    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=131.068s">Hi,</a>  I'm Abir Redati. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=133.71s">I'm</a>  Himo's mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=136.233s">Himo</a>  was six years old when he was diagnosed with cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=141.577s">He</a>  was just a happy, healthy <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=144.4s">funny</a>  child, and he started to feel unwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=149.003s">And</a>  then we took him to Children's Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=152.286s">And</a>  after investigation, he was diagnosed with spinal cord cancer that has already spread along his spine. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=160.232s">After</a>  that, he went into surgery and received radiation and chemotherapy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=165.937s">and</a>  was treated in Dana-Farber and Children's Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=169.259s">He</a>  went to school in second grade and he passed away in his third grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=175.841s">And</a>  he tried hard, he tried for almost two and a half years to fight cancer, but he couldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=186.966s">During</a>  his last month in the hospital, we have received a lot of support from <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=193.867s">Medford</a>  families from the McGlynn School, the teachers, the principal, and they really took care of my daughters while I was in the hospital with him for a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=205.135s">And</a>  they took care of me and the girls after he passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=210.258s">And</a>  they did, like, honor him by just planting a tree outside the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=216.55s">in</a>  his name, and then we had some events that took place also in the school, the Hoops for Hemo, and I will let Anthony talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=227.838s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=229.399s">Yeah,</a>  so the last couple years we had a basketball game known as Hoops for Hemo, and these are the t-shirts that the teachers wore every year and played. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=236.244s">They</a>  were also able to be purchased by people in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=238.746s">So,</a>  you know, we had a blue out, I would say, during the games. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=243.759s">So</a>  this Buzz Off event came to us last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=247.383s">Bier</a>  had approached me and several middle school teachers about participating in this event in honor of HEMO. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=253.57s">And</a>  last year we raised over $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=256.575s">myself</a>  and McGlynn middle school teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=258.517s">There</a>  was about seven or eight of us that went down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=260.758s">So</a>  this year I kind of assembled my own team. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=263.16s">One</a>  of the people here, Dave Richard, who is a phys ed teacher at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=267.423s">Also,</a>  I have a fifth grade teacher, Cameron Cosmith, at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=273.848s">And</a>  I have Matt McKenna, a middle school teacher at the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=278.002s">So</a>  we've put a team together, several students are also participating in it this year, and it's been unbelievable support we've had from the city, we've had them put it on their Facebook page, the mayor has written about it, it's been in the paper, all the faculty's been notified of it, and we're just really trying to spread the word of this event, it's such a special event, listening to stories when you're there, meeting kids that are very sick and they're high spirits, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=304.63s">It's</a>  just something I was a part of last year, and I thought it was amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=308.031s">I</a>  really want to try to make this such a big event. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=310.592s">Going</a>  there last year, there were cities like Milton that brought firefighters, police officers, teachers, cheerleaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=317.034s">It</a>  was a really big event, and we kind of got a late jump on it this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=323.556s">This</a>  is something I kind of really want to work with Abir hand-in-hand with every single year to honor her son who was a great kid and make this something that Medford as a city can kind of unite and participate in for one of their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=342.043s">So</a>  I thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for allowing me to come here and speak tonight and allow us to be here and spread the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=351.614s">We</a>  have flyers and certificates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=353.697s">If</a>  anybody's more interested in learning about it, we'll gladly hand them out to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=359.543s">We've</a>  had a lot of local business support. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=362.026s">Boston</a>  Physical Therapy and Wellness has donated to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=364.73s">Avellino's</a>  Sub Shop has donated to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=367.105s">And</a>  we have a word out there at several other places as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=370.386s">So</a>  this is really trying to spread the word, tell the story, and hope that we can gain support in the next month to really show up with a big group of people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=380.87s">Thank</a>  you guys very much.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=384.571s">Mr.</a>  President, can we ask Mr. Petrelas if people would like to donate maybe where they can go to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=389.532s">Is</a>  there a site online?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=392.232s">Yes,</a>  so this information that I have here explains it a lot better, where to donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=398.878s">Basically,</a>  you would go to onemissionbuzzoff.org, and then you would click the team that you donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=404.743s">We're</a>  Team HEMO. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=406.904s">And</a>  when you click there, it's pretty self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=409.687s">You</a>  just kind of fill in the information, what you're donating. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=413.83s">And</a>  then it goes right to our team page, so we can see who donates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=417.453s">As</a>  I said, it's kind of been spread all over Facebook, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=421.522s">emails,</a>  blogs, everything around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=424.743s">And</a>  as I said, I have papers that I can hand out to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=427.784s">We've</a>  been giving them to local businesses all across the city, walking and knocking on doors and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=433.645s">So</a>  I don't know if anybody wants to take these or leave them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=437.306s">We'll</a>  leave them with the messenger.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=438.387s">I'm</a>  sure he'll give it to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=451.697s">Mr.</a>  President, I for one just want to thank the Medford Public Schools, Mr. Rich, Mr. Petrellis, for the work that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=461.866s">It's</a>  obvious that they're more than just classroom teachers, Mr. President, that they have a true concern for their kids and that they're perfect examples of the great job that our public school system here in Medford is doing in terms of focusing on the whole student, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=475.291s">really</a>  caring for the students that are in that classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=477.693s">And,</a>  you know, it takes a village, Mr. President, and this is a perfect example of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=482.276s">To</a>  see Hemo's mom here after several years, come back, and to see these two teachers who were affected by Hemo's life and Hemo's, you know, passing, to continue this tradition, it's really moving, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=495.126s">And</a>  I'd like to thank Mr. Rich and Mr. Petrellis for all their efforts on behalf of the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=500.37s">I'm</a>  sure that she's thanked them a thousand times over, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=503.925s">Really,</a>  this is just another perfect example of the work that great public schools do here in the city of Medford, and our great public school teachers, and what they can do when they put their mind to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=512.072s">So,</a>  Mr. President, thank you very much to everybody that's donated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=516.215s">Thank</a>  you to everybody that's paid attention to the cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=519.057s">And</a>  thank you to these two gentlemen with those beautiful heads of hair that are going to be getting mowed down to wiffle length come early June. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=529.246s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to ask that the matter be received and placed on file, but I thank the folks for being up here.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=535.15s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=537.071s">If</a>  I can, I echo my remarks from Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=540.733s">I</a>  actually challenge him because I will shave my head if he shaves his. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=545.096s">And</a>  no, no, I, I, I, again, but on a serious note, I appreciate mom being here and I know that what that negative situation did <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=558.13s">to</a>  our school at the McGlynn, and our McGlynn family, my son and daughter both being around at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=565.237s">And</a>  with something negative and sad came out something positive with a lot of pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=570.522s">And</a>  Hemo's name will never be forgotten in my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=574.026s">And</a>  it's people like Mr. Petrellis and Mr. Richard and the fellow teachers that carry on this tradition, his name. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=580.512s">And</a>  as Mr. Petrella says, next year we get a head start on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=586.994s">Spread</a>  the word and let's challenge the whole community to get around issues like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=591.075s">I</a>  think that this is what makes our system great because it's real and it deals with real people and how we can stand together and work together for a great cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=601.798s">So</a>  thank you very much for being here tonight and good luck.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=664.301s">For</a>  the last three years, they've been doing this Hoops for Hemo, and all the funds that's raised goes to Children's Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=672.064s">And</a>  they have his team's name on the donation board.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=678.926s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=679.186s">And</a>  the game is 6.30 at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=683.167s">What</a>  cause is that for this year?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=686.188s">Jocelyn</a>  diabetes.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=687.328s">That's</a>  right, Jocelyn diabetes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=688.529s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=688.869s">I</a>  should have known that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=689.589s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=690.329s">Well,</a>  best of luck with both events. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=692.09s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=692.55s">Thank</a>  you for coming.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=695.506s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=698.147s">And</a>  I, too, want to lend my support. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=700.988s">This</a>  is a very worthy cause, and I'm sure it's a very difficult story to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=705.849s">And</a>  it's very heart-wrenching, to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=709.77s">I</a>  would ask, Mr. President, that if we could, as a council, we have a billboard, electronic billboard, on 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=718.113s">And</a>  part of the agreement we have with the billboard company is that we're allowed to put <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=723.672s">a</a>  certain number of local community events and activities on the billboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=728.355s">And</a>  I think that would be a very positive way of uniting not only this community, but everyone that uses 93 in donating and getting active in such a cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=740.362s">So</a>  I would ask that we send a message to the mayor that we'd like to promote this particular event through the use of the electronic billboard at 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=752.308s">And</a>  this is going to be a yearly event that we continue to promote as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=757.753s">And</a>  as Mr. Petrales mentioned, that we unite as a community and get the police, fire, DPW, anyone in the community that wants to get active and involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=768.463s">And</a>  I think that's a great way of at least getting the message out to the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=772.227s">So</a>  I'll ask that be an amendment that we send out, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=775.91s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=776.25s">So</a>  if a council night is amenable to withdraw his motion, I will withdraw my motion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=781.232s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that's an excellent suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=782.813s">An</a>  excellent idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=783.453s">And</a>  I support it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=784.674s">So</a>  the motion under discussion now is Councilor Marks council cafe.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=788.136s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=788.656s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=789.416s">And</a>  Anthony, thank you for coming up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=790.997s">And</a>  then I would like you to come to my Kiwanis meeting on Monday to receive a donation from our club. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=796.279s">So</a>  if you come down to Pacelli's on Monday at six o'clock, we would make a donation to your group. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=801.462s">So</a>  if you can come down, come down and join us for dinner and we would make a donation to you.</p>

Burke, Mayor, gift from Hallmark Health Corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=875.453s">Dear</a>  Mr. President and members of the Medford City Council, in accordance with the provisions of General Law, Chapter 44, Paragraph 53A, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the acceptance of an unconditional gift to the City of Medford from Hallmark Health Corporation of 170 Governors Avenue, Medford Mass, 02155, in the amount of $4,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=895.296s">It</a>  is intended that this gift be used <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=901.665s">to</a>  support a program called Produce in a Snap for Seniors, which provides subsidized farm shares to residents over 60 years of age living in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=911.714s">It</a>  will provide them better access to the freshest, locally grown produce, thanks to a collaboration with our four local organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=920.068s">Medford</a>  farmers market, the board of health slash mass in motion, the Medford housing authority and new entry sustainable farming project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=929.254s">Sarah</a>  McGiven will be in attendance at the council meeting for further information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=933.897s">Respectfully</a>  submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=936.959s">Stephanie</a>  M Burke mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=939.261s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=939.881s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=940.362s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=950.632s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=952.774s">Do</a>  you want to present or explain this paper?</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=954.976s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=955.456s">So,</a>  um, the program, which you just briefly described called produce in a snap for seniors is one of the programs at the Medford farmer's market, um, has designed to provide food access, greater access to healthy food for people in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=970.467s">The</a>  farmer's market, as you may or may not know, does a lot of other programming besides just the farmer's market on Thursday afternoons. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=977.387s">And</a>  this is one that's specific for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=979.488s">Last</a>  year was our first year that we ran the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=982.71s">And</a>  it was sort of a pilot program that provided bags of fresh produce to seniors on Tuesday afternoons. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=991.815s">It</a>  was subsidized from the Massachusetts Association of Councils on Aging. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=997.057s">And</a>  basically the seniors came and picked up a bag of fresh produce. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1001.88s">You</a>  can see in the handouts that I passed out to you a picture of what some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1006.172s">fresh</a>  vegetables and fruits looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1007.953s">It</a>  was a really great variety of everything from beets, lettuce, arugula, berries, apples, you name it, things that were grown in the Lowell area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1020.397s">And</a>  the seniors paid $5 for the bag and it was worth about $20. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1024.778s">We</a>  had such an overwhelming response from the participants in the program last summer that we really worked hard to find funding to run this program again this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1035.043s">And</a>  the overall program costs close to $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1038.324s">We</a>  were lucky enough to get this great donation from Hallmark Health to cover most of the produce for the program this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1046.228s">So</a>  that's why Eileen's here, too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1049.709s">So</a>  it's very exciting for us, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1052.05s">As</a>  most of the folks know, we do do a mobile food market in Malden and ride a shuttle bus down from City Hall every month here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1060.293s">But</a>  Sarai had done such a great job of describing the importance of the program, had great measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1065.795s">It</a>  fit with what we're trying to do to improve health for our patients as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1070.176s">And</a>  in addition to the donation, we're providing a senior outreach nurse who will be with Sarai and her team to help with cooking and screening and helping with other health initiatives as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1081.2s">So</a>  it's a really nice use of collaboration to improve the access to good, healthy food for our seniors and really improve <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1088.893s">that</a>  whole idea of isolation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1090.513s">So</a>  they'll be helping each other learn how to cook, maybe share some things where they have a little bit more than they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1095.974s">And</a>  I think this will be a great way to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1098.215s">So</a>  thank you for this opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1099.695s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1104.316s">Can</a>  you explain which, if all seniors will be involved in the program, will they have to qualify?</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1110.857s">You</a>  just have to be a resident living in Bedford age 60 or older. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1116.038s">There's</a>  no income qualifications.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1121.81s">I</a>  just want to thank you for the donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1124.332s">This</a>  is great and hopefully there will be some sort of marketing and publicity on this so all our seniors can take advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1134.522s">Will</a>  you be posting in the paper and how will you be letting everybody know?</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1140.188s">Senior</a>  newsletter, Facebook transcript patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1144.756s">all</a>  the usual places. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1145.676s">We</a>  had a tremendously long waiting list last year, so we do give priority to the residents at Medford Housing Authority first, because it's held there at their buildings.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1155.361s">And</a>  for the 10,000, how many seniors will you be able to get a bag to?</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1159.303s">We'll</a>  have 38 bags per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1161.143s">So</a>  if the same people came every week, we'd be serving 38 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1164.665s">But</a>  it'll probably be different people coming all the time.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1167.086s">And</a>  how many weeks?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1220.25s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1224.554s">And</a>  this is a great program, and I appreciate the donation from Hallmark Health also. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1230.613s">The</a>  registration one has to go to the council on aging to register. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1234.434s">Is</a>  that how it works?</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1235.175s">We're</a>  going to hold registration for one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1237.015s">I</a>  think it's probably going to be June 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1239.396s">We'll</a>  start out with, um, at the Medford housing authority sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1243.137s">Well,</a>  I'll move around to different sites and register people there and then, uh, go to the, um, senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1250.56s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1251.3s">But</a>  we have to give priority to the people who live at Medford housing authority first.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1255.641s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1256.401s">And,</a>  um, the, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1258.865s">It's</a>  weekly pickup afterwards, right, once you register for the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1262.907s">And</a>  the weekly pickup is at the senior housing, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1266.708s">No,</a>  it was at 121 Riverside Avenue, the Salton Stall building. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1271.23s">It's</a>  a nice big open space with a kitchen that we can use for doing cooking demos.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1277.133s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1278.233s">What</a>  about for just fresh fruits and vegetables if someone wants?</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1282.815s">They</a>  can come to the farmer's market.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1285.173s">Or</a>  they can come to the market that we run through Hallmark Health for the second Saturday of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1290.456s">And</a>  we do provide transportation from City Hall.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1293.819s">You</a>  provide it from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1295.019s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1295.68s">Is</a>  there any outreach at all involved in this for shut-ins and people that actually can't get out?</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1301.741s">Well,</a>  we're relying on the newsletter that comes out of the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1307.442s">Um,</a>  and I also distribute flyers to the food pantries and a transcript article. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1314.744s">Um,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1315.384s">But</a>  if you have any other ideas, if, well, if I'm homebound and I can't get out, um, how would I be able to participate?</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1322.246s">Oh,</a>  um, we did have some volunteers last summer that were willing to pick people up and bring them to the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1326.887s">Um,</a>  it didn't end up being needed, but we can try to do that again this summer.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1331.808s">That'd</a>  be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1332.949s">And</a>  just, you know, I love the farmer's market. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1336.911s">I</a>  think it does a lot of great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1338.892s">However,</a>  price-wise, from what I hear from the seniors, and it's great to have local grown produce and so forth, but many of the seniors are priced out of getting fruits and vegetables from the farmer's market. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1355.022s">And</a>  I'd like to see some type of component. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1357.383s">Maybe</a>  you aren't the correct people to speak with, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1360.685s">I'd</a>  like to see some type of component that would embrace our seniors and those that are on fixed incomes that may be priced out of that particular venue.</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1371.232s">We</a>  have our EBT matching program on Thursdays, so that's people who are receiving government benefits, formerly known as food stamps, now called SNAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1381.273s">We</a>  actually match that and double the value of those, so that makes it a little bit more accessible to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1385.577s">But</a>  there's, of course, all those families that don't qualify for federal assistance and then are kind of outside that category and can't get those benefits from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1396.105s">But</a>  also, I mean, this program was designed to serve seniors who maybe can't afford or can't get to the farmer's market. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1403.311s">And</a>  because this is actually subsidized, they're getting a bag that's worth $15 for $5. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1408.215s">So</a>  trying to make it a little bit more equitable.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1410.801s">And</a>  the market on Saturday, the second Saturday, in fact, it's this Saturday coming up, there's no fee at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1416.205s">So</a>  it's completely free for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1418.246s">And</a>  the transportation is free as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1420.447s">And</a>  we can help people set up the rides. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1422.068s">Some</a>  of our customers come with a ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1424.09s">And</a>  folks from Medford do volunteer and help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1427.412s">Because</a>  I know the police chief makes robocalls often to let people know that that market is there and that it's free for Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1435.057s">And</a>  when they call, they don't call us to register. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1437.298s">They</a>  actually call here at Medford City Hall so that they <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1440.518s">they</a>  feel like it's a Medford-based program.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1443.479s">And</a>  do you know if this is listed in the Senior Sounds, which is a newsletter that goes out to the seniors? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1448.041s">I'm</a>  not sure, but... You may want to check that, because a lot of seniors get that delivered.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1454.004s">And</a>  we do have flyers that are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1455.905s">We</a>  send them to the Board of Health, so they would receive a flyer every month with the dates and times. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1461.728s">We</a>  work very closely with Diane McLeod just to make sure that it gets out to the right folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1467.268s">And</a>  then, in addition, we get it out to all the different doctor's office practices so that they can hang that in their office and refer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1473.512s">And</a>  we're actually working very hard with the Greater Boston Food Bank to add even some more programs like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1478.835s">They've</a>  just hired a physician to work with them because they really feel strongly that, just as you're saying, that making sure that the most vulnerable people have access to fresh, healthy foods.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1489.001s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1489.461s">I</a>  would just, if you could, check the senior sounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1492.523s">I</a>  know a lot of seniors use that as their</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1495.008s">information.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1495.648s">Yes,</a>  we'd be glad to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1496.849s">Thanks</a>  very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1497.669s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1631.095s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to take number 16481, communications and report from city boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1638.49s">16481</a>  John Costas, Treasurer of the Civic Auditorium Commission, Chevalier Theatre, to update the City Council on an opportunity presented to the Commission by the North Shore Music Theatre and other updates to the theatre. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1651.761s">Mr.</a>  Costas, welcome.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1654.903s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1657.045s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1657.565s">John</a>  Costas, 56 Hain Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1661.936s">Well,</a>  let me start by saying I'm up here as a citizen, not as a 30-year member of the Chevalier Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1668.381s">And</a>  one of the reasons why I chose this forum is back in 1981, when the council voted to retain the theater and put it under the direction of a commission, part of the job was to renovate, rehab, operate it, and bring it up to a level <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1687.672s">where</a>  professional management companies or groups would want to use us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1695.575s">And</a>  that's not exactly the words I wanted to use, but we're now at a level where a professional production company has voiced an interest in putting on professional concerts, Broadway shows, and run a movie series. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1715.342s">That</a>  was North Shore Music Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1717.915s">Now,</a>  they're only one body that happened to voice an interest in Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1724.6s">And</a>  there's a lot of people still around that remember Chevalier Theater when it was being saved in 1981. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1731.605s">And</a>  unfortunately, with 35 years past, a lot of them can't come out to the city council, and they don't come to the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1739.351s">So</a>  I felt this would be the best way of letting these people know that we're just about there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1746.741s">We</a>  now have one company that has two successful theaters, one in the North Shore, Beverly Music Theater, and down on the South Shore, Theater by the Sea, and has seven movie theaters that has an interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1762.092s">Now,</a>  speaking for myself, now that we have one corporation that has an interest in us, there's a possibility that other people may come forth now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1772.46s">Because</a>  once one person comes through and they realize we're viable, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1777.115s">And</a>  this is the first time that I'm really confident that we're viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1780.117s">There's</a>  other opportunities for the community and the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1784.14s">And</a>  obviously, all these studies that the city had done over the past 30 years said the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1789.924s">Chevalier</a>  Theater is the key to Medford Square to bring in shows on a weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1796.688s">And</a>  if we can present, or if a company can present shows every week, or a series of movies, we've certainly accomplished the goal <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1806.681s">that</a>  the people wanted in 1981. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1808.122s">And</a>  I know it makes me sound old, but I'm old. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1814.426s">And</a>  I just wanted to just convey that there's a possibility out there that this corporation has an interest in us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1821.911s">And</a>  if an RFP is presented out there to find anybody else that may be interested, I mean, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1830.097s">Maybe</a>  there's a second corporation out there that has an interest in the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1836.456s">But</a>  if there's one, there could be more. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1839.558s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1839.799s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1850.287s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that it might make sense for us to refer this to the arts and culture subcommittee for an update from the council when in fact they do maybe put on an RFP or receive some further interest from other people and then the subcommittee can report back to us at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1862.797s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, Councilor Longo Crenshaw.</p>

And we do have a meeting scheduled next Tuesday at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1884.088s">for</a>  this very reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1885.028s">I</a>  believe there's a number of things going on with Chevalier that need to be, we really haven't been updated on, and it's about time that we figure out <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1893.51s">what's</a>  going on, what offers are out there, what RFPs are, you know, in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1899.933s">We've</a>  been briefed and we've talked to a number of different people, I'm sure each and every one of us have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1904.855s">So</a>  it's definitely time for a meeting, time to sit down and start the discussion and start getting updated ourselves so we know what is going on and we can help in any way we can as well as, you know, give advice if that's, you know, necessary or wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1921.36s">So</a>  we do have a meeting scheduled next week at 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1924.021s">I'm</a>  not sure if there's going to be a conflict with that, but as of right now, that is scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1927.543s">So</a>  hopefully we'll learn from, you know, the whole commission is invited, John and the whole commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1933.566s">So</a>  hopefully we can get more of an idea of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1936.887s">And</a>  I appreciate Mr. Costas informing us of this new news. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1941.749s">And</a>  I look forward to the meeting next week.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1943.881s">Councilor</a>  Knight, with your motion then, since the meeting has already been called. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1949.305s">Receive</a>  and place on file Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1950.726s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1952.908s">Yes</a>  Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1953.409s">Just</a>  what I meant to say, and it goes along with the Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1957.131s">Thursday,</a>  this Thursday coming, at 7 o'clock, the Chevalier Commission is meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1962.956s">It's</a>  an open public meeting, and at that meeting is where they'll be discussing an RFP that will be going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1971.378s">And</a>  at this meeting, I've asked somebody to be there that has experience in theater rental and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1978.942s">So</a>  that if we have any questions, if I have any questions, he represents the theater, we can talk to him as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1986.207s">But</a>  it's Thursday at 7 o'clock, Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1990.889s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1991.51s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1992.29s">On</a>  the motion, Councilor, I'm sorry, Councilor Scappelli is next.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1997.313s">If</a>  I can, Mr. Costa, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=1998.894s">Just</a>  a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2001.578s">Did</a>  the North Shore Music Theater, did these representatives come and search you out? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2005.8s">Or</a>  did we go out and commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2011.582s">They</a>  came to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2012.623s">They</a>  came to us.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2013.103s">And</a>  then the owner of North Shore Music Theater, Bill Haney, he took a brief site visit because he had never seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2019.666s">But</a>  he heard from his associate who had been in there that the size of the theater and what we have done in the past.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2027.409s">Did</a>  they give you any indication of what they wanted to? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2031.804s">get</a>  involved in?</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2033.125s">No,</a>  no, we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2034.866s">That's</a>  all, you know, has not been discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2037.628s">It's</a>  just an interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2039.49s">They</a>  want to invest money and make improvements to the theater and to its appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2045.174s">This</a>  absolutely hasn't been any discussion on money, value, anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2049.978s">It's</a>  just they came to us interested in us and it kind of made me excited.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2056.203s">I</a>  look forward to our subcommittee meeting and maybe attending your meeting on Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2060.952s">What</a>  would that be and what time?</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2063.096s">It's</a>  in the lobby of Chevalier Theater at 7 o'clock.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2067.848s">And</a>  again, again, this is something I think we all echoed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2071.211s">And</a>  if you looked at everybody's, um, uh, literature going out and running for office, everybody talked about the jewel of the city and the heartbeat of our community is the, uh, Chevalier theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2083.381s">So</a>  we're pretty, pretty excited about this and appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2086.123s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2416.36s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2419.581s">Watching</a>  the school committee meeting last Monday, so a week from yesterday, there was discussion on a bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2427.886s">It</a>  seems like there's going to be a top over the Field of Dreams <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2435.964s">During</a>  the months of November till March They did there was serious discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2440.567s">There</a>  was input that was given by each school committee member There was question on whether the council should have involvement I know there was a couple school committee members that wanted the council to be involved and that was that idea was kind of shut down but Due to it being school property I've gotten calls after the article after the school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2461.299s">I've</a>  gotten calls questions have been asked to me and <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2464.057s">We</a>  also were the body that approved the bond to implement the Field of Dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2469.161s">It's</a>  been very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2471.063s">I</a>  know in the first two years when we did ask for the numbers, I believe the income and revenue was paying for the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2478.289s">I</a>  know that one issue is their lack of maintenance budget, so this may very well be a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2484.955s">It</a>  may very well be a possibility to use these funds that are going to be brought in by an outside company. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2492.812s">to</a>  maintain the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2494.112s">Now,</a>  I believe we have somebody here who has more of a background than I do, but this bubble or this RFP that they want to put out is for $75,000 per season. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2505.435s">Medford</a>  children will only get to use the bubble from 2.30 to 4, 5 days a week, which is the weekdays, and then possibly sometime during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2516.938s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2520.141s">My</a>  request is just simply to review the RFP, to take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2524.224s">I</a>  know that they did want to push it through a week ago, but there were some updates that some of the school committee members did want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2533.151s">So</a>  I would just like to review the RFP, take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2537.835s">It</a>  is on school property, but the school is part of the city buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2542.518s">It's</a>  part of the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2543.759s">So</a>  I do want to just take a look at the RFP, and I hope that my colleagues will understand that and agree with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2549.853s">more</a>  eyes on something obviously is better. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2551.875s">And</a>  that's really it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2553.236s">Can</a>  you just explain what you mean by take a look and review it? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2556.939s">You</a>  mean you're asking for a copy of it so you can look at it?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2559.902s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2560.642s">Just</a>  looking for a copy of the RFP that's going to be sent out or voted on.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2565.326s">It's</a>  my understanding at this point in time there is no RFP because they're in the process of drafting the RFP and that's what the discussions at the school committee meeting were surrounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2576.442s">It's</a>  also my further understanding that once the RFP terms are agreed upon by the policy-setting body for the school department, the school committee, that this RFP will be voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2586.045s">And</a>  once it's voted on, it will become public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2588.266s">So</a>  I don't see any problem with this.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2589.766s">Plenty</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2590.586s">Plenty</a>  of information, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2592.267s">There</a>  was a full RFP presented to the school committee eight days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2598.489s">It</a>  was a full RFP that the administrators wanted to get approved that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2605.824s">few</a>  changes that just need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2608.125s">So</a>  that should be drafted already, because I know that the next meeting is when they want them to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2613.267s">So</a>  I would like to take a look at it before it's voted on, just in case we have any questions and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2619.169s">And</a>  I also want to be able to answer questions and concerns of the constituents and the parents that have been reaching out to me with questions.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2626.592s">Mr.</a>  President, my point of information was this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2628.353s">Until</a>  the school committee votes on the RFP to be issued, there is no RFP.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2635.248s">There</a>  is a draft RFP, so I'd like the draft RFP, updated RFP, that will be voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2640.57s">As</a>  a matter of course.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2642.13s">So</a>  your motion is, so the chair can have clarity, Madam Vice President, you are requesting for a copy of the draft RFP for the so-called bubble over the field of dreams, which I think has a real name.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2659.156s">Edgeley</a>  Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2660.076s">Edgeley</a>  Field.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2663.603s">uh,</a>  you're asking that draft to be forwarded to the method city councilors, uh, for their personal perusal.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2670.184s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2671.004s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2671.705s">So</a>  on that motion, councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2675.005s">Uh,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2676.145s">And,</a>  uh, uh, I did, I talked to a few of the, uh, city Councilors and, um, and talk to a bunch of the parents about the, uh, edgily field project and bubble project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2688.668s">I,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2689.817s">happen</a>  to be one of the members on the Field of Dreams Committee when we look to, you know, an innovative way of bringing artificial turf facilities for our students and kids in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2703.163s">And</a>  it was highly successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2704.724s">I</a>  think that with spearheaded by Bill Carr Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2709.926s">and</a>  his group that he put together, they reached out and went through walls to make sure that this dream came to reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2719.51s">One</a>  thing we thought outside the box at the time, and people worked very hard, and at the time we had a cell phone company that came in and wanted to actually lease the land for one of the worst hotspots in the United States and bring a cell phone tower that would help fund that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2742.996s">Unfortunately,</a>  that didn't work out, and it went out to Bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2748.457s">And</a>  as we're moving forward with this project, I'm actually excited that Medford has the innovation and the forthright to think outside the box, because I think this is what we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2764.972s">The</a>  bubble, the questions I had were we, you know, our schools are a mess and let's put our funding to this and we're lacking this and we're lacking that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2775.279s">Clarification</a>  on that is that the RFP, from what was told to me yesterday, is the funding would come from one of the outside agencies that would come in and fund that, fund it completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2791.57s">Another</a>  question was that, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2794.786s">that</a>  if it bubbles, the overuse is going to ruin the turf. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2800.049s">And</a>  studies have shown, from what I've done my research and being in my field, that actually it lengthens the turf because it's covered, not weathered. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2811.774s">Some</a>  other issues are what funding would come in and what would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2815.976s">Well,</a>  we're talking about a maintenance plan that we're not very happy that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2821.094s">most</a>  of the things we're doing in our community that in the past that hasn't been a capital improvement plan and we're looking at an RFP going out for someone to come in, bubble <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2833.407s">an</a>  area that would normally sit dormant and have the opportunity, from what I've been told, that would open up the mornings for recreational space for our seniors and provide some walking programs and stuff that we've lost with the Meadow Glen Mall closing and having the physical education department using that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2856.369s">and</a>  then using the athletic teams, using that for practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2861.672s">And</a>  then another piece of that is making sure that whatever entity came in to do this, it would give the Method residents an opportunity to participate in any program at half of the price. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2872.679s">I</a>  believe that's what was told to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2879.087s">There's</a>  a lot of questions we have, but these are the clarifications that I wanted to give that I made sure that I made some phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2886.389s">I</a>  did talk to a few of the school kid members and they were heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2889.75s">And</a>  I also hear that it will go out to vote on, on, um, on Monday at the school committee meeting because they did their due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2898.073s">And</a>  I believe it was a subcommittee, but I believe there were at least five members there that shared their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2905.795s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2906.957s">and</a>  put their input into this possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2911.499s">So</a>  I appreciate Vice President Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2918.622s">And</a>  again, I applaud what we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2921.623s">I</a>  just hope, as we move forward, that we can set an identity of what we're doing with the funding to make sure that we're looking to do that and putting it back to the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2933.408s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2934.887s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2935.688s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2938.249s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2939.03s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm happy to see that our school committee is sticking outside the box and being innovative with these type of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2947.115s">And</a>  my only concern is that I just want to make sure that our children, our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2954.273s">Don't</a>  get pushed aside on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2956.616s">They</a>  have ample time to use this hopefully good innovation for their benefit and not more to private company using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2966.45s">So</a>  that's one of my biggest concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2969.795s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2971.916s">To</a>  answer that, when I did talk to them, that was one of the biggest questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2975.499s">And</a>  having time there and finding a balance, just as we do with all of our fields and what we're trying to do when you rent a facility, there's got to be a balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2987.267s">If</a>  someone's going to come in and <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2988.73s">and</a>  bid for a bubble that's going to cost $1.8 million and put what they're asking for, the RFP, bathrooms, locker rooms, concession stand, parking lots, you're talking about making sure there's a balance, if that's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3003.101s">So,</a>  you know, again, this is where I think, where this isn't coming out of our taxpayers' pockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3011.067s">This</a>  is an outside agency coming in and paying for future ventures, which will be probably $500,000 in field replacement within five to eight years on that facility.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3022.836s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3024.177s">Like</a>  I said, I'm happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3024.818s">I'm</a>  happy with thinking out of the box and being innovative and you know, that's what I think it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3029.441s">And</a>  again, I just want to make sure that our, our children are getting better because I can already envision the calls coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3035.066s">Oh,</a>  you know, my kid couldn't get the play, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3036.987s">So,</a>  again, that's a big concern, and I want to make sure that we're protected on that end.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3043.452s">Councilor</a>  Knights. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3044.753s">Mr.</a>  President, I do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3046.034s">What</a>  were those periods of time that Councilor Lungo referred to as to when the bubble was going to be up? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3052.019s">Madam</a>  Vice President, if you could.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3053.801s">The</a>  bubble in the RFP, it says from November to March, and it says that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3058.825s">Do</a>  you have a copy of the RFP already? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3061.928s">No,</a>  I watched the school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3063.349s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3063.789s">Yeah,</a>  it was discussed in length. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3066.117s">The</a>  contractor selected by the district would have use of the fields from 4 to 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3071.52s">on</a>  weeknights and 8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3072.901s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3073.141s">on</a>  weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3077.208s">from</a>  those months.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3078.189s">And</a>  the reason I ask, Mr. President, because having been very familiar with the administration of the fields, they closed usually at Thanksgiving and they didn't open up again until after March. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3088.295s">So</a>  in essence, the fields are closed for the period of time that the bubble would be up normally. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3092.698s">So</a>  any use that we're getting out of it would be bonus. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3095.58s">You</a>  know, if we can establish a public-private partnership with an entity that wants to come in there and invest money into our infrastructure at the fields during and use it for the majority of time during a period of time where it would actually be <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3106.357s">inaccessible</a>  to everybody, anyhow, I don't see any downside to this whatsoever, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3114.178s">They're</a>  going to come up, they're going to invest some money into the city of Medford, they're going to invest some money into our facilities, they're going to make our state of the fields even more state of the art, I guess you'd want to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3125.02s">I'm</a>  a little confused by the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3127.321s">I'm</a>  not going to be in a position to tell the school committee not to vote on something that's in front of them they're comfortable to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3132.902s">They're</a>  the policy setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3134.701s">of</a>  our government for all things that are related to the school department, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3137.603s">So</a>  I can't support- Point of information.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3138.945s">Point</a>  of information, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3140.846s">The</a>  resolution doesn't say that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3143.028s">I</a>  believe the resolution doesn't say that, but I believe as you were speaking in your presentation, you said, I just want to get a copy of the RFP to look at it and review it before they vote on it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3151.515s">Personally-</a>  If I have questions, I maybe could give a call to a few school committee members and ask, because one question that has come to my attention is the weekends, 8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3160.622s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3162.716s">Why</a>  can't Medford kids, you're the negotiator, you do that for a living, so maybe a couple hours on a Saturday, Medford kids can't play on it, and I'm not saying they should or shouldn't be able to, but I have questions.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3174.923s">Again,</a>  I believe, because I watched that same meeting and I actually talked to a few school committee members, part of that is something that was stressed, that whatever programs go on at those times, whether it be four to 11 or eight to 11 on the weekends, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3191.595s">whatever</a>  entity comes in and wants that situation, that's Medford residents will have an opportunity to participate in those programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3200.26s">So</a>  in other words, where other in other ways, unless we start a cross country ski program, which I think is a great idea with community schools, they can do that up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3210.626s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3211.607s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3212.808s">Councilor</a>  Knight has the floor.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3213.848s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3214.068s">So</a>  as I was saying, Mr. President, I'm not comfortable telling the school community they can't vote on something until we get a copy of something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3219.211s">Um,</a>  so for that reason, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3221.266s">I</a>  won't be supporting this paper.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3222.947s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3226.589s">The</a>  citizen at the podium wishes to address us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3229.091s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3229.611s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record, and welcome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3232.273s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3232.813s">Bill</a>  Carr, 47 Blakely Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3236.295s">Back</a>  in 2000, I just want to talk about the fields, because I'm going to give maybe a little history of how it came about, and then where it is and where it needs to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3244.94s">So</a>  in 2000, I got together a committee, George Scarpelli, Jay Shirami. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3250.923s">Emory,</a>  Callahan, Herwin, Sudirosa, Suzanne Higgins. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3254.967s">We</a>  got together down in South Medford, put together a team of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3259.01s">We</a>  had a big meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3259.811s">A</a>  lot of people were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3261.592s">And</a>  we decided to get something together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3263.734s">We</a>  started a 501c3, 401c3 nonprofit to raise money to see if the fields could even be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3268.698s">So</a>  we don't need to get all the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3270.7s">But</a>  we ended up going through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3273.402s">And</a>  I did get a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3276.575s">Right</a>  at the very beginning, maybe six months in, we had raised about $50,000 privately to do the engineering to see if this would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3283.357s">I</a>  got a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3283.957s">There</a>  was a cell phone tower option at the field that was looked at, and no one wanted to touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3291.52s">So</a>  I took it on with George and a few other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3294.781s">And</a>  we had a $1.6 million bid that went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3298.222s">There</a>  was a $600,000 check written out to the city of Medford with $1 million to come back in over 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3307.051s">At</a>  that point, one person had complained that we were going to lose two parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3314.473s">We</a>  had to move the cell phone tower down to another area and went back out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3320.035s">That</a>  was in 2000, 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3322.035s">And</a>  that's just about when the economy was starting to head down the tubes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3325.617s">And</a>  when it went back out to bid, it came back at less. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3327.617s">And</a>  then it went back out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3329.378s">And</a>  then eventually nobody bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3331.027s">So</a>  the city of Medford really lost 1.6 million by moving it 100 feet to the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3336.231s">But</a>  that's past history. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3337.492s">We</a>  can go back and revisit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3338.893s">That</a>  cell phone tower option is still available to the city today. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3342.956s">Nobody's</a>  taking it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3344.037s">Maybe</a>  that's what we'll look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3345.258s">Maybe</a>  it's only worth 800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3346.519s">So</a>  that's one option. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3348.98s">Anyway,</a>  the fields were built, 2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3352.163s">And</a>  when they would cut the deal with the council, in fact, Brianna, she was one of the first people to come forward and actually donate to the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3359.624s">Because</a>  I know, I got the check in the mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3360.844s">She</a>  was one of the first ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3362.325s">So</a>  the deal with the fields was the kids from the city of Medford, at the high school, had to have field priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3369.567s">They</a>  came first, whatever Bobby Maloney's needs were at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3373.248s">The</a>  youth sports came second. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3374.609s">All</a>  the private organizations came third. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3376.75s">So</a>  I'm not sure about the Dome as far as, but maybe that rule should apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3380.811s">If</a>  there are needs for the kids in Medford, they've got to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3384.992s">And</a>  then the outside forces. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3387.693s">Maybe</a>  an equal playing ground up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3390.214s">But</a>  again, that company's a private company coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3391.934s">They're</a>  looking to make as much money as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3395.255s">Anyway,</a>  so fast forward to this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3399.556s">Seven,</a>  six years later, the fields last 10 to 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3403.237s">I</a>  did two years of study and research and all kinds of information I had to go get. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3408.919s">So</a>  they got 10 to 15 years is kind of the life cycle, but 15 on the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3413.72s">But</a>  the fields over the last six years haven't been maintained properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3418.062s">I'm</a>  not saying who's responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3419.523s">That's</a>  not really what I'm here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3420.963s">They</a>  have not been groomed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3422.444s">You</a>  need to groom those fields two to four times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3425.805s">Do</a>  a GMAC study. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3427.626s">Suck</a>  up all the pellets and all the dirt, and then put it back down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3430.987s">There's</a>  companies that do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3432.428s">That's</a>  about $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3434.389s">It</a>  hasn't been done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3435.849s">So</a>  you guys want to put a dome over the field that has been maintained for six years, you can have all the domes you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3441.572s">If</a>  you don't maintain what's been there for six years, then we're going to be ripping that field up quicker than we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3447.62s">So</a>  maybe that should be put in as the budget's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3451.023s">Put</a>  the $10,000 in the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3452.684s">Put</a>  it as a budget item. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3454.485s">Start</a>  doing it now so we can get 15 years, not 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3458.368s">Because</a>  in five years from now, or six, or however long the longevity, if you do that GMAX, they'll tell you how long those fields will last once you do that study. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3465.774s">And</a>  I believe that study's around $1,200 to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3468.696s">Then</a>  they'll tell you the length. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3470.558s">And</a>  they'll also tell you how much it's going to cost to rip those up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3473.955s">which</a>  is approximately $400,000 to rip those fields up and put down two new fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3478.596s">So</a>  that's going to have to happen very shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3481.057s">What</a>  should happen, what the city should do, is take every hourly fee that's charged up there, whatever it is, $175 or $200 an hour, and add a user fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3491.979s">Call</a>  it what you want, $20 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3494.04s">And</a>  the money should go to pay the bond, but that fee should go off. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3497.921s">So</a>  then in six years, when you need the $400,000, we're not going out to get another bond or trying to raise money to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3504.027s">So</a>  that should be put off to the side as a separate fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3508.11s">This</a>  is my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3508.87s">I'm</a>  not telling you how to do your job, but I'm just saying that should be done so that you're not going to be chasing that money in six or seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3514.614s">The</a>  other option, if you go up there, because I designed the fields, when you go up the top of the stairs, you look to the left, you look to the right, there's a track. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3521.659s">And</a>  between the track and the edge of the fence is about a six foot area of grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3525.863s">That</a>  grass was left there for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3527.945s">There's</a>  going to be alumni bricks going there, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3530.668s">That</a>  was a program that was all set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3532.63s">I</a>  had it all ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3533.751s">We</a>  had alumni lists all the way back to the 60s. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3536.574s">We</a>  had approximately between a half million to a million dollars on alumni bricks that people wanted to buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3541.939s">Because</a>  you remember back in the 60s and 70s and even the 80s, Method Eye had classes of a thousand or better. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3548.005s">Rick</a>  knows, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3549.146s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3550.233s">That</a>  money, I was told that the alumni at the high school, they're going to have their own organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3554.714s">And</a>  they would kind of run with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3556.254s">But</a>  that never got off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3557.454s">But</a>  that's still a viable option. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3558.695s">There's</a>  a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3559.855s">And</a>  a lot of families would buy a brick up there and mine both sides, left and right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3563.315s">There's</a>  enough room up there for 3,000 or 4,000 bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3567.196s">That's</a>  so much per family brick or individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3569.016s">You've</a>  seen them at Family Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3569.997s">They're</a>  all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3571.197s">And</a>  if it's a proud city, those bricks could be sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3575.018s">And</a>  I had the list all the way back 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3577.773s">So</a>  that's another option. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3579.134s">So</a>  there are ways to prepare for five or six years from here, from down the road, to rip these fields up and put new turf down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3588.178s">The</a>  other option that no one looked at, and when I was in the many negotiations with Mike McGlynn over the many times when we went back and forth on things, we had an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3598.723s">We</a>  could have lights, or we could have had a third field off to the left. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3602.265s">The</a>  third field would be about a 60-yard field, half a football field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3606.397s">a</a>  6 v 6 soccer field and maybe extend the parking lot out for a little more parking up top. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3611.742s">That</a>  would bring more rental in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3613.244s">So</a>  if you're going to rip it up, you're already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3616.246s">You</a>  can do another 60 yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3617.928s">That</a>  brings in another $150 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3620.51s">It's</a>  just grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3621.231s">It's</a>  just overgrown weeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3622.712s">It's</a>  doing nothing up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3623.713s">It's</a>  just sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3624.314s">And</a>  all you have to do is put another bank of lights off to the left and come right on that field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3628.158s">So</a>  those are the other options that we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3629.759s">So</a>  there's a lot of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3632.057s">And</a>  I'm not for or against the bubble because I haven't seen what they're actually trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3638.32s">But</a>  you can do all the bubbles you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3640.361s">You</a>  need to look at out of the box and look at the other options for raising money besides the bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3645.344s">Remember,</a>  when you put a private company into a public school, there's a negative and a positive there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3651.086s">They're</a>  going to make money, but their main goal is to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3654.208s">If</a>  they can give the money back to the city, let's use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3657.77s">Let's</a>  put a parking lot up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3659.231s">Let's</a>  get rid of the <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3660.595s">Skateboard</a>  park, which is unsafe and in a bad location. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3663.716s">Let's</a>  move that to another location and make parking up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3666.137s">Move</a>  that to a location that's safer and more accessible and more visible for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3670.238s">That's</a>  a bad spot for young kids up there right in the woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3672.499s">That's</a>  not a good spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3674.74s">And</a>  you could put another 50 to 100 spots there easily and move that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3678.161s">They've</a>  been talking about moving that skateboard park for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3681.822s">So</a>  there's all these things that are going along. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3684.423s">And</a>  now I hear about the bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3686.358s">I'm</a>  not, like I said, I'm not for or against it, but you've got all these other things that you're not looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3689.82s">And</a>  that needs to be looked at by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3692.141s">And,</a>  um, and I'd be happy to reinvestigate the cell phone tower since I know all the players and maybe it's at the time, George, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3702.085s">We</a>  were there at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3703.746s">The</a>  guy flew up, the president of American towel flew up from Maryland. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3706.747s">He</a>  says the fourth most valuable spot on the East coast. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3710.189s">So</a>  that tells you that it's probably still a valuable spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3713.442s">Maybe</a>  not the numbers they gave us were maybe a little inflated, but I think there's something there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3719.486s">And</a>  we did our study. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3720.267s">We</a>  had an MIT people come in about the radiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3723.609s">We</a>  had a meeting with all the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3725.65s">They</a>  were all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3726.331s">It</a>  was going to be a monopole with a flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3727.792s">It</a>  was going to be very well done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3729.433s">And</a>  there's plenty of room to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3730.594s">So</a>  that's something that I think you need to get behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3735.877s">I</a>  have the history all the way through, so I kept all my records. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3738.559s">If</a>  you have any questions, if not, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3740.648s">Those</a>  are all food for thought, but somebody's got to do some of this stuff, so.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3744.811s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3745.551s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3746.512s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President LaGuardia.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3748.574s">Thank</a>  you, President DeLaRusso. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3749.794s">So</a>  just take me back, Mr. Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3751.756s">Thank</a>  you for the education, especially with regards to the maintenance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3754.998s">You</a>  can call me Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3755.639s">My</a>  father's Mr. Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3756.259s">Bill.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3756.619s">That's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3757.46s">The</a>  maintenance, I think, is what I kind of grabbed from what you discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3762.303s">And</a>  I obviously have a problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3764.024s">And</a>  I think that's another reason why it's somewhat related to city business. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3769.268s">We</a>  voted for a bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3770.787s">And</a>  we asked that a maintenance budget be put aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3773.428s">Same</a>  with the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3774.328s">We</a>  asked that 5% per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3776.349s">I</a>  don't know if it was of the income. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3778.21s">I</a>  can be quoted probably differently than we actually wrote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3782.431s">But</a>  there was supposed to be maintenance on the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3785.412s">So</a>  six years.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3786.572s">Yes,</a>  it was supposed to be maintenance on the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3789.318s">Medford</a>  does a horrible job with maintenance in the general sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3793.08s">Schools,</a>  streets, fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3796.923s">We</a>  don't do a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3797.783s">We</a>  don't have a good plan in place.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3802.803s">I</a>  don't think anybody here is in a position to speak about what the maintenance plan is at the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3806.506s">I'm</a>  sure there is a maintenance plan in place, but I don't think anybody knows what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3810.248s">I</a>  mean, Billy, I know you well, but I question as to whether or not he knows whether or not they go out there and groom the field once a week or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3816.973s">They</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3817.253s">You</a>  know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3818.954s">Actually,</a>  I can speak to that, because when I took over the fields, Mayor McGlynn said, I need somebody to run the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3825.499s">I</a>  volunteered for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3826.499s">I</a>  took the fields over. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3827.52s">I</a>  volunteered. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3828.12s">I</a>  make a dime. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3828.741s">I</a>  hired 10 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3831.687s">a</a>  sweeping machine that just grooms the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3836.191s">And</a>  that's supposed to do that weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3837.452s">And</a>  those guys do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3838.833s">That's</a>  what they're told to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3840.634s">Then,</a>  apparently, Joe Crowley comes up, and he sweeps the fields twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3845.919s">He's</a>  just sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3847.079s">It's</a>  not the deep cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3848.34s">It's</a>  not the cleansing that needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3850.342s">It</a>  probably just was overlooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3852.624s">I</a>  don't know who was responsible for getting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3854.545s">But</a>  that's a budget item. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3855.706s">That's</a>  money that has to be spent so those fields can get the extra five, six years we need.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3860.955s">But</a>  I was going to say that they sit there and just don't get treated at all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3864.777s">No,</a>  no, I didn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3865.417s">No,</a>  they get treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3866.517s">I</a>  just said we don't do a good job with maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3868.178s">I</a>  know they get treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3869.179s">I</a>  actually, I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3872.1s">The</a>  machine came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3872.86s">I</a>  know all about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3873.861s">And</a>  it's been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3874.501s">The</a>  guy is doing a nice job up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3875.641s">In</a>  fact, the workers up there, and I know them all, they're all making $12 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3879.643s">They</a>  should be up to $15, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3881.024s">Madam</a>  Vice President, Madam Vice President, you have the floor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3883.105s">But</a>  the deep cleaning they were supposed to do for $10,000 two to four times a year has never been done.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3891.676s">As</a>  far as I know, it's never been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3893.137s">So</a>  it needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3894.398s">You</a>  can start as soon as the budget, you put a line item in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3897.7s">Let's</a>  do that so we can get some extra years out of this field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3899.981s">It's</a>  not anybody's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3901.102s">It</a>  just slipped through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3902.663s">No</a>  one saw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3904.604s">They</a>  were grooming what they were told to do, but no one took the time to do the extra step. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3908.706s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3909.047s">And</a>  they're trying to get some extra years out of it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3910.487s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3911.048s">If</a>  I may amend my resolution just to ask what funding has been used to maintain the fields within the last three years?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3918.862s">It's</a>  amended by council vice president current to include a question of what funding has been used.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3926.688s">I</a>  believe it's council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3927.728s">Now</a>  you could well be. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3928.489s">I</a>  think it's been twice a year with Joe Crowley. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3930.591s">Crowley's</a>  purpose has been, has been grooming it doing a deeper sweep, but we need to do, we need to take it that extra step. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3935.995s">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3939.037s">Um,</a>  madam vice president has the floor still.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3942.559s">That's</a>  it for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3943.12s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3944.621s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3945.942s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3946.586s">Mr.</a>  Carr was one of the first people, I was here, supporting the cause as a citizen back in, what was it, 2004, 2000? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3952.791s">2000,</a>  2000, the year 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3956.293s">And</a>  if I remember correctly, the fields were opened up in 2002? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3960.857s">Fall</a>  of 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3962.538s">Fall</a>  of 2000.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3962.879s">The</a>  barn was approved in February of 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3966.882s">The</a>  fields opened in September of 2000.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3970.024s">So</a>  we're at year 16 now, anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3972.466s">So</a>  I think the shelf life on the field, no?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3976.075s">2010,</a>  excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3976.996s">Yeah,</a>  it was going to say, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3978.677s">It</a>  was like, that doesn't, 2010, February, 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3980.137s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3980.437s">And</a>  then we open it now, fall of 2010, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3984.44s">I'm</a>  off by 10.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3985.44s">So</a>  2008, it went out 2010 and opened.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3987.021s">We're</a>  heading into our seventh, we're heading into our seventh year.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3989.462s">Seventh</a>  year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3990.203s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3990.603s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3994.085s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3995.806s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3996.426s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3997.066s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3998.367s">Just,</a>  just to follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=3999.507s">I</a>  know this is, this is what a part of what I do for a living. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4002.909s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4005.642s">To</a>  be honest with everyone here, the maintenance of a field, what was true to be a maintenance of a field was the vacuuming two times a year by Joe Crowley and what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4019.415s">I</a>  personally met with a company last week that has a true understanding of what you're supposed to do, and they would come in to do all the tests that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4028.404s">And</a>  one test that's very important is a concussion impact test, whether our facilities are safe enough for our kids because of the pellets, what's added, what's not added. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4039.447s">And</a>  it's something to the point where there was quoted for us was $6,000 and they would come in and what they would do is the true maintenance where they would suck up all the pellets, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4049.57s">re-sweep</a>  the fibers so they're upright again, and then re-enter the pellets. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4056.097s">And</a>  then with that, you would get a certified study that would make sure that you are covered by insurance and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4064.705s">So</a>  that's something, as we move forward, I know that one of the things we talked about and one of the things Mr. Carr said, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4072.213s">When</a>  I talked to some of the school committee members, they're also coming out Monday with a detailed plan of all the facilities and funding and what each facility would cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4084.802s">I</a>  personally think that we in Somerville, what we charge is $185 per hour flat fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4091.907s">And</a>  that's something that I would like to see the school committee look at maybe increasing the fee for non-resident programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4099.592s">So,</a>  the BSSCs, the club soccer programs that make money, that come in and fund that to help pay for maintenance and pay for turf recovery as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4114.943s">This</a>  is what we're doing and we hope that as Monday's meeting comes out, would spell out a lot of what we're trying to think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4125.404s">This</a>  is easy, and I point back to a resolution I made last week, this is easy when you have a recreation department that oversees the fields, the maintenance, the budgeting, the rentals, the employees, soup to nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4142.197s">When</a>  we have one person doing six jobs, this is where it's difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4148.182s">So</a>  it's gonna come time that we should, and I'm anxious to see what we, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4153.599s">have</a>  for a recreation plan going forward, but it's going to be interesting to see where we're going to go with this because. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4161.172s">I</a>  want us to look outside the box and think maybe sometimes spending a little money is going to save us a lot of money as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4169.659s">So</a>  again, I appreciate Mr. Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4172.341s">I</a>  know everything you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4174.042s">I</a>  will tell you what I've been told what's done at Medford High School is something very important to me, many different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4181.828s">I</a>  was part of this program when it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4184.09s">My</a>  son will be playing at the high school in a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4187.373s">It's</a>  very important that we do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4190.744s">hope</a>  that there's safe turf and safe fields for our kids to play on for years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4195.206s">So</a>  I would love to share what I know with the school committee with plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4200.968s">And</a>  it's not $10,000, it's $6,000 per field for the whole plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4206.59s">And</a>  that's every season coming in, doing two deep cleanings, doing two vacuums that what Crowley does now, and sweeping and adding pellets when needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4215.853s">So</a>  it's a pretty

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4224.208s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4224.988s">I</a>  want to thank Bill Carr Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4227.609s">for</a>  coming up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4229.609s">He</a>  was one of the biggest advocates that I recall back in the days when the field of dreams was in its infancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4238.151s">And,</a>  you know, I just want to say, Mr. President, that we're discussing a bubble top. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4243.773s">And</a>  in my opinion, we should be discussing books in the schools that are 25 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4250.057s">We</a>  should be discussing the fact that teachers don't have proper supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4254.641s">We</a>  should be discussing the deplorable condition of the restrooms at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4259.324s">I'd</a>  venture to say probably 60 or 70% of the bathrooms in the high school are physically locked because they're in deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4267.931s">The</a>  water fountains don't work throughout the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4269.972s">And</a>  that may be a good thing because of lead pipes that we have throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4274.756s">So</a>  that may be a positive thing that they're not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4277.278s">We</a>  have a leaky roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4279.068s">I</a>  was up there several weeks ago watching my son play a basketball game, and they had to navigate between barrels because the roof was leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4286.653s">These</a>  are the issues we should be discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4288.914s">And</a>  in my opinion, I'm not pro or con of a bubble top. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4293.277s">I</a>  haven't seen the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4294.858s">But</a>  I could just tell you from firsthand experience, serving as a member of the school committee, that when we had the swimming pool up and running back some years ago, and the lack of resources, and the lack of upkeep on the pool, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4307.384s">and</a>  we rented it out to all the surrounding neighborhood communities to use our Olympic-sized swimming pool, over the years it deteriorated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4314.99s">And</a>  we got to a point where we couldn't use the swimming pool for I think it was roughly eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4319.613s">That</a>  went unused because of the lack of maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4322.736s">It</a>  was great to rent it out, and God knows where that rental money went. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4326.438s">It</a>  sure didn't go back into the swimming pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4328.6s">But</a>  that's the issue I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4330.181s">You</a>  know, rentals sound great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4331.462s">Bringing</a>  in outside money sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4334.408s">You</a>  know, we've been renting out the high school every Saturday for the past 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4339.213s">There's</a>  over 700 people every Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4342.716s">I'd</a>  ask anyone in the community to go up, and you can't get a pocket spot up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4347.3s">And</a>  it's a great program they run up there, the Japanese Language Arts Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4351.164s">And</a>  they have complete run of the entire high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4354.567s">However,</a>  Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4356.207s">I</a>  don't see any benefits over the years that we can say, well, this program has put on a new roof, or this program repaved the parking lot, or this program helped us do X, Y, and Z. I have yet to see any of that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4370.75s">And</a>  it's great to rent out the high school and our middle school and the pool and the field of dreams, and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4377.691s">But</a>  without, as Mr. Carr mentioned and Councilor Longo, without the proper maintenance, which this city has a poor track record, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4385.546s">We're</a>  going to be putting good money after bad money after renting these facilities out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4390.371s">And</a>  I, as one member of this council, I remember the bond funding that needed for the Field of Dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4396.378s">And</a>  I, as one member of this council, Mr. President, rather see the local use. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4402.105s">Yeah,</a>  we might not make as much on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4403.767s">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4404.486s">It</a>  may not be, but we're not in the business in this community to make money, to rent out fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4411.328s">Let's</a>  rent City Hall out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4413.269s">I</a>  mean, we're not in the business of renting facilities in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4416.99s">We're</a>  not in the rental business. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4419.31s">I</a>  want to make sure the fields are there, the fields are safe, and they're in great user condition for our athletes, for our students, for our intramural teams, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4430.554s">That's</a>  what I'm concerned about, not renting it out to these outside <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4434.734s">places</a>  that have no affiliation, just want to use it as a space. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4439.278s">And</a>  I don't know, Mr. President, I have a lot of reservations with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4443.661s">You</a>  know, the determination is up to the school committee, and good luck to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4448.144s">Apparently,</a>  they don't need any money from this council, so they're going off on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4452.267s">And</a>  good luck to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4453.068s">But,</a>  you know, let's take a look at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4456.29s">Let's</a>  get our current needs underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4458.372s">If</a>  that high school was ship-shaped, Mr. President, I wouldn't even have made this speech tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4462.861s">But</a>  I can tell you firsthand, having two children at the high school — I don't know when the last time you've been up to high school, but I have two children that go there on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4471.246s">And</a>  when they don't have a restroom to attend, when the bubbler doesn't work, when books they come home with look like they're from ancient Egypt, there's a problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4480.251s">There's</a>  a problem with what's going on for the basic necessities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4483.432s">And</a>  when teachers can't muster together paper and pencil and the basics, there's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4490.416s">So,</a>  I thank Mr. Carr for coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4492.294s">And</a>  I thank Councilor Longo for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4494.475s">And</a>  I think we should all be getting a copy of this RFP or draft of the RFP, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4499.559s">So</a>  we're informed when we get the calls from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4503.522s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4506.403s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4508.305s">As</a>  we all know, I think maintenance has been the Achilles heel of this whole city over for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4514.989s">And</a>  Councilor Marks is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4518.732s">We</a>  rent out the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4519.712s">We</a>  rent out everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4521.426s">It's</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4522.026s">And</a>  I agree, you know, we come up with some creative findings to get the bubble thing out of the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4529.529s">Time</a>  we start thinking out of the box to take some of this, like I said, take some of this rental money, reinvest it back into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4535.871s">As</a>  I said, the money from the Saturday rentals at the high school, some of that money should be going back into the high school to do repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4548.055s">You</a>  know, no one even mentioned the new field at <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4551.835s">And</a>  we only talked about the field up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4556.977s">I</a>  don't know what we've done over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4559.478s">So</a>  I'm sure that needs the same, if there's been, the attention has been lacking over there, I'm assuming that the same attention is lacking at Palmdale Stadium too, am I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4570.682s">You</a>  would know, I mean, I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4577.184s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think we get too many <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4581.337s">I</a>  think we got maybe too many groups, um, all fighting in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4585.279s">I</a>  think it's a, I think it's about time that we, uh, we come together on the one roof, but everybody, so we can, and maybe develop a solid plan, uh, to move forward on these type of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4595.062s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4598.663s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4599.083s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4604.585s">If</a>  I can, I, I, again, I, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4606.811s">I</a>  applaud my colleagues, this is a very hot topic, this is a very important topic, and I think that's something we all recognize, and what I recognized six years ago on the school committee, is the lack of a maintenance plan that needs to be in place, and I think that we should be working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4624.836s">But</a>  if we can recall back some odd years ago, and I think Mr. Carr can attest, the reason why we did these fields, and the reason why we could do these fields, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4634.38s">at</a>  the time it wasn't going to be funded by the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4638.505s">The</a>  whole idea was a grassroots effort by the community to come out and make sure that our kids that were playing on dangerous fields at the time were going to play on safe fields and given the opportunity for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4652.841s">And</a>  the only way to do that <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4655.405s">The</a>  realistic way to do that is to strike a balance where there was rentals and giving our opportunity for our kids to play on those fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4663.413s">And</a>  that was the only way that there was the balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4666.215s">Unfortunately,</a>  to say that we would go and just build this and make it happen wasn't going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4671.34s">We</a>  know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4672.321s">We</a>  lived it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4674.001s">There</a>  was no way the administration was going to let that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4676.483s">So</a>  we had to look at that, think outside the box, be creative, so our kids weren't playing on a dangerous field. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4681.427s">Because</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4682.387s">Most</a>  of that time, those fields were closed because they were dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4686.19s">Let's</a>  not forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4688.072s">To</a>  say that, you know, and not putting words in my colleague's mouth, but looking at books and looking at pens and pencils and paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4700.079s">To</a>  me, that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4701.12s">For</a>  six years, I was on the school committee making sure that, trying to make sure we had checks and balances. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4707.725s">We</a>  never let a teacher go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4710.228s">Our</a>  classroom size is the best in the commonwealth, and our programs are thriving. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4715.312s">We</a>  have a beautiful science building, we have a beautiful pool, we have a beautiful place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4718.915s">Now,</a>  don't get me wrong, there are definitely issues there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4722.958s">Bubblers,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4724.039s">Bathrooms,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4726.381s">But</a>  I'd love to see a maintenance plan moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4728.862s">Counsel,</a>  you're correct, a thousand percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4731.423s">But</a>  to insinuate one rather than the other, it's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4735.945s">We</a>  needed these fields to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4738.446s">And</a>  the only way to make them work is find a balance from outside and what we have inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4745.388s">And</a>  talking to these youth organizations, our youth organizations, sure, they'd like to be there every single night and play for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4752.432s">But</a>  the realistic issues are, if we wanted them, this is what we needed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4758.008s">And</a>  this wasn't George Scarpelli's school committee member, this wasn't George Scarpelli's city councilor, this was George Scarpelli, a parent of a child that wanted to make sure that our kids played on safe fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4768.074s">That's</a>  what Billy Carr started back then, and this is what we went forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4771.636s">Now</a>  as we're moving forward, and you're talking in a bubble, whether it works or whether it doesn't, whether the RFP goes through, whether it doesn't, I applaud at least an effort that's creative, that's not coming out of taxpayers' pockets, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4786.988s">to</a>  pay for turf that will be replaced within eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4793.393s">Because</a>  that's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4794.434s">Because</a>  in eight years, if we don't think outside the box, if we don't think of a maintenance plan to put in place so we can identify funding that goes directly to the replacement, we're going to be sitting here in eight years, hopefully, and we're going to be talking about where are we going to come up with $500,000 for each field at the time to replace a turf. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4815.27s">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4817.118s">That's</a>  why I applaud that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4818.519s">This</a>  is what neighboring communities do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4821.182s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4825.807s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4828.25s">So</a>  I have received a couple of calls and questions about this bubble project, and I think it's interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4835.096s">I</a>  think it has potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4839.978s">But</a>  I do believe preventive maintenance is the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4843.119s">I</a>  mean, when I was on the school committee, one of the big things advocates I was for is maintaining and making sure that we maintain our buildings and make sure we basically provide preventive maintenance on a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4856.865s">And</a>  back in 2010, when I was first elected, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4861.289s">I</a>  remember that was when I think Paul Edwards at the time came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4865.131s">He</a>  was the building and director, the school's buildings and directors, director. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4872.054s">And</a>  I said, what are we doing for preventive maintenance? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4874.335s">He</a>  said, we're doing nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4875.416s">We</a>  don't have money in the budget.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4878.497s">It</a>  was a rolling plan, if you remember, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4883.16s">They</a>  were doing this as they go, which is wasn't possible.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4886.261s">But</a>  I mean, I will say, some people may disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4890.587s">over</a>  time, that has improved a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4893.329s">I</a>  mean, we've actually made some progress in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4896.751s">For</a>  example, filters getting changed on a regular basis, whereas before, there were issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4901.013s">So</a>  I mean, preventive maintenance is the key to any project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4905.196s">In</a>  a project like this, it has to be the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4907.978s">I</a>  mean, I remember Field of Dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4909.138s">It</a>  was the first thing I voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4911.54s">It</a>  was the first issue that came before us when we were elected in 2010, was voting for the Field of Dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4917.083s">I</a>  still think today it's a good vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4919.705s">It's</a>  a great vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4920.861s">Um,</a>  you know, and I think that we have to think about when we think about education, we think of students, we have to think about well rounded students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4926.959s">We</a>  need to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4928.125s">you</a>  know, we, we provide, uh, things both inside the classroom and outside the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4932.969s">And</a>  I, I understand your, you know, about the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4935.311s">We</a>  do need to make sure our books are current 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4937.553s">I,</a>  I, I didn't know we had any of that old. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4940.195s">I</a>  knew we do have some old textbooks, but I didn't think they were that old. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4943.498s">But,</a>  um, and I'd love to know what class we can talk afterwards, but I'd love to know what class has those because we need to get the school committee needs to know that those have to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4952.906s">But,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4954.733s">But,</a>  I mean, it's, you know, we want to make sure we have well-rounded students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4957.575s">The</a>  fields are a great example of how we, our children and our students, can actually use, you know, get physical activity through sports and recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4966.461s">And</a>  it's important that we have, you know, state-of-the-art facilities to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4970.404s">But</a>  for me, you know, it comes down to preventive maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4973.326s">And</a>  what I'd like to see is, you know, and if I could amend the resolution, is just to receive a business plan from the school committee as to what they're going to do as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4982.223s">you</a>  know, how much is going to be charged, the plans to rent it out, I mean, how much is being set aside for preventive maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4988.37s">So</a>  if we could add that to the resolution, I'd greatly appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4993.136s">Add.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4995.118s">If</a>  we get the school committee could give us the proposed business plan for the fields with regard to, um, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5003.208s">with</a>  your charging the cost, how much is going back to preventive maintenance, basically the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5007.893s">What's</a>  the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5008.634s">I</a>  mean, I know we talked a little bit about the hours, you know, who's gonna be renting it out if possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5015.041s">I</a>  mean, that type of thing, the type of programming that's gonna be offered.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5019.366s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5020.146s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5023.033s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be given a draft copy of the edited and updated RFP that will be voted on by the Medford School Committee regarding the leasing of the Edgeley Field with, as amended, a report to convey to us the funding that has been used over the years for the maintenance of the fields, and secondly, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5052.486s">amended</a>  by Councilor Falco that the proposed business plan be included in that communique. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5060.713s">We</a>  have a citizen who wishes to readdress us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5068.34s">Just</a>  one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5069.241s">I've</a>  asked for the last couple of months, and maybe Councilor, I'll let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5074.451s">How</a>  much money has come in on a yearly basis to the two fields behind Medford High School? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5078.995s">Exact</a>  dollar figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5080.316s">No</a>  one seems to get, no one knows that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5083.699s">I've</a>  asked everybody from the top, no one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5086.281s">I'm</a>  sorry, you can finish.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5091.365s">Maybe</a>  we should group this with resolution that I put on 16.475 in which I asked the very same question.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5097.691s">It's</a>  a little late for that, isn't it?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5107.462s">I</a>  have that answer at my house.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5111.865s">I'll</a>  let someone else speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5114.647s">My</a>  statement as far as the city doesn't do a good job, it's not anybody's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5117.97s">It's</a>  an oversight that happens through many of the projects in the city and many of the situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5122.753s">We</a>  don't do a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5124.234s">We</a>  can stop it and get a $10,000 budget line item in this year so we can start doing the fields properly so we can get the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5131.98s">If</a>  I come back here in three years and we're still not doing it right, you're going to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5137.178s">And</a>  it's going to be embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5139.323s">So</a>  we don't want to get to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5141.569s">Let's</a>  do the right thing and keep them going for the next five or six years, probably.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5148.445s">Good</a>  evening, citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5149.505s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5151.586s">My</a>  name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5152.526s">I</a>  live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5154.547s">I'm</a>  a member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5156.607s">My</a>  take on this is just a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5158.507s">We</a>  can talk about the maintenance, and it's quite obvious that the maintenance is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5162.128s">But</a>  I'd like to get into the legality of the bond in and of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5165.809s">When</a>  the city of Medford went out for the bond in this particular field,</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5171.715s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5173.656s">I'm</a>  going to get into the legality of matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5175.297s">I</a>  think I'd feel more comfortable if the city solicitor were present and able to provide us with that type of advice.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5180.481s">I</a>  would, too.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5181.282s">Mr.</a>  President, my purpose of saying the legality of it is because I would like to ask a question, and I think it needs to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5187.506s">The</a>  question is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5188.607s">The</a>  City of Medford owns the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5190.808s">Now,</a>  will the City of Medford own the dome that the renter wants to come in? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5195.511s">And</a>  if that's the situation, I think it changes the whole intent of what the City of Medford's bond was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5201.533s">and</a>  that bond being for the exclusive use, again, of the fields, Medford folks and students first, and however the rentals take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5210.001s">But</a>  you're now building a bond, and now you want to build a bubble, and the bubble will declare an ownership of authority of the person that has it, and the city of Medford will not have priority of the use of those fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5219.791s">So</a>  I would hope one of you folks on the council would make that request to our city solicitor to ask him <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5226.18s">if</a>  in fact this is even legal to do and what authority, if anything, does the city or will they have over the dome itself for the purposes of liability and for the purposes of its use? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5237.444s">I</a>  think it's an important question to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5240.025s">I</a>  have no problem with the bubble, whether it goes or doesn't go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5242.906s">I</a>  think you need to have this legal question as it relates to this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5246.767s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5247.827s">So</a>  I would hope somebody.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5248.988s">I</a>  can move that question, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5253.909s">Please</a>  state the question, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5256.65s">The</a>  question is the liability of the bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5259.131s">Who</a>  would be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the bubble? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5264.553s">In</a>  case of some type of disaster, what would happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5268.455s">Would</a>  the City of Medford be responsible? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5270.756s">Who</a>  maintains ownership?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5273.077s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, there is an additional, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5276.518s">Also</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5277.639s">Sir.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5277.859s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5279.119s">Councilors</a>  may only introduce motions on this floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5282.581s">Only</a>  councilors may introduce motions on this floor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5285.706s">I'm</a>  trying to clarify the motion, if you'd give me the courtesy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5290.109s">Also,</a>  the fact of the matter is, does this interfere with the bond that originally was written, therefore allowing, as such right now, the city of Medford entertaining a private entity to come in, use its field for its particular purpose, the dome? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5303.958s">I</a>  think that question needs to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5306.639s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5307.82s">So</a>  moved, Mr. President, that that be asked.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5310.382s">And</a>  you can review that on tape, if you'd like.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5317.89s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5318.71s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[uIlyuj9UctU_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5320.991s">My</a>  name is Carolyn Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5322.512s">I</a>  live at 32 Arlington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5326.174s">I</a>  was sitting back listening to the conversation particularly about this dome and the field versus the educational side of public schools in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5339.14s">And</a>  I think that the conversation sort of got askew because it's really very necessary <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5347.995s">for</a>  the students to have a place where they can be active, since I don't think that they really have that many gym courses that get them out to be active. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5358.982s">But</a>  I think more important than that is the education that they get. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5363.585s">I</a>  taught at Medford High School eons ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5368.208s">I</a>  only taught for one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5370.309s">The</a>  reason why I only taught for one year is that I'm a shoe freak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5374.253s">And</a>  I had all of these shoes, and standing on my feet, my shoes, my feet grew like a size larger, and I said, I can't do this every year if I have to buy new shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5386.817s">And</a>  so I decided to move on, and I went into the private sector. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5391.518s">But</a>  one of the things that disturbed me when I taught was that the, I taught history and civics, and the books were antiquated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5402.356s">And</a>  so I had some relatives who were educators, and they didn't live in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5408.783s">And</a>  I said, what books can you send me that I can use to teach civics and history in a way that I want the students to understand it? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5417.933s">And</a>  they sent me some books. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5419.594s">Now,</a>  they sent me books for me to use, so that meant that I had to spend more time developing <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5426.568s">the</a>  script for the courses that I taught. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5431.01s">And</a>  my classroom was next door to the senior submaster's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5438.112s">And</a>  I was told that that was where they put first year teachers because he thought that they could not control themselves or the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5447.156s">And</a>  about halfway through the year, he came and he stood in the back of my class <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5451.951s">At</a>  the end of the class, I said, is there something I can help you with? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5455.733s">And</a>  he said, I never hear any noise coming from your class. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5459.495s">And</a>  I said, that's because you're not supposed to hear any noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5463.277s">And</a>  I developed my own curriculum for what I taught the students that I thought would keep them interested in history and civics, because I know that that's not <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5475.647s">those</a>  are not classes that most students liked. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5478.408s">Unfortunately,</a>  when I was in high school, those were my favorite classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5483.691s">I</a>  think that Medford High School, all of Medford schools, need to keep up in terms of the books that you use, the curriculum that you help the teachers design, whether they do it on their own, whether they do it collectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5505.765s">I</a>  was just disturbed by the conversation that it was like either you get new books and the teachers don't have to buy their own paper and pencils or you put in this big dome. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5518.337s">I</a>  mean there must be some way that you can talk about it collectively and come up with <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5525.263s">a</a>  solution that provides both things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5530.424s">And</a>  for myself, I mean, I think that things that are around athletics are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5537.326s">But</a>  if there was one choice, I would make the choice that it go towards the academic side, because that's what the students are going to need when they graduate from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5547.548s">And</a>  if they haven't gotten the basics while they're in school, they're not really going to get a good job or get into college once they get out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5555.003s">So</a>  that is all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5557.644s">I</a>  hope that you'll take what I've said under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5561.346s">And</a>  if you need any more information from me, you can give me a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5568.548s">Some</a>  of the people who come down to the West Medford Community Center know me from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5573.512s">So,</a>  Councilman Falco and his partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5577.593s">I</a>  think I've seen you before, Councilman Marks, but I didn't know what your name was, but I do know those two.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5585.315s">Huh?</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5589.117s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5591.717s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5592.758s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5594.358s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Lungel-Kern, as amended by Vice President Lungel-Kern, Falco and Marks, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5601.828s">Roll</a>  call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5616.08s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5616.44s">With</a>  the vote of four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5621.144s">Motion</a>  for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5622.845s">Can</a>  we take, we have two cab drivers here to have quick business. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5634.377s">No,</a>  one was tabled and one was. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5640.822s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor, Vice President Lungo-Koehn to take paper out of order 16474 by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the issue of public safety in South Medford be addressed as it relates to parking on sidewalks and any other related issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5656.093s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5657.494s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5660.425s">I</a>  know that I sound like a broken record with regards to bringing this up every month or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5666.229s">And</a>  I know the council, we get repeated emails from neighbors and phone calls from neighbors in the Harvard and Main Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5673.935s">And</a>  I know that we have a committee working on certain issues within that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5679.92s">But</a>  a resident would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5682.421s">And</a>  I think it's definitely relative and definitely needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5686.324s">It</a>  seems like we're getting nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5687.705s">I</a>  bring it up time and time again. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5690.591s">parking</a>  on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5692.112s">We</a>  have bus stops in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5694.254s">We</a>  have children. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5695.114s">We</a>  have senior citizens in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5697.756s">And</a>  just the neighborhood, when you have a Mack truck pulling up onto a sidewalk, somebody could get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5704.481s">Somebody</a>  could get seriously injured. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5707.683s">And</a>  for some reason, it's fallen on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5709.885s">I</a>  said it before and I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5711.285s">I</a>  mean, I've been to a traffic commission meeting to try to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5715.225s">And</a>  it just seems like nothing's getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5717.086s">And</a>  I know it has to come from the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5719.067s">I</a>  mean, it has to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5720.528s">The</a>  administration has to rule on this one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5724.07s">So</a>  we haven't got anything in writing with regards to this being allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5727.311s">But</a>  from what I understand, when residents and people call and ask for enforcement, some people are told that this is allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5736.376s">I</a>  don't think it's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5737.277s">I</a>  think we need to find a way for the business district <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5742.144s">and</a>  the neighbors to coexist in a safe manner, a safe manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5747.206s">So</a>  whether that's a committee of the whole meeting with the chief of police and the neighbors and the business owners, we need to figure something out to alleviate this safety concern that so many have, not just, we do get emails repeatedly, pictures all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5763.012s">So</a>  we see it, we drive by, we see it happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5766.515s">And</a>  it's an unsafe situation that needs to be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5769.717s">We</a>  need some enforcement and we need to figure out a way to work on this together as a community, as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5776.742s">You</a>  know, whether we pinpoint whose cars and whose trucks are making deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5781.405s">You</a>  know, I see the pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5782.506s">I</a>  don't know exactly, but, you know, you have a feeling, you know who it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5785.928s">Well,</a>  let's figure out whether it be a loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5788.289s">And</a>  I think there is a committee working on that and we can get some updates on that, but something needs to, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5794.794s">relieve</a>  the stress of people who want to walk, traverse the sidewalks, maybe go grab a pastry at Arthur's Pastry, but are scared to walk on Medford's sidewalks.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5805.845s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5807.066s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Scott Bally. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5809.048s">If</a>  I can, shed some light on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5810.909s">I</a>  know that, and I appreciate Council President, Vice President Lungo-Koehn bringing this up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5818.903s">We</a>  are actively working with subcommittee on transportation just to shed a little light. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5824.587s">We</a>  have met with the T and the DOT about talking about moving or eliminating or temporarily moving a few stops that were in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5837.375s">And</a>  we had a subcommittee meeting last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5839.968s">to</a>  discuss those issues that directly relate to this issue, and they're getting back to us hopefully very soon about looking into a study, what times would be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5851.528s">It</a>  would take that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5852.348s">So</a>  they're doing a time study and distance study. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5854.929s">They're</a>  doing a ridership study and we're talking and filling everybody in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5860.232s">I</a>  know the, uh, disability commission is very involved and we're making sure that every resident is heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5866.474s">So</a>  I wanted to make sure with that issue being said, that led me to a meeting, um, today with, um, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5874.187s">our</a>  council liaison, uh, Lauren Felch. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5877.008s">And</a>  she was very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5878.909s">Um,</a>  part of the discussions and it was all, uh, predicated on the efforts of our, uh, resident, uh, Miss Anne Fretz, who's been working diligently for the neighbors in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5890.855s">Uh,</a>  when we had our first tour of that facility and that area of concern, one being Harvard street and having residents that were, um, were pregnant and, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5902.403s">the</a>  trucks pulling up and idling in front of where the children's bedroom would be ended up being very dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5909.268s">And</a>  I think that meeting today with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5912.791s">Felch</a>  and talking about a simple fix and something we talked to the residents and that neighbor in particular and Anne and some other folks that putting planters along Harvard Street to something as simple as planters just to eliminate that concern <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5931.748s">and</a>  a decade of plantas that <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5934.316s">I</a>  got a word back this afternoon that that would happen relatively soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5939.58s">The</a>  mayor supports that, and that's going to be done immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5944.243s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5945.804s">And</a>  the other issues, and like my fellow colleague, Vice President Lungo-Koehn mentioned, a meeting with the business owners in that area and the neighbors, I think that's something that they also discussed that they're trying to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5964.38s">We</a>  were hoping that I know the chief was trying to make it here tonight to answer some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5969.31s">I</a>  believe Kim Fowler is here from Department of Health to also answer a few questions about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5976.29s">another</a>  concern, which is the dumpster issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5978.773s">And,</a>  um, I know they've already been working that Mr. Bavuso is, has already talked to the company today about the issue that you brought forward and really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5989.484s">Um,</a>  I believe they were picking up the trash, I believe three or five o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5993.508s">And</a>  one of the biggest issues that will come in front of this council with, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5999.052s">With</a>  Ann's persistence and her devotion to these concerns, looking deeply into the ordinances both on trash pickup and for <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6016.167s">loading</a>  and, uh, at different, different businesses that reside in residential communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6022.671s">So</a>  I think that that's going to be vetted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6024.773s">And</a>  I think that's going to be coming to this body relatively soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6027.915s">So,</a>  um, I appreciate the mayor's office today meeting with me and, um, listening and moving forward in a couple of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6036.84s">And,</a>  uh, again, I appreciate and, and I know that you, you deserve to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6041.664s">And</a>  I know that this has been a lot of hard work on your end. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6044.505s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Fretts]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6057.426s">Ann</a>  Marie frets two 15 Harvard street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6059.966s">Actually</a>  it's 50 Yale street, but the numbers don't work out that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6064.167s">Um,</a>  this is a photo taken this week from in front of one 59 Harvard street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6070.349s">You</a>  can't see the window where a newborn, a two week old is sleeping at this point with his parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6076.536s">This</a>  is what it looks like every day in front of that place at any given time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6082.861s">And</a>  this is what the sidewalk looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6086.664s">What</a>  this indicates is someone has driven across the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6089.586s">And</a>  what I saw last Thursday, I believe, was a school bus letting the children out at 2.30 while this person was driving, actually it was his partner, driving on the sidewalk across Main Street and across Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6108.422s">No,</a>  there is no loading dock. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6110.423s">All</a>  we have is sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6112.523s">That's</a>  why we need the MBTA slot. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6114.744s">And</a>  I spent two hours along with Jim Silva at the traffic commission today asking for four parking spaces to be freed up and designated as a loading zone for this particular person. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6127.928s">So,</a>  or for this particular area, actually, it's not just one business. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6132.329s">It</a>  is a group of businesses that are impacting our area in a negative manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6136.851s">It's</a>  unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6138.187s">that</a>  the neighbors are the last people to be considered when we're operating a booming square of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6145.972s">And</a>  I believe that Mr. DelaRosa is aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6149.614s">Mr.</a>  President, you can probably speak to that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6152.456s">It's,</a>  it's throbbing down there at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6155.157s">Um,</a>  so we have a situation where public safety is at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6159.598s">and</a>  the quality of life is being impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6162.941s">I</a>  was going through some documents, and I came across this document from six years ago, when we first looked at our condominium. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6171.828s">And</a>  it is a great place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6173.69s">Lincoln</a>  Kennedy is why I'm here, because I want to maintain what we have at our property. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6179.334s">Unfortunately,</a>  because of the delivery zone <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6182.984s">and</a>  trailer trucks driving down Harvard Street and unloading at specific places and then buying lunch, they need a place to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6191.469s">What</a>  has happened is we've lost 12 trees that were planted on the sidewalk apron out in front of the Lincoln School and in front of the Kennedy School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6201.876s">Aggie</a>  Tudin was kind enough to come out and the DPW director assisted today and said, we cannot have those trees replanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6210.141s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6211.361s">The</a>  apron is too short. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6212.953s">The</a>  trees will be taken out again. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6214.354s">They</a>  are going to be cementing over the grass in front of our buildings, which will make more parking spaces for the trailer trucks, which is why we need more flower pots down in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6226.065s">Unfortunately,</a>  we're also being vandalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6228.867s">The</a>  trees in front of the Kennedy buildings are being snapped off in between the trees, in the center trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6234.354s">people</a>  are hanging out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6235.034s">They're</a>  doing the same thing to our use on Yale street, which may sound silly, but when you find chunks of the main core thrown onto the side sidewalk, it is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6247.062s">So</a>  we've got drivers and owners parking and driving on the sidewalks, using them extensions of the streets, encouraging their vendors to park there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6256.628s">And</a>  the people who live at one 59 have gone out and asked these vendors to move their trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6262.632s">And</a>  they said that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6264.023s">businesses</a>  in question have told them to park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6267.226s">They</a>  can't move. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6267.966s">That's</a>  where they have to unload. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6269.468s">There's</a>  nowhere else that they can unload. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6272.33s">We've</a>  been impacted greatly by this for the last three years now in an ever increasing mountain of just stuff happening to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6286.423s">And</a>  it's not that we've kept it quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6288.604s">I</a>  don't know how many times I've been before this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6292.822s">six</a>  possibly discussing the same issue, but yet in all the emails I've sent out to everyone and the emails and contacts with the phone calls I've made to Lauren, to Linda Coletti, trying to get in touch with the mayor, copying the mayor, copying the chief of police, I have yet to receive a phone call or email from the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6312.838s">And</a>  what really upset me is that looking at the mayor's, um, 2015 platform to campaign to be the mayor for public safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6323.187s">She</a>  had to, and you can find this on the website, it's to continue invest in the safety of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6330.17s">Our</a>  sidewalks aren't safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6331.25s">I</a>  mean, it's a basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6332.81s">We</a>  have children who live at Lincoln Kennedy who walk on the sidewalks while these trailer trucks are driving down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6338.953s">We</a>  have people living in the condominiums and in the homes that are right next door to commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6345.095s">We</a>  could call it an industrial zone because it really is truly based on the number of things we have going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6351.855s">But</a>  what concerns me about this is that it says core to our continued investment in the infrastructure of our community is the safety of our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6361.443s">First</a>  and foremost, we need to investigate avenues for improved public safety facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6366.487s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6367.528s">This</a>  is vital to moving our community forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6369.85s">In</a>  addition, we will need to conduct traffic pattern studies at major intersections throughout the city to improve the ability for residents to move within and throughout the city safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6379.915s">The</a>  following locations will be a focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6383.118s">South</a>  Medford Business District is not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6387.021s">The</a>  closest one is three quarters of a mile away, the Tufts Square intersection of Main and Medford streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6392.525s">There</a>  is nothing, despite the fact that last October, a Mr. Ernest Martinello was run over while he was crossing Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6404.715s">He</a>  was in the hospital for a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6407.512s">He</a>  was in rehab for five months. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6409.493s">I</a>  haven't verified this myself, but with someone who he shops with on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6415.356s">We</a>  don't know the circumstances other than he was out in front of Gagney Insurance in the crosswalk and was hit by a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6421.758s">The</a>  chief is aware of this and is checking into it for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6425.32s">My</a>  concern is there will be more, more accidents before something happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6430.062s">If</a>  you stand at the stoplights and try and cross the street, even pushing the button, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6434.812s">people</a>  will turn right on red while you're in the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6438.173s">It's</a>  a very dangerous area and yet it is not on Mayor Burke's list. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6443.735s">I</a>  have yet to hear from Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6445.875s">I</a>  have yet to get a return phone call from Lauren or from anyone else in the entire staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6452.237s">I</a>  looked at the history of who has responded and who has.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6458.479s">And</a>  it's this council and the</p>

    <p>[Ann Fretts]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6464.954s">Chief</a>  of Police has tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6467.556s">Sergeant</a>  Rich Carroll has tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6470.699s">Captain</a>  Alan Daugherty have tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6473.262s">But</a>  as the Chief said today, you can drive by these areas six times a day, and maybe a truck will be there, maybe it won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6480.928s">I</a>  happen to see them on occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6482.45s">I</a>  take a picture, and I send it, and I call the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6485.132s">My</a>  new process is to call the police, call the mayor's office, and send them a picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6492.353s">That's</a>  the best we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6493.954s">But</a>  we just want to be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6495.054s">We</a>  want to be able to walk the streets, walk our dogs, enjoy life, and live in a great place, continue to live in a great place that's maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6504.499s">The</a>  sidewalks are a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6505.759s">We</a>  can't wait two years, three years, to have a street fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6509.781s">We're</a>  starting to trip over the cracked sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6512.042s">The</a>  sidewalk that was repaired across the street from your house next to 363 Main Street is already cracked. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6518.245s">There's</a>  already grease from trucks driving over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6522.427s">to</a>  pick up a dumpster, which is slippery when wet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6526.269s">I</a>  pointed that out today to the city DPW director. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6531.711s">We</a>  don't know what can be done, but I appreciate everything that you're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6535.533s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6537.114s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6538.794s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6541.716s">And</a>  I think if we can, I'd like to, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6545.175s">I'd</a>  like to meet, make a call tomorrow and maybe see if we can set something up with the mayor's office, the police chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6551.479s">I</a>  know Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6552.46s">Fowler's</a>  here tonight and someone from her office that, you know, I, I want to move this in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6559.265s">I</a>  think, I think the response I got today is something positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6562.547s">I</a>  think, you know, with what you're dealing with, I think it's very important, um, to follow up on a couple of issues that Mr, uh, uh, fellow, uh, colleague, Mr. Marks has worked so hard with is bringing the light of crosswalks <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6575.148s">and</a>  painting throughout our community and something that Mr. Falco and I were at the meeting, was it last Thursday with open streets with the grant possibility, excuse me, complete streets and one of the things we talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6589.582s">was</a>  South Medford and the safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6591.903s">One</a>  thing we talked about, Mr. Marks, so you know, as we talked about priorities and since you were the four on the four forefront of talking about the painted sidewalks and we're talking these crosswalks and the lighting and having visible lighting so people know that's going to attract the oncoming traffic that this is a highly <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6618.004s">community</a>  area that they have to pay attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6620.587s">I</a>  think that's part of the complete street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6622.229s">So</a>  I think and I believe if Mr. Falco can correct me, I believe this all has to be in by by June. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6629.437s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6629.757s">It</a>  has to be done within one year.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6632.06s">I'm</a>  getting you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6636.985s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6638.895s">You</a>  are correct, there is actually a timeline or time frame as to, I believe, the objectives of the plan have to be in place, and that needs to be approved by the state, and then the funding will come, and then the money has to be spent by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6653.977s">June</a>  30th, 2017.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6655.197s">So</a>  this is a meeting in South Medford a month or so ago with the business and economic development transition team. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6663.899s">And</a>  May Burke was there and announced that her priority for spending the complete streets money was to address the intersection of Harvard and main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6672.801s">She</a>  made that announcement at that meeting.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6674.942s">So,</a>  so to follow up and if we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6678.035s">You've</a>  championed this and I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6681.096s">And</a>  I think that let's move forward in a positive direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6684.177s">Let's,</a>  let me, let's see if we can have a meeting and let's see if we can all get together and put all the stakeholders at the table that we're talking about the revitalization of, of a main street in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6695.7s">If</a>  we're talking about the crosswalks and the possibility of using complete streets to make sure those are the priorities and making sure that our streets are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6703.922s">Cause</a>  I think that's all of our intentions anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6706.443s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6708.117s">you</a>  know, you know, if all I can ask is this is new to me with this situation, give me another 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6715.062s">Let's</a>  see if we can do something positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6716.543s">So,</a>  and I appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Ann Fretts]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6720.446s">Councilman</a>  Caraviello and mostly Councilman Mark championed a walk through our fair square, our fair city down at our end of the neighborhood 18 months ago and attempted to create a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6737.027s">to</a>  have a safety council, I think it was called. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6740.651s">And</a>  that has yet to happen, and yet we've had support driving that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6744.956s">So</a>  if you can pull this off, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6747.599s">And</a>  Councilman Caraviello was on the walk with us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6751.183s">Councilman</a>  Knight asked to have, or suggested a traffic study, which would have been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6756.95s">That</a>  was last October. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6759.17s">So</a>  it would have happened by now had we followed through on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6761.771s">He</a>  was not voted through on that aspect of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6764.913s">But</a>  there's been many things other than just the trailer trucks driving. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6768.315s">We</a>  have dumpsters being picked up, as you said, at three o'clock and four o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6772.898s">This</a>  is a four yard dumpster, a metal dumpster being picked up by a forklift and dropped outside of the bedroom wall of this young couple and their baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6783.043s">This</a>  has been going on for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6784.464s">I</a>  wasn't aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6785.365s">And</a>  these kids have been in this condominium <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6788.299s">The</a>  condimenting was purchased long before there was any expansion of restaurants or doubling the size of restaurants in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6795.364s">So</a>  it's unfortunate for these people.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6797.225s">If</a>  we can, and if I know what we brought up the top, Kim's right behind you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6801.528s">So</a>  if she can just real quick with that, that's a couple more Councilors that want to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6805.931s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6806.331s">Councilor,</a>  uh, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6809.133s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, there are several items and suggestions that we've kicked around in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6815.197s">Um,</a>  this council, I believe, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6817.565s">appropriated</a>  1.4, the prior council appropriated $1.4 million in funds for what would be called the Community Improvement Initiative, and part of that included portable safety cameras, portable security cameras that would be able to record and report back to our police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6833.533s">And</a>  I had a brief conversation with Chief Sacco about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6837.709s">and</a>  saying, we have two cameras, why don't we just set the two cameras up on Harvard and one on Maine, right at the location, and then we can have a guy sitting in the police station sending them $300 tickets with the camera pointing at the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6849.159s">I</a>  mean, at least that way they'll get the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6850.9s">After</a>  a couple of tickets, they're not going to park on the sidewalk anymore, and we don't even have to have somebody out there on the beep. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6855.724s">All</a>  we have to do is have somebody who's maybe in the office on some downtime going through the paperwork, or weekly even, going through the tape and just putting the paperwork together and sending it out for those vehicles that we can't identify through that tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6867.133s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, I think that we have a unique opportunity to work in concert with the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6873.194s">Maybe</a>  we can establish certain hours for on-street parking and certain hours for loading so that the same parking spots that are used for business parking are the same parking spots that are used for loading, and they're just restricted to certain hours in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6885.377s">So</a>  I think there are a number of different ways that we can look at this and a number of different ways that we can approach this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6889.077s">And</a>  these are some suggestions that I'd like to send over to our Transportation Subcommittee because they anxiously await. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6893.998s">their</a>  report on the issue.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6895.579s">There's</a>  also the loading zone on Yale Street that's amply available to people to use.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6901.44s">And</a>  I mean, I think that this council, since it's swearing in in January, has had more subcommittee meetings than we've had in 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6911.383s">So</a>  we're out on the street, there's a lot going on, and we're working hard trying to get it done, but there are a lot of irons in the fire as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6916.764s">But</a>  I think that Councilor Scarpelli's had at least two meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6919.626s">on</a>  this committee that he's chaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6920.546s">He's</a>  been down to the site at least twice, so I certainly feel as though we're in great hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6924.891s">I</a>  mean, it's an enforcement issue, and that's what it sounds like. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6926.753s">It's</a>  an enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6927.573s">Nobody</a>  behind this rail can write a parking ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6930.562s">Nobody</a>  behind this rail can write a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6932.003s">The</a>  only people that can do that are the police and parking enforcement officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6936.046s">So</a>  it's really an enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6937.327s">If</a>  someone's parking on the sidewalk, they should be getting tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6940.77s">The</a>  Yale Street is not the only location. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6942.832s">You're</a>  seeing it down on Middlesex Ave, too, at Asian Taste, at the Old Roses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6946.515s">You're</a>  seeing it at a number of different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6948.556s">You're</a>  seeing it around our parks when games are being played, where cars are starting to park halfway up on the sidewalk to create a path because they want to park close enough to the field where they don't have to walk too far. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6959.065s">but</a>  the vehicle's not in the greatest spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6960.605s">So</a>  I certainly can understand the frustration that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6963.506s">Fritz</a>  has. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6964.466s">I</a>  drive that stretch from Bob's to LaCosche's, you know, at least 25 times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6970.288s">That</a>  is one of the most frustrating intersections that we have in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6973.808s">It</a>  needs to be looked at, and we need to engineer it properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6977.009s">I</a>  think that, you know, all of us sitting, put a crosswalk here, move a bus stop here, do this, that's all well and good, but if we really take the appropriate steps and invest the funds in a traffic study or a traffic engineer, I think that this is something that'll resolve itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6989.534s">But</a>  we have to get to that point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6991.396s">So</a>  I want to thank Councilor Scott Felley for the work that he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6994.458s">And,</a>  you know, let Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6995.879s">Fretz</a>  know that I certainly understand her pain and anguish, because I drive through it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6999.602s">But</a>  there are some options out there that we need to explore.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7001.924s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7003.546s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7006.108s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7006.868s">Mr.</a>  President, you know, I've had the opportunity to work with Ian for the last five years that I've been on this council, probably from, I think, day one when I first got elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7017.257s">And</a>  again, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7018.621s">We</a>  have made some strides over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7021.442s">I</a>  mean, it's not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7023.862s">I</a>  think everyone in this council is called John Bavuso in regards to the rubbish, the Board of Health in regards to the rubbish. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7030.664s">They</a>  have been increased, but again, it's still not enough for the needs of the businesses over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7040.446s">First</a>  and foremost, parking on the sidewalk is illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7042.586s">I</a>  think everybody knows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7044.706s">Again,</a>  we have, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7048.157s">a</a>  parking company, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7051.339s">Instead</a>  of, I mean, listen, these, Republic Parking can go out and tag these trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7059.344s">Instead</a>  of going around looking at smaller things, these are big ticket items. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7063.626s">These</a>  are the things that they should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7066.128s">Again,</a>  you know, with four people patrolling the city, they drive by, I've seen them drive by when the trucks were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7074.793s">Those</a>  guys should be pulling over and tagging the truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7077.767s">I</a>  mean, I brought this up with Councilor Langlois-Coon at many of the traffic meetings, that the Republic should be tagging these trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7086.29s">Again,</a>  in Councilor's night is right, it's enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7090.832s">If</a>  I had a ticket book, I could be famous in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7096.394s">Again,</a>  this council can't write tickets, but again, we have facilities for people that can write tickets, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7102.849s">And</a>  like I say, we have a private company. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7104.89s">They</a>  should be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7106.011s">They</a>  drive by enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7107.212s">They</a>  see it, don't drive by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7109.373s">They</a>  should be, the chief should force them to ticket these trucks when they're on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7116.438s">I</a>  mean, they're not there for one minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7117.838s">They're</a>  there for 10, 15, 20 minutes, a half an hour sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7120.54s">So</a>  again, and I say, we've worked with Councilor Scarpelli, like me, we've worked hard to make strides and we're trying our hardest, but again, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7129.073s">It</a>  all revolves around enforcement, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7131.394s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7132.715s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7133.715s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7134.855s">Um,</a>  I agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7136.276s">I</a>  think enforcement is a major issue, but I also think, um, it just comes down to traffic and they offered a resolution back in February to hire a traffic consultant or traffic engineer to come in and take a look at the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7148.601s">This</a>  situation is only going to get worse and we live in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7152.903s">We</a>  just live, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7154.197s">In</a>  a section of the state where there's just tons of traffic, we need to have a professional come in and take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7159.942s">If</a>  you take a look at South Medford, you take a look at the Wegmans neighborhood down by the mall, the Shaw's development, the potential casino.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7166.368s">North</a>  Medford.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7167.75s">North</a>  Medford, with that possible development at the Malvern Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7172.754s">It's</a>  happening all over the city, and we need to actually have a professional come in and take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7177.279s">We</a>  don't have a traffic consultant <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7179.239s">in</a>  this traffic engineer in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7181.14s">We</a>  need to get some sort of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7183.061s">And</a>  I think that this should hopefully be included in the budget this year because I honestly feel this problem is going to get worse and it really needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7190.484s">You</a>  know, I take a look at the emails that come in and the pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7193.045s">It's</a>  horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7193.585s">People</a>  parking on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7195.265s">That's</a>  common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7196.286s">It's</a>  just not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7196.986s">It's</a>  against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7199.067s">It</a>  comes down to enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7200.528s">But</a>  traffic is a major issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7202.388s">I</a>  really think that a traffic engineer needs to be consulted or hired hopefully sooner than later and hopefully in this budget cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7209.405s">And</a>  hopefully, this issue gets resolved soon.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7212.887s">We</a>  did a traffic study on Harvard Street back some 10 years ago before the building was built or before it was reconverted.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7223.613s">I</a>  just feel like I feel that we need something current, but we need to look at our whole city and look at all the traffic patterns in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7230.437s">We</a>  have some major traffic problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7231.778s">They</a>  need to be addressed, and they're not going to go away.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7234.5s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7235.16s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7239.173s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7242.694s">Kimberly</a>  Fowler. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7243.975s">Kimberly</a>  Fowler. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7244.915s">I'm</a>  a registered sanitarian for the city of Medford Board of Health and I'm happy to be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7249.937s">I</a>  was introduced to Anne Fretz early this year, approximately January 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7253.579s">We</a>  received an email about some overflowing rubbish at the Oasis Brazilian restaurant at 373 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7261.242s">I</a>  responded and conducted a routine full inspection based on her complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7266.697s">And</a>  the Oasis Brazilian restaurant was cited for errant trash, meaning trash that is not in dumpsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7274.402s">There</a>  were some big oil bottles back behind the dumpster. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7277.725s">So</a>  they were cited for that, and they were giving a warning ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7281.267s">I</a>  had also got in touch.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7283.829s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7286.739s">I</a>  don't want the people in the community to think that Oasis was cited for any cleanliness violations inside the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7293.264s">Was</a>  there an inside inspection as well?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7294.985s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7295.405s">There</a>  was, and everything came back fine from the inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7297.667s">It</a>  was just the outside that was the concern.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7299.468s">No,</a>  but these, the violation, I'm talking about the violations that are relevant to Ann's complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7303.792s">And</a>  that was that everybody in Medgar was due for an inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7307.334s">So</a>  her complaint prompted a full inspection inside and outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7311.502s">So</a>  they were cited for the garbage issues outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7314.244s">Outside.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7314.704s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7315.064s">And</a>  the inside among other, among other things inside that aren't relevant to this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7319.647s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7320.728s">So,</a>  um, I also wrote a cease and desist letter to Republic services, the, um, hauler who was doing the early morning pickups and they were cited, they were served a cease and desist order January 26 based on their violations of the Medford city ordinances, as well as the Medford board of health regulations, which, um, regulate dumpster, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7341.728s">and</a>  licensing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7343.228s">So</a>  as of January 21st, I went back for a re-inspection to the Oasis Brazilian restaurant, and they were A-OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7351.151s">Everything</a>  was in good shape, which tells me that they're fully capable of taking care of their business and their trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7357.453s">So</a>  that was January 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7364.048s">I'm</a>  not going to go through all of them, but I'm going to go through them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7381.816s">one</a>  yesterday, as of yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7384.398s">And</a>  so this morning at 5 AM, I was conducting my own surveillance at the new Oasis Brazilian restaurant to see if Republic Services was picking up trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7394.667s">And</a>  I didn't see anybody, and I walked over, took a couple pictures, looked in the dumpster, and it was completely empty, which tells me that Republic was there sometime between closed last night and 5 o'clock this morning to pick up the trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7407.397s">They</a>  have already been cited.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7410.45s">It</a>  was between 3.30 and 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7411.971s">I</a>  heard it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7412.932s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7413.312s">You</a>  know, I can't even get up early enough to beat Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7415.834s">That's,</a>  that's something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7417.535s">I</a>  don't know how their drivers do that, but I, you know, I did my best 5 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7423.479s">So,</a>  um, we will continue to supply sufficient enforcement activities on Republic services for the after hours pickup, as well as on the Oasis Brazilian restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7435.887s">When</a>  I went this morning, there were some, um, violations of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7440.225s">food</a>  code and relevant to the trash that was collecting behind the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7446.328s">There</a>  were several bags of trash just sitting on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7449.43s">There</a>  was a five-gallon bucket about halfway full of grease from the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7453.372s">I</a>  mean, I was tearing open trash bags, looking at the trash to see where it could have come from, and I am 99 percent certain it came from that particular restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7463.557s">So</a>  we are working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7466.299s">We</a>  are on the case, and we'll continue to <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7470.788s">supply</a>  those enforcement efforts against Republican as well as and work with the Oasis Brazilian restaurant.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7477.812s">What</a>  is the regulation state as far as the pickup of the dumpsters? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7481.675s">When</a>  is it permitted?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7486.097s">This</a>  is the Medford Board of Health regulation number six, dumpster regulations and licensing of dumpsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7491.3s">It</a>  states 6.9, dumpster management. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7495.245s">One,</a>  no contractor shall remove dumpster contents prior to 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7500.166s">nor</a>  later than 8 o'clock p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7502.847s">And</a>  their cease and desist order that was served to Republic on January 26th states, you are hereby ordered to cease and desist operations within the city of Medford between the hours of 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7513.95s">and</a>  7 o'clock a.m.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7517.111s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7519.292s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7520.872s">Through</a>  you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7521.473s">Fowler,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7523.641s">A</a>  dumpster that is located on private property, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7526.702s">And</a>  licensed through the Board of Health?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7528.742s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7529.242s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7529.802s">So,</a>  um, who is responsible for getting the permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7533.263s">Would</a>  it be Republic or would it be the business owner? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7536.103s">The</a>  business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7537.144s">The</a>  business owner is responsible for getting the license for the permit?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7539.344s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7539.944s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7540.244s">So</a>  now the business owner has a permit and the business owner has contracted a contracted relationship with someone who's violating the terms of the permit on the dumpster.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7547.806s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7548.206s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7548.706s">And</a>  the, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7550.745s">result</a>  of the enforcement issue goes back to Republic, who is the provider, as opposed to the business owner, who is the permittee?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7563.514s">As</a>  far as the pickup times?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7565.556s">Well,</a>  you sent a cease and desist order to Republic.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7568.117s">Yes,</a>  about the pickup times.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7568.818s">And</a>  Republic is an organization that's contracted with Oasis. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7573.061s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7573.701s">So</a>  if Republic keeps coming at 5 o'clock in the morning, and even if you see them, what can you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7579.486s">Can</a>  you cite them? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7580.456s">They're</a>  not the permitted entity, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7581.937s">So</a>  who do you cite? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7582.898s">Is</a>  there any ramifications?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7584.299s">As</a>  far as I know, we're following up with Republic, yes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7587.862s">Okay,</a>  and is there a mechanism to find Republic? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7590.464s">Is</a>  there a mechanism to?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7592.206s">As</a>  far as I know, it is my understanding there is a mechanism to find them, yes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7595.568s">Okay,</a>  but at no point in time is Republic actually required to register their product in our community?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7601.273s">They</a>  have to register with the city of Medford as a licensed hauler, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7605.016s">As</a>  a licensed hauler. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7605.816s">Yes,</a>  and part of their cease and desist letter states</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7610.503s">It</a>  would jeopardize their other licenses.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7612.184s">Yes,</a>  it would jeopardize their haulers license.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7613.844s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7613.944s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7614.505s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7614.825s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7615.365s">I</a>  appreciate you clearing that up for me.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7617.006s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7617.366s">Chair</a>  recognizes council Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7619.147s">If</a>  I can, I just want, I know that with this situation, you are due diligence and going out there and, and, uh, picking through trash at five o'clock in the morning is, uh, is very impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7632.112s">And</a>  I appreciate that effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7633.912s">So</a>  again, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7637.894s">Do</a>  we have a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7639.315s">Madam</a>  vice president.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7640.393s">Just</a>  briefly through the chair, I also just want to thank you for coming and giving us an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7644.434s">It's</a>  more information and probably more enforcement than I've seen in a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7649.315s">So</a>  it's very appreciated.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7652.956s">We</a>  depend on the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7653.976s">I</a>  can't be everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7654.897s">I'm</a>  the only food inspector for over 300 licensed food establishments in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7659.738s">Plus,</a>  I do pools and spas and complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7661.898s">And</a>  I help with tanning inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7663.259s">So</a>  I'm stretched pretty thin. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7665.019s">So</a>  I appreciate Anne's tenacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7668.695s">keep</a>  me on the straight and narrow and helps me know who to keep an eye on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7672.236s">So</a>  I appreciate her efforts as well.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7675.037s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7676.717s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7678.718s">And</a>  there's one more citizen who wishes to speak behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7682.939s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7683.459s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7684.979s">My</a>  name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7687.88s">I'm</a>  a member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7689.001s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Lungelkorn for bringing this up, but more importantly, I'd like to thank the squeaky wheel of South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7694.692s">and</a>  threats, because she's been fighting this battle for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7697.799s">And</a>  for five years, as Councilor Caraviello said, some things have gotten better, some things have gotten worse, and some things haven't even been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7704.521s">But</a>  I want to pick up on the second part of your resolution, Councilor, where you indicate, and any other related issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7710.126s">In</a>  early spring of this past year, when the city had its street-sweeping program, the City of Medford engaged in the South Medford area, as well as other parts of the city, in a tag-and-toe process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7721.456s">And</a>  then on April 29th, this immediate April 29th, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7725.392s">the</a>  mayor of this community instructed the police department to stop tagging and towing as it relates to the street sweeping that was continuing on after that time to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7734.155s">Now,</a>  I don't know what the reason is for the stopping of the tagging and the towing, but anyone who got a ticket and was tagged and towed, as the gentleman who was here last week, they should get their money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7745.4s">Every</a>  single person in this city who's been tagged and towed should get their money back because the mayor abruptly stopped on April 29th</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7756.888s">former</a>  Councilman Penta bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7759.669s">One</a>  of the discussions this morning was the irate member of this community and what they are recommending is that they will bring that ticket to the City Hall and the talk is that they will be refunded if that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7773.938s">So</a>  I thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7775.739s">So</a>  I think that there were some mistakes and posting is one and I think that that's something that will be rectified. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7784.644s">Thank</a>  you for Mr. Lester. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7786.005s">who</a>  came about in front of us last week, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7788.447s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7789.128s">The</a>  issue revolves more than Mr. Lester. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7790.669s">It</a>  revolves around everyone else that received a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7793.932s">Subsequent</a>  to April 29th, on a Friday, when the Police Department was informed by the Mayor not to give out any more ticket and tags, the Police Department still went down the street with the bullhorn, telling people the streets were going to be sweeped, but nobody was ticketed and tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7807.042s">Now,</a>  prior to that, during the early spring sweep, people were tagged.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7811.586s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7814.658s">The</a>  gentleman made reference saying that the mayor told the police not to give any tickets out or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7818.401s">I</a>  was just wondering how he had personal knowledge of such a directive. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7821.264s">Sounds</a>  like hearsay to me, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7822.685s">It</a>  is, and I spoke to the police department personally, and the Councilor can check himself if he so chooses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7826.749s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7827.75s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, the police department's a building, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7830.932s">Well,</a>  you have your contacts over there, and anyone who wants to refute what I'm saying, I'd be more than happy to apologize, but I'm not apologizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7838.115s">The</a>  fact of the matter is it did happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7839.836s">We've</a>  had this discussion before as it relates to sweet streeping here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7844.998s">We</a>  have our tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7846.979s">You</a>  have your water and sewer tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7849.26s">Those</a>  go out, and whether you're the homeowner or the business owner or you're the renter, it's up to the person who owns the property <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7856.16s">to</a>  instruct the person who's either renting and the homeowner or the business person who's there in that particular street for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7863.747s">If</a>  it takes a year, and this is what we talked about almost four years ago, if it takes a year to get into a street signage program where all the streets in this community are signed and everybody becomes aware of it, we won't have to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7876.12s">posting</a>  papers on a tree, or stapling them on whatever you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7879.923s">You</a>  have many opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7881.605s">If</a>  you had public access here in this community, you'd be able to see it, but we don't have that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7885.789s">So</a>  what you have is— Point of information, Councilor Nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7888.691s">I</a>  don't know if I'm having deja vu, but this seems—sounds eerily familiar to the meeting we had last week and the same exact issues that we discussed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7895.978s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7897.019s">It</a>  may be the same issues, but still nothing seems to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7899.63s">And</a>  unfortunately, a whole host of individuals have been tagged and towed needlessly because, in fact, they may have changed their mind, maybe because of the complaints, and that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7909.256s">But</a>  if you don't have a stationary in-house program that's consistent, you can't pick on one week and then cancel it on another. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7917.06s">So</a>  I would recommend to anyone who received a ticket prior to April 29, was tagged and towed, go to City Hall and demand, because this administration stopped it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7927.426s">Can</a>  I finish, please, without you being so rude? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7930.267s">Is</a>  it possible that you can for once in your life just stand there and be decent when I'm at this podium? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7940.21s">That's</a>  my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7941.431s">I</a>  would hope the council in some shape, manner or form consults with the administration, asks them for the purposes of <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7948.247s">Let</a>  this year go by, it's a big mistake that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7951.528s">Why,</a>  in fact, they stopped on April 29th, why the police department no longer is tagging and towing for street sweeping, I don't know, but it's the mayor of this community right now that's done that, and anyone that's gotten the ticket prior to that, unfortunately, doesn't have any recourse unless they get some recourse from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7968.593s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7977.413s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7978.614s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7980.695s">I</a>  came out to support Anne and her efforts, but that's not the only corner in Medford that's got cars on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7987.659s">It</a>  seems to be the culture in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7990.561s">You</a>  go on C-Click Fix, and you'll see people posting police cars, other cars, every car is on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7998.566s">I</a>  live on Park Street where the Roberts School is, and we have some wonderful parents that do the Walking Wednesdays, which just began last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8005.556s">And</a>  the walking school bus walked up Park Street, and my daughter waited for the walking bus to come by. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8011.138s">And</a>  they all squeezed by the car that's on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8014.939s">I</a>  posted C-Click Fix a month ahead and said, you know, Walking Wednesdays are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8019.3s">Maybe</a>  this car could move. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8020.381s">It</a>  hasn't moved in two months. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8021.721s">Maybe</a>  they could drive around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8024.962s">Barry</a>  Clemente responded back, I'll drive by and see. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8028.763s">So</a>  he comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8030.604s">He</a>  radios in that he's coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8033.485s">They</a>  come. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8034.125s">They</a>  move the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8035.693s">He</a>  drives by, takes a picture, posts it, and says there's no car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8039.097s">Within</a>  an hour, the car is back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8040.938s">He</a>  doesn't come back for a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8042.18s">The</a>  car doesn't move for a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8043.761s">He</a>  radios in again. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8045.523s">Four</a>  times he did this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8046.644s">I</a>  said, maybe don't radio in and just go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8050.608s">So</a>  he did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8051.589s">He</a>  went. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8052.35s">He</a>  knocked on the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8053.791s">And</a>  someone came out, who I'm told works for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8056.833s">I</a>  can't verify that, and said, oh, my mother's elderly, and it's easier for her if we park on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8062.998s">But</a>  we'll leave enough room for a pedestrian to get by, a pedestrian.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8067.402s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8069.343s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8069.523s">Rodriguez</a>  was here before this Council, and this very same issue came up when we discussed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8073.046s">We</a>  sent the correspondence to the administration, and we asked the administration as to what the status was for that piece of property across the street from this house that she referred to.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8080.892s">No,</a>  not that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8082.675s">Not</a>  that side of the street, no.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8083.935s">It's</a>  a different side of the street.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8084.976s">This</a>  is the side of the street where the houses are on.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8087.256s">He</a>  already claimed that sidewalk.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8088.797s">Now</a>  he wants the other sidewalk.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8089.817s">It's</a>  the same people, different side of the street now.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8091.857s">But</a>  he's been parking on that sidewalk for five years.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8094.078s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8094.938s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8095.298s">So</a>  because we got report back that the side of the park side was actually a parking pad.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8100.86s">Which</a>  is a darn shame, because it broke the new street as they drive up onto the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8104.7s">I'm</a>  just telling you what it is.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8106.241s">Shame</a>  or not, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8107.781s">It's</a>  a parking pad. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8108.561s">But</a>  all right, I was a little confused about this.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8110.482s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8113.423s">Actually,</a>  Mayor McGlynn said that he didn't agree to that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8117.087s">The</a>  person that worked for the DPW said, let's just put this in at an angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8120.311s">And</a>  then they just claimed it because they had parked on that side of the street before and wished to continue to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8125.647s">There</a>  was no ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8126.988s">I</a>  don't remember an ordinance coming through and saying, hey, does everyone agree that we won't have a sidewalk? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8131.41s">Because</a>  I spent five years of my life meeting with the mayor, meeting with the DPW, meeting with the chief of police to have a path built so that people could walk on that side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8140.876s">They</a>  paved in the path in street material. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8144.738s">I</a>  don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8145.938s">And</a>  the very next day, those cars were parked on the path and the sidewalk because they wanted both. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8151.6s">Then</a>  I spent another year going back to have a fence put so we could have a path. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8156.081s">Now</a>  when they plow their parking platform, they put the snow on the path. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8161.063s">So</a>  someone, I don't think we need to wait for someone to get hit by a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8164.544s">I</a>  think we need to get the cars off the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8166.125s">I</a>  think it's basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8167.125s">The</a>  kindergartners walk by and they say, Mommy, why are there people parked on the sidewalk? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8171.792s">The</a>  mayor said, oh, this is terrible, and we'll take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8175.253s">The</a>  guy's still on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8176.473s">They</a>  told me they gave him an exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8178.814s">So</a>  now he has both sides of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8181.355s">So</a>  I'm going to park on the sidewalk in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8183.756s">I</a>  mean, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8185.416s">Because</a>  they said, because it's easier for his mom, that they can park on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8189.097s">I've</a>  never seen this woman get in the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8190.778s">I've</a>  always seen a younger person get in the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8194.319s">So</a>  before someone gets hurt, maybe you should not worry about <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8199.35s">paving</a>  or putting in paint on the ground if we can't get cars off the sidewalk.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8203.872s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8204.792s">And</a>  we're talking about self-metric public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8207.673s">And</a>  is there a motion on the floor yet?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8211.535s">Motion</a>  to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8212.776s">The</a>  subcommittee is already working on the issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8214.696s">On</a>  that motion, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8216.037s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8216.397s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8218.418s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8218.978s">Joe</a>  Villion, 59 Garfield Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8221.219s">Cars</a>  everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8221.959s">There</a>  were three trucks parked on Garfield Ave on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8225.961s">We're</a>  discussing the issues of self-metric? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8228.432s">South</a>  Medford, too, as I drive to my radio station and go through South Medford, all I see are cars on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8233.997s">It's</a>  insane.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8236.099s">On</a>  the motion to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8239.342s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8240.623s">If</a>  we could ask the chief of police, and I don't know if that's through Captain Daugherty or Sergeant Carroll, I believe you said, if we could get an update on what the city's policy is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8252.013s">Are</a>  we allowing certain areas to park on certain sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8255.777s">Or</a>  are we going to start enforcing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8258.639s">I</a>  mean, I think we need, if there's an ordinance, but why aren't we enforcing that ordinance is my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8264.262s">So</a>  it is related to South Medford, this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8268.424s">But</a>  I agree with Cheryl. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8269.425s">I</a>  mean, I drive down Park Street every day to drop off my child. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8272.907s">And</a>  there are a number of students who are walking to school, and there are cars parked on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8278.69s">I</a>  don't get as many complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8280.571s">So</a>  obviously, South Medford, I think I get a complaint every day on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8284.795s">from</a>  multiple people, but it's an issue throughout our community, and it's an issue where if we do get complaints, we need to do something, especially if we get complaints, we need to do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8295.683s">So</a>  by resolution, Madam Vice President, what would you like the resolution to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8299.927s">What</a>  is our policy with regards to enforcement of our ordinance with regards to parking on sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8305.471s">Is</a>  it uniform or are different areas treated differently?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8309.254s">So</a>  we have a motion to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8312.276s">Will</a>  that motion be removed?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8316.435s">And</a>  if I may, if I may.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8553.099s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8554.64s">After</a>  I spoke last week about a number of issues with regards to having a meeting with the group meeting with the mayor, one of the issues was related to, you know, school school issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8568.166s">Since</a>  I spoke, I've received a number of phone additional phone calls with regards to issues that may be going on in the school, whether or not <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8578.423s">There</a>  are more than one employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8580.043s">I</a>  am aware that there is an employee that is somewhat of a department head, although not working full time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8586.804s">I</a>  don't know the pay scale, because it almost seems like it's hidden somewhere in the budget, that is the head of a department and lives in Florida. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8595.426s">So</a>  it's of extreme concern to me that we have somebody on the payroll that is not currently in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8603.707s">And</a>  I'd like to know if there is more than one <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8607.323s">Obviously,</a>  I know it's going to be tough to get this information, but it's something that needs to be spoken about. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8612.366s">I</a>  got this from a very good source. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8614.168s">I</a>  don't think I've questioned a couple of school committee members on it, and they were unaware. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8619.491s">So</a>  if we could get an update with regards to anybody that lives out of state, I'm not talking if you're commuting from New Hampshire or Rhode Island, but when you're talking you live in Florida and are ahead of a department, there's a concern there, and we need <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8637.093s">as</a>  a community to get to the bottom of that because it's wrong.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8640.478s">Thank</a>  you Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8641.619s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8644.703s">I'm</a>  a firm believer that people who provide high quality public services and abide by the terms of their work contract have the right to live wherever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8654.728s">I</a>  think one thing that we're not thinking about here is the fact that people may claim permanent residency in one community and live there not six months out of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8662.194s">For</a>  example, I think we remember when Suzanne Bump was running for auditor and there became a question as to whether or not she had a primary residence in South Boston or a primary residence in Pittsfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8673.102s">On</a>  her tax returns, she put both. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8675.164s">She</a>  had two primary residences. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8679.033s">I</a>  don't know how the school committee would ever be able to quantify who lives in a place for up to 180 days, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8687.075s">Number</a>  two, I really don't understand the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8692.957s">I</a>  mean, you know, anybody that works for the school department is provided their benefits through the benefit packages provided as an employee, their salary through the contract that they've negotiated or through the bargaining agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8706.241s">Really,</a>  all we're looking at here is, who are these people that don't live in Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8711.083s">And</a>  whether or not we can determine whether or not they're residing in Massachusetts for more than six months of the year or not, I just don't see the relevance at all to how this is something that even makes any sense for us to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8725.649s">I</a>  mean, what are we going to use this information for? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8727.61s">I</a>  just don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8729.07s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8940.751s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8941.972s">This</a>  is an issue that has been brought up by a number of school committee members a number of times, and it's information that hasn't been given to the school committee for one reason or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8952.617s">So</a>  there are a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8958.931s">fees</a>  for service and for use of our facilities, especially in the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8964.214s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks brought up one at the beginning of tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8968.677s">There</a>  are tens of maybe a hundred organizations that use our facilities that pay a fee, whether that be to community schools or to the general fund of the schools, and the school committee is asking for information, and for some reason they're not being given this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8985.706s">I</a>  think this is pertinent to our budget hearings, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8988.382s">I</a>  would like to know, you know, this is one thing, one of the probably ten things that I'm going to ask for before I vote on the entire city budget because it's, we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars that we don't know what accounts they're going into, what they're being spent on, and how they're being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9005.369s">So</a>  it's very important information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9008.131s">It's</a>  going to decide, help me decide how to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9013.953s">go</a>  about looking at the budget and deciding on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9017.234s">And</a>  it's information that we in the school committee need to be able to take an educated vote on whether to approve or deny or ask for more information or to come up with better rules and regulation to manage this money and be more forthcoming with it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9038.746s">I</a>  certainly have no problem with the resolution, Mr. President, but I think that it needs to be a little clearer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9042.729s">I</a>  think we need to really delineate and designate what facilities it is that we're looking at here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9047.333s">Is</a>  it the Masha Cameron Theater? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9048.494s">Is</a>  it the field? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9049.115s">Is</a>  it Hormel? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9049.795s">Hormel</a>  doesn't fall under the school's purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9051.456s">Is</a>  it, you know, the side field? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9056.1s">Is</a>  it the gymnasium? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9057.461s">Is</a>  it the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9059.083s">Is</a>  it the community schools program? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9061.244s">What</a>  the community schools programs bring in? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9062.666s">I</a>  think we really need to be a little bit clearer as to what facilities we're <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9065.982s">looking</a>  at and what facilities we're trying to designate to get this information for, I think that that might make it a little easier for the administration to be a little bit more forthcoming with the information as well.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9074.689s">So</a>  should I take that as an amendment that asks for specific— Well, it's not my paper, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9079.653s">I'm</a>  not comfortable voting for the paper in its current form. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9082.335s">However,</a>  I didn't author the piece of legislation, so I'd ask for it to be amended or maybe move to committee for that to be delineated.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9089.281s">Madam</a>  Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9095.078s">We</a>  can start by asking for community schools, Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9102.679s">I</a>  mean, all school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9104.82s">It</a>  doesn't include Hormel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9105.82s">That's</a>  not a school facility.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9107.2s">All</a>  school facilities?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9109.1s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9110.081s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9110.381s">I</a>  mean, we're talking probably close to a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9114.261s">We</a>  need to know where this is going.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9115.422s">I</a>  just wanted to know which facility, because I don't want to get a feedback that says, OK, all school facilities were rented to these organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9122.243s">This</a>  is how much it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9131.228s">but</a>  facility is generating more money, how much we're getting from that particular entity.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9136.472s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9137.013s">Madam</a>  Vice President, are you all set?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9140.436s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9140.756s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9142.557s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9144.039s">If</a>  Councilor Lazzaro doesn't mind, if we could incorporate 16.475 into that same request, I think it's pretty much all relevant, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9155.989s">And</a>  476. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9156.429s">And</a>  476, what I say, I think they're all pretty relevant.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9159.511s">Can</a>  we do that, parliamentary? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9160.712s">Why</a>  don't we make those two as amendments to this and withdraw them? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9174.92s">You</a>  want to take them separately, madam? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9177.813s">So</a>  do we have, uh, we have council Scarpelli wishes to address us on this.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9182.155s">Again,</a>  I did talk to the, uh, uh, a few school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9186.077s">I,</a>  they had a subcommittee last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9188.538s">Um,</a>  I believe Monday at their regular meeting, uh, there'll be a, um, to help with some of these, these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9196.221s">at</a>  the regular meeting, that there'll be a detailed line item that shows which facility is self-sufficient, which facilities are in need of funding, because from what I hear, there are, and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9212.19s">So</a>  I believe the school committee has done their due diligence, and that's something that, with this subcommittee, will be out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9220.775s">And</a>  I appreciate Vice President Lungo-Koehn, but I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9226.052s">courses</a>  out of the barn and will be presented on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9230.396s">So</a>  we could follow up with that and then we can agree to our colleague and then get that report right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9237.222s">That'd</a>  be great for Tuesday.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9239.163s">If</a>  I, if I may point information on that, I, we must be talking to different Councilor, um, school committee people because, um, the few that I've talked to said they've asked for this information and for some reason are not, are not getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9251.774s">And</a>  it's been months. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9253.149s">So</a>  they're asking for help again. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9254.81s">Like</a>  I said last week, hopefully Monday, that would be great.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9257.612s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9258.092s">We</a>  could see Monday because the subcommittee members that were on that committee I talked to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9261.975s">So</a>  most of the table next meeting was on Monday.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9264.716s">If</a>  they don't have it on Monday, then we can take it up again on Tuesday.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9266.577s">Motion</a>  to table is before us, which is undebatable on that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9271.52s">All</a>  the better.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9272.141s">They're</a>  going to get it and have it ready on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9273.962s">Then</a>  why don't we, why can't we get a coffee? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9275.983s">This</a>  is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9278.064s">I'm</a>  opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9279.405s">I</a>  challenge, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9281.483s">The</a>  chair should be in doubt and take a roll call vote, please.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9283.945s">Roll</a>  call vote to table this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9285.806s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9289.048s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9289.389s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9289.609s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9289.709s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9289.969s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9305.104s">Five</a>  in the affirmative.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9306.905s">We</a>  should care where the council, we should care where probably a million dollars is going.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9311.509s">Next,</a>  16-473 offered by vice-president Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9320.916s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford city council be provided with the names of those who will be appointed to the veterans advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9330.003s">And</a>  I think councilor Cavill knows about that, but madam vice president,</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9334.042s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9335.183s">Yes,</a>  I'm just looking, there's a number of people that I know applied for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9338.984s">One</a>  or two have called, and they said the names have been picked, but they're not, you know, they have.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9343.987s">I</a>  have them if you'd like to.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9344.827s">You</a>  have the names, great.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9346.368s">We</a>  have our own, one of those collected was our own Gene Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9349.449s">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9353.531s">Mr.</a>  Matthew Wyants of 134 Auburn Street, he's been selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9360.654s">Dominic</a>  Dorsey. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9362.627s">48</a>  Suffolk Street has been appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9366.41s">And</a>  Michael Vecchia has been appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9373.655s">Lawrence</a>  Brown, 26 Florence Street has been appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9377.838s">And</a>  Dominic Marcellino has been appointed as an ad hoc member because he does not live in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9383.762s">So</a>  at the moment, I know the mayor had the option to choose up to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9388.693s">but</a>  these are the ones that she was chosen as of what I was given.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9395.156s">And</a>  through the chair, so it's gonna be a committee of five, or we're just not sure yet?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9400.559s">At</a>  the moment, this is the committee she's chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9402.4s">Like</a>  I say, she had the option to choose up to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9405.582s">I</a>  assumed that she chose not to choose 12.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9409.203s">But</a>  you don't know for sure if she's adding more people or?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9412.485s">I</a>  know there were other names. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9413.726s">I</a>  mean, I had submitted eight names myself, and only two of them were chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9418.765s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9419.125s">So,</a>  um, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9420.807s">Yeah,</a>  that's what I, they, people are calling and asking and they said the names, but it wasn't public.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9425.851s">This</a>  is the committee.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9808.765s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9809.045s">With</a>  a vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9815.081s">16-477</a>  offered by Councilor Marks be resolved that the Massachusetts water resource authority led service line replacement loan program for both private and public projects be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9826.607s">Did</a>  we not discuss this? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9827.787s">Not</a>  a week or two ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9828.787s">Councilor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9830.828s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9832.189s">Uh,</a>  no, we actually did not discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9834.15s">This</a>  is a relatively, uh, a new advisory board opinion that was just issued by the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9841.972s">A</a>  few weeks back, as many may be aware, I asked that the city look into the number of lead service lines in the city of Medford due to safety concerns, in particular for young children and infants that consume lead in their water. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9861.666s">And</a>  at the time I asked that the city do a complete accounting of the number of lines that exist in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9868.511s">I</a>  believe there are about 2,200 lines <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9871.433s">that</a>  currently exist, and I ask that the city not only do a complete and thorough audit, but also notify residents who may have a lead line to alert them of this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9885.202s">And</a>  I just received notice that the MWRA board, the advisory board, on April 21st approved a $100 million lead service line replacement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9898.271s">And</a>  this program will provide interest-free loans <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9901.578s">to</a>  rehabilitate or replace lead service lines for both the community-owned and privately-owned portions of local water systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9910.621s">The</a>  funding will become available FY17, and the community needs to acknowledge a number of things before they're eligible for this particular funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9922.044s">I'll</a>  just read off a couple, but this is actually 0% interest <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9928.163s">So</a>  if the city takes advantage of this, it's possible we could approach homeowners and say, we can get you the money, the 2,000 or 2,500 that's necessary to replace on the homeowner's side, their lead service line at zero interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9944.047s">And</a>  that's a big cost savings for people on tight budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9947.268s">So</a>  the components that are recommended by the MWRA that the city must acknowledge is the community will clearly establish that the goal is to fully remove <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9958.431s">all</a>  lead pipes from both publicly owned and privately owned water sewer line connections. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9963.714s">The</a>  lead removal program will include replacement of lead gooseneck connections when encountered during construction or targeted for replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9971.758s">The</a>  community will commit to a comprehensive lead service line inventory program, and that's what I spoke about a couple of weeks ago, Mr. President, to compile a listing of properties with a full or partial lead service line that will be made available for the public <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9986.156s">via</a>  webpage or other similar public access vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9990.058s">Um,</a>  the community will target proactive outreach to customers with lead service lines to provide educational information regarding the risk of lead exposure and information, encouraging customers to participate in community led service line replacement programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10005.027s">Uh,</a>  so that privately owned portion is replaced concurrent with publicly owned portions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10010.122s">and</a>  then it goes on to just mention about community outreach and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10014.005s">So</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that the city look into this MWRA advisory board replacement loan program and that you could also use some of the money to do a complete audit of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10031.637s">The</a>  reason why I brought this up is there was an article in the Globe, I don't know, about six, eight weeks ago, that referred to Medford having the second highest <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10039.605s">lead</a>  line connections in the MWRA district, which I believe is some 46 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10045.712s">And</a>  come to find out, the numbers that were reported are way off, needless to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10052.079s">And</a>  rather than having 3,500 connections or very close to that, we're close to the 2,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10057.044s">And</a>  no number is acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10060.534s">uh,</a>  we, we, by no stretch of the imagination have what was reported in the Boston Globe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10066.04s">So,</a>  uh, I just like to move approval that Mr. President, uh, to the, uh, city engineer and a response, whether or not the city will take advantage of this, uh, lead line replacement program.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10078.112s">Uh,</a>  thank you counsel for your vigilance in this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10081.235s">Uh,</a>  chair recognizes councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10129.427s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Mark, Senate by Councilor Scott Peli, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10135.09s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10135.711s">I</a>  think many of us are MWRA director last year on television, last night on Fox 25, where he was announcing the program in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10144.852s">And</a>  they were on some streets in Malden digging up, and he outlined the whole thing for the whole MWIR system. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10152.24s">So</a>  again, I commend Councilman Moxley for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10155.504s">And</a>  I commend MWIR Director Lasky for also instituting the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10161.97s">A</a>  great citizen in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10163.132s">A</a>  great citizen in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10164.533s">We're</a>  lucky to have him. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10166.115s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10166.867s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10167.748s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10169.008s">I'd</a>  just like to commend Councilor Marks for his efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10171.71s">He</a>  identified an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10172.811s">He</a>  brought the issue to everybody's attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10174.311s">He</a>  stayed on top of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10175.532s">He</a>  found a solution to the problem that was out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10177.633s">So</a>  for that, I thank him. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10179.074s">I</a>  think that this is some great stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10181.075s">And</a>  I just would wonder if there's an application deadline that needs to be met by the city.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10188.92s">Honestly,</a>  there's a lot of paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10190.341s">I</a>  didn't see a deadline, but the funds are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10194.687s">fiscal</a>  FY 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10195.868s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10197.049s">Uh,</a>  I didn't see any talk about a deadline.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10212.178s">It</a>  has my support on the motion for approval at council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10214.96s">Mark</a>  seconded by councilor Scott Feli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10216.661s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10217.762s">All</a>  those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10218.582s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10221.147s">1516-478</a>  offered by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10225.631s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council requests the Department of Public Works Department to paint the following crosswalks in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10235.938s">Crosswalk</a>  at the intersection of Hadley Place and Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10240.001s">Crosswalk</a>  at the intersection of Fulton Street and Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10244.084s">Crosswalk</a>  at the <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10245.75s">in</a>  front of the Brookline Bank on Salem Street, crosswalk in front of Sonny's Corner Variety on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10254.014s">Councilor</a>  Falco, you are gonna join Councilor Marks in finding every crosswalk in this city and separately moving their painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10266.24s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10268.861s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10269.701s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10271.805s">I,</a>  uh, I thank my colleague, uh, uh, Councilor Marks for bringing this up last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10276.166s">And,</a>  uh, actually, um, the reason why this actually came up is I was waiting for the bus to take the three 25 bus into town. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10283.328s">And,</a>  uh, it was actually at that intersection last Friday and, um, almost saw someone get hit by a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10289.37s">And,</a>  um, that intersection is really dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10292.631s">Um,</a>  and as I looked around, the crosswalks are all faded, so they really need to be repainted or relined or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10299.313s">But,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10300.979s">It's</a>  a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10301.46s">I</a>  mean, that intersection there, I see adults having a tough time crossing the street there in the morning, and when they get off the bus at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10309.526s">It's</a>  the last intersection before you get onto the off-ramp on 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10312.949s">So</a>  it really needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10314.15s">So</a>  I'd ask that that be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10315.651s">And</a>  since I've actually put this resolution out there, I got a call from a resident as well, or an email, about the, from the corner of Parris Street to the corner of Dudley.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10327.56s">So</a>  across Salem Street, if we could add that as well to the list, amending the repair of Paris and Dudley.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10334.322s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10334.763s">And</a>  if we could, um, if we could also look at around, uh, various neighborhood schools, not neighborhood schools, but at our various schools, we can take a look at the crosswalks in those areas as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10345.006s">The</a>  weather's nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10345.787s">People</a>  are walking and, uh, there's a lot of, uh, children walking to and from school that live close to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10351.669s">So</a>  if we could take a look at those crosswalks as well, um, I think, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10355.579s">uh,</a>  there'll be benefit to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10356.9s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10358.241s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10359.261s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could have been there to do all the side to all the, all the crosswalks in the city, I think they're all in need of repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10364.965s">Uh,</a>  so if council faculty is in mind that we amend that to do, to do all of them as amended by councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10370.308s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10370.748s">Nice.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10370.988s">Um,</a>  yes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10372.99s">Um,</a>  I certainly understand councilor Caraviello's position on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10376.092s">They</a>  should be painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10377.052s">So</a>  why aren't they painted? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10378.013s">Why</a>  are we picking one over the other? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10379.634s">They</a>  should all be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10380.954s">Um,</a>  however, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10382.205s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10382.385s">Rodriguez</a>  was up here a little earlier and she was speaking about the walking school bus and how groups of students will walk to school and they'll collect on their way to school at certain and different locations, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10391.935s">And</a>  I think it might make sense for us to maybe identify some safe routes to school for these individuals as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10397.896s">If</a>  right now we have some crosswalks that have faded out and there are individuals and groups that are meeting along a certain pathway or a certain route, maybe we prioritize those locations first so that these children that are walking to school and that are trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10414.008s">begin</a>  that whole process of walking to school again like I used to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10417.65s">You</a>  know, he's coming back and he's coming back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10419.751s">Maybe</a>  we can make sure it's a little safer for them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10421.992s">So,</a>  um, you know, I'm, I'm looking at it saying that there's a group that's already together that's coordinating this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10426.415s">They</a>  have pathways that they already take. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10428.576s">Um,</a>  it might be nice if they could provide us with that information or follow that information to the administration.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10432.939s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10435.28s">Chair</a>  recognizes.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10438.161s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10439.122s">I</a>  thank a Councilor Falco for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10442.544s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10443.249s">You</a>  know, Councilor Knight just brought up a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10446.43s">And,</a>  you know, why aren't they done? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10447.65s">We</a>  should be asking the question, why isn't it done citywide? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10450.751s">And</a>  I happen to ask that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10452.872s">I</a>  ask it every year, but I just asked it recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10456.213s">And</a>  I was told that the city contracts out for roughly 80% of the painting of crosswalks in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10465.595s">So</a>  80% is contracted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10467.776s">Over</a>  the last several years, contracted services, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10472.021s">have</a>  been on a decline in the budget, and we're at a point right now that our current contract does not call for the completion of the 80% that's required under the painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10486.831s">That's</a>  not an excuse, that's reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10489.753s">And</a>  we're in May now, we're five months into the year, and to have our crosswalks, as Councilor Falco mentioned, all faded. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10498.218s">I</a>  mean, you can add churches to the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10501.272s">senior</a>  housing, everywhere in the city, they're faded, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10506.493s">And,</a>  you know, the mayor recently entered into a complete streets with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10510.615s">And</a>  it was a great photo op. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10512.375s">And</a>  it sounds great when you read the brochure and there's money available. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10516.496s">But</a>  this is basic, basic city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10521.378s">We're</a>  not asking to move mountains. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10523.458s">We're</a>  asking to paint a simple crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10527.064s">That's</a>  all we're asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10528.844s">And</a>  the complete streets is great, and they should move forward with that, but I think it's a shame that basic city services, we have to stand up here week after week and do them one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10542.988s">That's</a>  not very productive, and it's not productive for the DPW who has to run out and do them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10548.61s">And</a>  if we don't have enough money in the contracted services for painting crosswalks, that should be brought to our attention <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10557.05s">immediately</a>  after 10 resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10559.811s">And</a>  we can move because at the end of the year, as we all know, we've been on this council for a number of years, there's millions of dollars in line item transfers, there's money in the budget that could be appropriated to do a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10573.193s">So,</a>  you know, I'm really tired of talking about this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10577.134s">I'm</a>  really fed up with talking about this basic, basic, you know, service and to use it as a PR to get press in the newspaper about, oh, look at what the city's doing now, complete streets, safe streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10592.618s">It's</a>  a lot of hogwash because we don't have complete streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10596.059s">We</a>  get complete messes throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10598.74s">That's</a>  what we have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10600.901s">And</a>  you can talk about the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10602.917s">Let's</a>  talk about the catch basins, the hundreds of catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10607.24s">I</a>  ask any of my colleagues to go up and down the street, not the manhole cover, which are in deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10612.964s">Check</a>  the catch basins that catch the groundwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10615.305s">And</a>  you'll see a majority of them on every street are sinking down, posing a real concern not only for drainage, but public safety concerns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10625.112s">That's</a>  one aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10626.013s">And</a>  the potholes is another aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10628.323s">So,</a>  you know, it's great to say that we're going to become this complete street with the state funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10634.388s">But,</a>  you know, that's a one-time fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10636.57s">And</a>  if the city doesn't create their own internal policy to deal with this year after year, Mr. President, we're going to be back, as we all mentioned about some of the other neglect issues, be back facing the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10649.561s">I've</a>  been on the council 14 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10651.963s">Every</a>  single year, we have to bring up this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10655.505s">Every</a>  single year, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10657.983s">Without</a>  a doubt, it comes up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10660.645s">And</a>  you would think as an administrator and someone that specially served on the council and heard these concerns, this would be one of the issues that you tackle. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10669.81s">And</a>  it's not a difficult issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10671.891s">It</a>  really, really isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10673.692s">You</a>  know, so I don't know what it's going to take, Mr. President, but I'm getting real frustrated talking about the same issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10680.036s">You're</a>  right, I'd rather focus my attention on things that we should be looking out of the box, things we should be discussing about improving this community <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10687.605s">and</a>  not basic amenities, basic city services that we're all paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10693.149s">And</a>  when you get a crosswalk done, oh, I want to thank the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10696.531s">I</a>  want to thank DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10697.932s">We</a>  shouldn't have to go through that list of thank yous. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10700.654s">This</a>  is a service that should be done without fail every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10705.077s">Out</a>  feel, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10706.398s">So</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10707.699s">I</a>  don't know what it's going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10709.185s">a</a>  few more fatalities in the community, and then someone in the administration will finally wake up and say, oh, we need to do a better job about making sure that our crosswalks are visible, making sure there's proper signage, making sure that we abide by some of the safety rules that are laid out by many other communities when it comes to traffic calming approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10731.316s">You</a>  know, there's so many things that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10733.117s">Someone</a>  recently sent me, as I spoke about the 3D markings that some communities are doing in the road where cars are speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10742.442s">They're</a>  able to paint where it's a flat surface, but they make it look like it's elevated through a form of the way it's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10749.926s">And</a>  it looks like a 3D obstruction in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10753.208s">And</a>  it makes cars slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10755.009s">And</a>  it's really a great way of controlling speeding at a very minimal cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10761.153s">And,</a>  you know, we don't have to create the wheel, but, you know, we still have two raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10768.239s">Remember</a>  the pilot program? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10770.321s">It</a>  called for three. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10771.742s">We</a>  have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10773.003s">I</a>  think that was two years ago.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10774.604s">It's</a>  kind of smushed out.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10776.225s">We</a>  haven't we haven't implemented the other two, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10779.528s">It's</a>  similar to the citywide streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10781.73s">We've</a>  a pilot program where we don't sweep off our streets now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10786.073s">Look</a>  at any major thoroughfares. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10787.895s">The</a>  cars that are parked overnight aren't being towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10790.836s">and</a>  they're not sweeping appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10792.998s">And</a>  there's no secret to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10794.218s">So,</a>  um, you know, here we go again with a pilot programs that really mean nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10800.923s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10801.403s">Motion</a>  for approval by council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10803.185s">Falco</a>  has amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10804.125s">Mr.</a>  Citizen, you wish to speak on this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10808.328s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10808.749s">Please</a>  take your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10812.571s">No,</a>  we're talking about the crosswalks.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10815.493s">Andrew</a>  Carson at a cushion street method. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10818.175s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10818.636s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10822.126s">You</a>  saw like a broken record and you're doing a good job because it's an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10827.61s">You</a>  would think in a city like this we could have nice and bright on these crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10834.375s">Maybe</a>  the 3D hologram effect might be a good way to do it and maybe the color could be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10844.283s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10845.124s">Instead</a>  of the whites. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10847.502s">and</a>  maybe make it yellow if that's allowed legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10851.906s">And</a>  maybe we should check out the paint manufacturer and make sure that the paint they've been using is not a defective batch number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10859.634s">Something</a>  is amiss. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10860.915s">They</a>  shouldn't be fading so quickly, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10864.139s">And</a>  with less rock salt being used this past winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10871.351s">I</a>  don't know, maybe it should be just as bright as the front of the vinyl LP Abbey Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10877.295s">Good</a>  luck, people.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10878.616s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10879.076s">A</a>  motion for approval by Councilor Falco as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10881.618s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10882.378s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10885.18s">16-483</a>  offered by Councilor Cavill will be resolved at the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10888.863s">Commend</a>  and congratulate Sophie Santoro on the celebration of her 90th birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10895.807s">Councilor.</a> </p>
