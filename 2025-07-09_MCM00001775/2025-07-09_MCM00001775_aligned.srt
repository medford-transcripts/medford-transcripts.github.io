1
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:02,353
8.25, 6.30 p.m.

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:03,314
to 8.00 p.m.

3
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:13,704
We are in room 201, Brick City Hall, and meeting hybridly with many of our members on Zoom.

4
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:15,866
So let's take the roll.

5
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:17,427
Oh, sure.

6
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,268
Do we always do that?

7
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:18,948
We're supposed to.

8
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:41,447
So I have a couple members of the public in here.

9
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:42,887
Okay.

10
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:45,949
So, um, I have a reg.

11
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,090
Adam Doug.

12
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:50,911
Yeah.

13
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,432
Jeremy here.

14
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,973
Joe here.

15
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:57,133
All right.

16
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:00,355
Here, just moving to the room with air conditioning.

17
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:02,525
All right.

18
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:03,806
And did I get everyone?

19
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:05,146
And myself.

20
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:05,146
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

21
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:11,087
Okay.

22
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:12,987
All right.

23
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:14,728
So got that out of the way.

24
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:23,529
We will first item on the agenda is to revisit the off-cycle application from the Medford Armory emergency building restoration.

25
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:27,470
So thank you for coming back again for a second time.

26
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,772
with more clarification on your application.

27
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:38,978
So I would invite you to share with us what you have filled in since the last time you were here.

28
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,180
Okay, sure.

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:47,105
First of all, I did contact the unit owner that has the water seepage coming in.

30
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:51,529
He did apply to his insurance company, because I remember you asked that question.

31
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:53,410
They denied him.

32
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:56,353
And then we went to our master policy

33
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:03,129
And we were also denied because they said the word seepage is a no-no.

34
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:13,311
And unless it's within 14 days of the original water coming in, that it would not be covered.

35
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:16,812
So we did go back to JMS.

36
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:20,793
We kind of fine-tuned their contract.

37
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:25,594
We got information regarding their scope of work and also

38
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:32,548
They did give us the pictures and the information regarding historic buildings that they have done.

39
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:42,353
We've also had several good discussions about bringing in some type of community opportunity to the building.

40
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:53,740
We discussed possibly doing a veterans, at least twice a year, bringing in veterans and doing a meeting and coffee and everything, because it was

41
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,491
originally, you know, an army facility.

42
00:02:57,551 --> 00:03:00,012
We thought that that would be a really good thing.

43
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:10,577
And also, too, we looked into possibly like a Christmas jingle bells theme lighting up the outside front of the building.

44
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:12,838
So that's where we are now.

45
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:18,994
So we have that space, that lobby space, which is very nice, which could accommodate meetings and things like that.

46
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:23,036
So we thought that was a good idea, especially geared toward the veterans, because we are an armory.

47
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:26,478
It seemed like it made for a nice fit.

48
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:38,843
And just to add on top of that, just the veterans piece, speaking as city staff, the veterans office has been engaging in monthly coffee and cookies with veterans at various spots around the city.

49
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:42,205
They want to be going to different places so that they can reach everybody.

50
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,412
I just wanted to add that color to the comments.

51
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,893
Yeah, so we looked into that too.

52
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:49,614
I appreciate that.

53
00:03:52,035 --> 00:04:09,922
So one of the things that had been outstanding previously was to have a better understanding of the budget, of exactly what was the short-term emergency ask, and the bigger picture of how much work you're doing and what the

54
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:17,095
what the Condo Association is putting toward the total package of work that needs to be done.

55
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:17,956
Correct.

56
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:30,745
So as the emergency, we did start out with a much lower bid, but it was only to do an area of, say, 14 feet of the building.

57
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:39,432
When we went back to the other contractors, everybody seemed to be in agreement that you can't just do, like, from this window to this window.

58
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:42,112
because water up above could move.

59
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:51,914
So then it was thought that the best way to handle this and make sure the issue was alleviated was to do one third of the building.

60
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:56,455
And that was considered the emergency, which was their quote for the 616.

61
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:08,037
Out of that, we have already determined that the other 50% would come from the unit owners and the specialists.

62
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:17,751
and give them three months to pay that, because I don't believe any work would be starting until September.

63
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,373
I mean, we're going to be into August before we know it.

64
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:31,861
So based on that and that amount of money, and there's 32 units, people do own more than one unit.

65
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:37,205
So I would say I'll estimate 30 units altogether.

66
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:42,771
And based on their square footage, they will be assessed for that portion.

67
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:52,754
If we have an issue with somebody paying a special assessment, because some unit owners have very small units, maybe 600, 700 square feet.

68
00:05:52,814 --> 00:06:03,897
And if it was an issue, then we also have a reserve and an equity line that we could dip into for what they can't pay.

69
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:06,258
But we definitely want to move forward right away.

70
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:07,678
I appreciate that.

71
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:13,601
So if I read the budget correctly, the ask of the CPA today is $37,280?

72
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:14,702
Correct.

73
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:15,563
All right.

74
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,145
Thank you.

75
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:20,966
Are there questions from committee members?

76
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:31,293
Just one question.

77
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:33,575
We were talking before the meeting started about the

78
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:36,989
the repointing of the brick and granite.

79
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:45,714
I just paged through the documents that describe the detail of what's going to be done, but I didn't see any reference.

80
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:49,416
They mentioned what type of mortar, how they're going to cut it, et cetera.

81
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:58,060
But they don't mention anything about the historic color or shape of that joint.

82
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,421
Some joints are like convex, some are angles.

83
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:12,907
There's something that Soca Tech as a historic architect should know what that original joint would have been for a building of this more than 120 years old.

84
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:22,252
It's a small detail, but before you do it, I think it just began to be consistent with the standards that we need to follow, the federal standards.

85
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:25,734
We just make sure that detail needs to be there for,

86
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:34,015
knowing what the correct color and the right mixes and the right shape of that, whatever that joint is.

87
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:39,557
And maybe historic photos will tell them, but usually it's a database.

88
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:42,497
They should know that as historical architects.

89
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:43,577
Okay.

90
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:52,259
And I know he did mention that any bricks that needed to be replaced are going to be matched as close as possible.

91
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:57,436
But you're right, he did not mention, you know, the water, the mix.

92
00:07:57,556 --> 00:08:01,038
He did mention the type they were going to use and everything, but.

93
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:01,758
Yeah.

94
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:06,681
It's listed in the color and the mix, but I just can't tell if it's a historic one or not because it's not the history.

95
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,663
The historic nature is not listed there in the details.

96
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:10,724
Okay.

97
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:12,224
Oh, I got that.

98
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,065
Good point.

99
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:13,245
Okay.

100
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,026
Thank you.

101
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:18,431
I really appreciate, Doug, you providing that input.

102
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:23,615
That's why we have a member of the Historical Commission serving on the CPC.

103
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:40,450
In the community where I work, in Somerville, they actually require all historic projects to go to the Historical Commission as a whole board before they can receive CPA funding.

104
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:53,081
so that they can get that kind of input, that kind of direction to make sure that they're following the guidelines for historic preservation.

105
00:08:53,681 --> 00:09:10,828
So that's really, I think, really important information to make sure that you, and perhaps if there's any question, you might be able to ask members of the Historical Commission for further guidance

106
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:39,162
as um yeah as needed as um uh just to for um advisory comments no it's a great point something i'm happy to facilitate too so i talk with his i talk with ryan hayward at the commission every day okay good have a meeting scheduled with the contract the next

107
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:41,304
Tuesday, Wednesday?

108
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:42,464
Wednesday, the 17th.

109
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:49,406
To kind of go over the final details and kind of lock things into place, contracts, things like that.

110
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:52,446
So if we have questions, we'll reach out.

111
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:55,507
That's good.

112
00:09:57,968 --> 00:10:07,330
Something that I wish that I had the forethought to bring in hand to the meeting would be a suggestion.

113
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,710
So I really appreciate the

114
00:10:09,903 --> 00:10:14,506
ideas that you brought up for community, like allowing for community access.

115
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:21,790
And I would love to be able to suggest that if the CPC recommends funding, we could attach a condition.

116
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,651
And now I need to, did we?

117
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:26,812
Absolutely.

118
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:27,753
Yeah.

119
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:31,015
Set up on the screen right now, would you like me to share it with everybody?

120
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:34,857
Sure, that would be helpful because then we could wordsmith it together.

121
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:38,293
Oh, that's, yeah.

122
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:39,454
Thank you so much for that.

123
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:57,768
I try to be.

124
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:04,553
I'm working without a mouse right now, so please forgive me if I'm a little clunky on that computer today.

125
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:06,995
I'd like to see more of what that little thing has.

126
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,177
Oh, I don't know what to say.

127
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:11,077
I hope it was okay.

128
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:15,198
So this was the condition, right?

129
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:24,680
The applicant will work with the Community Preservation Act manager to coordinate up to two public events, which the project building at 925th Street will be open to the public, these events.

130
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,280
Up to two public events ever or annually?

131
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:34,122
What do you think?

132
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:36,562
I would like to see annually.

133
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:40,513
In perpetuity or?

134
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:46,074
So I, it's like perpetuity is very strong language.

135
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:47,295
Yes.

136
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:47,355
So.

137
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:51,535
And Joan has her hand raised.

138
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:53,676
Joan, while we think about that.

139
00:11:53,716 --> 00:12:03,337
I'm sure that if Doug wanted to add a condition related to his comment, it can be general, not specific.

140
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:07,338
Is that maybe perhaps encompassed in his first condition here?

141
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,321
It does have sections speaking to masonry joinery or something.

142
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:29,886
It is, but also it might like a little bit more specificity might help to ensure that it's like technically understood.

143
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,142
Very good.

144
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:41,862
Thank you.

145
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:48,047
I'm going to finish my thought on the rest of that.

146
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:55,473
Restored into historically accurate.

147
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:56,434
That's not a word.

148
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:11,337
It's always really fun when you're typing on the fly and everybody's watching and it's being recorded.

149
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:12,357
Great job.

150
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:14,637
I'm happy to amend that.

151
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:19,779
I got the word proper and then I think it isn't redundant.

152
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:23,980
We were largely talking about the mortar.

153
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,901
Was there anything else besides the mortar we're talking about?

154
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:28,101
Oh, sorry.

155
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:30,582
In my head, I was thinking mortar.

156
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:40,183
make that an extra service profile of the worker and the workers.

157
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:45,325
How do you feel about that, Doug?

158
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:51,587
I would just add in color as well, materials, profile, and color.

159
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:52,367
Okay.

160
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:54,728
I can do that.

161
00:13:57,969 --> 00:13:58,549
That's good.

162
00:13:59,689 --> 00:13:59,829
Okay.

163
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,490
Let's back to this one.

164
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,332
Annually.

165
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:13,355
When we say up to two, do we mean at least one?

166
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,616
To put an upper limit on.

167
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:16,516
Thank you.

168
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:20,818
We could say one to two.

169
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:25,440
One, two.

170
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:30,702
Public events annually.

171
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:35,441
Live ears or what are you putting as the limit on this?

172
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:53,597
So actually, I'm so I'm thinking, I don't know if this goes in the conditions of approval, but I would like to amend or create general conditions for all of our grants that require that.

173
00:14:55,646 --> 00:15:07,031
there not be changes to the work that's done for a period of years that is commensurate with the object that's being, the asset that's being approved.

174
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:19,757
In this case, say 30 years is a reasonable amount of time to require that the asset not be changed.

175
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:23,959
Or, and then perhaps to have a step down of

176
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:31,680
If it's changed within 10 years, some percent has to be paid back.

177
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,202
15 or 20 years, some percent has to be paid back.

178
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,604
Up to after 30 years, it doesn't have to be repaid.

179
00:15:40,184 --> 00:15:52,349
So if we were to envision a timeline on this that is pegged to the timeframe in which we are asking for the

180
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:55,852
asset to be preserved.

181
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:09,756
Do committee members have a feeling about what a timeline would be reasonable to ask for one or two annual events?

182
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:17,738
I'd like to go back to the conversation about in perpetuity.

183
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:21,138
I wonder if that can be caveated with

184
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:32,141
reconsideration at a certain time frame, rather than limiting the requirement to only a set number of years.

185
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:35,643
You know, in my experience, when you're trying to

186
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:44,890
I appreciate what the applicant is doing to offer these public engagement opportunities, but I feel like we're stretching to make it work.

187
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,570
And those are the hardest ones to sustain.

188
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:53,092
So I think putting some emphasis on sustaining that public engagement has value.

189
00:16:55,012 --> 00:17:06,635
So I'd ask that we consider a condition that requires this annually, but that it could be, that could be revisited in 10 years or something like that, or five years, whatever the group.

190
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:08,964
I thought was reasonable.

191
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:15,827
Well, I'm also just thinking about the fact that it's like a bunch of condo owners that might be different.

192
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:16,427
Yes.

193
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:22,989
Like 10 years from now that might have, I mean, the building is going to be the same, but like they might not agree to that.

194
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:23,749
Yeah.

195
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:24,790
So yeah.

196
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,471
Although they, um, you know, like this is actually,

197
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:37,747
Because I had a project like this in Somerville that really became extremely difficult when we got down to this level of detail.

198
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:42,530
And so, yeah, this is really where the meat of it is.

199
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,412
So for one thing, I think 30 years is the longest that you can have

200
00:17:53,863 --> 00:18:02,905
a stipulation in a contract that doesn't require state approval to override.

201
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:17,229
Like, for example, if you want to have a preservation restriction, after 30 years or in perpetuity, you have to have the state as a partner to that, but up to 30 years.

202
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:25,002
It could just be the city of preservation restriction could be something that we ask for here, but.

203
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:39,067
And I, that is something that I suggested asking for, and some of our previous projects, and we have asked for that and I'm starting to, like, based on my experience with a lot of projects that I've been involved with.

204
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:50,255
starting to think that something smaller scale and more fine-tuned is a better ask than a permanent preservation restriction in every case.

205
00:18:50,975 --> 00:19:06,338
So that's why I was suggesting earlier that we might incorporate a requirement for like a clawback up to 30 years if something is changed, and that could be applicable to

206
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:11,002
any kind of project, not just a historic preservation project.

207
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:13,703
Did you have something you wanted to say, Reg?

208
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:19,227
With all due respect, we're only asking for $37,000 to repair.

209
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:32,995
So I'm thinking a 30-year commitment from the applicant is a little bit on the steep side, in my estimation.

210
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:35,357
I'm thinking maybe a 10-year.

211
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:42,460
Um, commitment might be a little bit more applicable in this case, since they're only asking for repairs.

212
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,802
That's just my thoughts on the matter.

213
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:47,444
Thank you.

214
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:48,404
Jerry.

215
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:55,929
On that point, and I'm sorry, this was mentioned earlier, but the project's planned in 3 phases.

216
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:04,575
Does the applicant intend to anticipate that they'll come back to the CPC for more funding for those future phases?

217
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:15,096
We may, we may, depending, you know, basically on how this goes and how the repair goes moving forward.

218
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:33,306
We had discussed it with Teresa from the beginning for, you know, a larger scale for the full project, but then decided we would be better served to scale it down and go with what is definitely an emergency

219
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,863
At this point, that needs to be done.

220
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:45,045
Future funding, we were looking at a four to five year project to get the entire building done.

221
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:53,468
And I know you were talking about, you know, the length of time, and a lot, I was in the mortgage industry for many years.

222
00:20:54,048 --> 00:21:01,651
Anybody that got any type of funding from city, town, whatever, they would put a 10 year moratorium to say, okay,

223
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,665
you know, we're going to give you this money.

224
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:13,947
And then, you know, if things change, and you don't go by our contract, then you have to pay back.

225
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:14,328
Yeah.

226
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:18,909
Otherwise, you know, moving forward after 10 years, it goes away.

227
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:20,089
Yeah.

228
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:20,970
So that's consistent.

229
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,831
It might be something we could do like, I mean, I think we're amenable to a 10 year period.

230
00:21:25,971 --> 00:21:28,692
But it'd be something that we could revisit if we do come back.

231
00:21:28,832 --> 00:21:28,972
Yeah.

232
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:36,417
And I appreciate also to Reg's point that for this amount of money, we asked for 10 years.

233
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:48,566
And if you come back next year or two years, then an additional amount of money might come with an additional block of time that we're committing to public.

234
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:53,170
So that gives some room for growth on both sides.

235
00:21:56,754 --> 00:22:09,499
And to your question about what to do about the condo owners who are, you know, our future condo owners have the opportunity to agree to the terms that we're agreeing to right now.

236
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:22,325
And, you know, if we were to put a restriction in place, we would be filing an instrument at the Registry of Deeds, and that would be attached to the deed.

237
00:22:23,332 --> 00:22:48,957
This is not a document that's going to be filed at the registry, but if it were helpful to create a lien or something that can be reported so that future condo buyers see that this requirement is attached to the deed,

238
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,210
I don't, I don't know.

239
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,871
You can tell me if you think that that would be helpful.

240
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:59,955
So we've gone back and forth and I have got counsel with regards to the bylaws of the association.

241
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:00,655
Okay.

242
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:08,978
And as trustees, the trustees make all the decisions and the unit owners have to abide by it.

243
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:10,179
The trustees can say,

244
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:12,519
We want a million dollars.

245
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:22,353
Yeah, they have to come up, you know, so it kind of it gives us as trustees a little more ability to do something like this.

246
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:22,934
Okay.

247
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:25,118
So this I think this, I mean, this would be binding.

248
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:30,632
on us as the board of trustees, which will then make it binding on our unit owners.

249
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:38,894
So if we get voted out, this new board of trustees is still bound by the same condition.

250
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:45,596
It would be recorded somewhere in your guidelines, your judgment.

251
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:46,776
Okay, that makes sense.

252
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:46,916
Joan?

253
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,296
Through the chair, I have a question for Doug.

254
00:23:53,956 --> 00:24:05,460
I mean, if this building is already on, like, a historic register, whether it's Medford's or the state's, there are some conditions or requirements around changing this building anyway, right?

255
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:14,023
So they would have to get permission from some other entity if they were trying to make a change that would affect this restoration.

256
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:15,444
Is that true?

257
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:38,780
Right, so basically either commission or the state must have some say in any changes to a building that's deemed historically significant or preferably preserved, right?

258
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,382
So it's not just this condition.

259
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:54,127
It would be a higher thing to get over in order to make changes to this building that would affect the restoration that's being contemplated here.

260
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:54,968
Is that right?

261
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:56,680
I think it is.

262
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,840
I'll give you an example.

263
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,542
If the windows were all replaced, we did this with Chevalier.

264
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:04,624
Chevalier had to deal with their historic windows.

265
00:25:04,684 --> 00:25:10,767
It's a newer building than this is, but only by about a couple of decades, I think.

266
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:18,591
Yes, there are definitely other entities, but everything that we're seeing here, it's restoration.

267
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,201
of what's there.

268
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:21,602
We're not changing any fabric.

269
00:25:22,763 --> 00:25:25,746
We're not really doing anything.

270
00:25:25,906 --> 00:25:26,867
It's more than maintenance.

271
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:27,808
It's restoration.

272
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:35,676
That's why the mortar is what it is, not what's off the shelf right now that you would buy in any mason.

273
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:43,083
You've got a mason that has an architect who has historic qualifications, which is important.

274
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:44,782
and a requirement.

275
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:48,384
But I kind of agree with what Roberta said earlier.

276
00:25:48,404 --> 00:25:57,528
It wouldn't be a bad idea to get Ryan Hayward involved, who actually designs a lot of historic buildings and renovates a lot of historic buildings.

277
00:25:57,548 --> 00:25:59,569
He's the co-chair of the commission.

278
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:03,371
He works a lot with Teresa and the city.

279
00:26:04,451 --> 00:26:08,793
And he's definitely one of the most knowledgeable people in the city of Medford for historic resources.

280
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:13,195
So I think we have a meeting.

281
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:27,281
And next week, you know, we could easily, I think, probably shoehorn you in if I can get, if I can talk to them on the agenda, if we wanted to, you know, keep this process moving as quickly as possible, which I know is important.

282
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:34,226
And we can get some answers by then from Soca Tech and a few details on the mortar.

283
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:39,370
I think, you know, a 15-minute conversation with the commission would go a long way, I think.

284
00:26:43,442 --> 00:26:47,965
So I wanted to also respond to Joan's question.

285
00:26:47,985 --> 00:27:05,276
I don't know if Doug heard the entire question, but you asked if being on the historic register offers a level of protection and review from some other historic preservation entity.

286
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:11,120
And being listed on the register does not offer any such protection.

287
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:36,415
If the building were in a local historic district, or if it had a preservation restriction, then some other entity, our local historic district commission would have say over, like, would have to review the project and say, you know, whether they approved of the of the changes to the building.

288
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:49,401
But in this case, that isn't cast in stone, but as Doug offered, they could do it as an advisory review, not a required review.

289
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:52,022
Yeah, I agree with that.

290
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:53,623
You're right, Roberta.

291
00:27:53,803 --> 00:28:02,527
When I found out that there's 31 buildings in Medford, I think, that are on the National Register, but the protection is not as robust as I thought it was.

292
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:04,719
when you get down to brass tacks.

293
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:12,346
I mean, the historic commission, if somebody tried to make a change to the face of one of those buildings, we would have control of that.

294
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:21,114
But it's remarkably little protection, given you think that a state and national register declaration would mean something more.

295
00:28:21,174 --> 00:28:23,696
But in the real world, it doesn't.

296
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:43,916
Any further questions or discussion about this request?

297
00:28:48,879 --> 00:29:05,108
Would anyone from the committee like to move to recommend funding for this project, applying the conditions of approval as presented on the screen?

298
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:06,996
And the amount of funding would be $37,280.

299
00:29:07,056 --> 00:29:08,057
There's $38,000 listed on here.

300
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:10,559
So it looks like Teresa might have rounded up.

301
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:10,759
I did.

302
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:10,759
$37,000.

303
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:12,700
Oh, thank you.

304
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,341
That looks better.

305
00:29:34,376 --> 00:29:36,237
And I'll second Reg's move.

306
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:38,538
All right.

307
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:40,198
And I will call the roll.

308
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:41,299
Maisha?

309
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,141
I didn't hear what you said.

310
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:50,622
Oh, yeah, I can't hear you.

311
00:29:51,502 --> 00:29:52,383
I'll come back to you.

312
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,043
You can.

313
00:29:54,604 --> 00:29:54,964
Reg?

314
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:55,644
Yes.

315
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:56,324
Ada?

316
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:56,724
Yes.

317
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:57,405
Doug?

318
00:29:58,285 --> 00:29:58,585
Yes.

319
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:00,066
Jeremy?

320
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:01,046
Yes.

321
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:02,306
Joan?

322
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:03,427
Yes.

323
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:04,766
Ari?

324
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:06,007
Yes.

325
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,029
Aisha?

326
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,570
Yes.

327
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:11,792
Yeah, me too.

328
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:13,753
And myself, yes.

329
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:14,894
Thank you.

330
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:16,516
Excellent.

331
00:30:16,936 --> 00:30:17,396
Thank you.

332
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:18,657
Thank you very much.

333
00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:26,430
A little stressful for me, because it first time and not knowing what to do or expect, but thank you very much.

334
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,450
It's a new one for us, too.

335
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,791
So, yeah, thank you for being with us while we work out how it works.

336
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:35,112
It's a good learning process for everyone.

337
00:30:35,372 --> 00:30:35,652
Good.

338
00:30:35,672 --> 00:30:36,472
Especially for us.

339
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:36,992
OK.

340
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:37,872
Thank you.

341
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:39,552
Sasha.

342
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:41,713
We just also want to lend our thanks.

343
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:45,613
This is Sasha and Marnie, trustee and co-owner here, too.

344
00:30:45,713 --> 00:30:46,493
Thank you, everybody.

345
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,654
Thank you, Sasha.

346
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:49,354
Thank you, Marnie.

347
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:59,249
I'll reach out to you tomorrow.

348
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:03,873
Thank you very much.

349
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:06,515
We switched over a couple of years ago.

350
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:11,459
We deal with a local agent, Bates Insurance in Medford.

351
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:13,180
They've been here forever.

352
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:18,805
Arcadia, I believe, is the insurance company that insures us.

353
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:25,444
And we did actually, do you do insurance?

354
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:26,645
Not anymore.

355
00:31:27,425 --> 00:31:29,046
Not anymore.

356
00:31:29,526 --> 00:31:29,886
Okay.

357
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:35,508
Thank you again very much and we will leave you to carry on.

358
00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:37,269
Thank you very much.

359
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:39,130
Good luck with your project.

360
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,190
Thank you.

361
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:41,231
Thanks.

362
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:43,292
Thanks for supporting me.

363
00:31:43,412 --> 00:31:44,232
Of course.

364
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:47,053
The lights will come on, I promise.

365
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:51,830
I have a thought about just this process.

366
00:31:52,351 --> 00:31:58,814
It seems like part of the hangup is that they are a historical building, however, they are not a public building.

367
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:08,979
And I wonder if coming out of this, we might just have a set of things we tell someone who's applying in that situation.

368
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:10,200
I would love that.

369
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,422
It's obviously different if it's a public building.

370
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:21,756
But in this, like if we are just going to be funding projects in private buildings like this, then like maybe we should have like specific criteria.

371
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:26,658
And it's like, are you willing to do these things as almost like a point of entry to even come here in the first place?

372
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,939
You know what I mean?

373
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,640
I totally agree.

374
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:43,545
I'm actually, I just put out an RFP in Somerville to hire a consultant to help us draft those guidelines because it is like every project becomes so complicated.

375
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:43,785
Yeah.

376
00:32:44,621 --> 00:33:01,015
And I think because we've already done it this way for so long, it's hard to change to something else without really documenting how you got there and why you're making that change.

377
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:04,458
This one was difficult.

378
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:09,663
This one was difficult because it became not only a public building, but a historical

379
00:33:12,606 --> 00:33:20,292
building, which has its own set of rules and guidelines and processes and so on and so forth.

380
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:27,898
I mean, Doug probably can speak to that, obviously, better than any of us are on the meeting.

381
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:31,421
But that makes it very, very unique.

382
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:32,362
Yeah.

383
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:32,822
OK.

384
00:33:32,882 --> 00:33:36,766
And once you have something unique, and quite frankly, to me, it's new.

385
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,368
I don't know if you've ever done anything like this before.

386
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:54,825
We had an application very similar to this in Somerville last year that was for residential condos for a building that was originally built by the city and converted to condos.

387
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:59,566
And honestly, the application fell apart in the end.

388
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:09,350
The committee spent several meetings trying to put together a set of conditions, and ultimately the condo association said, no, we can't abide by those conditions.

389
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:14,906
And that's why I'm hiring a consultant to help us figure out how to do it.

390
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:22,950
Because the conditions that we were putting on in Somerville were more stringent than what we talked about this evening.

391
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:29,353
And if we had talked about those same conditions this evening, they probably would have said, no, we can't do it and walked out.

392
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:32,414
So yeah, agreed.

393
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:43,233
You know, your point about making an ask that's commensurate with what we're giving them is a good point, too.

394
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:44,074
Yeah.

395
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:46,155
Go ahead.

396
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:49,117
Yeah, I just want to just chime in a couple things.

397
00:34:49,237 --> 00:35:00,805
I think this is somewhat of a unique situation, because if this building wasn't an International Writers' General Report building for Medford, it probably wouldn't have gotten over the finish line.

398
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:07,735
And I don't want to set a precedent, as I mentioned in our last meeting of being the, you know.

399
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:16,291
for the private sector being the big brain maker for their renovation restoration projects.

400
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:24,097
This was to me the kickstarter to get things going, but I don't think they should be coming back for any more money or not a lot of it.

401
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:36,288
Because we have so many big needs of the parks and other things in the city, publicly owned and otherwise, that I feel like it's not a good optical look to be spending money on a building that

402
00:35:37,347 --> 00:35:46,853
I still think it's worth tens of millions of dollars overall with 31 condo owners, private businesses in that building.

403
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:48,834
And off-cycle.

404
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:50,135
Yeah.

405
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:57,059
So actually, this all leads me to

406
00:35:58,585 --> 00:36:03,889
A question, so I think that this is a really important topic for us to discuss.

407
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:11,754
Is this too far off the reservation for us to go more deeply into this subject today?

408
00:36:12,615 --> 00:36:20,961
So we should put this on the agenda for a future meeting to talk about historic preservation guidelines.

409
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:25,250
for privately owned properties.

410
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,732
And it could be guidelines for all properties.

411
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:33,536
I mean, really, guidelines for all of our work should really be on the table.

412
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:39,601
Could we legally, as a CPC, just say we are not going to fund historical work in private buildings?

413
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:40,582
We could.

414
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:44,705
So we could potentially make that declaration.

415
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:49,929
As long as we spend 10% of our funds on historic preservation, then

416
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:53,743
we're meeting our obligation.

417
00:36:53,763 --> 00:37:01,306
That would be a really clear guideline.

418
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:01,747
Yeah.

419
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:05,348
We're eliminating all the sessions that we might have to have.

420
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:06,009
Yeah.

421
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:07,970
You know, just say, no, we're not doing it.

422
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,090
Stop.

423
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:09,850
Stop.

424
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:10,291
No.

425
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:15,153
It's the headphones.

426
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:24,017
Oh, there you are.

427
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:26,818
OK, can you hear me?

428
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:26,898
Yes.

429
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:28,219
OK, awesome.

430
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,660
Now I don't even remember what my question was.

431
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,323
That was not what I was testing with my hand, I promise.

432
00:37:35,983 --> 00:37:45,729
Yeah, is there a way to understand how other towns have kind of dealt with a similar, or cities have dealt with similar issues?

433
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:50,712
I know you've drawn a little bit on your experience in Somerville, but I'm curious if you can draw on experiences from other cities as well.

434
00:37:52,998 --> 00:37:53,879
I'll take that one.

435
00:37:53,959 --> 00:38:03,924
So Roberta, in all of her amazing glory, she actually manages a once a month peer network call where it's, is it about, is it every four weeks or six weeks?

436
00:38:04,224 --> 00:38:05,025
It's once a month.

437
00:38:05,105 --> 00:38:05,425
Once a month.

438
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:15,571
Where all the other CPA managers and all, it's open to everybody in Massachusetts, cities, towns as well, right?

439
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:15,871
No, no.

440
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:17,332
Okay, I got it.

441
00:38:17,352 --> 00:38:17,612
My bad.

442
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:25,091
So we often come to those meetings with, hey, I have this niche weird application.

443
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:27,112
Who else has dealt with something like this?

444
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:33,433
So we have a really good rapport in being able to talk amongst many different types of municipalities.

445
00:38:33,713 --> 00:38:38,054
Greenfield is always on there, so I get to hear about how it goes out in Western Mass versus here.

446
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:41,515
We also do have a coalition.

447
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:44,156
It's the Community Preservation Coalition,

448
00:38:45,445 --> 00:38:49,628
Amongst other things, it does provide us with some technical assistance.

449
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:59,156
I wouldn't say it's legal advice, but some counsel that we can take back to applicants as well.

450
00:38:59,576 --> 00:39:04,060
So we do have some resources out there to bounce these niche type of applications off of.

451
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:14,167
And I certainly will bring this one to our next meeting to talk about, just for future applications of funding privately on buildings like this.

452
00:39:15,364 --> 00:39:20,269
Because we had to discuss on one of those calls about 80 years recently.

453
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:20,710
Yeah.

454
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:38,068
And I mean, one of the, regarding privately owned buildings, one of the things that won this project over for me was the fact that they were so amenable to opening their space for public events, even once a year, that's valuable.

455
00:39:39,297 --> 00:39:43,881
I mean, they've got to do something related to Veterans Day, like with the city.

456
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:46,864
They should work with City Hall to do something in their venue.

457
00:39:46,924 --> 00:39:47,986
Yeah, exactly.

458
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:57,916
And their willingness to talk about doing that enables us to turn a private space into a space that serves the public.

459
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:04,492
Um, you know, here I am grabbing the last word and saying, let's move on.

460
00:40:04,512 --> 00:40:25,905
Um, I feel like, um, I, I, this is a conversation that we should put on an agenda for a future meeting, but if anyone has any thoughts about like topic bubbles that we should cover in that future discussion.

461
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:40,591
Um, you can mention them now, or maybe send them by email to Teresa so that we can maybe do a little bit of research and, um, bring some.

462
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:44,512
Yeah, yeah, sure.

463
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:48,413
I'm recalling the guy who came to us with his 2 chimneys.

464
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:49,313
Do you remember that?

465
00:40:49,373 --> 00:40:50,393
That was yes.

466
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:50,774
Yeah.

467
00:40:53,115 --> 00:41:00,357
I think we did not fund him because we didn't have any public use, except he kept saying, oh, they look good from the street.

468
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:01,917
Well, that wasn't enough, right?

469
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:08,599
So I think there's definitely some lines to draw around this.

470
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:15,840
And clearly, we've funded private before, but they're usually nonprofits, like churches and things like that.

471
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:22,822
So we'll bring in that as a sort of point to put into the plan or process.

472
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:25,655
Yeah, and that's- Stop, Jeremy, I'm sorry.

473
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:30,156
I was gonna go off topic, so here.

474
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:46,861
And I was just gonna mention, and I'm sorry if it was discussed at a meeting I missed, but a few meetings ago, we talked about talking more about our sort of relationship, working relationship with the Affordable Housing Trust.

475
00:41:47,621 --> 00:41:50,722
I don't know if we came back around to that in more detail.

476
00:41:52,568 --> 00:41:59,735
I'd throw that out there as another topic to get into more discussion about that.

477
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:01,577
Thank you for bringing that back up again.

478
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:10,386
That has been something that I've been discussing with Roberta as well as the chairperson for the trust and my city colleagues who support the trust.

479
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:18,975
They will actually, I'll pause for a moment and plug that there is, is it a hearing or is it just a big meeting on July 30th for the trust?

480
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:20,336
Is that technically a hearing?

481
00:42:20,796 --> 00:42:24,759
A community meeting to present the Affordable Housing Trust action plan.

482
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:25,459
Right, okay.

483
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:29,862
Yeah, I don't think we're advertising it with legal ads.

484
00:42:29,902 --> 00:42:30,322
Okay.

485
00:42:31,263 --> 00:42:35,205
So the idea is the action plan is coming out from the trust.

486
00:42:35,225 --> 00:42:37,747
They're going to talk about it at the July 30th meeting.

487
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:52,187
And then we're really hoping that some public comment that might come from there, as well as some just good dialogue, might help us inform how we move forward as a CPA granting authority with the trust as we look at housing applications.

488
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:54,168
So thank you for remembering that.

489
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:55,829
And don't be a squeegee wheel about it, Jeremy.

490
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:56,329
Keep going.

491
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:02,472
But that is something that we're going to probably bring up, hopefully, at either a September, potentially September

492
00:43:10,456 --> 00:43:16,358
It just so happens that on the past commission, we have a low in winter.

493
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:17,718
Okay.

494
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:27,300
And we designate January as the meeting date when we are going to discuss all off topic, um, issues.

495
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:33,002
Um, so we set off these guidelines, et cetera, et cetera.

496
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:42,405
And I know that by that time, we will have given the City Council our recommendations, and they will be voting on it.

497
00:43:42,445 --> 00:43:55,291
I would think that we could probably use our January meeting as a springboard, depending on what we get for applications this year, because there might be something that's untoward in one of those.

498
00:43:56,092 --> 00:44:01,394
We might run into a similar situation right off the bat, and then we have to move it up.

499
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:12,898
Collectively, if we grab all of these topics and have a specific meeting, whereas we don't discuss anything else except off topic.

500
00:44:13,658 --> 00:44:17,481
I feel like that could end up being a six hour meeting, but it's a great idea.

501
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:26,187
I'm not breaking discouraging it, but we're fixing Medford in this committee so that those conversations can be.

502
00:44:26,227 --> 00:44:27,848
We really like thorough discussions.

503
00:44:30,605 --> 00:44:42,391
I mean, this is all theoretically a part of our annual review process, like us reflecting on our program and thinking about how do we make program improvements to do it better.

504
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:46,433
So that's a great segue to the annual plan that we've worked on.

505
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:54,877
I don't know if everyone did their homework and read the plan in advance, but Teresa and I were doing some heavy editing today.

506
00:44:55,498 --> 00:45:02,942
during the day, so the plan that you look at this evening might be different than the one that you saw yesterday.

507
00:45:02,962 --> 00:45:08,624
I think that's the application.

508
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:16,428
I'm just realizing our applicants took my copies of the plan that I had printed up.

509
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:18,989
I'm very sorry.

510
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:22,591
I will screen share.

511
00:45:22,611 --> 00:45:23,792
They're getting an education.

512
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:27,407
Um, so I want to put a pin in that.

513
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:40,077
I just want to make a note that yes, we should schedule the conversations and maybe it would be helpful before we leave this evening to pencil in the dates that we think that we could cover each of these topics.

514
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:41,458
And given the.

515
00:45:48,837 --> 00:45:55,062
I think some of these things are sensitive to the decisions that we want to make about this funding cycle.

516
00:45:55,142 --> 00:46:02,286
So I don't know if we want to wait until after the funding cycle is over before we figure out how it's going to work.

517
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:17,557
So it would be really great if we're able to integrate over the next few months, like say, we cover one topic each month over the next few months, iron out some

518
00:46:18,293 --> 00:46:20,114
rather than lumping it all in one page.

519
00:46:20,434 --> 00:46:38,564
And it'd be helpful to also have the conditions, like the general conditions for all the committee members to see so that we know that our concerns are covered in the contracts, the grant agreements that the applicants end up signing.

520
00:46:39,225 --> 00:46:40,105
That sounds like a plan.

521
00:46:40,285 --> 00:46:40,485
Yeah.

522
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:42,807
So we'll flip through the annual

523
00:46:48,281 --> 00:47:00,152
The purpose of this plan update is to provide information about the CPA program and the amount of funding that's available and how we plan to disperse it over the next year.

524
00:47:01,453 --> 00:47:05,677
So the first section covers all of that financial information.

525
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:15,674
and describes the projects that we funded in the last year.

526
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:23,019
This is a lot of information that was presented over the last couple of months when we had our annual public hearing.

527
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:31,564
This is essentially a summary of the various talking points that we've been reviewing the past few months.

528
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:38,989
But we share this with the public so that they're informed about what it is we're all doing here.

529
00:47:39,129 --> 00:47:47,111
We're obviously in it and doing it, but this is a public-facing plan.

530
00:47:48,391 --> 00:47:50,592
It also is like 30 pages.

531
00:47:50,612 --> 00:47:59,074
30 pages, but it's very dense with information, including several pages of

532
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:05,497
progress reports for all of the projects that we've ever funded.

533
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,002
Did you want to look at anything specific or down?

534
00:48:11,023 --> 00:48:12,063
I can keep scrolling.

535
00:48:12,104 --> 00:48:15,327
Yeah, I can keep scrolling through this section.

536
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:18,229
Can I ask a question?

537
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:19,350
Yeah.

538
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:26,097
Because this is so dense as a reader, I wonder if it makes sense to

539
00:48:27,712 --> 00:48:32,533
where you've got the FY25 activity summary, which is kind of like an executive summary.

540
00:48:32,553 --> 00:48:35,854
That should be right after the acknowledgements.

541
00:48:36,194 --> 00:48:43,935
So that's the first thing people read, and then go into the detail, rather than having to search for it.

542
00:48:46,516 --> 00:48:49,136
You're saying the fiscal 25 activity summary?

543
00:48:49,156 --> 00:48:54,357
You put that in- That's somewhat of an executive summary, if you will.

544
00:48:54,897 --> 00:48:56,238
You know, it should be written in the,

545
00:48:58,137 --> 00:49:03,199
form of an executive summary, or maybe we need an executive summary.

546
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:17,024
You know, what could be missing, what could be added to the very first page is, oh wait, back up to the top.

547
00:49:17,924 --> 00:49:24,967
So we have this table of contents, which is, I wonder if it could be possible to

548
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:32,462
Simplify the table of contents.

549
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:43,685
Crunch it down into just a little tiny box that could be on the same page as the introduction, and maybe the introduction could be shortened.

550
00:49:43,705 --> 00:49:52,687
Because the FY25 activities summary is on page two after the introduction, but we've already

551
00:49:53,648 --> 00:49:55,129
How many pages in are we?

552
00:49:55,149 --> 00:49:58,051
We're on page three before we get to the table of contents.

553
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:01,433
And five before we get to the activity summary, right?

554
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:02,113
Yeah.

555
00:50:02,553 --> 00:50:04,875
So maybe we can dispense.

556
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:13,360
Yeah, maybe there's too much in the beginning acknowledgments and everything.

557
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:22,866
So I'm hearing to shorten the introduction, create, and then move up an executive summary

558
00:50:23,832 --> 00:50:33,696
but reformat the fiscal 25 activity summary into being more of an executive summary, so it's less, maybe less narrative, and then put that at the tippity top.

559
00:50:33,956 --> 00:50:35,017
I can do that, yeah.

560
00:50:35,897 --> 00:50:37,658
The tippity top, exactly.

561
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:45,061
Do we want to review the legal contents more?

562
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:48,443
I mean, I could see a tinker with where we can condense.

563
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:55,080
Like, I think procedures can probably go on, you know, in the due process.

564
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,721
Procedures could even go into the appendix.

565
00:50:58,501 --> 00:50:58,781
Yeah.

566
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:03,663
I mean, all of that, basically under goals and priorities, everything after that is appendix.

567
00:51:03,683 --> 00:51:04,463
Reversible.

568
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:06,704
So we write the book.

569
00:51:08,045 --> 00:51:08,285
Yeah.

570
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:12,627
And the editors didn't do their job.

571
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:20,210
So that... All right, we can... Theresa and I can look at that later.

572
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:21,876
They look beautiful.

573
00:51:22,616 --> 00:51:23,137
Thank you.

574
00:51:24,017 --> 00:51:30,162
Yeah, so as I looked through it earlier, a comment about lining or making the colors consistent throughout.

575
00:51:30,242 --> 00:51:31,483
And I really appreciated that.

576
00:51:31,724 --> 00:51:33,445
And it looks like you picked that up, Teresa.

577
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:34,806
It helps a lot.

578
00:51:34,906 --> 00:51:44,454
The one place where it might be worth also editing that would be on the map, if that's possible, to make some of the pins match.

579
00:51:44,594 --> 00:51:46,656
But I agree.

580
00:51:46,676 --> 00:51:47,716
It looks like a great report.

581
00:51:48,077 --> 00:51:50,659
I have not had an opportunity to read it in detail yet.

582
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,950
Thank you for that feedback, Chairman.

583
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,250
It's a fair point.

584
00:52:02,532 --> 00:52:09,773
So then each of these sections might be exactly what the person is looking for who comes to this report.

585
00:52:10,353 --> 00:52:13,813
So what is the funding availability for this year?

586
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:18,774
It's the next most relevant thing that they may be looking for.

587
00:52:18,794 --> 00:52:21,295
Maybe like this block of text.

588
00:52:21,315 --> 00:52:22,755
While I was writing it, I'm like,

589
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,161
people are looking for numbers, they don't want to read a whole paragraph.

590
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:29,301
So maybe this is something where it can be bulletized and called out.

591
00:52:29,341 --> 00:52:30,521
So it's, yeah.

592
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:31,581
Yeah.

593
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:48,004
I also wonder, um, in the, in the vein of what people are looking for more immediately, um, if the goals and priorities section would move up above the, um,

594
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,641
Priorities by program area.

595
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:57,263
It's like, you give the highlights overview.

596
00:52:58,103 --> 00:53:01,545
Of the goals and priorities, and then you break each of those down in more detail.

597
00:53:03,287 --> 00:53:06,669
In the following section, sort of the reverse of what you have now.

598
00:53:09,511 --> 00:53:11,252
Fair, I like that brought it down.

599
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:11,792
Thank you.

600
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:20,998
So, like, maybe we can just go go a little more slowly through this section that so that what's.

601
00:53:21,582 --> 00:53:40,173
described for each of the three program areas is what we've learned over the last year through what's happened in the community, kind of providing the context to help us understand what the community needs are as we make decisions.

602
00:53:40,893 --> 00:53:49,899
And some of this we've learned through the community engagement that Teresa has been wonderful at facilitating over the last year.

603
00:53:50,566 --> 00:53:57,350
Some of it has been learned through other planning processes that are going on at the same time.

604
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:05,554
So we're trying to pull out what is relevant that's going on in Medford that would help us understand our decision making process better.

605
00:54:06,315 --> 00:54:14,779
So under the open space and recreation, we've last had an open space and recreation plan in 2019.

606
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:22,884
So we're still working from the goals that were identified in that open space and recreation plan.

607
00:54:23,244 --> 00:54:40,975
But since we've already done a lot of the work that was envisioned in that plan, and we have been collecting a lot of community input and feedback over the past seven, five years, six, how many years that was.

608
00:54:41,942 --> 00:55:02,617
If we even scroll to the next page, we're taking the goals that were identified and then kind of adding in our understanding of what the community needs are today before the city goes back and does the next open space and recreation plan.

609
00:55:03,018 --> 00:55:04,779
And this is a really interesting table.

610
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:11,304
Figure seven shows how much work has actually been done since the last open space and recreation plan.

611
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:17,099
and how much of that has come from CPA funding versus other sources.

612
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:31,108
Yeah, you'll see that if you were looking at last year's update to this, actually, let me describe what the alphabet soup here in the middle is, CPAs.

613
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:34,170
CDBG is Community Development Block Grant.

614
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:36,912
That is federal funding that comes into certain communities.

615
00:55:37,052 --> 00:55:40,595
Medford qualifies that federal funding.

616
00:55:41,387 --> 00:55:50,930
as it's looking forward, they're budgeting very conservatively because federal funding, as we all know, is a little bit tumultuous at this moment in time.

617
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:59,713
So CDBG, you'll start seeing them probably shift their focus, not totally away from park projects, but more on the infrastructure in the city.

618
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:06,315
CDBG money can be used for, they have less restrictions as we did with CPA.

619
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:09,376
So just to explain seeing some of the numbers drop,

620
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,601
in CDBG as well as ARPA.

621
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:16,685
ARPA is gone at this point, so there's a couple of projects that are wrapping up.

622
00:56:17,545 --> 00:56:23,410
So just to explain what the alphabet soup and why you're seeing a little bit of a drop and an increase on CPA side.

623
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:31,195
We're probably going to be seeing more applications this funding round than we have in the past.

624
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:39,361
We anticipate yet another competitive round, but we have been doing an excellent job this past couple of years with securing

625
00:56:40,153 --> 00:56:41,294
other grants for the city.

626
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:46,337
So a lot of our projects are seeing funding coming from state as well as federal programs.

627
00:56:46,598 --> 00:56:50,901
So that's that's all Amanda Centrella right there.

628
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:53,322
That 43% doing a great job.

629
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,483
Thank you, Amanda.

630
00:56:54,523 --> 00:56:54,804
Yes.

631
00:56:56,485 --> 00:57:04,390
So I just want to kind of explain what the purpose of this is to see the cost sharing of all the various funding agencies that are out there.

632
00:57:05,451 --> 00:57:06,512
Any questions on that?

633
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,940
It has a lot of numbers.

634
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,201
How do we get that 8% higher?

635
00:57:15,382 --> 00:57:15,702
Yeah.

636
00:57:16,762 --> 00:57:17,802
That's a great question.

637
00:57:18,163 --> 00:57:19,143
I'm half kidding, but.

638
00:57:20,143 --> 00:57:24,464
Very nice.

639
00:57:26,265 --> 00:57:27,205
Yes.

640
00:57:27,565 --> 00:57:29,766
I'm kidding in that I'm not expecting you to answer it.

641
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:31,786
I mean what I say, though.

642
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:32,127
Yes.

643
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:36,108
So we'll scroll on.

644
00:57:38,785 --> 00:57:42,866
The next page has examples of things that we've heard from the public input.

645
00:57:42,906 --> 00:57:51,108
People often, when we go out collecting public input, have the most to say about open space and recreation.

646
00:57:51,188 --> 00:58:00,230
It's probably the area that they interact with the most intimately, whatever their ages and interests are.

647
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:09,428
Everybody cares about housing, certainly, but we get a little bit more of the specific examples of what you'd like to see from our open space.

648
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:14,450
I was surprised when we were tabling how many people wanted to talk about affordable housing.

649
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:18,131
There were just a lot of people in Medford that really care about affordable housing.

650
00:58:18,151 --> 00:58:18,491
Yeah.

651
00:58:19,392 --> 00:58:21,212
It's a hot topic right now.

652
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:22,133
Yeah.

653
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:23,253
It is.

654
00:58:24,093 --> 00:58:28,335
It is, especially as we're revisiting our zoning.

655
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:29,565
What?

656
00:58:29,645 --> 00:58:30,546
We are?

657
00:58:30,566 --> 00:58:30,966
What?

658
00:58:31,066 --> 00:58:34,308
What do I mean?

659
00:58:34,468 --> 00:58:34,688
Yes.

660
00:58:36,149 --> 00:58:42,312
So it doesn't really change too much year over year as we're looking at open space comments.

661
00:58:42,332 --> 00:58:45,613
A lot of folks just want to see improvements for bike and pedestrian.

662
00:58:45,674 --> 00:58:46,734
Yes, Reg.

663
00:58:47,514 --> 00:58:51,877
What constitutes the east side environmental justice areas?

664
00:58:56,017 --> 00:59:08,960
Yeah, most of Medford lands, except for I believe North Medford, in some capacity Lawrence Estates, the rest of East and Southern Medford does land in environmental justice areas.

665
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:13,281
So, I don't know if it would be helpful to provide context.

666
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:24,803
Environmental justice areas have a very specific definition that's based on a census data on household incomes,

667
00:59:25,413 --> 00:59:31,255
minority populations and people who, like, language isolation.

668
00:59:31,975 --> 00:59:41,738
So they look at the number of people in each neighborhood who fits into, like, vulnerable populations based on those criteria, and you can get a map.

669
00:59:42,198 --> 00:59:53,962
Maybe it would be helpful for us, especially if somebody mentions that, to include a map of environmental justice neighborhoods in Medford would be really great, helpful context for us.

670
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:57,942
Um, yeah, I can share that with you.

671
00:59:58,002 --> 00:59:58,582
I got a map.

672
00:59:58,922 --> 01:00:07,605
You know what I did in, um, in Somerville with the help of having a GIS person who could have, um, I could just say, can you give me this?

673
01:00:07,685 --> 01:00:14,148
And they give it to me is a map of all of our project sites against environmental justice neighborhoods.

674
01:00:15,168 --> 01:00:19,630
So I started manually making one of those would make sense.

675
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:20,430
So, um, yeah.

676
01:00:21,287 --> 01:00:22,548
Enter it in the IEIS.

677
01:00:22,648 --> 01:00:23,209
I love that.

678
01:00:23,309 --> 01:00:23,889
That would be great.

679
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:26,391
The UEP in turn should be able to do that.

680
01:00:27,732 --> 01:00:30,554
Yes, we have quite a few in our office.

681
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:32,636
Thank you, Aria.

682
01:00:32,816 --> 01:00:34,097
I'll tap one of them to help you.

683
01:00:34,117 --> 01:00:35,518
Thank you for the question, Raj.

684
01:00:36,018 --> 01:00:41,362
That would be a great add to our plan.

685
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:47,007
So if you're in an environmental justice area for various different reasons,

686
01:00:47,926 --> 01:00:50,887
qualifies that specific area for additional funding.

687
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:58,228
Like, for instance, I was working on a tree planting grant that will be targeting South Medford because it's an environmental justice area.

688
01:00:59,249 --> 01:01:17,013
In that alphabet soup that we saw in the previous page, the CDBG can only fund projects that are either in the environmental justice area or targeted toward a specific vulnerable population, like the senior center, they can do because that

689
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:28,999
is a target population, but a park has to be in a neighborhood that's been identified as environmental justice.

690
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:33,800
I'll share that map with everybody, because I think it would be helpful for all of us.

691
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:40,421
Any other questions, comments about the open space and recreation context?

692
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,262
Historic preservation.

693
01:01:49,423 --> 01:01:53,667
I just, actually, I wanted to comment on the first paragraph there.

694
01:01:54,047 --> 01:02:01,993
So unlike the other two program areas, Medford does not have an overall historic preservation plan.

695
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:06,577
So we're at figuring out what the priorities are.

696
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:17,686
There has been an effort by the Historical Commission, which is described in the next couple of paragraphs, to identify

697
01:02:18,408 --> 01:02:27,332
historic assets around the city and to protect some of our historic assets with local historic districts.

698
01:02:27,392 --> 01:02:33,335
We've also created some preservation restrictions that protect some of our assets.

699
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:37,416
By the way, I love that photo of them assing the window out the window.

700
01:02:37,436 --> 01:02:44,920
As I was walking into the building, I looked up and I saw them like, I have to run in there and take a picture.

701
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,081
There's some sort of like metaphor in there.

702
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:53,366
I didn't really realize how large those windows were until they removed them.

703
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:55,487
The 8-foot windows are huge.

704
01:02:56,528 --> 01:03:00,110
So that's the context that we have to work with for historic preservation.

705
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,811
You can scroll a little bit further.

706
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:13,819
So it describes some of the efforts that have been undertaken to expand our historic protections in the city.

707
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:21,355
Are these surveys in the office or are they going around neighborhoods?

708
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:23,377
They're going around neighborhoods.

709
01:03:23,457 --> 01:03:35,526
Essentially, they identify a neighborhood and they take an inventory of that entire swath of neighborhood boundaries and identify properties that are historic in there.

710
01:03:36,007 --> 01:03:41,551
Some of it does end up creating Form Bs, which are the summary of a historic

711
01:03:42,964 --> 01:03:44,285
narrative for a property.

712
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:54,395
So as we're working through these neighborhoods during the survey, some Form Bs are just naturally being created because they found, oh, we inventoried a very interesting specific house.

713
01:03:55,516 --> 01:04:02,223
How would one know if they were part of this inventory and have a Form B all of a sudden?

714
01:04:05,158 --> 01:04:11,161
I don't think there's any sort of public notification process right now, but that's a good point for us.

715
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:21,085
I'm not exactly sure what the awareness or outreach might be to just like share that with the neighborhood, but that's not currently being done actively.

716
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:31,730
I mean, it's really just making a snapshot description of what the neighborhood looks like today.

717
01:04:33,188 --> 01:04:41,392
And it doesn't have any further consequences besides like identifying what there is.

718
01:04:42,113 --> 01:04:52,338
So, I mean, maybe there's a good point that if your house is going to be listed in a, I think the form B's is a separate.

719
01:04:53,117 --> 01:05:20,687
project is the inventory doesn't involve actually right now but it is like flagging certain properties that they are then in the future they want to yeah yeah so um so years ago um i used to work for an insurance company and the insurance company covered um personal lines and commercial lines etc etc and they would identify historical

720
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:26,112
buildings as ones that had a plaque that was attached to them.

721
01:05:26,952 --> 01:05:35,977
I don't know that Redford actually has plaques that are, I mean, I know they have like the one on Woburn Street, that's a historical section, if you will.

722
01:05:37,037 --> 01:05:43,580
I don't know that they actually have a plaque that says this is a historic house that Paul Revere rode by back in 1775.

723
01:05:47,293 --> 01:05:50,014
on his way to conquer New England.

724
01:05:50,054 --> 01:05:50,834
Where's the guy?

725
01:05:50,974 --> 01:06:09,041
You know and uh so I mean well well Gaffney's for example I call it Gaffney's it's not Gaffney's anymore but Gaffney's used to have a sign on it that said that or maybe it was a plaque or a rock or something

726
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:15,033
that said it was a historical site based on... Do we have that?

727
01:06:15,153 --> 01:06:25,921
I mean, is it prevalent or is it just, you know... You've probably seen mostly the big plaques at our houses that say 1772 or whatever.

728
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:32,506
That is a voluntary program that the Medford Historical Society runs.

729
01:06:32,526 --> 01:06:33,987
You have to purchase the plaque.

730
01:06:34,087 --> 01:06:37,629
I'm not sure how much it is, but it is a voluntary and you have to buy it.

731
01:06:38,754 --> 01:06:46,676
commemorative monuments, you know, but... So you buy the house... They do the history regs.

732
01:06:46,716 --> 01:06:48,856
They give you the history of your house.

733
01:06:48,896 --> 01:06:50,937
So you're paying for that service, essentially.

734
01:06:50,957 --> 01:06:51,417
Right.

735
01:06:51,437 --> 01:06:52,437
Thank you.

736
01:06:52,977 --> 01:06:53,197
Yeah.

737
01:06:53,317 --> 01:06:57,278
But in terms of once upon a time, there was a famous battle here.

738
01:06:57,698 --> 01:07:04,299
Those type of things, we don't have a standard program for that budget.

739
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,680
So I realized that, you know, part of our

740
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:11,568
mission is to make sure that we maintain historical preservation.

741
01:07:11,588 --> 01:07:21,131
And we've actually designated a little bit more than a third or a little bit less than a third of our budget towards that.

742
01:07:23,312 --> 01:07:26,733
Signage is a tricky thing.

743
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:30,454
I'm trying to wrap my head around it, if you know what I mean.

744
01:07:31,975 --> 01:07:32,795
It just seems so

745
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:41,553
I want to come back to that, Doug.

746
01:07:42,113 --> 01:07:51,317
Picking up on an earlier points, you know, this, the commission has been surveying neighborhoods around Medford for more than a dozen years now, I think.

747
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:56,459
And that information really should be more accessible.

748
01:07:56,499 --> 01:08:02,862
I mean, it's on the MACRS website, the state, but it's, that's not an easy site for your average person to navigate.

749
01:08:03,263 --> 01:08:03,843
I feel like,

750
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:30,187
there is an opportunity to take all that information and let people, it probably could sit on the Memphis Historic Commission's website, you know, just look at a neighborhood and find out what buildings in your neighborhoods, in your neighborhood that you care about, even if you don't live there, might be interesting or have been, you know, looked at closely by an architectural historian, which is what this survey is all about.

751
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,230
And it's a great resource for the city.

752
01:08:34,303 --> 01:08:53,832
It might give people pause if their own house is on that list to think about maybe looking into coming before the commission and talking to us before they start having these grand plans to knock it down or to build an addition that may or may not be appropriate to that 1820 house.

753
01:08:54,232 --> 01:08:59,535
I think more information is always better, more transparency is always better for that kind of recognition.

754
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:16,008
So do I understand correctly that that is one of the purposes of the historic preservation commission to, um, do oversee some of that public education about their historic, um, resources?

755
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:20,251
I, you know, I, I've actually never seen that written down.

756
01:09:20,351 --> 01:09:22,013
I think it's implicit Roberta.

757
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:26,997
I think it's, but I don't actually know if that's a piece of our,

758
01:09:28,142 --> 01:09:31,346
you know, actual mission beyond the general education.

759
01:09:31,366 --> 01:09:32,067
It's not like that.

760
01:09:32,427 --> 01:09:36,232
That would be definitely a kind of step forward, which I think is a good one.

761
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:37,853
Yeah, I agree.

762
01:09:37,893 --> 01:09:38,674
Talk to them about it.

763
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:46,868
I just wanted to come back to your point, Reg, about signage, you know, awareness of Medford's history.

764
01:09:47,549 --> 01:10:04,102
CPA, a project that is just a sign is not eligible for CPA by itself because we're here to protect the assets, not the information.

765
01:10:04,123 --> 01:10:07,265
So a sign that describes what happened here

766
01:10:08,696 --> 01:10:14,361
like used to be at Gaffey's, is information that we want to share with the public.

767
01:10:14,621 --> 01:10:24,869
And creating a sign is just too many steps removed from protecting a historic asset, because that's what we're trying to do.

768
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,792
But we do.

769
01:10:28,032 --> 01:10:37,460
One of the things that I'd like to see us do even more than we have is, we kind of addressed this with this project this evening,

770
01:10:37,954 --> 01:10:54,651
to make sure that we leverage CPA funding to tap on a little bit of money to add signs every time so that we can actually share that information, but not as a standalone project.

771
01:10:56,995 --> 01:11:03,857
So we didn't think of that, of making that ask of these guys and maybe tacking on a little bit of money, but there might already be.

772
01:11:04,297 --> 01:11:07,037
There's one outside as well as several inside.

773
01:11:07,257 --> 01:11:12,418
And there's several inside where it's requiring them to let people in to enjoy looking at them.

774
01:11:12,598 --> 01:11:15,279
So we've addressed that, I think, in this case.

775
01:11:15,419 --> 01:11:17,880
So now it's a fair point to remember for subsequent.

776
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,560
So we talk a little bit.

777
01:11:20,127 --> 01:11:41,681
maybe not as succinctly as we could about city-owned assets, that we could be, that we're in discussion with the city about making improvements or protecting, preserving some of our city-owned assets, in particular the Curtis Tufts School fire stations,

778
01:11:42,113 --> 01:11:46,136
You know, it occurs to me, it says restoration efforts at Oak Grove Cemetery.

779
01:11:46,156 --> 01:11:55,244
Maybe we want to add, call out the superintendent's house and garage, since that's where a lot of our... That's where the money's going.

780
01:11:55,264 --> 01:11:56,345
That's where the money's going.

781
01:11:56,465 --> 01:11:56,765
Okay.

782
01:11:57,166 --> 01:11:59,207
So... Wait, what about the superintendent's house?

783
01:11:59,628 --> 01:12:00,929
The caretaker's house.

784
01:12:01,009 --> 01:12:02,130
The caretaker's house.

785
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:07,774
We've been putting CPA money into preserving that building.

786
01:12:11,191 --> 01:12:21,374
And there's been discussion about developing an archive for Medford historic records, which we don't, that hasn't really gone anywhere in the last year.

787
01:12:21,514 --> 01:12:24,915
We didn't receive the technical assistance grants twice.

788
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:27,255
So that's frustrating.

789
01:12:27,335 --> 01:12:30,976
I think they're only providing two grants per period.

790
01:12:30,996 --> 01:12:32,597
So yeah, I'll keep trying.

791
01:12:32,897 --> 01:12:34,537
Yeah, appreciate that.

792
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:37,958
And then we mentioned that

793
01:12:38,902 --> 01:12:51,587
The project is breaking ground at Shiloh Baptist Church, and Shiloh, like many religious organizations, is struggling to keep up its historic building.

794
01:12:52,247 --> 01:13:05,952
Investing CPA money has enabled the church to break the space into ADA compliance and make it available for a child care provider to occupy the building.

795
01:13:06,453 --> 01:13:18,858
So leveraging CPA has the opportunity to fund investment in historic community spaces to make the assets safe, accessible, and functional.

796
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:24,160
So any other questions, comments about historic preservation?

797
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:28,282
We'll move on to affordable housing.

798
01:13:29,922 --> 01:13:33,324
So context for affordable housing.

799
01:13:35,366 --> 01:13:36,127
move on to the next.

800
01:13:36,247 --> 01:13:38,128
I think the first is just introductory.

801
01:13:38,548 --> 01:13:41,570
So to... is this?

802
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,212
That's walking forward, right?

803
01:13:44,492 --> 01:13:45,973
That is walking forward.

804
01:13:46,653 --> 01:13:50,175
Hopefully it will actually look like that in the not too distant future.

805
01:13:50,936 --> 01:13:51,656
Where is that?

806
01:13:52,337 --> 01:13:54,518
Right behind Whole Foods.

807
01:13:54,558 --> 01:13:55,779
That's Whole Foods right here.

808
01:13:56,759 --> 01:13:59,101
Oh, that's where my new office is.

809
01:13:59,421 --> 01:13:59,561
Yeah.

810
01:14:00,845 --> 01:14:02,106
I keep falling asleep.

811
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:14,213
So over the past five years, Medford has made advancements in planning and policy implementation to address the city's affordable housing needs.

812
01:14:14,653 --> 01:14:15,774
First, the housing production plan,

813
01:14:29,272 --> 01:14:34,716
adopted in 2021, then the comprehensive plan adopted in 2023.

814
01:14:35,156 --> 01:14:43,562
I didn't get into detail about what the goals and strategies were for those documents.

815
01:14:45,043 --> 01:14:51,287
The housing production plan envisions specifically addressing affordability.

816
01:14:51,847 --> 01:14:55,930
The comprehensive plan is more about land use citywide.

817
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:58,772
And then we've undertaken actions

818
01:14:59,638 --> 01:15:16,422
to align with the objectives outlined in these plans, including citywide rezoning effort, the approval of 40B developments and developments that comply with inclusionary zoning, RFPs for the disposition of major city-owned lots.

819
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:18,503
Ooh, we don't have to capitalize owned.

820
01:15:19,243 --> 01:15:25,945
In Medford Square in Wellington, the expansion of city resources and programs supporting affordable housing.

821
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:40,191
With completion of all the development projects that are in the pipeline that would create affordable units, Medford will be keeping pace with the housing production goals outlined in its housing production plan.

822
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:49,715
We actually haven't completed any of those units yet, but the three units at Beltsway West that the CPA funded,

823
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:51,669
will be completed this summer.

824
01:15:51,849 --> 01:15:52,149
Yes.

825
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,230
Yes, they will.

826
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:59,011
They're anticipating construction will be complete in about two weeks or so, mid to late July.

827
01:16:00,271 --> 01:16:07,273
And I don't have a date yet, but we are planning for a ribbon cutting sometime in probably mid to late August.

828
01:16:07,533 --> 01:16:08,693
So before the school year starts.

829
01:16:09,553 --> 01:16:10,074
Woo-hoo.

830
01:16:10,154 --> 01:16:11,634
It's a long time coming.

831
01:16:12,374 --> 01:16:12,754
Yeah.

832
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:15,115
Like first year, second year?

833
01:16:15,455 --> 01:16:15,775
Yeah.

834
01:16:16,235 --> 01:16:16,435
Yes.

835
01:16:17,108 --> 01:16:28,533
First year, tiny project, but it's the CPA program's first affordable housing units created, opened to be occupied.

836
01:16:28,753 --> 01:16:31,094
So that's a big thing to celebrate, I think.

837
01:16:31,114 --> 01:16:32,595
Yeah.

838
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:38,857
So another significant initiative is obviously the establishment of the Affordable Housing Trust.

839
01:16:39,037 --> 01:16:45,520
The next steps, as Jeremy reminded us earlier, is that we need to have a discussion about how is this going to work now.

840
01:16:47,066 --> 01:16:54,030
So after we talk about this plan, we'll try to pencil in a date for that discussion.

841
01:16:54,050 --> 01:17:03,495
And then thanks to these efforts, Medford has been able to secure designation under the Massachusetts Housing Choice Initiative.

842
01:17:04,195 --> 01:17:13,760
And in order to maintain our designation, the CBC opted to increase the budgeted share of funds for affordable housing to 25%.

843
01:17:15,994 --> 01:17:33,669
So we talk about how much we funded for the Affordable Housing Trust and what are some options for increasing funding for affordable housing.

844
01:17:34,409 --> 01:17:36,851
Any questions, discussions about affordable housing?

845
01:17:39,694 --> 01:17:43,097
Is this our proposal to go from 1.5% to 3% or is that the city's?

846
01:17:45,393 --> 01:17:47,594
This is just saying that it could happen.

847
01:17:47,614 --> 01:17:52,576
So soon after I pay my taxes.

848
01:17:53,616 --> 01:17:58,237
Nobody is considering pushing this forward at all in the next few years.

849
01:17:58,358 --> 01:17:59,798
But it is something.

850
01:17:59,818 --> 01:18:00,498
It's another town.

851
01:18:00,618 --> 01:18:01,359
Yeah.

852
01:18:01,499 --> 01:18:05,800
And honestly, the initiative doesn't need to come from this committee.

853
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:11,242
If there was somebody out there who just felt really passionate about it and they want to collect signatures and put it on the ballot,

854
01:18:11,797 --> 01:18:16,379
It doesn't have to come from the committee was yeah it as I added today.

855
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:29,883
Since Medford initially adopted CPA through a signature campaign, the route to putting a surcharge increase on the ballot would have to be done again by a sick by a petition signature campaign so.

856
01:18:30,743 --> 01:18:43,813
If anybody wants to go out and collect 3,000 signatures to put it on the ballot, however, the Affordable Housing Trust has some other ideas about how to increase funding for affordable housing.

857
01:18:43,994 --> 01:18:47,496
So we don't have to put all of our eggs in that basket.

858
01:18:48,077 --> 01:18:54,562
But I thought it was worth stating in the plan because people will raise that as a possibility.

859
01:18:54,822 --> 01:18:59,566
And I feel like we should acknowledge it first before everybody else does and say,

860
01:19:00,123 --> 01:19:04,567
Like, yes, this could happen.

861
01:19:04,587 --> 01:19:06,489
This is what it would take to do it.

862
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:08,231
And leave it at that.

863
01:19:08,251 --> 01:19:15,698
Roberta, out of curiosity, what is the surcharge in Somerville?

864
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,763
Somerville, just last year, raised their surcharge from 1.5% to 3%.

865
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:21,304
Was it contentious?

866
01:19:26,697 --> 01:19:27,958
Not particularly.

867
01:19:28,118 --> 01:19:31,299
It passed by, I think, something like 70 percent.

868
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:37,801
But I think Medford will be a different, a different rate.

869
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:39,222
We're not in the same place.

870
01:19:41,703 --> 01:19:43,584
Did you have something to add, Brett?

871
01:19:44,384 --> 01:19:46,865
No.

872
01:19:47,345 --> 01:19:53,187
And Somerville also, because they had originally put it on the ballot through a council order

873
01:19:55,664 --> 01:19:58,246
it went through the council to get on the ballot again.

874
01:19:58,266 --> 01:20:01,108
So that was a different process as well.

875
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:12,777
I would just also point out too, we will, and it was reflected on our budget, we will see a little bit of a lift to our revenue because of the overrides.

876
01:20:14,278 --> 01:20:17,740
Our revenue is derived as a surcharge on top of property taxes.

877
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:23,144
So the fact that, you know, with the overrides, everybody did see an increase in their taxes while that surcharge,

878
01:20:24,802 --> 01:20:26,183
proportionally also increased.

879
01:20:26,283 --> 01:20:30,505
So I think we'll see an additional $85,000 this year.

880
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:32,867
So it's not much, but that's a project.

881
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:37,290
I'm just happy I get to spend it.

882
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:39,251
Feels cathartic.

883
01:20:41,272 --> 01:20:49,377
So the next section is really important for the committee members, especially to weigh in on the goals and priorities because

884
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:55,860
Theoretically, we're using these goals and priorities to evaluate projects when they come in.

885
01:20:55,941 --> 01:21:03,322
So, like, how well did these goals and priorities align with what we want to fund, having seen the types of projects that we receive.

886
01:21:03,863 --> 01:21:05,363
So, some overall goals.

887
01:21:05,503 --> 01:21:10,444
Projects should be highly visible and accessible, generating broad benefits to the community.

888
01:21:11,124 --> 01:21:16,646
As appropriate, the application should demonstrate public input or gathering of support.

889
01:21:17,345 --> 01:21:22,846
Projects must not replace funding from others from the city budget or other funding sources.

890
01:21:22,946 --> 01:21:23,606
So planting.

891
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:24,446
So planting.

892
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:32,328
Priority is given to projects that leverage funding from other sources and or fill a gap where other sources are not available.

893
01:21:33,068 --> 01:21:42,910
Projects should demonstrate cost sensitivity, both in the short term use of CPA funds and the long term maintenance or lifespan of the resource for which the funds are used.

894
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:54,185
Priority is given to projects with a public sector or non-profit applicant or co-applicant above private individuals or for-profit applicants.

895
01:21:54,786 --> 01:21:58,648
So that addresses what we consider this evening.

896
01:22:01,469 --> 01:22:08,753
Then there are specific goals and priorities stated for each of the program areas.

897
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:34,966
for open space and recreation, expand and enhance open space as distinguishing features of Medford's landscape, especially along the Mystic River and other bodies of water, make Medford Square and neighborhoods greener and more attractive, protect neighborhoods and natural resources from the impacts of flooding and climate change, improve access to open space and recreation resources for all Medford residents,

898
01:22:35,528 --> 01:22:46,612
expand bicycle and pedestrian paths, connecting neighborhoods and recreational community resources, and provide diverse recreation opportunities serving residents of all ages.

899
01:22:46,632 --> 01:22:57,417
These, by the way, were created through a big public process that we had the very first year of CPA back in 2017.

900
01:22:57,557 --> 01:22:57,857
We had

901
01:23:00,879 --> 01:23:08,425
public meetings that were well attended, and we gathered a lot of input from people, and that's how we developed these goals and priorities.

902
01:23:09,146 --> 01:23:21,916
And then for open space and recreation, the priorities are first, and this is kind of hard to explain, but I've never been able to come up with a better wording.

903
01:23:22,036 --> 01:23:24,218
So tell me if you can think of something better.

904
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:27,641
Enhance open space as a land use asset

905
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:31,628
while improving connectivity, access, safety, and function.

906
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:41,972
So thinking about recreation opportunities or having open space parcels that serve a function.

907
01:23:42,793 --> 01:23:46,094
Second, support resiliency through open space.

908
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:55,198
So generally, what is the quality of the open space, and how is it providing for more community or environmental resiliency?

909
01:23:57,948 --> 01:24:01,451
Would you call that a communal asset?

910
01:24:05,434 --> 01:24:06,414
A shared asset?

911
01:24:07,535 --> 01:24:11,458
Maybe that's not what you're after there.

912
01:24:11,518 --> 01:24:13,119
I don't think communal asset.

913
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,061
A public asset.

914
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:18,103
As a land use asset.

915
01:24:18,423 --> 01:24:19,744
Land use is such an awkward word.

916
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:19,964
Yeah.

917
01:24:20,185 --> 01:24:24,588
So I think Jeremy's suggestion has enhanced open space as a communal asset.

918
01:24:25,867 --> 01:24:29,169
Sorry, I thought you were asking for input on those lines.

919
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:32,232
Yeah, no, that's helpful.

920
01:24:33,392 --> 01:24:44,520
If we have a hard time with it, our applicants who look at this and ask themselves whether they meet these criteria are also going to have a hard time with it.

921
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:47,622
So I like that as a community asset.

922
01:24:52,780 --> 01:25:03,484
All right, affordable housing, preserve Medford's income and demographic diversity through sustaining and increasing the supply of affordable housing for families, seniors, individuals, and people with disabilities.

923
01:25:04,264 --> 01:25:10,026
Facilitate investments in affordable housing that preserve and complement the character of Medford's neighborhoods.

924
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:16,008
Support low and moderate income households in accessing housing that they can afford.

925
01:25:17,368 --> 01:25:21,770
With the priorities being first to increase the supply of affordable housing,

926
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:28,145
Second, to provide support services for households to access affordable housing.

927
01:25:30,707 --> 01:25:35,791
And that comes in the form of our rental arrears program, our move-in assistance programs.

928
01:25:36,271 --> 01:25:36,551
Yeah.

929
01:25:38,373 --> 01:25:51,544
And then for historic preservation, I'm proposing to change the priorities from what we originally came up with based on what we've

930
01:25:52,358 --> 01:25:54,239
seen in the last couple of years.

931
01:25:55,159 --> 01:26:12,587
So the goals are to preserve historic buildings and sites, protect, restore, and enhance public access to historical records and artifacts, and to increase public awareness about local history and historical sites.

932
01:26:13,247 --> 01:26:18,750
And I'm proposing to add a goal to make historic community buildings safe, accessible, and functional.

933
01:26:20,662 --> 01:26:35,707
And then the priorities, originally the priorities were to preserve city-owned historic resources as first priority, and second priority is to preserve non-city-owned historic resources.

934
01:26:36,267 --> 01:26:45,050
So the first and second priorities mean like who we give the highest ranking to in our criteria versus lower ranking.

935
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:46,871
And so

936
01:26:47,772 --> 01:26:49,292
I'm suggesting a change.

937
01:26:49,312 --> 01:26:53,833
Tell me if you like this change or agree with it.

938
01:26:54,413 --> 01:27:00,195
The first priority be to preserve resources that provide functional community use.

939
01:27:00,955 --> 01:27:08,096
And the second one to be preserve historic assets that contribute to community awareness and character.

940
01:27:08,116 --> 01:27:15,318
I like them.

941
01:27:23,505 --> 01:27:42,080
I think that I'll chime in that I think that that would help provide some clarity for, again, we looked at our applicant earlier this evening, having it called out that we want to support projects that provide a functional community use that could have raised a little bit of a flag for them.

942
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,121
So I like it.

943
01:27:44,341 --> 01:27:50,166
It expands upon the intention there, clarifies it a bit.

944
01:27:51,187 --> 01:27:51,467
Sure.

945
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:57,930
Another thought that occurs to me is that I don't know if I were the grantee reading this.

946
01:27:57,990 --> 01:28:04,492
I don't know if this is how all of you interpret the way that this chart reads, first priority, second priority.

947
01:28:05,133 --> 01:28:18,477
If it's clear to you that this is a ranking of what's more important or less important, maybe the names first and second priority should be higher priority, lower priority.

948
01:28:18,497 --> 01:28:19,997
Yeah.

949
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:22,778
That would work.

950
01:28:26,033 --> 01:28:35,119
I do worry that saying lower priority implies that it's not something we care about, whereas we're saying that's in fact the thing we care about second most.

951
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:37,881
It's above everything else except for the thing that's up top.

952
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:43,804
I think first and second is clear enough, but totally open to disagreement.

953
01:28:43,884 --> 01:28:44,865
Or something like that.

954
01:28:46,046 --> 01:28:48,828
What if we were to go higher and then secondary?

955
01:28:50,769 --> 01:28:50,909
Yeah.

956
01:28:53,327 --> 01:28:54,428
Kind of Frankenstein-y.

957
01:28:54,468 --> 01:28:57,249
Was there a question about this ranking, Teresa?

958
01:28:57,289 --> 01:28:59,270
Primary, secondary.

959
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:00,370
Not really.

960
01:29:03,732 --> 01:29:10,595
In my time, I think I've only encountered nine historical preservation projects.

961
01:29:10,615 --> 01:29:15,478
I feel like it's good to be scrutiny-proof as we head into more competitive cycles.

962
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:30,943
Yeah, let me say applicants like we had this evening, if we're in a competitive application cycle, would they understand that they're coming in at a lower priority?

963
01:29:31,063 --> 01:29:41,650
And by adding the community use of their building once or twice a year, that's helping to nudge their priority ranking a little bit higher.

964
01:29:46,138 --> 01:30:03,226
up as something that I've been wanting to bring up not related to this, but could we shift the process to vote after, like, could we basically have applicants not here while we vote?

965
01:30:04,246 --> 01:30:04,506
No.

966
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:06,127
We could.

967
01:30:06,867 --> 01:30:07,247
Really?

968
01:30:08,128 --> 01:30:08,348
What?

969
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:10,611
Not with an open meeting, right?

970
01:30:10,771 --> 01:30:11,812
It's an open meeting.

971
01:30:11,832 --> 01:30:13,373
An open meeting.

972
01:30:13,433 --> 01:30:15,795
And they should probably be present.

973
01:30:17,196 --> 01:30:24,421
I mean, just because I feel like it adds, like, it doesn't give us an opportunity to, like, privately discuss our concerns with each other.

974
01:30:25,061 --> 01:30:34,768
Not that we wouldn't, like, then bring them back in and be like, here's what we came to, but we go straight from, like, discussing it with them here to voting in their presence, you know what I mean?

975
01:30:35,286 --> 01:30:39,854
Yeah, I was trying not to make any eye contact with them while we were trying to have a discussion.

976
01:30:40,976 --> 01:30:43,360
It's a little awkward.

977
01:30:43,961 --> 01:30:46,385
Are we allowed to deliberate outside of an open meeting?

978
01:30:47,787 --> 01:30:47,967
No.

979
01:30:48,668 --> 01:30:50,329
we can go on to the executive session.

980
01:30:50,449 --> 01:31:06,977
But we could still be an open, I don't know if this is the case, but I wonder if we could still be considered an open meeting and just like politely ask them to give us, like we'd still literally be open to the public, but asking them to sort of like give us a moment to deliberate.

981
01:31:07,097 --> 01:31:15,902
I'm curious, because other committees such as perhaps the Zoning Board of Appeals and Conservation Commission, we are joined by Janice McDougall in the room here.

982
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,621
They don't privately deliberate.

983
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:21,841
Not allowed to.

984
01:31:21,861 --> 01:31:25,121
Applications, yeah, exactly.

985
01:31:25,301 --> 01:31:40,404
I don't think, I don't think if you're having a meeting while it's open, that's the definition of, I just don't think that, and I understand the awkwardness of talking about somebody when they're sitting next to you.

986
01:31:40,444 --> 01:31:40,684
Yeah.

987
01:31:41,585 --> 01:31:43,905
But at the same time, you know, we don't have the

988
01:31:44,696 --> 01:31:47,718
you really need to say, well, go to the other room over there.

989
01:31:47,738 --> 01:31:52,160
Well, we could ask them to just sit in the back of the room so that they're not at the table with us.

990
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:55,762
That would help us to feel like it's our space.

991
01:31:55,862 --> 01:32:03,286
During our regular funding round, the applicants present one night and then we deliberate on a different night.

992
01:32:11,075 --> 01:32:14,776
And they're welcome to observe that, but they're not part of the conversation.

993
01:32:14,836 --> 01:32:23,998
But whenever it's an off-cycle application, they're typically applying and getting a decision the same night that they apply.

994
01:32:24,618 --> 01:32:26,298
So that's a good point.

995
01:32:26,358 --> 01:32:35,400
We might be able to comply with open meeting law, but make it more like have them not be in the middle of our conversation.

996
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:36,140
Doug?

997
01:32:38,121 --> 01:32:40,041
Under the history, sorry, I'm switching topics.

998
01:32:40,598 --> 01:32:52,840
a little bit going back to the change in verbiage here about preserving city-owned historic prop resources versus preserve resources that provide functional community use.

999
01:32:53,580 --> 01:33:01,102
I feel that's actually a pretty significant shift than what we had, than what we started with, you know, seven, eight years ago.

1000
01:33:03,022 --> 01:33:06,583
You know, like, because, I mean, you can read

1001
01:33:07,513 --> 01:33:18,379
functional community use a lot of different ways, but that's actually quite far from city homes like Oak Grove or other things, the library, Brooks Estate.

1002
01:33:18,519 --> 01:33:31,347
There's a lot of things here that have been on the top of the list because of that verbiage and what we started out with that I think are being a little diluted here, but I'm just not sure if that's just the way I'm reading it.

1003
01:33:31,367 --> 01:33:34,568
For example,

1004
01:33:36,033 --> 01:33:50,623
this using the new version, Shiloh would be a high priority because it's a functional community use.

1005
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:55,546
City-owned buildings are functional community buildings.

1006
01:33:56,227 --> 01:34:03,932
I think that all city buildings by definition would be, and institutional buildings that provide

1007
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:08,312
like public use could also be a high priority.

1008
01:34:09,132 --> 01:34:10,393
So what if we combine it?

1009
01:34:10,573 --> 01:34:24,181
What if we say preserve city-owned historic resources and resources that provide functional community use or non-city resources that provide functional community use as a first or top priority?

1010
01:34:26,022 --> 01:34:26,262
Yeah.

1011
01:34:28,424 --> 01:34:28,964
That would work.

1012
01:34:35,927 --> 01:34:37,827
That way we're not reinventing the wheel.

1013
01:34:40,248 --> 01:34:43,269
And then the second one can stay as you've changed it.

1014
01:34:44,229 --> 01:34:44,589
Okay.

1015
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:50,030
All right.

1016
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:54,791
I think that's all that we really need to talk about the procedures and the rest of this document.

1017
01:34:54,851 --> 01:35:02,453
Oh, maybe we could just flip to the very end where we have the, the procedures have been, we've updated the dates here.

1018
01:35:03,443 --> 01:35:06,466
for the application process, but the procedures haven't changed.

1019
01:35:07,186 --> 01:35:12,390
I invite everyone to review it so that you're familiar with what the procedures are.

1020
01:35:16,113 --> 01:35:23,938
I'm looking further to the list of, yeah, the overtable list of projects.

1021
01:35:30,787 --> 01:35:35,370
So the CPA funded projects, it's a pretty remarkable list.

1022
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:41,194
It covers every project that we've ever funded and what's been completed.

1023
01:35:41,714 --> 01:35:49,939
You can see that there are still a couple of projects in progress that are old, but they're almost there.

1024
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:58,725
And then you can see the most recent projects where things are also very remarkable.

1025
01:36:00,195 --> 01:36:01,937
when we get to the very bottom of the list.

1026
01:36:02,117 --> 01:36:03,378
It just goes on and on.

1027
01:36:03,418 --> 01:36:08,502
It's incredible.

1028
01:36:09,803 --> 01:36:16,368
Last month, we had the Medford Square pop-up community garden come in, and it's already completed.

1029
01:36:17,809 --> 01:36:21,832
The next day, they're like, okay, so when do we get the money?

1030
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:24,534
I was very excited, but they're sweet.

1031
01:36:25,915 --> 01:36:27,357
Thank you for supporting that project.

1032
01:36:28,952 --> 01:36:30,133
And so we have a lot to be proud of.

1033
01:36:30,153 --> 01:36:31,614
Do you have a timeline for a second?

1034
01:36:32,255 --> 01:36:32,515
Yep.

1035
01:36:34,277 --> 01:36:35,257
Look away, everybody.

1036
01:36:35,297 --> 01:36:35,638
I'm sorry.

1037
01:36:35,678 --> 01:36:37,479
I'm fast forwarding, and that makes me nauseous.

1038
01:36:41,082 --> 01:36:41,643
I'm sorry.

1039
01:36:41,663 --> 01:36:42,784
A couple more pages, Jo.

1040
01:36:42,804 --> 01:36:43,224
I'm sorry.

1041
01:36:43,244 --> 01:36:44,305
Timeline.

1042
01:36:44,986 --> 01:36:45,626
There you go.

1043
01:36:46,347 --> 01:36:46,787
One more.

1044
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:47,368
One more.

1045
01:36:47,748 --> 01:36:50,310
There we go.

1046
01:36:50,531 --> 01:36:50,771
OK.

1047
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:55,215
I'm assuming we're still meeting on Tuesdays?

1048
01:36:56,396 --> 01:36:56,616
Yes.

1049
01:36:57,132 --> 01:37:01,753
October 13th is a Monday, that's Columbus Day or Indigenous Peoples Day.

1050
01:37:01,773 --> 01:37:06,394
Are you looking at next year's calendar?

1051
01:37:06,414 --> 01:37:10,415
This is the plan for... Oh, this is for next year.

1052
01:37:10,495 --> 01:37:11,175
Oh, thank God.

1053
01:37:11,635 --> 01:37:12,395
Not this year?

1054
01:37:14,956 --> 01:37:16,496
No, this is for Fiscal 26.

1055
01:37:16,556 --> 01:37:21,937
So this will be... That doesn't... Yeah.

1056
01:37:22,978 --> 01:37:24,318
Do you want me to have it for this...

1057
01:37:24,808 --> 01:37:25,348
past year?

1058
01:37:25,368 --> 01:37:28,909
This fiscal year, is it?

1059
01:37:29,049 --> 01:37:29,970
We're in fiscal 26.

1060
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:31,790
Yeah, we're in fiscal 26.

1061
01:37:32,711 --> 01:37:35,912
So the full applications are due in 25.

1062
01:37:35,952 --> 01:37:36,032
Yes.

1063
01:37:36,052 --> 01:37:38,733
I will make those amendments.

1064
01:37:39,173 --> 01:37:40,814
But yes, it is Tuesday.

1065
01:37:40,854 --> 01:37:42,954
So give or take a day here or there.

1066
01:37:43,094 --> 01:37:43,855
I apologize.

1067
01:37:44,355 --> 01:37:44,715
No worries.

1068
01:37:45,155 --> 01:37:52,338
So if we are meeting in 2025, October 14, I will not be available.

1069
01:37:52,418 --> 01:37:53,578
I'll be out of the country.

1070
01:37:54,633 --> 01:38:12,225
Okay, I think we were going to split up, it was October 28th and November 19th, so we may not be meeting specifically because of a, nope, that was Veterans Day lands on a Tuesday this year, so that's why.

1071
01:38:12,245 --> 01:38:17,809
Okay, I will revisit these dates and make sure everybody has them in their calendars.

1072
01:38:18,129 --> 01:38:24,033
Yeah, and while we do this, while we have the dates up, maybe we want to review, so

1073
01:38:24,577 --> 01:38:28,058
We want to talk with the Affordable Housing Trust, perhaps in September.

1074
01:38:28,138 --> 01:38:30,379
I think that's when the Affordable Housing Trust will be ready.

1075
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:36,221
October is our applicant presentations.

1076
01:38:36,261 --> 01:38:38,002
We really can't have a discussion then.

1077
01:38:38,722 --> 01:38:39,942
And then we're deliberating.

1078
01:38:40,022 --> 01:38:52,647
So the idea of actually having these conversations before, it's already too late to have them before we make the next funding round of

1079
01:38:54,435 --> 01:38:55,115
decisions.

1080
01:38:56,076 --> 01:39:01,698
So we're going to have to be doing it on the fly, just as we've done this evening.

1081
01:39:02,519 --> 01:39:15,045
So at this point, I haven't heard to tell of any applications in the housing realm beyond the trust perhaps coming back for additional funding.

1082
01:39:15,145 --> 01:39:18,546
Okay, so I don't have any housing projects on my radar currently.

1083
01:39:18,606 --> 01:39:19,707
That doesn't mean they don't exist.

1084
01:39:20,107 --> 01:39:20,347
Yeah.

1085
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:33,742
And it would be really nice to be able to transition the affordable housing trust to be making housing decisions, but they can't, like, that has to align with our funding cycle.

1086
01:39:34,563 --> 01:39:39,287
So when you redo this calendar, can you put it in order of fiscal year?

1087
01:39:39,668 --> 01:39:41,789
So let's start at the top with July.

1088
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,271
I can do that.

1089
01:39:51,205 --> 01:39:55,746
So OSR, thank you, John, I'll do that.

1090
01:39:57,187 --> 01:40:02,188
So I would suggest- Are you in August?

1091
01:40:02,208 --> 01:40:05,049
Well, there's usually a special meeting in August, Reg.

1092
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:09,891
We don't technically meet, but we have a social outing.

1093
01:40:11,111 --> 01:40:11,691
Okay.

1094
01:40:11,711 --> 01:40:14,352
Speaking of which, we need to find a date for a social outing.

1095
01:40:14,392 --> 01:40:14,992
I'm pretty sure.

1096
01:40:15,152 --> 01:40:18,053
Yeah, I have the scheduling full ready, I just need it.

1097
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:35,261
So, the affordable housing trust discussion in September, and then we wait until January or February to do historic preservation or open space recreation and then do the other 1 of thinking about guidelines.

1098
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:35,922
And how do we.

1099
01:40:37,362 --> 01:40:46,027
Um, the, the open space and recreation, we may not really need to make any big changes to what we do.

1100
01:40:46,648 --> 01:40:46,888
Right.

1101
01:40:47,108 --> 01:40:47,348
But.

1102
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,581
historic preservation, I think we do.

1103
01:40:50,242 --> 01:40:51,423
Yeah.

1104
01:40:51,803 --> 01:40:57,748
As you said earlier, we're the only ones in the city really responsible in looking at these type of projects.

1105
01:40:57,768 --> 01:41:02,672
So yeah, we should have a better guideline plan.

1106
01:41:03,973 --> 01:41:05,834
So you're thinking January for that meeting?

1107
01:41:06,395 --> 01:41:06,915
Probably.

1108
01:41:07,596 --> 01:41:09,297
Just as Fredge suggested.

1109
01:41:09,317 --> 01:41:14,561
That is the next time we have.

1110
01:41:14,661 --> 01:41:16,223
I'm going to go ahead and stop sharing.

1111
01:41:17,785 --> 01:41:18,405
look at each other.

1112
01:41:18,425 --> 01:41:21,687
All right.

1113
01:41:22,367 --> 01:41:24,048
Did we get through the agenda?

1114
01:41:24,088 --> 01:41:26,309
I have one more very, very quick thing.

1115
01:41:26,469 --> 01:41:26,749
Oh, yeah.

1116
01:41:26,769 --> 01:41:27,209
Thank you.

1117
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:32,411
And the meeting minutes, which were in the packet, but also in the packet.

1118
01:41:32,431 --> 01:41:33,572
Let me screen share.

1119
01:41:33,592 --> 01:41:45,697
I think it's time that we refresh our temporary signage that we use at CPA projects that just make the community aware of who they can follow up with.

1120
01:41:46,050 --> 01:41:53,913
The signage currently is just says Community Preservation Act funds at work with our logo, and that's great, but that's pretty much it.

1121
01:41:54,554 --> 01:41:57,075
So I can share it.

1122
01:41:57,095 --> 01:41:58,856
I think I still have it up here.

1123
01:41:58,876 --> 01:42:03,958
And then for the folks in the room, there are a few different options here.

1124
01:42:04,018 --> 01:42:11,821
But I would love to get people's feedback just really quickly on their thoughts on the proposed design.

1125
01:42:11,841 --> 01:42:14,923
I am sharing this one.

1126
01:42:16,161 --> 01:42:21,765
I like the fun.

1127
01:42:21,945 --> 01:42:23,085
So we'll put it back.

1128
01:42:23,125 --> 01:42:24,526
This is the line.

1129
01:42:25,187 --> 01:42:27,828
I tend to be a little bit of an extra person.

1130
01:42:27,968 --> 01:42:32,731
So that's why mostly I wanted to get your feedback on here to edit me.

1131
01:42:33,752 --> 01:42:36,053
But it also represents you all as well.

1132
01:42:36,153 --> 01:42:40,295
So any initial thoughts in the room right now?

1133
01:42:40,315 --> 01:42:44,578
It sounds like folks like the very first one.

1134
01:42:45,315 --> 01:42:49,117
where it's got the square logo on the top left and the QR code on the right.

1135
01:42:49,937 --> 01:42:50,418
I agree.

1136
01:42:50,438 --> 01:42:52,759
I like how big the QR code is in this one too.

1137
01:42:52,779 --> 01:42:54,360
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

1138
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,760
That's a bigger QR code.

1139
01:42:56,481 --> 01:42:57,081
I agree.

1140
01:42:58,242 --> 01:42:58,702
Excellent.

1141
01:43:02,604 --> 01:43:03,044
That was it.

1142
01:43:03,064 --> 01:43:04,265
All right, I will order those.

1143
01:43:04,365 --> 01:43:10,368
And the idea is that this would turn around and point to that QR code would redirect folks to our website, which

1144
01:43:11,387 --> 01:43:16,429
One of our lovely repeat interns is going to help me with updating that shortly.

1145
01:43:16,449 --> 01:43:21,532
I know, John, you're very excited about that, aren't you?

1146
01:43:22,872 --> 01:43:23,993
I have notes here.

1147
01:43:24,233 --> 01:43:26,734
I have notes on my desk to help you with that.

1148
01:43:26,754 --> 01:43:31,656
Well, maybe we can find a date where all three of us are available.

1149
01:43:31,716 --> 01:43:33,497
Yeah, of course you can keep it.

1150
01:43:33,517 --> 01:43:33,757
Sure.

1151
01:43:33,977 --> 01:43:34,177
Yeah.

1152
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:37,491
Just right now, that's going to get a bumper sticker.

1153
01:43:37,731 --> 01:43:40,032
Yes.

1154
01:43:40,152 --> 01:43:47,015
It'll take a couple weeks for the signs to come in.

1155
01:43:47,075 --> 01:43:50,797
So hopefully, that kind of sets up a deadline of updating the website.

1156
01:43:52,478 --> 01:43:54,198
But thank you very much for that feedback.

1157
01:43:54,238 --> 01:43:55,159
I really appreciate it.

1158
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:56,659
Can you tell us the pictures?

1159
01:43:56,819 --> 01:44:00,801
Is it Wackling Court and then the McGlynn Playground?

1160
01:44:01,742 --> 01:44:02,222
Keep going.

1161
01:44:02,262 --> 01:44:02,642
You got it.

1162
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:07,194
And then obviously the condensation and I don't know, Brooks Estate maybe?

1163
01:44:07,854 --> 01:44:10,797
Yeah, that's the Brooks Estate.

1164
01:44:14,441 --> 01:44:22,649
Yeah, that's kind of been the branding I've been using and I think it's important to stay consistent with it so that people have recognition.

1165
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:26,893
So thank you for... It's a good thing that you double as a graphic designer.

1166
01:44:27,891 --> 01:44:55,461

1185
01:45:17,653 --> 01:45:18,053
Second.

1186
01:45:18,073 --> 01:45:19,874
All right.

1187
01:45:20,014 --> 01:45:21,014

Jeremy.

1197
01:45:29,075 --> 01:45:29,355
Yes.

1198
01:45:30,175 --> 01:45:30,636

01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:43,765
One last thing, Brooks Estate Pitnick is this Saturday, 12 to 3, if anyone wants to come for some free food and a free tour.

1204
01:45:45,006 --> 01:45:45,966
I'll be there.

1205
01:45:46,086 --> 01:45:46,687
Bring an ice cream.

1206
01:45:47,265 --> 01:45:49,086
Thank you.

1207
01:45:49,206 --> 01:46:02,810
I also wanted to flag since we're not meeting in August, I will probably be out in September because I'm due with our 1st kid at the end of August.

1208
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:04,950
So see you guys in a while.

1209
01:46:08,511 --> 01:46:09,912
And good luck tomorrow night too.

1210
01:46:12,655 --> 01:46:14,016
You are doing the Lord's work.

1211
01:46:14,056 --> 01:46:14,376
Thank you.
