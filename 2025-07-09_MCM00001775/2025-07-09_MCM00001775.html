    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=13.724">So</a>  let's take the roll. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=16.006">Oh,</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=17.467">Do</a>  we always do that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=18.288">We're</a>  supposed to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=31.242">So</a>  I have a couple members of the public in here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=41.527">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=44.068">So,</a>  um, I have a reg. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=48.65">Adam</a>  Doug.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=50.611">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=51.931">Jeremy</a>  here.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=54.272">Joe</a>  here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=56.813">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=58.174">Here,</a>  just moving to the room with air conditioning.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=61.325">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=62.825">And</a>  did I get everyone? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=64.566">And</a>  myself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=69.887">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=71.107">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=73.187">So</a>  got that out of the way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=74.748">We</a>  will first item on the agenda is to revisit the off-cycle application from the Medford Armory emergency building restoration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=83.669">So</a>  thank you for coming back again for a second time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=88.81">with</a>  more clarification on your application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=92.052">So</a>  I would invite you to share with us what you have filled in since the last time you were here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=99.719">Okay,</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=101.26">First</a>  of all, I did contact the unit owner that has the water seepage coming in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=107.265">He</a>  did apply to his insurance company, because I remember you asked that question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=112.549">They</a>  denied him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=113.991">And</a>  then we went to our master policy <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=117.508">And</a>  we were also denied because they said the word seepage is a no-no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=123.709">And</a>  unless it's within 14 days of the original water coming in, that it would not be covered. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=133.871">So</a>  we did go back to JMS. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=137.372">We</a>  kind of fine-tuned their contract. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=141.253">We</a>  got information regarding their scope of work and also <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=146.104">They</a>  did give us the pictures and the information regarding historic buildings that they have done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=153.388">We've</a>  also had several good discussions about bringing in some type of community opportunity to the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=162.814">We</a>  discussed possibly doing a veterans, at least twice a year, bringing in veterans and doing a meeting and coffee and everything, because it was <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=174.23">originally,</a>  you know, an army facility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=177.551">We</a>  thought that that would be a really good thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=181.113">And</a>  also, too, we looked into possibly like a Christmas jingle bells theme lighting up the outside front of the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=190.597">So</a>  that's where we are now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=193.612">So</a>  we have that space, that lobby space, which is very nice, which could accommodate meetings and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=199.015">So</a>  we thought that was a good idea, especially geared toward the veterans, because we are an armory. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=203.056">It</a>  seemed like it made for a nice fit.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=207.218">And</a>  just to add on top of that, just the veterans piece, speaking as city staff, the veterans office has been engaging in monthly coffee and cookies with veterans at various spots around the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=218.863">They</a>  want to be going to different places so that they can reach everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=222.551">I</a>  just wanted to add that color to the comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=225.092">Yeah,</a>  so we looked into that too.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=226.913">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=232.035">So</a>  one of the things that had been outstanding previously was to have a better understanding of the budget, of exactly what was the short-term emergency ask, and the bigger picture of how much work you're doing and what the <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=251.711">what</a>  the Condo Association is putting toward the total package of work that needs to be done.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=257.535">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=258.056">So</a>  as the emergency, we did start out with a much lower bid, but it was only to do an area of, say, 14 feet of the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=271.166">When</a>  we went back to the other contractors, everybody seemed to be in agreement that you can't just do, like, from this window to this window. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=279.892">because</a>  water up above could move. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=282.532">So</a>  then it was thought that the best way to handle this and make sure the issue was alleviated was to do one third of the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=292.434">And</a>  that was considered the emergency, which was their quote for the 616. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=297.135">Out</a>  of that, we have already determined that the other 50% would come from the unit owners and the specialists. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=309.145">and</a>  give them three months to pay that, because I don't believe any work would be starting until September. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=317.771">I</a>  mean, we're going to be into August before we know it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=320.633">So</a>  based on that and that amount of money, and there's 32 units, people do own more than one unit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=331.941">So</a>  I would say I'll estimate 30 units altogether. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=337.749">And</a>  based on their square footage, they will be assessed for that portion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=343.491">If</a>  we have an issue with somebody paying a special assessment, because some unit owners have very small units, maybe 600, 700 square feet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=352.814">And</a>  if it was an issue, then we also have a reserve and an equity line that we could dip into for what they can't pay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=364.037">But</a>  we definitely want to move forward right away.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=366.977">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=367.758">So</a>  if I read the budget correctly, the ask of the CPA today is $37,280? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=373.682">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=374.722">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=375.583">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=378.685">Are</a>  there questions from committee members?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=388.892">Just</a>  one question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=391.353">We</a>  were talking before the meeting started about the <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=395.188">the</a>  repointing of the brick and granite. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=397.65">I</a>  just paged through the documents that describe the detail of what's going to be done, but I didn't see any reference. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=406.354">They</a>  mentioned what type of mortar, how they're going to cut it, et cetera. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=410.136">But</a>  they don't mention anything about the historic color or shape of that joint. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=418.76">Some</a>  joints are like convex, some are angles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=422.202">There's</a>  something that Soca Tech as a historic architect should know what that original joint would have been for a building of this more than 120 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=433.527">It's</a>  a small detail, but before you do it, I think it just began to be consistent with the standards that we need to follow, the federal standards. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=442.832">We</a>  just make sure that detail needs to be there for, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=446.754">knowing</a>  what the correct color and the right mixes and the right shape of that, whatever that joint is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=455.136">And</a>  maybe historic photos will tell them, but usually it's a database. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=460.237">They</a>  should know that as historical architects.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=463.237">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=463.677">And</a>  I know he did mention that any bricks that needed to be replaced are going to be matched as close as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=473.714">But</a>  you're right, he did not mention, you know, the water, the mix. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=477.556">He</a>  did mention the type they were going to use and everything, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=481.058">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=482.139">It's</a>  listed in the color and the mix, but I just can't tell if it's a historic one or not because it's not the history. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=486.721">The</a>  historic nature is not listed there in the details.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=490.303">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=491.684">Oh,</a>  I got that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=492.405">Good</a>  point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=493.125">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=493.285">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=495.048">I</a>  really appreciate, Doug, you providing that input. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=498.451">That's</a>  why we have a member of the Historical Commission serving on the CPC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=503.835">In</a>  the community where I work, in Somerville, they actually require all historic projects to go to the Historical Commission as a whole board before they can receive CPA funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=522.497">so</a>  that they can get that kind of input, that kind of direction to make sure that they're following the guidelines for historic preservation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=533.681">So</a>  that's really, I think, really important information to make sure that you, and perhaps if there's any question, you might be able to ask members of the Historical Commission for further guidance <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=552.35">as</a>  um yeah as needed as um uh just to for um advisory comments no it's a great point something i'm happy to facilitate too so i talk with his i talk with ryan hayward at the commission every day okay good have a meeting scheduled with the contract the next</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=580.264">Tuesday,</a>  Wednesday? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=581.364">Wednesday,</a>  the 17th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=582.825">To</a>  kind of go over the final details and kind of lock things into place, contracts, things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=589.466">So</a>  if we have questions, we'll reach out.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=593.707">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=597.968">Something</a>  that I wish that I had the forethought to bring in hand to the meeting would be a suggestion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=607.39">So</a>  I really appreciate the <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=609.903">ideas</a>  that you brought up for community, like allowing for community access. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=614.866">And</a>  I would love to be able to suggest that if the CPC recommends funding, we could attach a condition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=621.81">And</a>  now I need to, did we? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=624.811">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=626.852">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=627.913">Set</a>  up on the screen right now, would you like me to share it with everybody? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=631.395">Sure,</a>  that would be helpful because then we could wordsmith it together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=637.392">Oh,</a>  that's, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=638.413">Thank</a>  you so much for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=639.474">I</a>  try to be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=658.588">I'm</a>  working without a mouse right now, so please forgive me if I'm a little clunky on that computer today.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=664.573">I'd</a>  like to see more of what that little thing has.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=668.877">Oh,</a>  I don't know what to say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=670.257">I</a>  hope it was okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=673.358">So</a>  this was the condition, right?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=675.938">The</a>  applicant will work with the Community Preservation Act manager to coordinate up to two public events, which the project building at 925th Street will be open to the public, these events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=685.72">Up</a>  to two public events ever or annually? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=688.301">What</a>  do you think? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=695.222">I</a>  would like to see annually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=697.673">In</a>  perpetuity or?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=700.774">So</a>  I, it's like perpetuity is very strong language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=706.094">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=707.315">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=707.375">And</a>  Joan has her hand raised. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=711.555">Joan,</a>  while we think about that.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=713.716">I'm</a>  sure that if Doug wanted to add a condition related to his comment, it can be general, not specific.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=724.337">Is</a>  that maybe perhaps encompassed in his first condition here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=731.279">It</a>  does have sections speaking to masonry joinery or something.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=736.421">It</a>  is, but also it might like a little bit more specificity might help to ensure that it's like technically understood.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=760.601">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=761.402">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=762.203">I'm</a>  going to finish my thought on the rest of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=768.107">Restored</a>  into historically accurate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=775.493">That's</a>  not a word. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=786.375">It's</a>  always really fun when you're typing on the fly and everybody's watching and it's being recorded. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=791.377">Great</a>  job.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=793.357">I'm</a>  happy to amend that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=794.677">I</a>  got the word proper and then I think it isn't redundant.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=801.079">We</a>  were largely talking about the mortar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=804.58">Was</a>  there anything else besides the mortar we're talking about?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=807.601">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=808.361">In</a>  my head, I was thinking mortar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=811.62">make</a>  that an extra service profile of the worker and the workers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=820.283">How</a>  do you feel about that, Doug?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=825.345">I</a>  would just add in color as well, materials, profile, and color.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=833.507">I</a>  can do that.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=837.969">That's</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=839.689">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=840.21">Let's</a>  back to this one.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=842.551">Annually.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=848.053">When</a>  we say up to two, do we mean at least one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=853.375">To</a>  put an upper limit on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=856.076">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=856.536">We</a>  could say one to two.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=863.819">One,</a>  two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=869.241">Public</a>  events annually.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=872.518">Live</a>  ears or what are you putting as the limit on this?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=876.642">So</a>  actually, I'm so I'm thinking, I don't know if this goes in the conditions of approval, but I would like to amend or create general conditions for all of our grants that require that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=895.646">there</a>  not be changes to the work that's done for a period of years that is commensurate with the object that's being, the asset that's being approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=907.151">In</a>  this case, say 30 years is a reasonable amount of time to require that the asset not be changed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=920.717">Or,</a>  and then perhaps to have a step down of <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=925.938">If</a>  it's changed within 10 years, some percent has to be paid back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=931.7">15</a>  or 20 years, some percent has to be paid back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=935.802">Up</a>  to after 30 years, it doesn't have to be repaid. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=940.184">So</a>  if we were to envision a timeline on this that is pegged to the timeframe in which we are asking for the <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=954.132">asset</a>  to be preserved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=960.434">Do</a>  committee members have a feeling about what a timeline would be reasonable to ask for one or two annual events?</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=974.937">I'd</a>  like to go back to the conversation about in perpetuity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=977.898">I</a>  wonder if that can be caveated with <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=984.058">reconsideration</a>  at a certain time frame, rather than limiting the requirement to only a set number of years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=992.161">You</a>  know, in my experience, when you're trying to <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=997.948">I</a>  appreciate what the applicant is doing to offer these public engagement opportunities, but I feel like we're stretching to make it work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1005.05">And</a>  those are the hardest ones to sustain. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1007.67">So</a>  I think putting some emphasis on sustaining that public engagement has value. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1015.012">So</a>  I'd ask that we consider a condition that requires this annually, but that it could be, that could be revisited in 10 years or something like that, or five years, whatever the group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1027.944">I</a>  thought was reasonable.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1029.765">Well,</a>  I'm also just thinking about the fact that it's like a bunch of condo owners that might be different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1036.147">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1036.447">Like</a>  10 years from now that might have, I mean, the building is going to be the same, but like they might not agree to that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1043.469">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1044.029">So</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1044.99">Although</a>  they, um, you know, like this is actually, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1049.943">Because</a>  I had a project like this in Somerville that really became extremely difficult when we got down to this level of detail. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1057.767">And</a>  so, yeah, this is really where the meat of it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1062.55">So</a>  for one thing, I think 30 years is the longest that you can have <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1073.863">a</a>  stipulation in a contract that doesn't require state approval to override. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1082.925">Like,</a>  for example, if you want to have a preservation restriction, after 30 years or in perpetuity, you have to have the state as a partner to that, but up to 30 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1098.359">It</a>  could just be the city of preservation restriction could be something that we ask for here, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1105.022">And</a>  I, that is something that I suggested asking for, and some of our previous projects, and we have asked for that and I'm starting to, like, based on my experience with a lot of projects that I've been involved with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1120.293">starting</a>  to think that something smaller scale and more fine-tuned is a better ask than a permanent preservation restriction in every case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1130.975">So</a>  that's why I was suggesting earlier that we might incorporate a requirement for like a clawback up to 30 years if something is changed, and that could be applicable to <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1146.939">any</a>  kind of project, not just a historic preservation project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1151.742">Did</a>  you have something you wanted to say, Reg?</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1154.664">With</a>  all due respect, we're only asking for $37,000 to repair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1159.787">So</a>  I'm thinking a 30-year commitment from the applicant is a little bit on the steep side, in my estimation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1173.676">I'm</a>  thinking maybe a 10-year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1176.416">Um,</a>  commitment might be a little bit more applicable in this case, since they're only asking for repairs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1184.281">That's</a>  just my thoughts on the matter.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1186.623">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1187.904">Jerry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1190.265">On</a>  that point, and I'm sorry, this was mentioned earlier, but the project's planned in 3 phases. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1197.01">Does</a>  the applicant intend to anticipate that they'll come back to the CPC for more funding for those future phases?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1206.411">We</a>  may, we may, depending, you know, basically on how this goes and how the repair goes moving forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1215.376">We</a>  had discussed it with Teresa from the beginning for, you know, a larger scale for the full project, but then decided we would be better served to scale it down and go with what is definitely an emergency <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1234.102">At</a>  this point, that needs to be done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1236.003">Future</a>  funding, we were looking at a four to five year project to get the entire building done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1245.766">And</a>  I know you were talking about, you know, the length of time, and a lot, I was in the mortgage industry for many years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1254.048">Anybody</a>  that got any type of funding from city, town, whatever, they would put a 10 year moratorium to say, okay, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1262.844">you</a>  know, we're going to give you this money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1264.685">And</a>  then, you know, if things change, and you don't go by our contract, then you have to pay back.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1274.107">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1274.588">Otherwise,</a>  you know, moving forward after 10 years, it goes away.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1279.109">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1280.109">So</a>  that's consistent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1281.07">It</a>  might be something we could do like, I mean, I think we're amenable to a 10 year period. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1285.971">But</a>  it'd be something that we could revisit if we do come back.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1288.832">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1290.353">And</a>  I appreciate also to Reg's point that for this amount of money, we asked for 10 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1296.498">And</a>  if you come back next year or two years, then an additional amount of money might come with an additional block of time that we're committing to public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1308.827">So</a>  that gives some room for growth on both sides. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1316.754">And</a>  to your question about what to do about the condo owners who are, you know, our future condo owners have the opportunity to agree to the terms that we're agreeing to right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1330.62">And,</a>  you know, if we were to put a restriction in place, we would be filing an instrument at the Registry of Deeds, and that would be attached to the deed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1343.332">This</a>  is not a document that's going to be filed at the registry, but if it were helpful to create a lien or something that can be reported so that future condo buyers see that this requirement is attached to the deed, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1369.43">I</a>  don't, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1370.25">You</a>  can tell me if you think that that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1373.232">So</a>  we've gone back and forth and I have got counsel with regards to the bylaws of the association. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1379.975">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1380.875">And</a>  as trustees, the trustees make all the decisions and the unit owners have to abide by it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1389.038">The</a>  trustees can say, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1391.297">We</a>  want a million dollars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1392.879">Yeah,</a>  they have to come up, you know, so it kind of it gives us as trustees a little more ability to do something like this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1402.554">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1402.994">So</a>  this I think this, I mean, this would be binding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1406.351">on</a>  us as the board of trustees, which will then make it binding on our unit owners. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1411.432">So</a>  if we get voted out, this new board of trustees is still bound by the same condition.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1419.094">It</a>  would be recorded somewhere in your guidelines, your judgment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1425.636">Okay,</a>  that makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1426.796">Joan?</a> </p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1431.435">Through</a>  the chair, I have a question for Doug. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1433.956">I</a>  mean, if this building is already on, like, a historic register, whether it's Medford's or the state's, there are some conditions or requirements around changing this building anyway, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1445.54">So</a>  they would have to get permission from some other entity if they were trying to make a change that would affect this restoration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1454.043">Is</a>  that true? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1467.115">Right,</a>  so basically either commission or the state must have some say in any changes to a building that's deemed historically significant or preferably preserved, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1478.84">So</a>  it's not just this condition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1482.442">It</a>  would be a higher thing to get over in order to make changes to this building that would affect the restoration that's being contemplated here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1494.388">Is</a>  that right?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1496.079">I</a>  think it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1496.76">I'll</a>  give you an example. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1498.58">If</a>  the windows were all replaced, we did this with Chevalier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1501.682">Chevalier</a>  had to deal with their historic windows. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1504.684">It's</a>  a newer building than this is, but only by about a couple of decades, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1510.807">Yes,</a>  there are definitely other entities, but everything that we're seeing here, it's restoration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1519.62">of</a>  what's there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1520.241">We're</a>  not changing any fabric. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1522.763">We're</a>  not really doing anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1525.906">It's</a>  more than maintenance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1526.907">It's</a>  restoration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1527.908">That's</a>  why the mortar is what it is, not what's off the shelf right now that you would buy in any mason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1535.736">You've</a>  got a mason that has an architect who has historic qualifications, which is important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1544.002">and</a>  a requirement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1545.843">But</a>  I kind of agree with what Roberta said earlier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1548.404">It</a>  wouldn't be a bad idea to get Ryan Hayward involved, who actually designs a lot of historic buildings and renovates a lot of historic buildings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1557.548">He's</a>  the co-chair of the commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1559.589">He</a>  works a lot with Teresa and the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1564.451">And</a>  he's definitely one of the most knowledgeable people in the city of Medford for historic resources. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1571.014">So</a>  I think we have a meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1574.592">And</a>  next week, you know, we could easily, I think, probably shoehorn you in if I can get, if I can talk to them on the agenda, if we wanted to, you know, keep this process moving as quickly as possible, which I know is important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1589.303">And</a>  we can get some answers by then from Soca Tech and a few details on the mortar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1595.107">I</a>  think, you know, a 15-minute conversation with the commission would go a long way, I think.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1603.442">So</a>  I wanted to also respond to Joan's question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1607.985">I</a>  don't know if Doug heard the entire question, but you asked if being on the historic register offers a level of protection and review from some other historic preservation entity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1625.977">And</a>  being listed on the register does not offer any such protection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1632.108">If</a>  the building were in a local historic district, or if it had a preservation restriction, then some other entity, our local historic district commission would have say over, like, would have to review the project and say, you know, whether they approved of the of the changes to the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1656.875">But</a>  in this case, that isn't cast in stone, but as Doug offered, they could do it as an advisory review, not a required review.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1669.421">Yeah,</a>  I agree with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1672.482">You're</a>  right, Roberta. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1673.803">When</a>  I found out that there's 31 buildings in Medford, I think, that are on the National Register, but the protection is not as robust as I thought it was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1683.518">when</a>  you get down to brass tacks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1684.799">I</a>  mean, the historic commission, if somebody tried to make a change to the face of one of those buildings, we would have control of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1692.426">But</a>  it's remarkably little protection, given you think that a state and national register declaration would mean something more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1701.174">But</a>  in the real world, it doesn't.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1717.432">Any</a>  further questions or discussion about this request? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1728.879">Would</a>  anyone from the committee like to move to recommend funding for this project, applying the conditions of approval as presented on the screen? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1745.695">And</a>  the amount of funding would be $37,280. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1747.056">There's</a>  $38,000 listed on here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1748.117">So</a>  it looks like Teresa might have rounded up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1750.619">I</a>  did.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1752.36">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1752.72">That</a>  looks better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1774.376">And</a>  I'll second Reg's move.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1778.097">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1778.858">And</a>  I will call the roll. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1780.718">Maisha?</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1785.8">I</a>  didn't hear what you said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1787.161">Oh,</a>  yeah, I can't hear you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1791.502">I'll</a>  come back to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1792.423">You</a>  can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1794.604">Reg?</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1795.344">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1796.044">Ada?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1796.464">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1797.084">Doug?</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1798.285">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1799.585">Jeremy?</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1800.746">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1801.966">Joan?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1803.227">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1804.426">Ari?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1805.707">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1807.388">Aisha?</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1809.19">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1810.591">Yeah,</a>  me too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1811.872">And</a>  myself, yes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1814.354">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1815.575">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1816.936">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1817.596">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1819.989">A</a>  little stressful for me, because it first time and not knowing what to do or expect, but thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1826.47">It's</a>  a new one for us, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1828.65">So,</a>  yeah, thank you for being with us while we work out how it works.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1832.991">It's</a>  a good learning process for everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1835.372">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1835.672">Especially</a>  for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1836.632">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1837.432">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1839.792">We</a>  just also want to lend our thanks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1841.733">This</a>  is Sasha and Marnie, trustee and co-owner here, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1845.713">Thank</a>  you, everybody.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1846.513">Thank</a>  you, Sasha. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1848.674">Thank</a>  you, Marnie. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1851.143">I'll</a>  reach out to you tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1859.749">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1863.993">We</a>  switched over a couple of years ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1866.535">We</a>  deal with a local agent, Bates Insurance in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1871.499">They've</a>  been here forever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1874.481">Arcadia,</a>  I believe, is the insurance company that insures us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1880.442">And</a>  we did actually, do you do insurance? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1885.804">Not</a>  anymore.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1887.425">Not</a>  anymore.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1889.526">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1890.666">Thank</a>  you again very much and we will leave you to carry on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1896.189">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1897.289">Good</a>  luck with your project.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1899.49">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1900.751">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1902.171">Thanks</a>  for supporting me.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1903.412">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1904.492">The</a>  lights will come on, I promise.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1909.109">I</a>  have a thought about just this process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1912.351">It</a>  seems like part of the hangup is that they are a historical building, however, they are not a public building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1919.875">And</a>  I wonder if coming out of this, we might just have a set of things we tell someone who's applying in that situation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1928.999">I</a>  would love that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1930.22">It's</a>  obviously different if it's a public building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1934.533">But</a>  in this, like if we are just going to be funding projects in private buildings like this, then like maybe we should have like specific criteria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1941.776">And</a>  it's like, are you willing to do these things as almost like a point of entry to even come here in the first place? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1946.978">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1949.079">I</a>  totally agree.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1950.86">I'm</a>  actually, I just put out an RFP in Somerville to hire a consultant to help us draft those guidelines because it is like every project becomes so complicated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1963.565">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1964.621">And</a>  I think because we've already done it this way for so long, it's hard to change to something else without really documenting how you got there and why you're making that change.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1983.197">This</a>  one was difficult. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1984.778">This</a>  one was difficult because it became not only a public building, but a historical <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=1992.606">building,</a>  which has its own set of rules and guidelines and processes and so on and so forth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2000.392">I</a>  mean, Doug probably can speak to that, obviously, better than any of us are on the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2007.918">But</a>  that makes it very, very unique.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2012.122">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2012.502">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2012.882">And</a>  once you have something unique, and quite frankly, to me, it's new. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2016.806">I</a>  don't know if you've ever done anything like this before.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2021.98">We</a>  had an application very similar to this in Somerville last year that was for residential condos for a building that was originally built by the city and converted to condos. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2035.745">And</a>  honestly, the application fell apart in the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2039.767">The</a>  committee spent several meetings trying to put together a set of conditions, and ultimately the condo association said, no, we can't abide by those conditions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2050.143">And</a>  that's why I'm hiring a consultant to help us figure out how to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2055.226">Because</a>  the conditions that we were putting on in Somerville were more stringent than what we talked about this evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2063.35">And</a>  if we had talked about those same conditions this evening, they probably would have said, no, we can't do it and walked out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2070.073">So</a>  yeah, agreed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2074.167">You</a>  know, your point about making an ask that's commensurate with what we're giving them is a good point, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2083.253">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2084.234">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2087.036">Yeah,</a>  I just want to just chime in a couple things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2089.237">I</a>  think this is somewhat of a unique situation, because if this building wasn't an International Writers' General Report building for Medford, it probably wouldn't have gotten over the finish line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2101.683">And</a>  I don't want to set a precedent, as I mentioned in our last meeting of being the, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2109.345">for</a>  the private sector being the big brain maker for their renovation restoration projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2116.331">This</a>  was to me the kickstarter to get things going, but I don't think they should be coming back for any more money or not a lot of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2124.798">Because</a>  we have so many big needs of the parks and other things in the city, publicly owned and otherwise, that I feel like it's not a good optical look to be spending money on a building that <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2137.347">I</a>  still think it's worth tens of millions of dollars overall with 31 condo owners, private businesses in that building.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2148.013">And</a>  off-cycle.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2149.894">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2150.975">So</a>  actually, this all leads me to <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2158.585">A</a>  question, so I think that this is a really important topic for us to discuss. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2164.149">Is</a>  this too far off the reservation for us to go more deeply into this subject today? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2172.615">So</a>  we should put this on the agenda for a future meeting to talk about historic preservation guidelines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2183.629">for</a>  privately owned properties. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2185.39">And</a>  it could be guidelines for all properties. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2187.812">I</a>  mean, really, guidelines for all of our work should really be on the table.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2193.636">Could</a>  we legally, as a CPC, just say we are not going to fund historical work in private buildings? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2200.181">We</a>  could. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2200.602">So</a>  we could potentially make that declaration.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2205.005">As</a>  long as we spend 10% of our funds on historic preservation, then <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2211.962">we're</a>  meeting our obligation.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2213.763">That</a>  would be a really clear guideline.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2221.366">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2221.887">We're</a>  eliminating all the sessions that we might have to have.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2225.748">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2226.129">You</a>  know, just say, no, we're not doing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2228.67">Stop.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2229.57">Stop.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2230.151">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2230.311">It's</a>  the headphones.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2241.535">Oh,</a>  there you are.</p>

    <p>[Myisha Majumder]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2245.517">OK,</a>  can you hear me? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2246.838">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2247.438">OK,</a>  awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2248.519">Now</a>  I don't even remember what my question was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2250.68">That</a>  was not what I was testing with my hand, I promise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2255.983">Yeah,</a>  is there a way to understand how other towns have kind of dealt with a similar, or cities have dealt with similar issues? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2265.749">I</a>  know you've drawn a little bit on your experience in Somerville, but I'm curious if you can draw on experiences from other cities as well.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2272.998">I'll</a>  take that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2273.959">So</a>  Roberta, in all of her amazing glory, she actually manages a once a month peer network call where it's, is it about, is it every four weeks or six weeks? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2284.224">It's</a>  once a month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2285.105">Once</a>  a month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2286.446">Where</a>  all the other CPA managers and all, it's open to everybody in Massachusetts, cities, towns as well, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2295.651">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2295.891">Okay,</a>  I got it.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2297.352">My</a>  bad. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2300.17">So</a>  we often come to those meetings with, hey, I have this niche weird application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2305.111">Who</a>  else has dealt with something like this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2307.152">So</a>  we have a really good rapport in being able to talk amongst many different types of municipalities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2313.713">Greenfield</a>  is always on there, so I get to hear about how it goes out in Western Mass versus here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2319.315">We</a>  also do have a coalition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2321.535">It's</a>  the Community Preservation Coalition, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2325.445">Amongst</a>  other things, it does provide us with some technical assistance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2330.129">I</a>  wouldn't say it's legal advice, but some counsel that we can take back to applicants as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2339.576">So</a>  we do have some resources out there to bounce these niche type of applications off of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2345.621">And</a>  I certainly will bring this one to our next meeting to talk about, just for future applications of funding privately on buildings like this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2355.364">Because</a>  we had to discuss on one of those calls about 80 years recently.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2360.289">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2361.19">And</a>  I mean, one of the, regarding privately owned buildings, one of the things that won this project over for me was the fact that they were so amenable to opening their space for public events, even once a year, that's valuable.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2379.297">I</a>  mean, they've got to do something related to Veterans Day, like with the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2384.142">They</a>  should work with City Hall to do something in their venue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2386.924">Yeah,</a>  exactly.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2388.126">And</a>  their willingness to talk about doing that enables us to turn a private space into a space that serves the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2400.229">Um,</a>  you know, here I am grabbing the last word and saying, let's move on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2404.512">Um,</a>  I feel like, um, I, I, this is a conversation that we should put on an agenda for a future meeting, but if anyone has any thoughts about like topic bubbles that we should cover in that future discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2427.428">Um,</a>  you can mention them now, or maybe send them by email to Teresa so that we can maybe do a little bit of research and, um, bring some. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2440.911">Yeah,</a>  yeah, sure.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2444.932">I'm</a>  recalling the guy who came to us with his 2 chimneys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2448.453">Do</a>  you remember that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2449.373">That</a>  was yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2450.413">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2453.115">I</a>  think we did not fund him because we didn't have any public use, except he kept saying, oh, they look good from the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2460.397">Well,</a>  that wasn't enough, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2462.717">So</a>  I think there's definitely some lines to draw around this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2468.699">And</a>  clearly, we've funded private before, but they're usually nonprofits, like churches and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2475.86">So</a>  we'll bring in that as a sort of point to put into the plan or process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2483.474">Yeah,</a>  and that's- Stop, Jeremy, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2488.515">I</a>  was gonna go off topic, so here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2492.637">And</a>  I was just gonna mention, and I'm sorry if it was discussed at a meeting I missed, but a few meetings ago, we talked about talking more about our sort of relationship, working relationship with the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2507.621">I</a>  don't know if we came back around to that in more detail. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2512.568">I'd</a>  throw that out there as another topic to get into more discussion about that.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2519.775">Thank</a>  you for bringing that back up again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2521.597">That</a>  has been something that I've been discussing with Roberta as well as the chairperson for the trust and my city colleagues who support the trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2531.25">They</a>  will actually, I'll pause for a moment and plug that there is, is it a hearing or is it just a big meeting on July 30th for the trust? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2539.055">Is</a>  that technically a hearing?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2540.796">A</a>  community meeting to present the Affordable Housing Trust action plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2544.919">Right,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2545.479">Yeah,</a>  I don't think we're advertising it with legal ads.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2549.902">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2551.263">So</a>  the idea is the action plan is coming out from the trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2555.225">They're</a>  going to talk about it at the July 30th meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2558.321">And</a>  then we're really hoping that some public comment that might come from there, as well as some just good dialogue, might help us inform how we move forward as a CPA granting authority with the trust as we look at housing applications. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2572.227">So</a>  thank you for remembering that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2574.188">And</a>  don't be a squeegee wheel about it, Jeremy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2575.849">Keep</a>  going. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2577.45">But</a>  that is something that we're going to probably bring up, hopefully, at either a September, potentially September</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2590.456">It</a>  just so happens that on the past commission, we have a low in winter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2597.318">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2598.238">And</a>  we designate January as the meeting date when we are going to discuss all off topic, um, issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2608.301">Um,</a>  so we set off these guidelines, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2613.62">And</a>  I know that by that time, we will have given the City Council our recommendations, and they will be voting on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2622.445">I</a>  would think that we could probably use our January meeting as a springboard, depending on what we get for applications this year, because there might be something that's untoward in one of those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2636.092">We</a>  might run into a similar situation right off the bat, and then we have to move it up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2642.851">Collectively,</a>  if we grab all of these topics and have a specific meeting, whereas we don't discuss anything else except off topic.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2653.658">I</a>  feel like that could end up being a six hour meeting, but it's a great idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2657.501">I'm</a>  not breaking discouraging it, but we're fixing Medford in this committee so that those conversations can be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2666.227">We</a>  really like thorough discussions.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2670.605">I</a>  mean, this is all theoretically a part of our annual review process, like us reflecting on our program and thinking about how do we make program improvements to do it better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2682.991">So</a>  that's a great segue to the annual plan that we've worked on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2686.453">I</a>  don't know if everyone did their homework and read the plan in advance, but Teresa and I were doing some heavy editing today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2695.498">during</a>  the day, so the plan that you look at this evening might be different than the one that you saw yesterday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2702.962">I</a>  think that's the application.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2709.285">I'm</a>  just realizing our applicants took my copies of the plan that I had printed up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2718.129">I'm</a>  very sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2721.711">I</a>  will screen share. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2722.611">They're</a>  getting an education.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2725.465">Um,</a>  so I want to put a pin in that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2727.427">I</a>  just want to make a note that yes, we should schedule the conversations and maybe it would be helpful before we leave this evening to pencil in the dates that we think that we could cover each of these topics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2740.437">And</a>  given the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2748.837">I</a>  think some of these things are sensitive to the decisions that we want to make about this funding cycle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2755.142">So</a>  I don't know if we want to wait until after the funding cycle is over before we figure out how it's going to work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2762.947">So</a>  it would be really great if we're able to integrate over the next few months, like say, we cover one topic each month over the next few months, iron out some <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2778.293">rather</a>  than lumping it all in one page. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2780.434">And</a>  it'd be helpful to also have the conditions, like the general conditions for all the committee members to see so that we know that our concerns are covered in the contracts, the grant agreements that the applicants end up signing.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2799.225">That</a>  sounds like a plan.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2800.285">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2801.066">So</a>  we'll flip through the annual <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2808.281">The</a>  purpose of this plan update is to provide information about the CPA program and the amount of funding that's available and how we plan to disperse it over the next year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2821.453">So</a>  the first section covers all of that financial information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2830.11">and</a>  describes the projects that we funded in the last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2835.694">This</a>  is a lot of information that was presented over the last couple of months when we had our annual public hearing.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2843.039">This</a>  is essentially a summary of the various talking points that we've been reviewing the past few months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2854.488">But</a>  we share this with the public so that they're informed about what it is we're all doing here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2859.129">We're</a>  obviously in it and doing it, but this is a public-facing plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2868.391">It</a>  also is like 30 pages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2870.612">30</a>  pages, but it's very dense with information, including several pages of</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2881.994">progress</a>  reports for all of the projects that we've ever funded.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2888.02">Did</a>  you want to look at anything specific or down? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2891.023">I</a>  can keep scrolling. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2892.104">Yeah,</a>  I can keep scrolling through this section.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2897.068">Can</a>  I ask a question? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2898.93">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2900.792">Because</a>  this is so dense as a reader, I wonder if it makes sense to <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2907.712">where</a>  you've got the FY25 activity summary, which is kind of like an executive summary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2912.553">That</a>  should be right after the acknowledgements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2916.194">So</a>  that's the first thing people read, and then go into the detail, rather than having to search for it.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2926.516">You're</a>  saying the fiscal 25 activity summary?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2929.156">You</a>  put that in- That's somewhat of an executive summary, if you will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2934.897">You</a>  know, it should be written in the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2938.137">form</a>  of an executive summary, or maybe we need an executive summary.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2947.921">You</a>  know, what could be missing, what could be added to the very first page is, oh wait, back up to the top. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2957.924">So</a>  we have this table of contents, which is, I wonder if it could be possible to <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2966.52">Simplify</a>  the table of contents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2973.202">Crunch</a>  it down into just a little tiny box that could be on the same page as the introduction, and maybe the introduction could be shortened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2983.705">Because</a>  the FY25 activities summary is on page two after the introduction, but we've already <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2993.648">How</a>  many pages in are we? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2995.149">We're</a>  on page three before we get to the table of contents.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=2998.911">And</a>  five before we get to the activity summary, right?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3001.673">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3002.553">So</a>  maybe we can dispense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3005.535">Yeah,</a>  maybe there's too much in the beginning acknowledgments and everything.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3013.38">So</a>  I'm hearing to shorten the introduction, create, and then move up an executive summary <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3023.832">but</a>  reformat the fiscal 25 activity summary into being more of an executive summary, so it's less, maybe less narrative, and then put that at the tippity top. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3033.956">I</a>  can do that, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3035.897">The</a>  tippity top, exactly.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3038.438">Do</a>  we want to review the legal contents more? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3045.081">I</a>  mean, I could see a tinker with where we can condense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3051.358">Like,</a>  I think procedures can probably go on, you know, in the due process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3055.2">Procedures</a>  could even go into the appendix.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3058.501">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3059.141">I</a>  mean, all of that, basically under goals and priorities, everything after that is appendix.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3063.683">Reversible.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3065.224">So</a>  we write the book.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3068.045">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3068.965">And</a>  the editors didn't do their job.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3072.807">So</a>  that... All right, we can... Theresa and I can look at that later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3081.375">They</a>  look beautiful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3082.616">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3084.017">Yeah,</a>  so as I looked through it earlier, a comment about lining or making the colors consistent throughout. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3090.242">And</a>  I really appreciated that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3091.724">And</a>  it looks like you picked that up, Teresa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3093.625">It</a>  helps a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3094.906">The</a>  one place where it might be worth also editing that would be on the map, if that's possible, to make some of the pins match. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3104.594">But</a>  I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3106.676">It</a>  looks like a great report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3108.077">I</a>  have not had an opportunity to read it in detail yet.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3113.37">Thank</a>  you for that feedback, Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3115.29">It's</a>  a fair point.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3122.532">So</a>  then each of these sections might be exactly what the person is looking for who comes to this report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3130.353">So</a>  what is the funding availability for this year? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3133.833">It's</a>  the next most relevant thing that they may be looking for.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3138.794">Maybe</a>  like this block of text. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3141.315">While</a>  I was writing it, I'm like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3143.36">people</a>  are looking for numbers, they don't want to read a whole paragraph. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3146.181">So</a>  maybe this is something where it can be bulletized and called out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3149.341">So</a>  it's, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3151.281">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3155.202">I</a>  also wonder, um, in the, in the vein of what people are looking for more immediately, um, if the goals and priorities section would move up above the, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3173.04">Priorities</a>  by program area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3174.661">It's</a>  like, you give the highlights overview. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3178.103">Of</a>  the goals and priorities, and then you break each of those down in more detail. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3183.287">In</a>  the following section, sort of the reverse of what you have now.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3189.511">Fair,</a>  I like that brought it down.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3191.332">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3192.693">So,</a>  like, maybe we can just go go a little more slowly through this section that so that what's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3201.582">described</a>  for each of the three program areas is what we've learned over the last year through what's happened in the community, kind of providing the context to help us understand what the community needs are as we make decisions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3220.893">And</a>  some of this we've learned through the community engagement that Teresa has been wonderful at facilitating over the last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3230.566">Some</a>  of it has been learned through other planning processes that are going on at the same time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3237.37">So</a>  we're trying to pull out what is relevant that's going on in Medford that would help us understand our decision making process better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3246.315">So</a>  under the open space and recreation, we've last had an open space and recreation plan in 2019. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3256.86">So</a>  we're still working from the goals that were identified in that open space and recreation plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3263.244">But</a>  since we've already done a lot of the work that was envisioned in that plan, and we have been collecting a lot of community input and feedback over the past seven, five years, six, how many years that was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3281.942">If</a>  we even scroll to the next page, we're taking the goals that were identified and then kind of adding in our understanding of what the community needs are today before the city goes back and does the next open space and recreation plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3303.018">And</a>  this is a really interesting table. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3304.859">Figure</a>  seven shows how much work has actually been done since the last open space and recreation plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3312.075">and</a>  how much of that has come from CPA funding versus other sources.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3320.961">Yeah,</a>  you'll see that if you were looking at last year's update to this, actually, let me describe what the alphabet soup here in the middle is, CPAs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3331.629">CDBG</a>  is Community Development Block Grant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3334.19">That</a>  is federal funding that comes into certain communities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3337.052">Medford</a>  qualifies that federal funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3341.387">as</a>  it's looking forward, they're budgeting very conservatively because federal funding, as we all know, is a little bit tumultuous at this moment in time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3350.97">So</a>  CDBG, you'll start seeing them probably shift their focus, not totally away from park projects, but more on the infrastructure in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3360.333">CDBG</a>  money can be used for, they have less restrictions as we did with CPA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3366.495">So</a>  just to explain seeing some of the numbers drop, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3369.9">in</a>  CDBG as well as ARPA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3371.661">ARPA</a>  is gone at this point, so there's a couple of projects that are wrapping up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3377.545">So</a>  just to explain what the alphabet soup and why you're seeing a little bit of a drop and an increase on CPA side. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3384.37">We're</a>  probably going to be seeing more applications this funding round than we have in the past. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3391.375">We</a>  anticipate yet another competitive round, but we have been doing an excellent job this past couple of years with securing <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3400.153">other</a>  grants for the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3401.314">So</a>  a lot of our projects are seeing funding coming from state as well as federal programs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3406.598">So</a>  that's that's all Amanda Centrella right there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3410.921">That</a>  43% doing a great job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3413.743">Thank</a>  you, Amanda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3414.523">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3416.485">So</a>  I just want to kind of explain what the purpose of this is to see the cost sharing of all the various funding agencies that are out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3425.451">Any</a>  questions on that?</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3429.0">It</a>  has a lot of numbers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3430.62">How</a>  do we get that 8% higher?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3435.382">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3436.762">That's</a>  a great question.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3438.163">I'm</a>  half kidding, but.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3440.143">Very</a>  nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3446.265">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3447.565">I'm</a>  kidding in that I'm not expecting you to answer it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3449.966">I</a>  mean what I say, though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3451.866">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3452.827">So</a>  we'll scroll on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3458.785">The</a>  next page has examples of things that we've heard from the public input. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3462.906">People</a>  often, when we go out collecting public input, have the most to say about open space and recreation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3471.188">It's</a>  probably the area that they interact with the most intimately, whatever their ages and interests are.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3481.305">Everybody</a>  cares about housing, certainly, but we get a little bit more of the specific examples of what you'd like to see from our open space.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3490.028">I</a>  was surprised when we were tabling how many people wanted to talk about affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3494.77">There</a>  were just a lot of people in Medford that really care about affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3498.151">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3499.392">It's</a>  a hot topic right now.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3501.933">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3502.933">It</a>  is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3504.093">It</a>  is, especially as we're revisiting our zoning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3508.905">What?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3509.645">We</a>  are?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3510.566">What?</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3511.066">What</a>  do I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3514.468">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3516.149">So</a>  it doesn't really change too much year over year as we're looking at open space comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3522.332">A</a>  lot of folks just want to see improvements for bike and pedestrian. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3525.674">Yes,</a>  Reg.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3527.514">What</a>  constitutes the east side environmental justice areas?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3536.017">Yeah,</a>  most of Medford lands, except for I believe North Medford, in some capacity Lawrence Estates, the rest of East and Southern Medford does land in environmental justice areas.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3549.08">So,</a>  I don't know if it would be helpful to provide context. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3553.361">Environmental</a>  justice areas have a very specific definition that's based on a census data on household incomes, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3565.413">minority</a>  populations and people who, like, language isolation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3571.975">So</a>  they look at the number of people in each neighborhood who fits into, like, vulnerable populations based on those criteria, and you can get a map. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3582.198">Maybe</a>  it would be helpful for us, especially if somebody mentions that, to include a map of environmental justice neighborhoods in Medford would be really great, helpful context for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3596.341">Um,</a>  yeah, I can share that with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3598.002">I</a>  got a map. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3598.922">You</a>  know what I did in, um, in Somerville with the help of having a GIS person who could have, um, I could just say, can you give me this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3607.685">And</a>  they give it to me is a map of all of our project sites against environmental justice neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3615.168">So</a>  I started manually making one of those would make sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3619.71">So,</a>  um, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3621.287">Enter</a>  it in the IEIS.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3622.648">I</a>  love that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3623.309">That</a>  would be great.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3623.949">The</a>  UEP in turn should be able to do that.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3627.732">Yes,</a>  we have quite a few in our office. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3631.695">Thank</a>  you, Aria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3632.816">I'll</a>  tap one of them to help you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3634.117">Thank</a>  you for the question, Raj.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3636.018">That</a>  would be a great add to our plan.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3642.683">So</a>  if you're in an environmental justice area for various different reasons, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3647.926">qualifies</a>  that specific area for additional funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3650.927">Like,</a>  for instance, I was working on a tree planting grant that will be targeting South Medford because it's an environmental justice area.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3659.249">In</a>  that alphabet soup that we saw in the previous page, the CDBG can only fund projects that are either in the environmental justice area or targeted toward a specific vulnerable population, like the senior center, they can do because that <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3677.717">is</a>  a target population, but a park has to be in a neighborhood that's been identified as environmental justice.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3689.819">I'll</a>  share that map with everybody, because I think it would be helpful for all of us.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3694.58">Any</a>  other questions, comments about the open space and recreation context? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3702.741">Historic</a>  preservation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3709.423">I</a>  just, actually, I wanted to comment on the first paragraph there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3714.047">So</a>  unlike the other two program areas, Medford does not have an overall historic preservation plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3722.594">So</a>  we're at figuring out what the priorities are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3727.057">There</a>  has been an effort by the Historical Commission, which is described in the next couple of paragraphs, to identify <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3738.408">historic</a>  assets around the city and to protect some of our historic assets with local historic districts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3747.392">We've</a>  also created some preservation restrictions that protect some of our assets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3753.375">By</a>  the way, I love that photo of them assing the window out the window.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3757.436">As</a>  I was walking into the building, I looked up and I saw them like, I have to run in there and take a picture.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3764.94">There's</a>  some sort of like metaphor in there.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3768.363">I</a>  didn't really realize how large those windows were until they removed them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3774.007">The</a>  8-foot windows are huge.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3776.528">So</a>  that's the context that we have to work with for historic preservation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3780.15">You</a>  can scroll a little bit further. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3783.492">So</a>  it describes some of the efforts that have been undertaken to expand our historic protections in the city.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3794.91">Are</a>  these surveys in the office or are they going around neighborhoods?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3801.395">They're</a>  going around neighborhoods. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3803.457">Essentially,</a>  they identify a neighborhood and they take an inventory of that entire swath of neighborhood boundaries and identify properties that are historic in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3816.007">Some</a>  of it does end up creating Form Bs, which are the summary of a historic <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3822.964">narrative</a>  for a property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3824.405">So</a>  as we're working through these neighborhoods during the survey, some Form Bs are just naturally being created because they found, oh, we inventoried a very interesting specific house.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3835.516">How</a>  would one know if they were part of this inventory and have a Form B all of a sudden?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3845.158">I</a>  don't think there's any sort of public notification process right now, but that's a good point for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3851.701">I'm</a>  not exactly sure what the awareness or outreach might be to just like share that with the neighborhood, but that's not currently being done actively.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3861.105">I</a>  mean, it's really just making a snapshot description of what the neighborhood looks like today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3873.188">And</a>  it doesn't have any further consequences besides like identifying what there is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3882.113">So,</a>  I mean, maybe there's a good point that if your house is going to be listed in a, I think the form B's is a separate.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3893.117">project</a>  is the inventory doesn't involve actually right now but it is like flagging certain properties that they are then in the future they want to yeah yeah so um so years ago um i used to work for an insurance company and the insurance company covered um personal lines and commercial lines etc etc and they would identify historical <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3921.129">buildings</a>  as ones that had a plaque that was attached to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3926.952">I</a>  don't know that Redford actually has plaques that are, I mean, I know they have like the one on Woburn Street, that's a historical section, if you will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3937.037">I</a>  don't know that they actually have a plaque that says this is a historic house that Paul Revere rode by back in 1775. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3947.293">on</a>  his way to conquer New England. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3950.054">Where's</a>  the guy? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3950.974">You</a>  know and uh so I mean well well Gaffney's for example I call it Gaffney's it's not Gaffney's anymore but Gaffney's used to have a sign on it that said that or maybe it was a plaque or a rock or something <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3969.809">that</a>  said it was a historical site based on... Do we have that?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3975.153">I</a>  mean, is it prevalent or is it just, you know... You've probably seen mostly the big plaques at our houses that say 1772 or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3985.941">That</a>  is a voluntary program that the Medford Historical Society runs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3992.526">You</a>  have to purchase the plaque. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3994.087">I'm</a>  not sure how much it is, but it is a voluntary and you have to buy it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=3998.754">commemorative</a>  monuments, you know, but... So you buy the house... They do the history regs.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4006.716">They</a>  give you the history of your house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4008.896">So</a>  you're paying for that service, essentially. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4010.957">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4011.437">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4012.977">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4013.317">But</a>  in terms of once upon a time, there was a famous battle here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4017.698">Those</a>  type of things, we don't have a standard program for that budget.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4024.76">So</a>  I realized that, you know, part of our <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4027.647">mission</a>  is to make sure that we maintain historical preservation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4031.588">And</a>  we've actually designated a little bit more than a third or a little bit less than a third of our budget towards that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4043.312">Signage</a>  is a tricky thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4046.833">I'm</a>  trying to wrap my head around it, if you know what I mean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4051.975">It</a>  just seems so</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4056.73">I</a>  want to come back to that, Doug.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4062.113">Picking</a>  up on an earlier points, you know, this, the commission has been surveying neighborhoods around Medford for more than a dozen years now, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4072.278">And</a>  that information really should be more accessible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4076.499">I</a>  mean, it's on the MACRS website, the state, but it's, that's not an easy site for your average person to navigate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4083.263">I</a>  feel like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4085.067">there</a>  is an opportunity to take all that information and let people, it probably could sit on the Medford Historic Commission's website, you know, just look at a neighborhood and find out what buildings in your neighborhoods, in your neighborhood that you care about, even if you don't live there, might be interesting or have been, you know, looked at closely by an architectural historian, which is what this survey is all about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4110.648">And</a>  it's a great resource for the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4114.303">It</a>  might give people pause if their own house is on that list to think about maybe looking into coming before the commission and talking to us before they start having these grand plans to knock it down or to build an addition that may or may not be appropriate to that 1820 house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4134.232">I</a>  think more information is always better, more transparency is always better for that kind of recognition.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4140.035">So</a>  do I understand correctly that that is one of the purposes of the historic preservation commission to, um, do oversee some of that public education about their historic, um, resources?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4157.349">I,</a>  you know, I, I've actually never seen that written down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4160.351">I</a>  think it's implicit Roberta. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4162.033">I</a>  think it's, but I don't actually know if that's a piece of our, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4168.142">you</a>  know, actual mission beyond the general education. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4171.366">It's</a>  not like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4172.427">That</a>  would be definitely a kind of step forward, which I think is a good one.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4177.173">Yeah,</a>  I agree.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4177.893">Talk</a>  to them about it.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4180.823">I</a>  just wanted to come back to your point, Reg, about signage, you know, awareness of Medford's history. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4187.549">CPA,</a>  a project that is just a sign is not eligible for CPA by itself because we're here to protect the assets, not the information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4204.123">So</a>  a sign that describes what happened here <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4208.696">like</a>  used to be at Gaffey's, is information that we want to share with the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4214.621">And</a>  creating a sign is just too many steps removed from protecting a historic asset, because that's what we're trying to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4226.13">But</a>  we do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4228.032">One</a>  of the things that I'd like to see us do even more than we have is, we kind of addressed this with this project this evening, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4237.954">to</a>  make sure that we leverage CPA funding to tap on a little bit of money to add signs every time so that we can actually share that information, but not as a standalone project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4256.995">So</a>  we didn't think of that, of making that ask of these guys and maybe tacking on a little bit of money, but there might already be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4264.297">There's</a>  one outside as well as several inside. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4267.257">And</a>  there's several inside where it's requiring them to let people in to enjoy looking at them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4272.598">So</a>  we've addressed that, I think, in this case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4275.419">So</a>  now it's a fair point to remember for subsequent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4278.44">So</a>  we talk a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4280.127">maybe</a>  not as succinctly as we could about city-owned assets, that we could be, that we're in discussion with the city about making improvements or protecting, preserving some of our city-owned assets, in particular the Curtis Tufts School fire stations, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4302.113">You</a>  know, it occurs to me, it says restoration efforts at Oak Grove Cemetery. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4306.156">Maybe</a>  we want to add, call out the superintendent's house and garage, since that's where a lot of our... That's where the money's going. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4315.264">That's</a>  where the money's going. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4316.465">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4317.166">So...</a>  Wait, what about the superintendent's house? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4319.628">The</a>  caretaker's house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4321.009">The</a>  caretaker's house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4322.19">We've</a>  been putting CPA money into preserving that building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4331.191">And</a>  there's been discussion about developing an archive for Medford historic records, which we don't, that hasn't really gone anywhere in the last year.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4341.514">We</a>  didn't receive the technical assistance grants twice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4345.095">So</a>  that's frustrating. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4347.335">I</a>  think they're only providing two grants per period.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4350.996">So</a>  yeah, I'll keep trying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4352.897">Yeah,</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4355.477">And</a>  then we mentioned that <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4358.902">The</a>  project is breaking ground at Shiloh Baptist Church, and Shiloh, like many religious organizations, is struggling to keep up its historic building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4372.247">Investing</a>  CPA money has enabled the church to break the space into ADA compliance and make it available for a child care provider to occupy the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4386.453">So</a>  leveraging CPA has the opportunity to fund investment in historic community spaces to make the assets safe, accessible, and functional. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4399.878">So</a>  any other questions, comments about historic preservation? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4404.18">We'll</a>  move on to affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4409.922">So</a>  context for affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4415.366">move</a>  on to the next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4416.247">I</a>  think the first is just introductory. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4418.548">So</a>  to... is this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4422.45">That's</a>  walking forward, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4424.492">That</a>  is walking forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4426.653">Hopefully</a>  it will actually look like that in the not too distant future.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4430.936">Where</a>  is that?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4432.337">Right</a>  behind Whole Foods.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4434.558">That's</a>  Whole Foods right here.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4436.759">Oh,</a>  that's where my new office is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4439.421">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4440.845">I</a>  keep falling asleep.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4442.146">So</a>  over the past five years, Medford has made advancements in planning and policy implementation to address the city's affordable housing needs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4454.653">First,</a>  the housing production plan, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4469.272">adopted</a>  in 2021, then the comprehensive plan adopted in 2023. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4475.156">I</a>  didn't get into detail about what the goals and strategies were for those documents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4485.043">The</a>  housing production plan envisions specifically addressing affordability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4491.847">The</a>  comprehensive plan is more about land use citywide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4496.59">And</a>  then we've undertaken actions <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4499.638">to</a>  align with the objectives outlined in these plans, including citywide rezoning effort, the approval of 40B developments and developments that comply with inclusionary zoning, RFPs for the disposition of major city-owned lots. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4516.642">Ooh,</a>  we don't have to capitalize owned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4519.243">In</a>  Medford Square in Wellington, the expansion of city resources and programs supporting affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4528.045">With</a>  completion of all the development projects that are in the pipeline that would create affordable units, Medford will be keeping pace with the housing production goals outlined in its housing production plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4541.571">We</a>  actually haven't completed any of those units yet, but the three units at Beltsway West that the CPA funded, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4550.209">will</a>  be completed this summer.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4551.849">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4552.59">Yes,</a>  they will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4554.17">They're</a>  anticipating construction will be complete in about two weeks or so, mid to late July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4560.271">And</a>  I don't have a date yet, but we are planning for a ribbon cutting sometime in probably mid to late August. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4567.533">So</a>  before the school year starts.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4569.553">Woo-hoo.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4570.154">It's</a>  a long time coming. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4572.374">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4573.194">Like</a>  first year, second year? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4575.455">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4576.235">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4577.108">First</a>  year, tiny project, but it's the CPA program's first affordable housing units created, opened to be occupied. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4588.753">So</a>  that's a big thing to celebrate, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4591.114">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4593.455">So</a>  another significant initiative is obviously the establishment of the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4599.037">The</a>  next steps, as Jeremy reminded us earlier, is that we need to have a discussion about how is this going to work now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4607.066">So</a>  after we talk about this plan, we'll try to pencil in a date for that discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4614.05">And</a>  then thanks to these efforts, Medford has been able to secure designation under the Massachusetts Housing Choice Initiative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4624.195">And</a>  in order to maintain our designation, the CBC opted to increase the budgeted share of funds for affordable housing to 25%. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4635.994">So</a>  we talk about how much we funded for the Affordable Housing Trust and what are some options for increasing funding for affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4654.409">Any</a>  questions, discussions about affordable housing?</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4659.694">Is</a>  this our proposal to go from 1.5% to 3% or is that the city's?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4665.393">This</a>  is just saying that it could happen.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4667.614">So</a>  soon after I pay my taxes.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4673.616">Nobody</a>  is considering pushing this forward at all in the next few years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4678.358">But</a>  it is something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4679.818">It's</a>  another town. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4680.618">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4681.499">And</a>  honestly, the initiative doesn't need to come from this committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4685.86">If</a>  there was somebody out there who just felt really passionate about it and they want to collect signatures and put it on the ballot, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4691.797">It</a>  doesn't have to come from the committee was yeah it as I added today.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4697.759">Since</a>  Medford initially adopted CPA through a signature campaign, the route to putting a surcharge increase on the ballot would have to be done again by a sick by a petition signature campaign so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4710.743">If</a>  anybody wants to go out and collect 3,000 signatures to put it on the ballot, however, the Affordable Housing Trust has some other ideas about how to increase funding for affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4723.994">So</a>  we don't have to put all of our eggs in that basket. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4728.077">But</a>  I thought it was worth stating in the plan because people will raise that as a possibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4734.822">And</a>  I feel like we should acknowledge it first before everybody else does and say, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4740.123">Like,</a>  yes, this could happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4744.587">This</a>  is what it would take to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4747.31">And</a>  leave it at that.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4748.251">Roberta,</a>  out of curiosity, what is the surcharge in Somerville?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4757.1">Somerville,</a>  just last year, raised their surcharge from 1.5% to 3%. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4760.803">Was</a>  it contentious? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4766.697">Not</a>  particularly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4768.118">It</a>  passed by, I think, something like 70 percent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4772.519">But</a>  I think Medford will be a different, a different rate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4778.141">We're</a>  not in the same place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4781.703">Did</a>  you have something to add, Brett?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4784.384">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4787.345">And</a>  Somerville also, because they had originally put it on the ballot through a council order <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4795.664">it</a>  went through the council to get on the ballot again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4798.266">So</a>  that was a different process as well.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4801.588">I</a>  would just also point out too, we will, and it was reflected on our budget, we will see a little bit of a lift to our revenue because of the overrides. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4814.278">Our</a>  revenue is derived as a surcharge on top of property taxes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4817.78">So</a>  the fact that, you know, with the overrides, everybody did see an increase in their taxes while that surcharge, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4824.802">proportionally</a>  also increased. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4826.283">So</a>  I think we'll see an additional $85,000 this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4830.525">So</a>  it's not much, but that's a project.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4833.667">I'm</a>  just happy I get to spend it.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4837.45">Feels</a>  cathartic. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4841.272">So</a>  the next section is really important for the committee members, especially to weigh in on the goals and priorities because <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4850.179">Theoretically,</a>  we're using these goals and priorities to evaluate projects when they come in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4855.941">So,</a>  like, how well did these goals and priorities align with what we want to fund, having seen the types of projects that we receive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4863.863">So,</a>  some overall goals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4865.503">Projects</a>  should be highly visible and accessible, generating broad benefits to the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4871.124">As</a>  appropriate, the application should demonstrate public input or gathering of support. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4877.345">Projects</a>  must not replace funding from others from the city budget or other funding sources. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4882.946">So</a>  planting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4883.746">So</a>  planting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4885.207">Priority</a>  is given to projects that leverage funding from other sources and or fill a gap where other sources are not available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4893.068">Projects</a>  should demonstrate cost sensitivity, both in the short term use of CPA funds and the long term maintenance or lifespan of the resource for which the funds are used. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4903.74">Priority</a>  is given to projects with a public sector or non-profit applicant or co-applicant above private individuals or for-profit applicants. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4914.786">So</a>  that addresses what we consider this evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4921.469">Then</a>  there are specific goals and priorities stated for each of the program areas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4930.325">for</a>  open space and recreation, expand and enhance open space as distinguishing features of Medford's landscape, especially along the Mystic River and other bodies of water, make Medford Square and neighborhoods greener and more attractive, protect neighborhoods and natural resources from the impacts of flooding and climate change, improve access to open space and recreation resources for all Medford residents, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4955.528">expand</a>  bicycle and pedestrian paths, connecting neighborhoods and recreational community resources, and provide diverse recreation opportunities serving residents of all ages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4966.632">These,</a>  by the way, were created through a big public process that we had the very first year of CPA back in 2017. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4977.557">We</a>  had <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4980.879">public</a>  meetings that were well attended, and we gathered a lot of input from people, and that's how we developed these goals and priorities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=4989.146">And</a>  then for open space and recreation, the priorities are first, and this is kind of hard to explain, but I've never been able to come up with a better wording. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5002.036">So</a>  tell me if you can think of something better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5004.238">Enhance</a>  open space as a land use asset <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5008.166">while</a>  improving connectivity, access, safety, and function. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5012.048">So</a>  thinking about recreation opportunities or having open space parcels that serve a function. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5022.793">Second,</a>  support resiliency through open space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5026.354">So</a>  generally, what is the quality of the open space, and how is it providing for more community or environmental resiliency?</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5037.948">Would</a>  you call that a communal asset? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5045.434">A</a>  shared asset? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5047.535">Maybe</a>  that's not what you're after there.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5051.518">I</a>  don't think communal asset. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5053.3">A</a>  public asset. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5056.802">As</a>  a land use asset. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5058.423">Land</a>  use is such an awkward word. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5059.764">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5060.185">So</a>  I think Jeremy's suggestion has enhanced open space as a communal asset.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5065.867">Sorry,</a>  I thought you were asking for input on those lines.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5069.93">Yeah,</a>  no, that's helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5073.392">If</a>  we have a hard time with it, our applicants who look at this and ask themselves whether they meet these criteria are also going to have a hard time with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5084.54">So</a>  I like that as a community asset. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5092.78">All</a>  right, affordable housing, preserve Medford's income and demographic diversity through sustaining and increasing the supply of affordable housing for families, seniors, individuals, and people with disabilities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5104.264">Facilitate</a>  investments in affordable housing that preserve and complement the character of Medford's neighborhoods. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5110.806">Support</a>  low and moderate income households in accessing housing that they can afford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5117.368">With</a>  the priorities being first to increase the supply of affordable housing, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5122.76">Second,</a>  to provide support services for households to access affordable housing.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5130.707">And</a>  that comes in the form of our rental arrears program, our move-in assistance programs.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5136.271">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5138.373">And</a>  then for historic preservation, I'm proposing to change the priorities from what we originally came up with based on what we've <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5152.358">seen</a>  in the last couple of years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5155.159">So</a>  the goals are to preserve historic buildings and sites, protect, restore, and enhance public access to historical records and artifacts, and to increase public awareness about local history and historical sites. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5173.247">And</a>  I'm proposing to add a goal to make historic community buildings safe, accessible, and functional. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5180.662">And</a>  then the priorities, originally the priorities were to preserve city-owned historic resources as first priority, and second priority is to preserve non-city-owned historic resources. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5196.267">So</a>  the first and second priorities mean like who we give the highest ranking to in our criteria versus lower ranking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5206.451">And</a>  so <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5207.772">I'm</a>  suggesting a change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5209.312">Tell</a>  me if you like this change or agree with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5214.413">The</a>  first priority be to preserve resources that provide functional community use. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5220.955">And</a>  the second one to be preserve historic assets that contribute to community awareness and character.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5228.116">I</a>  like them.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5243.505">I</a>  think that I'll chime in that I think that that would help provide some clarity for, again, we looked at our applicant earlier this evening, having it called out that we want to support projects that provide a functional community use that could have raised a little bit of a flag for them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5262.6">So</a>  I like it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5264.341">It</a>  expands upon the intention there, clarifies it a bit.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5271.187">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5273.869">Another</a>  thought that occurs to me is that I don't know if I were the grantee reading this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5277.99">I</a>  don't know if this is how all of you interpret the way that this chart reads, first priority, second priority. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5285.133">If</a>  it's clear to you that this is a ranking of what's more important or less important, maybe the names first and second priority should be higher priority, lower priority. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5298.497">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5300.837">That</a>  would work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5306.033">I</a>  do worry that saying lower priority implies that it's not something we care about, whereas we're saying that's in fact the thing we care about second most. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5315.199">It's</a>  above everything else except for the thing that's up top. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5318.361">I</a>  think first and second is clear enough, but totally open to disagreement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5323.884">Or</a>  something like that.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5326.046">What</a>  if we were to go higher and then secondary?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5330.769">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5333.327">Kind</a>  of Frankenstein-y. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5334.468">Was</a>  there a question about this ranking, Teresa? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5337.289">Primary,</a>  secondary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5339.43">Not</a>  really. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5343.732">In</a>  my time, I think I've only encountered nine historical preservation projects.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5350.615">I</a>  feel like it's good to be scrutiny-proof as we head into more competitive cycles.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5356.652">Yeah,</a>  let me say applicants like we had this evening, if we're in a competitive application cycle, would they understand that they're coming in at a lower priority? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5371.063">And</a>  by adding the community use of their building once or twice a year, that's helping to nudge their priority ranking a little bit higher.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5386.138">up</a>  as something that I've been wanting to bring up not related to this, but could we shift the process to vote after, like, could we basically have applicants not here while we vote?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5404.246">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5405.667">We</a>  could.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5406.867">Really?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5408.128">What?</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5409.17">Not</a>  with an open meeting, right?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5410.771">It's</a>  an open meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5411.832">An</a>  open meeting.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5413.433">And</a>  they should probably be present.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5417.196">I</a>  mean, just because I feel like it adds, like, it doesn't give us an opportunity to, like, privately discuss our concerns with each other. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5425.061">Not</a>  that we wouldn't, like, then bring them back in and be like, here's what we came to, but we go straight from, like, discussing it with them here to voting in their presence, you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5435.286">Yeah,</a>  I was trying not to make any eye contact with them while we were trying to have a discussion.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5440.976">It's</a>  a little awkward.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5443.961">Are</a>  we allowed to deliberate outside of an open meeting?</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5447.787">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5448.668">we</a>  can go on to the executive session. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5450.449">But</a>  we could still be an open, I don't know if this is the case, but I wonder if we could still be considered an open meeting and just like politely ask them to give us, like we'd still literally be open to the public, but asking them to sort of like give us a moment to deliberate.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5467.097">I'm</a>  curious, because other committees such as perhaps the Zoning Board of Appeals and Conservation Commission, we are joined by Janice McDougall in the room here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5477.44">They</a>  don't privately deliberate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5480.641">Not</a>  allowed to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5481.861">Applications,</a>  yeah, exactly.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5485.301">I</a>  don't think, I don't think if you're having a meeting while it's open, that's the definition of, I just don't think that, and I understand the awkwardness of talking about somebody when they're sitting next to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5500.444">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5501.585">But</a>  at the same time, you know, we don't have the <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5504.696">you</a>  really need to say, well, go to the other room over there.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5507.738">Well,</a>  we could ask them to just sit in the back of the room so that they're not at the table with us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5512.22">That</a>  would help us to feel like it's our space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5515.862">During</a>  our regular funding round, the applicants present one night and then we deliberate on a different night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5531.075">And</a>  they're welcome to observe that, but they're not part of the conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5534.836">But</a>  whenever it's an off-cycle application, they're typically applying and getting a decision the same night that they apply. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5544.618">So</a>  that's a good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5546.358">We</a>  might be able to comply with open meeting law, but make it more like have them not be in the middle of our conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5555.7">Doug?</a> </p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5558.121">Under</a>  the history, sorry, I'm switching topics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5560.598">a</a>  little bit going back to the change in verbiage here about preserving city-owned historic prop resources versus preserve resources that provide functional community use. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5573.58">I</a>  feel that's actually a pretty significant shift than what we had, than what we started with, you know, seven, eight years ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5583.022">You</a>  know, like, because, I mean, you can read <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5587.513">functional</a>  community use a lot of different ways, but that's actually quite far from city homes like Oak Grove or other things, the library, Brooks Estate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5598.519">There's</a>  a lot of things here that have been on the top of the list because of that verbiage and what we started out with that I think are being a little diluted here, but I'm just not sure if that's just the way I'm reading it.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5611.367">For</a>  example, <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5616.033">this</a>  using the new version, Shiloh would be a high priority because it's a functional community use. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5631.043">City-owned</a>  buildings are functional community buildings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5636.227">I</a>  think that all city buildings by definition would be, and institutional buildings that provide <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5645.13">like</a>  public use could also be a high priority.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5649.132">So</a>  what if we combine it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5650.573">What</a>  if we say preserve city-owned historic resources and resources that provide functional community use or non-city resources that provide functional community use as a first or top priority?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5666.022">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5668.424">That</a>  would work.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5675.927">That</a>  way we're not reinventing the wheel.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5680.248">And</a>  then the second one can stay as you've changed it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5684.229">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5684.929">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5690.17">I</a>  think that's all that we really need to talk about the procedures and the rest of this document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5694.851">Oh,</a>  maybe we could just flip to the very end where we have the, the procedures have been, we've updated the dates here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5703.443">for</a>  the application process, but the procedures haven't changed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5707.186">I</a>  invite everyone to review it so that you're familiar with what the procedures are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5716.113">I'm</a>  looking further to the list of, yeah, the overtable list of projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5730.787">So</a>  the CPA funded projects, it's a pretty remarkable list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5735.39">It</a>  covers every project that we've ever funded and what's been completed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5741.714">You</a>  can see that there are still a couple of projects in progress that are old, but they're almost there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5753.081">And</a>  then you can see the most recent projects where things are also very remarkable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5760.195">when</a>  we get to the very bottom of the list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5762.117">It</a>  just goes on and on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5763.418">It's</a>  incredible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5769.803">Last</a>  month, we had the Medford Square pop-up community garden come in, and it's already completed.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5777.809">The</a>  next day, they're like, okay, so when do we get the money? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5782.152">I</a>  was very excited, but they're sweet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5785.915">Thank</a>  you for supporting that project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5788.952">And</a>  so we have a lot to be proud of.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5790.153">Do</a>  you have a timeline for a second? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5792.255">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5794.277">Look</a>  away, everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5795.297">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5795.678">I'm</a>  fast forwarding, and that makes me nauseous. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5801.082">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5801.663">A</a>  couple more pages, Jo. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5802.804">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5804.986">There</a>  you go.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5806.347">One</a>  more.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5806.968">One</a>  more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5807.748">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5810.531">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5811.672">I'm</a>  assuming we're still meeting on Tuesdays? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5816.396">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5817.132">October</a>  13th is a Monday, that's Columbus Day or Indigenous Peoples Day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5821.773">Are</a>  you looking at next year's calendar? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5826.414">This</a>  is the plan for... Oh, this is for next year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5830.495">Oh,</a>  thank God. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5831.635">Not</a>  this year?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5834.956">No,</a>  this is for Fiscal 26. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5836.556">So</a>  this will be... That doesn't... Yeah.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5842.978">Do</a>  you want me to have it for this... <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5844.808">past</a>  year? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5845.368">This</a>  fiscal year, is it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5849.049">We're</a>  in fiscal 26. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5850.37">Yeah,</a>  we're in fiscal 26. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5852.711">So</a>  the full applications are due in 25.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5855.952">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5856.052">I</a>  will make those amendments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5859.173">But</a>  yes, it is Tuesday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5860.854">So</a>  give or take a day here or there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5863.094">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5864.355">No</a>  worries. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5865.155">So</a>  if we are meeting in 2025, October 14, I will not be available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5872.418">I'll</a>  be out of the country.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5874.633">Okay,</a>  I think we were going to split up, it was October 28th and November 19th, so we may not be meeting specifically because of a, nope, that was Veterans Day lands on a Tuesday this year, so that's why. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5892.245">Okay,</a>  I will revisit these dates and make sure everybody has them in their calendars.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5898.129">Yeah,</a>  and while we do this, while we have the dates up, maybe we want to review, so <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5904.577">We</a>  want to talk with the Affordable Housing Trust, perhaps in September. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5908.138">I</a>  think that's when the Affordable Housing Trust will be ready. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5913.9">October</a>  is our applicant presentations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5916.261">We</a>  really can't have a discussion then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5918.722">And</a>  then we're deliberating. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5920.022">So</a>  the idea of actually having these conversations before, it's already too late to have them before we make the next funding round of <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5934.435">decisions.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5936.076">So</a>  we're going to have to be doing it on the fly, just as we've done this evening.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5942.519">So</a>  at this point, I haven't heard to tell of any applications in the housing realm beyond the trust perhaps coming back for additional funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5955.145">Okay,</a>  so I don't have any housing projects on my radar currently. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5958.606">That</a>  doesn't mean they don't exist.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5960.107">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5961.472">And</a>  it would be really nice to be able to transition the affordable housing trust to be making housing decisions, but they can't, like, that has to align with our funding cycle.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5974.563">So</a>  when you redo this calendar, can you put it in order of fiscal year? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5979.668">So</a>  let's start at the top with July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5981.809">I</a>  can do that.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5991.205">So</a>  OSR, thank you, John, I'll do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=5997.187">So</a>  I would suggest- Are you in August?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6002.208">Well,</a>  there's usually a special meeting in August, Reg. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6007.47">We</a>  don't technically meet, but we have a social outing.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6011.111">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6011.711">Speaking</a>  of which, we need to find a date for a social outing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6014.392">I'm</a>  pretty sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6015.152">Yeah,</a>  I have the scheduling full ready, I just need it.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6019.413">So,</a>  the affordable housing trust discussion in September, and then we wait until January or February to do historic preservation or open space recreation and then do the other 1 of thinking about guidelines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6035.321">And</a>  how do we. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6037.362">Um,</a>  the, the open space and recreation, we may not really need to make any big changes to what we do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6046.648">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6047.108">But.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6048.0">historic</a>  preservation, I think we do.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6050.242">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6051.803">As</a>  you said earlier, we're the only ones in the city really responsible in looking at these type of projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6057.768">So</a>  yeah, we should have a better guideline plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6063.973">So</a>  you're thinking January for that meeting?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6066.395">Probably.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6067.596">Just</a>  as Fredge suggested.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6069.317">That</a>  is the next time we have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6074.661">I'm</a>  going to go ahead and stop sharing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6077.785">look</a>  at each other. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6078.425">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6082.367">Did</a>  we get through the agenda? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6084.088">I</a>  have one more very, very quick thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6086.469">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6086.769">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6088.249">And</a>  the meeting minutes, which were in the packet, but also in the packet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6092.431">Let</a>  me screen share. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6093.592">I</a>  think it's time that we refresh our temporary signage that we use at CPA projects that just make the community aware of who they can follow up with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6106.05">The</a>  signage currently is just says Community Preservation Act funds at work with our logo, and that's great, but that's pretty much it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6114.554">So</a>  I can share it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6117.095">I</a>  think I still have it up here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6118.876">And</a>  then for the folks in the room, there are a few different options here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6124.018">But</a>  I would love to get people's feedback just really quickly on their thoughts on the proposed design. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6131.841">I</a>  am sharing this one.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6136.161">I</a>  like the fun.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6141.945">So</a>  we'll put it back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6143.125">This</a>  is the line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6145.187">I</a>  tend to be a little bit of an extra person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6147.968">So</a>  that's why mostly I wanted to get your feedback on here to edit me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6153.752">But</a>  it also represents you all as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6156.153">So</a>  any initial thoughts in the room right now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6160.315">It</a>  sounds like folks like the very first one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6165.315">where</a>  it's got the square logo on the top left and the QR code on the right.</p>

    <p>[Myisha Majumder]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6169.937">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6170.438">I</a>  like how big the QR code is in this one too.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6172.779">Yeah,</a>  I was thinking the same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6174.4">That's</a>  a bigger QR code. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6176.481">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6178.242">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6182.604">That</a>  was it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6183.064">All</a>  right, I will order those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6184.365">And</a>  the idea is that this would turn around and point to that QR code would redirect folks to our website, which <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6191.387">One</a>  of our lovely repeat interns is going to help me with updating that shortly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6196.449">I</a>  know, John, you're very excited about that, aren't you?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6202.872">I</a>  have notes here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6204.233">I</a>  have notes on my desk to help you with that.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6206.754">Well,</a>  maybe we can find a date where all three of us are available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6211.716">Yeah,</a>  of course you can keep it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6213.517">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6213.977">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6214.83">Just</a>  right now, that's going to get a bumper sticker. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6217.731">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6220.152">It'll</a>  take a couple weeks for the signs to come in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6227.075">So</a>  hopefully, that kind of sets up a deadline of updating the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6232.478">But</a>  thank you very much for that feedback. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6234.238">I</a>  really appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6235.279">Can</a>  you tell us the pictures? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6236.819">Is</a>  it Wackling Court and then the McGlynn Playground? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6241.742">Keep</a>  going. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6242.262">You</a>  got it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6243.47">And</a>  then obviously the condensation and I don't know, Brooks Estate maybe? <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6247.854">Yeah,</a>  that's the Brooks Estate.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6254.441">Yeah,</a>  that's kind of been the branding I've been using and I think it's important to stay consistent with it so that people have recognition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6263.55">So</a>  thank you for... It's a good thing that you double as a graphic designer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/community-preservation-committee-07-08-25&start=6267.891">just</a>  this one thing i'm not good at anything else just just that one so thank you uh you should start seeing those shortly you know great the last thing i have were minutes which were in the folder happy to screen share them uh however we wanted to receive any comments acceptance of the minutes second six ten all right and i will uh call the roll maisha</p>
