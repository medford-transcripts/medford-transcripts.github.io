I'm going to call the vote.

68
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:39,155
Actually, I would love to give Councillor Sang an opportunity to speak first.

69
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:40,776
Thank you.

70
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:47,463
I had the pleasure to join Councillor Zaro at one of the City Council's listening sessions at the Senior Centre a few weeks ago.

71
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:53,410
And at the Senior Centre, we heard a lot from constituents about different issues that they were facing.

72
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,912
There seemed to be one common unifier that

73
00:21:56,867 --> 00:22:06,115
There were, you know, people in City Hall that they had wanted to reach, but they didn't know their phone numbers and their emails and they didn't have the resources to get that information.

74
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:09,218
So they didn't have computers or internet easy access to those things.

75
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:33,468
So this resolution is really to have our resident services committee spend a session really brainstorming ways that we can make access even easier, even more efficient for residents who don't have access to modern, you know, those uses of technology and to really, as I put it, bring City Hall to the people.

76
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:36,771
Thank you, Councilor San Buenaventura.

77
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:38,388
Thank you.

78
00:22:38,668 --> 00:22:57,806
Councilor Stang put it very well, but it also speaks to our role in the Resident Services Committee, which is, there's a portion of that committee that does constituent services, which I did for a bit in the State House, and constituent services often involves

79
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,153
that we're doing is.

80
00:22:59,173 --> 00:23:08,946
Referring people to, uh, other staff members who work in City Hall and letting them know who can help them with a problem that they're facing at the

81
00:23:16,574 --> 00:23:22,238
our residents that we may be speaking with more directly with the people that can actually help them.

82
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:30,224
On City Council, there are only a few things that we're able to do, but one of the things we do know how to do is make connections.

83
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:32,405
So that's what we're hoping to do here.

84
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:33,006
Thanks.

85
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:35,227
Thank you, Councilor Zaro.

86
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:43,133

Do we have a representative from the petitioner on Zoom or in person?

101
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,380
Not seeing a hand raised.

102
00:25:04,182 --> 00:25:07,804
All right, I'll open the public hearing then we can move that.

103
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:09,645
I'm going to open the public hearing.

104

00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:47,139
We still do not have a recommendation from the Community Development Board, which is having their continued public hearing.

110
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,102
I believe next week to the date on that on June 18th.

111
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:55,504
So I will reopen the public hearing.

112

We do not have a proposal to consider, so we need to continue the public hearing to a date certain.

There's a petition by Massachusetts Electrical Company and DBA National Grid for permission to remove and replace a joint-owned pole including necessary sustaining and protecting fixtures located between 197 and 203 Fulton Street and labeled 132 as depicted in the sketch.

128
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:11,795
The engineering division recommends the city grant that this grant of location be approved with the following conditions.

129
00:27:12,516 --> 00:27:17,858
Grant of location is limited to the removal and replacement of one joint-owned utility pole within the sidewalk between 197 and 203 Fulton Street.

130
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,939
and labeled 132 as depicted on the sketch.

131
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:27,562
Before starting work, the contractor shall notify Dig Safe and obtain all applicable permits from the engineering division.

132
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:34,866

The entire concrete panel will be required to be rebuilt.

00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:07,048

However, the timing should not extend more than 30 days.

140

Project site must be swept after installation or daily and shall be kept free of debris.

141
00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:19,703
The Fulton Street is a narrow, heavily-traveled roadway and requires a mandatory police detail.

00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:27,846
Engineering Division recommends the applicant consult with Metro Police Department traffic sergeants prior to scheduling this work, since work hours may be restricted outside of normal operations.

Approved, City Engineer.

145
00:28:41,115 --> 00:28:45,296
Do we have representative from National Grid on this for the light pole.

146
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:59,860
You just provide your name and address and give us any more information on this project.

Cam Hansel, National Grid.

148
00:29:03,304 --> 00:29:12,368
This is just to replace the pole and put it in a better location so it won't be leaning like the current one is now.

149
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:13,949
Thank you.

150
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:16,150
Does the city engineer have anything to add?

151
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:16,970
All right.

152
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:23,093
I'm going to open the public hearing to anyone in favor, opposed, or otherwise would like to comment on this grant of location.

153
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:26,735

Is there anyone else who would like to speak on this grant of location for the light pole replacement?

157
00:29:39,126 --> 00:29:40,987
Councillor Callahan, do you have a question for the petitioner?

158
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,889
Yes, do you know if it will affect any trees?

159
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:48,611
The placement of the pole and the placement of the wires?

160
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:50,612
No, no, there's no trees around it.

161
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:51,392
Thanks.

162
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:52,252
Great.

163
00:29:56,193 --> 00:30:00,616
Anyone else who would like to speak in favor, in opposition, or otherwise has a comment?

164
00:30:02,377 --> 00:30:07,559
Seeing none in the chamber and no hands on Zoom, declaring the public hearing closed.

165
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,240
Is there a motion?

166
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:18,806
Motion to approve with the conditions of the Engineering Division by Councilor Collins, seconded by.

167
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:20,887
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

168
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:22,628
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

169
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:45,707
Councilor Callahan?

170
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:46,808
Yes.

171
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:47,568
Vice President Collins?

172
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:47,648
Yes.

173
00:30:48,969 --> 00:30:49,649
Councilor Lozaro?

174
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:49,769
Yes.

175
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:50,970
Councilor Lemming?

176
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,890
Yes.

177
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,530
Councilor Scarpelli?

178
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:52,631
Yes.

179
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:53,831
Councilor Singh?

180
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:53,911
Yes.

181
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:55,012
President Behrs?

182
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:55,272
Yes.

183
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:56,692
I have an affirmative, none on the negative.

184
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:57,673
The motion passes.

185
00:30:57,693 --> 00:31:04,916
25083, petition for a grant of location, National Bridge, North Andover, Massachusetts, proposed joint one pool, 574 Fulton Street,

186
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:17,601
You are hereby notified by order of the Bedford City Council that the City Council hold a public hearing in the Council Chambers at Bedford City Hall and via Zoom on Tuesday, June 10th, 2025 at 7 p.m.

187
00:31:18,942 --> 00:31:27,486
on a petition by Massachusetts electrical company DBA National Grid for permission to install a joint own pole including necessary sustaining and protecting fixtures located at 574 Fulton Street.

188
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:35,890
The City Engineer, Engineering Division recommends the spirit of location be approved with the following conditions.

189
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:44,775
They are functionally the exact same conditions that I just read for the previous poll, so I'm just not going to do it again for everyone's sake.

190
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:53,839
The only change is that temporary patch using bituminous concrete pavement will not be permitted, but the concrete sidewalk will be replaced.

191
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:56,040
So that's the only difference as far as I can tell.

192
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,222
I'm looking at Owen, and I'm getting a thumbs up, so I read it right.

193
00:32:01,995 --> 00:32:05,598
Do you have anything to add on, or just if you could let us know a little bit more about this?

194
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:11,824
This is to add additional transformer.

195
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:14,787
The transformers in the area are getting overloaded.

196
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,029
Great.

197
00:32:19,011 --> 00:32:21,333
Do you have any questions for the petitioner, for members of the council?

198
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:30,060
Seeing none, I'm gonna open the public hearing to anyone in favor, opposed, or who otherwise has a comment on this grant application.

199
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,301
Public hearing is open.

200
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:34,081
Are you in favor?

201
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:36,402
Yes.

202
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:37,402
Great.

203
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:43,403
Is there anyone else, either in person or on Zoom, who would like to speak in this public hearing?

204
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:46,444
I do see a hand raised on Zoom.

205
00:32:46,604 --> 00:32:49,005
I'm going to recognize Joe DiCostantopoulo.

206
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:50,025
Give me one second.

207
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:00,768
So I'm going to ask you to unmute and you'll have three minutes.

208
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:02,408
Please provide your name and address for the record.

209
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:04,509
Oh, hi.

210
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:05,209
Thanks, everybody.

211
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,630
My name is Joe DeCristoforo.

212
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,710
I live across the street at 577.

213
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:13,992
And I just, I had some questions on it.

214
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:19,774
I think, I believe it's to replace the light pole across the street that's leaning.

215
00:33:20,954 --> 00:33:27,416
Is it also replacing the transistors up on, not the transistors, the transformers up on Wall Street?

216
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:35,889
And I guess what the impact to that part of the road, any impact for that would be, we live across from it.

217
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,853
But yeah, first time participating.

218
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,094
So thank you guys very much.

219
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:42,715
Thank you so much.

220
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:43,456
That's all we wonder.

221
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:44,396
Yeah.

222
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:45,177
Thank you.

223
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:50,241
Could you answer the question about the transformer and the impact on the road?

224
00:33:52,643 --> 00:33:57,607
The transformer is on top of the pole, so there wouldn't be any impact to the road.

225
00:34:02,347 --> 00:34:09,431
I'm sorry, I guess my question was, I think the transformers are up on Walsh Street, not on Fulton, if I'm correct.

226
00:34:09,691 --> 00:34:14,954
And the pole that's being replaced is the one on the corner of Fulton and Walsh.

227
00:34:15,415 --> 00:34:19,597
That's like the leaning tower of Pisa, like leaning into Fulton Street.

228
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:24,740
Is that the one that's being replaced and put at 574?

229
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,162
The one that's on Fulton currently that's leaning?

230
00:34:30,761 --> 00:34:40,768
That one is also being replaced, but it wasn't brought up because the pole is already existing and has the permission to be there.

231
00:34:41,108 --> 00:34:44,150
So it's just, this is just a new pole.

232
00:34:45,031 --> 00:34:45,371
Okay.

233
00:34:45,491 --> 00:34:56,718
And the new pole on Fulton street will have additional, um, transformers there, I guess, work with the ones on wall street too.

234
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:58,880
Yes.

235
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:26,644
okay great so there'll be new there'll be like i think there's four right now it would be like eight just to whatever number there'll be additional ones yes okay hey thank you guys so much that uh that clarifies a lot we uh a couple of the neighbors were asking questions about it and um it's good to know thank you guys thank you definitely uh i don't change my opinion but yeah thank you

236
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:32,630
Great, thank you for coming and thank you for registering your opinion as part of the public hearing.

237
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,512
And thank you to our representative from National Food for answering some questions.

238
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:38,753
I appreciate it guys, have a great night.

239
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:40,294
Thank you, have a good night.

240
00:35:40,314 --> 00:35:50,500
Are there any further comments on this grant of location as part of the public hearing?

241
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,842
Seeing none, is there a motion?

242
00:35:56,331 --> 00:35:56,831
Oh, sorry.

243
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:58,532
I'm closing the public hearing.

244
00:35:59,972 --> 00:36:00,592

255
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:03,490
It'd be where oh.

256
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:05,792
that's a misprint.

257
00:37:05,812 --> 00:37:08,213

259
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:39,877
The Engineering Division received a joint-loan pole petition from National Grid that includes two additional joint-loan poles near 287 Main Street at Frederick Avenue, dated March 12, 2024.

260
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:44,806
The Engineering Division recommends this grant of location be approved with the following conditions.

261
00:37:44,886 --> 00:38:04,089

Temporary patching using concrete pavement will not be permitted.

268
00:38:38,245 --> 00:38:42,509
And the project site must be swept after the installation or daily and kept free of debris.

269
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:50,375
There's going to be a police detail and there's going to be 72 hour notice so that the Director of Communications can coordinate with National Grid on a better communications.

270
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:56,400
The engineering division also recommends the grain of location for the five inch conduits.

The reconstruction of the wheelchair ramp and the reciprocal ramps located across Main Street and Frederick Avenue, three total, must also be completed.

275
00:39:17,384 --> 00:39:20,746
The city can provide engineering design plans for this reconstruction work.

276

Is there anything you'd like to add, Mr. City Engineer?

282
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:49,203
Seeing none, I do have a letter.

283
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:53,065
Well, I'll let the petitioner speak to it and then I'll open the public hearing.

284
00:39:57,633 --> 00:40:04,816
These polls are just to add additional disconnect switches to the distribution feeder.

285
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:05,977
Great.

286
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:11,120
Do we have any questions for the petitioner or members of the council?

287
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:14,382
Seeing none, I'm going to open the public hearing.

288
00:40:17,043 --> 00:40:17,883
Are you in favor?

289
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:19,524
Yes.

290
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:20,525
Great.

291
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,126
We also received a letter.

292
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:35,225
Dear Mr her to be made to an end 2025 I'm writing in regard to the petition for a grant of location to five zero eight four, please let it be known to the city council and other responsible parties that this exact location at the corner of Frederick Avenue and Main Street.

293
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:38,769
was dedicated as Rapallo Corner by Mayor McGlynn in 2010.

294
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:41,493
The Rapallo Corner sign is currently displayed at that location.

295
00:40:42,354 --> 00:40:53,709
Ceremony was covered by the Boston Globe on November 10, 2011, and also local papers wish to ensure that the Rapallo Corner sign is not removed, or if it be necessary, prominently displayed on the same corner.

296
00:40:54,438 --> 00:40:57,920
The Rapallo family was brought up at 12 Frederick Avenue, the closest one to the corner.

297
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:01,123
They and their descendants lived there for most of the last century.

298
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:04,485
Sal and Anna had seven sons and two daughters.

299
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:07,607
Four of the sons fought in different branches of the military during World War II.

300
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:14,252
My mother, Elizabeth Rapallo, Camerata, now 103 years old, along with her parents, saw each of their brothers off from this corner many years ago.

301
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:20,716
We would be grateful if you pass this information along to the city councilors, National Grid, and other associated entities in the project for their review.

302
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:23,318
We would hope that this honor will be preserved for years to come.

303
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:25,319
We would ask that this item be included on the agenda.

304
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,821
Please contact me if you need additional information.

305
00:41:28,682 --> 00:41:31,224
Please send the sketch referenced in the notice to this email.

306
00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:34,667
Respectfully, Stephen Camerata, graduate, Medford High School, 1967.

307
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:37,689
And I won't read the contact information.

308
00:41:39,851 --> 00:41:44,135
Is this going to, it's not, the city engineer's indicating this isn't going to affect the sign at the street sign?

309
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:46,693
Great, so that will be all set.

310
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:55,536
Do we have any other comments from members of the public on this public hearing regarding the polls at 587 Main Street?

311
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:06,059
Seeing none in the chambers and no hands on Zoom, I'm declaring the public hearing closed.

312
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,660
Do we have a motion?

313
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:14,602
Vice President Collins.

314
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:17,714
Motion to approve with conditions of the Engineering Division.

315
00:42:18,434 --> 00:42:26,360
On the motion to approve the two grants of location with the conditions from the Engineering Division, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

316
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,581
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

317
00:42:31,403 --> 00:42:31,944
Councilor Callahan?

318
00:42:31,964 --> 00:42:32,024
Yes.

319
00:42:32,864 --> 00:42:33,625
Vice President Collins?

320
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:33,705
Yes.

321
00:42:34,245 --> 00:42:34,886
Councilor Lozaro?

322
00:42:34,906 --> 00:42:35,026
Yes.

323
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,207
Councilor Lemming?

324
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:37,648
Yes.

325
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:38,308
Councilor Scarpelli?

326
00:42:38,328 --> 00:42:38,408
Yes.

327
00:42:39,229 --> 00:42:39,709
Councilor Sang?

328
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:39,789
Yes.

329
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:40,830
President Behrs?

330
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,471
Yes.

331
00:42:41,711 --> 00:42:42,371
That would be affirmative.

332
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:42,892
None the negative.

333
00:42:42,912 --> 00:42:43,732
The motion passes.

334
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:44,653
Thank you very much.

335
00:42:46,822 --> 00:42:52,004
I apologize that you will never be able to figure out exactly when you're going to need to be here or be able to leave.

336
00:42:53,085 --> 00:42:58,447
We got you out early tonight, but you were here, I don't know what, till 11 last time?

337
00:42:58,467 --> 00:42:58,447
1030.

338
00:42:59,207 --> 00:42:59,968
You were keeping track.

339
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:01,548
Thank you.

340
00:43:10,677 --> 00:43:11,017
All right.

341
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:13,019
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

342
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:34,156
25088 offered by Council is RO, whereas Immigration and Customs Enforcement has engaged in operations in Medford, and whereas ICE notifies the Medford Police Department when they will be engaged in operations in Medford, and whereas the Medford Police Department is obligated to the residents of Medford to protect their rights and to enforce laws, and whereas it may be a risk to Medford police officers to disclose ICE operations before they happen,

343
00:43:34,977 --> 00:43:41,060
be it resolved by the city council that the chief of police deliver a report of ICE operations in Medford after the fact on a monthly basis.

344
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,081
Councilor Lazaro.

345
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:43,762
Thank you.

346
00:43:44,822 --> 00:44:01,851
We have heard from a few members of the Medford Police Department leadership that that they are notified of federal operations

347
00:44:02,885 --> 00:44:22,090
before they happen, but vague information, and that there would be safety concerns on the MPD's side of things if we as a city council or other members of leadership in Medford were notified prior to operations taking place.

348
00:44:24,271 --> 00:44:29,212
So this resolution, it bears that in mind, hopes to

349
00:44:31,278 --> 00:44:46,243
hear about the police department's knowledge of operations after the fact so that we can remove some of the sort of collective

350
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:53,177
misinformation or fear that may be generated by not knowing what's happening.

351
00:44:54,118 --> 00:45:03,066
There is a little bit of a, I think, a little bit of the goal of the operations that Immigrations

352
00:45:03,652 --> 00:45:05,874
Immigration and Customs Enforcement is engaging in.

353
00:45:06,354 --> 00:45:16,022
A little bit of that goal is to make people feel worried, uncertain, and nervous about going about their business.

354
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:22,047
And I think one of our jobs as city councilors and in city leadership generally

355
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:24,808
is to make our residents feel more safe.

356
00:45:24,908 --> 00:45:41,938
So I think sharing truthful information and being honest about what we know is going to help our residents feel safer and more secure being armed with facts and true information.

357
00:45:42,078 --> 00:45:43,599
So that's the goal here.

358
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:50,183
The intention of this resolution is for it to be delivered in person.

359
00:45:51,402 --> 00:45:56,128
And, um, Chief Buckley is not available right now.

360
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:58,791
He's on leave for a period of time.

361
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:02,135
We have a provisional chief who is Captain Paul Covino.

362
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:06,740
I'm not sure if we refer to him as Chief Covino in the meantime, but, um,

363
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:21,190
I did send him a message seeing if he could make it tonight, and I haven't heard back, but he was here to discuss the Police Department budget, and he spoke about this issue actually already and was very forthright.

364
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:30,056
I have no doubt that our Medford Police Department only has the interest of Medford residents in mind.

365
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:44,474
I'm hopeful that this would just be a matter of transparency and bringing everybody to the table and hoping that we can just share factual information with each other.

366
00:46:44,915 --> 00:47:00,678
Just today, there were ICE operations happening in Medford that I was made aware of, not by the police department or any official methods, but because I got text messages from a variety of people, including, like,

367
00:47:01,114 --> 00:47:04,235
a friend of mine that I know through my kids going to school.

368
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:15,139
And when we share information that way, we don't know

369
00:47:16,353 --> 00:47:17,013
We don't know why.

370
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:29,502
We don't know if people are being picked up because of what happened in Milford, and a kid got taken into custody for six days on his way to volleyball practice, and he was brought here as a child.

371
00:47:30,143 --> 00:47:34,966
And he hadn't broken any laws besides being brought to this country as a child.

372
00:47:35,847 --> 00:47:41,671
We don't know if somebody might be a green card holder or actually just a US citizen who appears to be

373
00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:44,252
the wrong ethnicity.

374
00:47:44,412 --> 00:47:58,015
It's there are a lot of examples from across the country of things that are happening that are not valid reasons to, uh, to pick somebody up off the street.

375
00:47:58,135 --> 00:48:04,856
And I just want to do what we can as city leaders to, um, help our residents feel safe.

376
00:48:06,276 --> 00:48:08,996
And I think this is one of the least that we can do.

377
00:48:09,577 --> 00:48:09,857
Thank you.

378
00:48:10,997 --> 00:48:12,197
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

379
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:13,786
Thank you.

380
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:27,665
Um, I have spent a lot of this week talking to residents who are scared and confused about what we can do in the city regarding ice and it's difficult because

381
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:45,735
requires us to be really creative and I'm very grateful for the residents who've been pushing us as councillors to be even more on top of this, to be even more creative about this, who are helping us come up with more solutions as well.

382
00:48:46,035 --> 00:48:52,459
I recognize that there's much more to do than what we are doing right now, but we are doing a lot.

383
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:58,726
Um, there's a lot of advocacy that needs to be done across departments across City Hall.

384
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:05,051
Um, and this is, um, this is one of those things that I, you know, I do.

385
00:49:05,852 --> 00:49:12,197
I completely agree with Councilors are we need to be transparent with what we're doing when we have information.

386
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:13,038
I think

387
00:49:14,193 --> 00:49:21,164
It behooves us to know that information, especially as we are the conduits to the people, you know, we represent the people of the city.

388
00:49:22,366 --> 00:49:23,868
And the people of the city are scared.

389
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:26,792
This morning's reports about ice in our community.

390
00:49:28,517 --> 00:49:33,020
certainly, I think, caused a lot of fear with residents.

391
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,481
I heard a lot of it about it this morning.

392
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:45,548
And even, you know, my parents who are, you know, green card holders here, right, hearing about ICE's presence in Medford.

393
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:55,882
unsettles things because we've all seen the evidence online that they're not always just going after who they have a warrant for.

394
00:49:55,902 --> 00:49:57,702
A lot of the times there is profiling.

395
00:49:57,742 --> 00:50:06,223
They're trying to stop anyone and trick them into opening their car doors or opening their house home doors.

396
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:14,805
And so it's important for us to know what kinds of things are happening in the city so we know how to best respond and best protect our residents' rights.

397
00:50:15,785 --> 00:50:21,611
Um, so I'm, you know, grateful for Councilors are for for sponsoring this resolution.

398
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:29,459
I would even be open to an even more frequent report from the police department.

399
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,946
I think that, you know, a lot, even after we pass this resolution, a lot of work has to be done.

400
00:50:36,046 --> 00:50:38,148
And if there isn't enough compliance will

401
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:46,746
I would be open to revisiting parts of the welcoming city ordinance to strengthen what's there and to explore paths there.

402
00:50:47,827 --> 00:50:58,615
And I think while we're on this note, I also ask from our leaders in administration for greater clarity on these issues too.

403
00:50:58,715 --> 00:51:07,221
There's a lot of city staff who don't completely know what the policy is when, for example, agents come in to

404
00:51:07,848 --> 00:51:17,933
a public building or even a non-public building, like, for example, a library or a food bank.

405
00:51:18,633 --> 00:51:24,756
If agents come in without a warrant and are trying to look for someone, what can we do to protect our residents there?

406
00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:28,438
And there's just not a lot of clarity at the moment.

407
00:51:29,649 --> 00:51:31,389
on those issues, on those scenarios.

408
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:44,853
There's not a lot of clarity on what the police department's policy is when it comes to peaceful protests and what gets interpreted as a threat to justice or obstruction of justice.

409
00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:52,715
How do we as a city create the policies to define what falls under that bucket and what falls under another bucket?

410
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:56,476
So that's all to say, I think this is a very helpful step.

411
00:51:57,036 --> 00:52:03,261
My hope is that at the future meetings where we do have the chief of police president will be able to talk through a lot of these questions.

412
00:52:04,782 --> 00:52:14,330
I would love in the future going forward and even more open channels of dialogue with administration about maybe educating city staff about what we can do.

413
00:52:15,271 --> 00:52:15,511
Thanks.

414
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:19,915
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

415
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,541
Thank you, President Behrs.

416
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:27,405
I want to thank Councilor Zaro for bringing this forward to me.

417
00:52:27,525 --> 00:52:45,341
This proposed policy is about getting correct information into the community from a central source instead of continuing to rely on informal networks, hearsay, social media, and rumors, which is what is currently happening in the community, and I don't think that's in anybody's best interests.

418
00:52:47,002 --> 00:53:04,490
This would be a show of transparency from Medford Police Department which we know is a stated goal of theirs and something that they are working to enhance every week every month every year through various policies and I think that this would fit very neatly into that overall goal of transparency from Medford Police Department.

419
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:25,907
Right now, as I said, community members are the ones doing the work of trying to disabuse rumors about ICE in the community and verify correct ones when there are reports shared in text message groups or on social media about sightings of what people think to be ICE but aren't sure and sometimes are and sometimes are not.

420
00:53:27,188 --> 00:53:45,002
Verifying correct information and sharing it, even after the fact, I think, is for, you know, everybody's well being, and I think it's important that everybody have a better sense and accurate sense that they can rely on about when ISIS in the community and what in fact they are.

421
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:50,264
doing here and I don't think that should fall on these informal networks and community members entirely.

422
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:58,728
I think it's actually really inappropriate for the city to be essentially outsourcing that to volunteers and informal networks and to social media posting.

423
00:54:00,189 --> 00:54:08,953
At the same time, I think that this kind of after action report is the very least that our public safety officials could be doing for the community.

424
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:17,602
Our goal as a city should not just be to make community members feel more safe, but to make them actually more safe.

425
00:54:18,343 --> 00:54:24,971
That is why I have advocated and hoped and urged our administration

426
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:52,210
to do things like have the Medford Police Department not just be a force that is verifying and reporting on ICE activity in our community, but I would like for them in the future, and I can't say at the moment I have a lot of optimism that this would come to pass, but I think it would be very appropriate for our public safety officials to make best efforts to be on scene when ICE tells them that they will be in Medford and be doing the work of

427
00:54:52,750 --> 00:55:02,562
verifying identification of the people that they say they are there to talk to or detain or arrest and verify that warrants are proper and they have been signed for a judge.

428
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:08,690
And this is because that we know from communities as close as Somerville and as far away as the other part of the country,

429
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:18,056
that ICE lies, and ICE arrests people that are not the people they say they're there for, and ICE arrests people without proper warrants.

430
00:55:18,197 --> 00:55:32,607
So I believe this is the least that we can do, because what would be most appropriate for our police department to be doing is making sure that public safety also extends to people with whom ICE has an interest.

431
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:35,588
but this is a good place to start.

432
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:42,191
I would make a friendly amendment to the councilor if you're open to it, that we should institutionalize making this more frequent.

433
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:52,034
I would say a weekly report from MPD submitted to the city council with biweekly presentations at the city council regular meetings.

434
00:55:52,134 --> 00:56:02,478
And that is again, just to the goal of getting regular information from trusted sources and bringing some transparency to this very upsetting issue.

435
00:56:02,498 --> 00:56:03,298
Thank you.

436
00:56:04,993 --> 00:56:07,314
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

437
00:56:07,334 --> 00:56:09,355
Thank you.

438
00:56:10,015 --> 00:56:22,380
So, as I think many of my fellow City Councilors, I also feel that we are relatively powerless in this situation, which I'm not happy about.

439
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,662
I really appreciate the work of Councilor Lozaro in

440
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:46,109
talking to our police chief and getting an understanding from our police what they feel capable of doing, what they feel that they can do, what they are willing to do, and I'm very appreciative of that behind-the-scenes work.

441
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:51,371
I do think that this will be really important for people, and my hope is that we

442
00:56:52,772 --> 00:56:59,880
you know, the reports are that there is not a lot of ice activity and that people then feel more comfortable.

443
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:04,665
But of course, if there is, I think that is also very important for the public to know about.

444
00:57:05,065 --> 00:57:14,255
My only request was going to be, which I believe Councilor Collins also just put into her request, that it's specified that it is done at a City Council meeting so that it can be

445
00:57:14,675 --> 00:57:23,280
to be part of the public record because I think that's that's a to me almost the most important part of what this request is about is about getting this information to the public.

446
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,002
Um so thank you so much for this work that you're doing.

447
00:57:28,022 --> 00:57:30,643
Councilor Callihan, do you have any further comments from members of the council?

448
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:31,924
Councilor Scarpelli.

449
00:57:34,065 --> 00:57:40,709
Um first of all, the the situation with Marcelo Gomez Silver, I think that for me personally, it it it hits me

450
00:57:44,475 --> 00:58:03,987
It reminds me of all of my boys that I've coached in Somerville and a lot of those young men and young ladies that were part of the DACA process and were in process to be legalized really disappeared.

451
00:58:04,188 --> 00:58:12,093
And I think that's what hit me, the fact that it's something that

452
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:20,282
has to stop when it comes to members of our community that don't deserve it.

453
00:58:20,582 --> 00:58:22,763
And that's what I think is important.

454
00:58:23,224 --> 00:58:42,236
And I appreciate Councilor Zaho bringing this forward, but I know I talked to the Chief when he was here, and I know that the leadership team was here the other day, and I did have a brief conversation with Captain Covino, or Acting Chief Covino, and he expressed how difficult that is, and having, I mean, I think it's

455
00:58:43,999 --> 00:58:56,702
It's all meant for the right reasons, but I think it's very difficult, as he put it, that a lot of times they're not mandated to report to the city of Mentored either.

456
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:16,408
So to get a complete report to the city council, especially weekly, it's gonna be, I mean, if it's just for what they know, I can understand that, but I don't think we're gonna get a true understanding of what's really happening with ICE involvement in the community, just for the fact that they don't know a lot of times.

457
00:59:16,668 --> 00:59:26,494
And to Councilor Collins' point that, you know, being more involved in it, I think in the conversation we had,

458
00:59:27,294 --> 00:59:36,058
they really can't in the sense that they're mandated as law offices to support any agency that comes in the city.

459
00:59:37,278 --> 00:59:48,543
And, you know, and I think that's not realistic and unfortunate, but I think that finding some sort of avenue that would be more realistic.

460
00:59:48,563 --> 00:59:56,567
I know that today I've had many phone calls from a few former players that worked in the neighborhood that ICE was in today and they didn't,

461
00:59:57,075 --> 00:59:58,315
they were calling me for guidance.

462
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:07,817
And the idea that they're legal now, they're documented, but still afraid.

463
01:00:08,157 --> 01:00:16,719
And the fact that when I did some homework, it wasn't actually an ICE movement in that area today, it was state police.

464
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,040
And that brings up another point.

465
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,081
It's not just ICE that doesn't talk to our or work with our

466
01:00:25,228 --> 01:00:30,119
or mandated to tell our police department anything, it's also the state police.

467
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,123
So it's a slippery slope.

468
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:33,266
And to ask them to

469
01:00:34,888 --> 01:00:38,711
have them report to something they can't do, I think it's very difficult.

470
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:43,834
So that's my reservation, whether I can support this or not.

471
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:58,444
I support the measure in its spirit, 1,000%, but I think that right now we're in flux with understanding what the process is legally.

472
01:00:59,045 --> 01:01:01,630
with our police department, what they can and can't do.

473
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:07,643
So just wanted to share that with my fellow counselors and the conversations I've had.

474
01:01:08,404 --> 01:01:08,685
Thank you.

475
01:01:10,482 --> 01:01:11,043
Thank you.

476
01:01:12,224 --> 01:01:12,844
Councilor Sang.

477
01:01:13,445 --> 01:01:13,785
Thank you.

478
01:01:14,145 --> 01:01:18,389
I just wanted to, you know, add to the conversation in case it addresses some of the worries.

479
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:31,381
But at the meeting, at the budget meeting where the police team was present, what they had said was that reporting it, you know, on the day of

480
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,541
was what they would consider not wise.

481
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:39,582
So essentially the difference is this is an after report.

482
01:01:40,102 --> 01:01:50,105
And that one, when we asked that question, that question was about once you hear it, can you call the mayor of Medford and the city council president?

483
01:01:50,505 --> 01:01:52,986
So those are two different scenarios.

484
01:01:53,706 --> 01:02:01,208
So when Chief Buckley was addressing that, he was addressing the on the spot scenario and not the after report scenario.

485
01:02:02,328 --> 01:02:13,914
And then when it comes to the level of cooperation with federal authorities, federal agencies, it is actually within our powers not to cooperate with ICE.

486
01:02:14,334 --> 01:02:17,135
There are 10th Amendment cases about this.

487
01:02:18,656 --> 01:02:23,418
And there's established court precedent about not doing that precedent.

488
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:26,740
And that's why we have the Welcoming City Ordinance, and that's why it's legally sound.

489
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:34,106
The line is, you know, actively obstructing certain work.

490
01:02:35,027 --> 01:02:36,127
That is where the line is.

491
01:02:36,187 --> 01:02:39,088
But this report doesn't cross that line.

492
01:02:39,629 --> 01:02:41,830
And I don't think it's anywhere near that line.

493
01:02:45,891 --> 01:02:46,832
Vice President Collins.

494
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:49,653
Thank you, President Behrs.

495
01:02:49,693 --> 01:02:52,114
And Justin, I really appreciate this discussion.

496
01:02:52,174 --> 01:02:53,495
I know that all counselors are

497
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:04,215
feeling very grave about the situation that our community and other communities all across the nation are facing and that we all share.

498
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:14,360
a really profound sense of sadness and grief and anxiety over knowing what our constituents and community members and neighbors are going through.

499
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:27,185
But just in terms of framing what we have to expect from ourselves and other leaders in the community, I think that we should be holding our public safety officials to the same

500
01:03:28,645 --> 01:03:37,809
standard to which community members, just normal residents, are also entitled to say, hey, who are you?

501
01:03:37,909 --> 01:03:38,529
Are you ICE?

502
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:40,350
What's your badge number?

503
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:41,590
Why are you here?

504
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:42,551
What's going on?

505
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,532
These are things that it is legally protected for.

506
01:03:46,412 --> 01:03:49,214
any resident on the street to ask of law enforcement.

507
01:03:51,015 --> 01:04:01,162
I think it would be, well, I know it would be constitutional, and I think it would be really fair and appropriate for MPD to have the community's backs in asking those questions too.

508
01:04:02,502 --> 01:04:10,808
Apparently, that is outside the bounds of what is possible for city leadership right now, and I find that really regrettable, and I hope that that window shifts over time.

509
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:20,876
But in the meantime, I think it's really not enough to just share our solidarity and our sorrow.

510
01:04:20,896 --> 01:04:30,164
We need to be trying to move that window on what we can be doing to at least infuse some daylight into this really grave time in our community.

511
01:04:30,224 --> 01:04:32,747
So I just wanted to put that into the discussion.

512
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:37,511
I wanna, again, thank Councilor Lazaro for bringing this forward and I would move the question.

513
01:04:41,884 --> 01:04:48,288
I'm gonna go to Councilor Lemmon and Councilor, oh, I think it's actually Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Lemmon, Councilor Scarpelli.

514
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,411
Sorry, is it me, Councilman?

515
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:53,051
Yeah, thanks.

516
01:04:53,952 --> 01:05:09,462
And again, I understand what my fellow councilors are saying, but again, as much as I respect my fellow councilors and their ability with the perception of the law with this,

517
01:05:10,288 --> 01:05:19,653
the discussion I had with our leadership team in the police department is very, it was very black and white and what they can and can't do.

518
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:37,943
And I, even with the question with the welcoming city, why I couldn't support the welcoming city ordinance because the input of the chief at the time wasn't involved by crafting that because when I spoke with him, he made it, he made it clear that it really, it's really divided line when it comes to

519
01:05:39,184 --> 01:05:48,392
what we can ask him to do as an ordinance and what their position and their responsibilities and oaths are as police officers.

520
01:05:48,472 --> 01:05:57,080
So believe me, I don't, I should, you know, I just want to make sure that

521
01:05:58,892 --> 01:06:11,020
people clear because I had discussions today with a few of my friends that are going through this process and understanding the limitations.

522
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:19,865
So we also have to be true and that the community has to understand that our police department is limited.

523
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:27,290
So I would err to their judgment and understand

524
01:06:28,345 --> 01:06:45,498
follow their lead with this process, whether I believe in it or not, they are our professionals in this field, and I've been educated by their situations and what they're mandated to do with this process.

525
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:52,704
So it's not easy, it's very difficult, but I just wanted to share that process, so thank you.

526
01:06:54,806 --> 01:06:56,307
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

527
01:06:57,983 --> 01:07:07,225
One, when the police are presenting the budget, I specifically asked them if they're capable of executing this ordinance, providing periodic reports.

528
01:07:07,805 --> 01:07:10,485
They said they're working towards that, but it was doable.

529
01:07:10,505 --> 01:07:11,846
Okay.

530
01:07:12,226 --> 01:07:25,408
Two, saying that the input of the police chief is, well, using that as an excuse that you kind of go back to for not supporting these things, it's just something that

531
01:07:26,098 --> 01:07:27,158
We've heard time and time again.

532
01:07:27,178 --> 01:07:42,822
I mean, last time I heard a lack of support for this, for a surveillance report, because supposedly it wasn't, didn't get the approval of the police chief when it had actually been written by the police chief.

533
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:45,123
So I don't think that that's a reason to not do this.

534
01:07:45,203 --> 01:07:52,405
Third, we've had the thoughts and prayers, like language coming out of

535
01:07:53,685 --> 01:07:57,868
local politicians for the longest time and I just don't think it's satisfactory.

536
01:07:57,888 --> 01:08:06,293
Okay, this is a very basic minimal response, but it is something, and people don't want to keep hearing.

537
01:08:07,153 --> 01:08:14,898
Oh, I'm very concerned I'm knitting my eyebrows for people in this community who are being abducted by ice and shipped off to El Salvador.

538
01:08:15,701 --> 01:08:26,467
but they have my thoughts and prayers, but I can't support the minimal legislation possible to actually do something about that or even make them feel more safe.

539
01:08:26,507 --> 01:08:29,448
So I just, it's an excuse.

540
01:08:29,568 --> 01:08:36,652
I mean, the welcoming city ordinance is something that's been passed by multiple other cities in the Commonwealth.

541
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:38,273
It's been passed by many other states.

542
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:41,855
It is the least that we can do.

543
01:08:42,715 --> 01:08:43,256
And this is,

544
01:08:44,212 --> 01:08:52,237
Another, like an after action report showing where ICE was in the community is also the least that we can do.

545
01:08:53,277 --> 01:09:00,702
People are feeling unsafe right now and they wanna know that the police department has their back, is there for them.

546
01:09:01,782 --> 01:09:08,366
And this ordinance or this resolution gives them a framework to let them know that they can do that.

547
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,327
That's all I have to say.

548
01:09:10,487 --> 01:09:12,989
Councilor Zara, then Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Zara.

549
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:15,459
Thank you.

550
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:27,484
We are working very hard with us to abide by all of the laws that we are aware of, everything from local ordinances up to the U.S.

551
01:09:27,524 --> 01:09:28,304
Constitution.

552
01:09:28,584 --> 01:09:34,347
And it feels to me that the federal administration is only abiding by the laws that it

553
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:37,459
finds to be aligned with their goals.

554
01:09:38,099 --> 01:09:45,783
So I think what we have to ask ourselves is what are our intrinsic values and what is guiding us morally?

555
01:09:45,963 --> 01:09:51,486
And what is the thing that we want to do to best take care of our residents?

556
01:09:51,846 --> 01:10:01,071
And how can we carry forward our goals while following all the laws to the best of our knowledge?

557
01:10:01,091 --> 01:10:02,971
And I think this more than covers that.

558
01:10:04,741 --> 01:10:06,542
It's a very simple resolution.

559
01:10:06,562 --> 01:10:09,803
I think that our police department is more than capable of doing it.

560
01:10:12,104 --> 01:10:16,445
I think they're willing and able, well able to do it.

561
01:10:16,665 --> 01:10:20,127
It's a small lift and I'm sure we can make it happen.

562
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:20,847
Thanks.

563
01:10:21,907 --> 01:10:22,528
Thank you.

564
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:26,549
I just wanted to note that Captain Camino is chairing a traffic commission meeting tonight.

565
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:28,190
Councilor Scarpelli.

566
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,411
Thank you, Councilor Villes.

567
01:10:30,971 --> 01:10:34,132
I know that some of my colleagues get really offended and angry

568
01:10:34,909 --> 01:10:37,592
when people don't align with their beliefs.

569
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:48,561
And even though there might be other sides, it's shocking to see their behavior and how angry they can get because there's other viewpoints.

570
01:10:49,102 --> 01:10:49,803
And that's sad.

571
01:10:50,924 --> 01:10:52,825
So it's really disappointing.

572
01:10:53,286 --> 01:10:58,290
But again, I stand with both the video surveillance

573
01:11:00,078 --> 01:11:20,832
ordinance and with the welcoming ordinance that I had discussions with the police and the police were involved in crafting both the original welcoming city process and then also being involved with the surveillance process because a lot had to do with the body cameras.

574
01:11:21,492 --> 01:11:23,534
But as they move forward to make changes,

575
01:11:25,288 --> 01:11:27,530
the police weren't involved in those discussions.

576
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:28,690
That's why I didn't support it.

577
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:33,493
Whether it's, it angers some counselors, I could care less.

578
01:11:34,834 --> 01:11:40,678
But to understand the process, I think it's transparent and open.

579
01:11:41,419 --> 01:11:50,685
So it's, to say words like, you know, to just say things, like they're empty.

580
01:11:53,527 --> 01:11:56,670
Obviously, some counselors don't know their fellow counselors.

581
01:11:57,931 --> 01:12:09,059
Because I can assure, I can tell you this, I'm sure no one in this room right now stood in a young man's home with eyes staring down at their four family members.

582
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:16,385
So I understand exactly what it is, but I also understand what the limitations were for their local police department.

583
01:12:16,425 --> 01:12:19,428
Now, that's not to say that I'm not gonna support this,

584
01:12:20,746 --> 01:12:23,247
but it's also an understanding that it's difficult.

585
01:12:23,307 --> 01:12:39,250
And I want people to understand that the discussions I had with the police department, it's very difficult to ask them what you're asking them tonight because they're mandated for other mandates through the state or by what they're sworn in for.

586
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:46,952
So just to share that side of it and being angry about it is so immature and disrespectful.

587
01:12:47,452 --> 01:12:48,412
This is the rhetoric

588
01:12:49,768 --> 01:12:52,270
that people are alarmed with in this community right now.

589
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:56,493
This is where the divide is, because this council didn't stand.

590
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:58,534
I'm not standing for any sympathy.

591
01:12:59,355 --> 01:13:00,115
I'm understand.

592
01:13:00,195 --> 01:13:08,441
I'm sharing this from personal experience, but it's also another side that has to be mentioned, because I did talk to the police department.

593
01:13:08,962 --> 01:13:11,503
I did talk to Captain of Acting Chief Covino.

594
01:13:12,104 --> 01:13:16,327
I did talk to Chief Buckley at the time with these concerns and issues.

595
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:17,828
So

596
01:13:19,178 --> 01:13:22,119
you know, if I hurt your feelings, too bad.

597
01:13:22,139 --> 01:13:24,339
Thank you.

598
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:27,340
Thanks.

599
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,401
Do we have anything else from members of the council?

600
01:13:35,242 --> 01:13:46,445
I'm just going to give my very short two cents, which is I think that in these extraordinary times, we sometimes have to call on people to do more than the minimum and

601
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:57,349
You know, when we have people obviously and flagrantly violating the constitution and the laws of our country, we have to ask what our response looks like.

602
01:13:57,409 --> 01:14:01,891
That goes beyond just what we've done in the past.

603
01:14:02,992 --> 01:14:05,573
I'm gonna go to public participation.

604
01:14:06,533 --> 01:14:08,474
We have two hands on Zoom.

605
01:14:08,494 --> 01:14:11,035
It looks like we have some people lining up at the podium.

606
01:14:11,055 --> 01:14:15,157
And then I also have a comment to read in, which I'll do after everyone has spoken.

607
01:14:16,033 --> 01:14:17,114
We'll start at the podium.

608
01:14:17,294 --> 01:14:19,015
You'll have three minutes.

609
01:14:19,095 --> 01:14:21,096
Name and address for the record, please.

610
01:14:21,516 --> 01:14:22,497
Is this on the mic?

611
01:14:22,597 --> 01:14:22,937
Thanks.

612
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:23,597
You're on.

613
01:14:23,657 --> 01:14:24,778
President Pierce.

614
01:14:25,118 --> 01:14:25,938
Good evening, everyone.

615
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:34,623
I actually came here for residential comments because it's been brewing for about three years and many of us have questions.

616
01:14:35,284 --> 01:14:42,628
But on the subject of ice, I actually called my aunt yesterday because she's elderly and she lives in a lovely area of L.A.

617
01:14:43,628 --> 01:14:46,231
very, very, very, very big place, as you know.

618
01:14:47,492 --> 01:14:59,865
Most of the trouble is down by Georgia Stadium, and unfortunately, because of the attacks on ICE and on the police, the judges had to move the whole location of the ball game yesterday.

619
01:15:00,425 --> 01:15:05,847
If you're not into baseball, you probably don't care, but that's something very big to be thinking about.

620
01:15:06,848 --> 01:15:12,210
First of all, in the community, everybody should know the true definition of ICE.

621
01:15:13,351 --> 01:15:14,831
Who is an ICE agent?

622
01:15:14,871 --> 01:15:15,912
What is an ICE agent?

623
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:18,273
What level of government do they operate on?

624
01:15:20,273 --> 01:15:39,240
Also, when you were talking about having the police and the ICE maybe working on certain acts that were to come or after the fact, what method did you propose that the public could be advised?

625
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,721
And I'm going to give you an example.

626
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:50,383
About four or five years ago, I noticed that Councilor Schapelle probably contested this.

627
01:15:51,524 --> 01:16:00,726
We had robocalls, even if there was a burglary in your area, especially if there were two or three within a month, they just stopped.

628
01:16:01,587 --> 01:16:09,509
So about two summers ago, coming home, there was a state police car at the end of Governor's Avenue, just about where I live.

629
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:15,926
and two Memphis police cars for a day and a half.

630
01:16:16,686 --> 01:16:20,190
Ambulances all taped off, dogs, the whole works.

631
01:16:21,031 --> 01:16:22,213
I called the police station.

632
01:16:22,253 --> 01:16:24,335
They said, we cannot give you any information.

633
01:16:24,816 --> 01:16:25,877
That's state land.

634
01:16:26,357 --> 01:16:31,003
We found through the grave found that week that a body had been found on the walking trail.

635
01:16:32,023 --> 01:16:39,245
The same thing had happened about two years before, same response state and city couldn't give any information.

636
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:43,947
People who are near dead bodies should be acknowledged.

637
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:48,948
So this to me should be a workout, not tonight.

638
01:16:49,408 --> 01:16:51,449
I don't think you're gonna come up with an answer tonight.

639
01:16:51,949 --> 01:16:55,270
We also have to be very, very careful of our language.

640
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:58,471
Someone used the word, a nice agent abducted someone.

641
01:16:58,931 --> 01:17:00,632
They don't go out and kidnap people.

642
01:17:01,352 --> 01:17:11,559
So I just wanted to make it known that there's many people in the communities who are very aware of who ICE is, what's going on.

643
01:17:12,339 --> 01:17:17,062
We'd like to have a little bit better security updates.

644
01:17:17,303 --> 01:17:25,068
We don't even have a newspaper anymore that people could access during the week for their own safety, even before this.

645
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:31,150
So I think you have a little work going on before you can really come to a plan for this.

646
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:32,870
Thank you for your intent.

647
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:34,331
Thank you, Sharon.

648
01:17:38,872 --> 01:17:40,113
One second, Andy.

649
01:17:41,253 --> 01:17:42,013
Andy Castanetti.

650
01:17:42,594 --> 01:17:43,974
Your hand's raised on Zoom, but you're here.

651
01:17:44,014 --> 01:17:44,854
I'll take you in person.

652
01:17:55,677 --> 01:17:56,417
Okay, thanks.

653
01:17:56,497 --> 01:17:59,778
Then I'm going to go to Steve Schnapp on Zoom.

654
01:18:00,619 --> 01:18:02,899
Steve, name and address for the record, please.

655
01:18:02,919 --> 01:18:05,260
I'm going to let you start your video and you'll have three minutes.

656
01:18:10,762 --> 01:18:11,922
My name is Steve Schnapp.

657
01:18:12,263 --> 01:18:15,003
I live at 36 Hillside Avenue.

658
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:18,885
I want to read something.

659
01:18:21,005 --> 01:18:25,307
We place the highest value on the life and safety of all people.

660
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:31,073
We value individual rights and the human dignity of all.

661
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:35,696
We act with fairness, restraint, and impartiality in carrying out our duties.

662
01:18:37,317 --> 01:18:44,561
We are a proactive, problem-solving agency that strives to serve all with compassion and empathy.

663
01:18:45,682 --> 01:18:55,769
We are committed to providing the highest quality of professional law enforcement services with the goal of enhancing the quality of life for all within our community.

664
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,143
We have compassion for victims of crime.

665
01:19:00,384 --> 01:19:06,747
As members of the community, we have respect for and promote the diversity of our community.

666
01:19:07,387 --> 01:19:14,911
We advocate for social and other support services for victims, youth, and others involved in the criminal justice system.

667
01:19:15,911 --> 01:19:19,093
That's in the mission statement of the Medford Police Department.

668
01:19:20,309 --> 01:19:29,415
It seems to me that what the council is asking is completely consistent with the mission statement of the Medford Police Department.

669
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:31,356
Thank you very much.

670
01:19:33,037 --> 01:19:33,497
Thank you.

671
01:19:33,517 --> 01:19:40,662
I'm going to go back to the podium.

672
01:19:41,062 --> 01:19:42,183
Name and address for the record, please.

673
01:19:42,203 --> 01:19:42,823
You have three minutes.

674
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:47,140
Hi, my name is Julia Hendricks, I live at 86 2nd Street.

675
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:58,536
The last time I looked the Medford police work for the town city of Medford and the residents of Medford not the federal government, and so that they should be willing to release information

676
01:19:59,177 --> 01:20:07,403
especially after the fact about issues that concern the safety of the citizens of Medford and specifically related to ice.

677
01:20:08,484 --> 01:20:19,012
I'm particularly offended by the fact that Medford police work with open faces with badge numbers and with name tags and I can walk up to any Medford police officer anywhere and know who they are.

678
01:20:19,452 --> 01:20:22,253
And ice agents are coming into our community with mask.

679
01:20:22,653 --> 01:20:30,695
They are wearing out wearing shirts that say police on the back, which they are not and they were refusing to give any kind of identification.

680
01:20:31,215 --> 01:20:37,897
So we have a police department that is holding itself to a higher standard than the federal government ice agents are.

681
01:20:38,757 --> 01:20:43,180
and will not give us information about when ICE is in our community.

682
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:50,626
I would also like to say that I would very much like these reports to happen in city council meetings every other week so that they are part of the public record.

683
01:20:50,766 --> 01:20:51,146
Thank you.

684
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:52,527
Thank you.

685
01:20:55,089 --> 01:20:56,010
Stay at the podium.

686
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,811
Name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

687
01:20:59,747 --> 01:21:01,827
Good evening, Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road.

688
01:21:02,468 --> 01:21:12,190
So I just want to point out something that I noticed in looking at this resolution in comparison to the Sanctuary City Ordinance that we recently passed.

689
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:16,010
So I don't think the resolution is actually consistent with the ordinance.

690
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:23,012
So going to in the ordinance section 5105, there is a reporting requirement in there already.

691
01:21:23,692 --> 01:21:25,133
I'm going to just read a little bit from it.

692
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:43,741
It says beginning on the date of passage of this ordinance and every six months thereafter, Medford chief of police shall submit a report with the information detailed below in a de identified manner relating to the preceding six months to, and then it goes on to say, the Public Health and Community Safety Committee of the Medford City Council.

693
01:21:44,725 --> 01:21:54,012
In accordance with the provisions of the open meeting law and then it goes on the list specifically what is to be included in this report total number of ice detainers administrative warrants.

694
01:21:54,712 --> 01:22:05,720
Account of each instance in which information was given to a federal immigration agency with the names of individuals redacted and so forth, so to me, it seems like.

695
01:22:06,885 --> 01:22:12,269
In order to make the reporting requirement more frequent, what would need to be done is amend the ordinance.

696
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:17,633
So I don't think this resolution would be enforceable because, again, I think it's inconsistent with the ordinance.

697
01:22:18,794 --> 01:22:28,401
So I think at a minimum, what you should do is at least talk to legal counsel about this to see if there's a conflict and if the ordinance does need to be amended.

698
01:22:30,042 --> 01:22:35,567
But otherwise, I think more practically, I don't think this resolution is entirely necessary because there's already a reporting requirement.

699
01:22:36,628 --> 01:22:38,289
So I don't think it's necessary to pass.

700
01:22:38,429 --> 01:22:39,690
So those are my thoughts.

701
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:40,330
Thank you.

702
01:22:41,151 --> 01:22:41,691
Thank you.

703
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:48,414
Just on that point, you know, we can, this is a request for additional reporting beyond what's required by the ordinance.

704
01:22:48,575 --> 01:23:00,801
So if someone wants to propose an ordinance amendment to go further, and just as one counselor who voted for the welcoming city ordinance, we did vote on that before this administration began its assault on our communities.

705
01:23:00,881 --> 01:23:03,583
And so I don't think a lot of people

706
01:23:04,865 --> 01:23:11,513
had the hindsight or had the foresight, I should say, to realize how bad this would be, but maybe we didn't.

707
01:23:11,613 --> 01:23:12,954
And in hindsight, we're asking for more.

708
01:23:16,118 --> 01:23:18,040
At the podium, name and address for the record, please.

709
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:18,681
You have three minutes.

710
01:23:20,572 --> 01:23:22,593
Hi, my name is Beth Fasciatelli.

711
01:23:22,653 --> 01:23:32,179
I live at 39 Carolina Street, and I'm in support of the resolution that Councilor Lazaro has proposed, and thank you for proposing it.

712
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:43,527
We are living in unprecedented times, and I think in response, we need to be bold in setting precedent.

713
01:23:44,598 --> 01:23:49,083
Otherwise precedent is going to be set for us, which is happening right now.

714
01:23:51,044 --> 01:23:59,132
We were talking about the legality of this the feasibility of this this is all unchartered territory.

715
01:23:59,853 --> 01:24:01,354
and we need to start somewhere.

716
01:24:01,854 --> 01:24:10,017
We cannot wait until we fine tune a plan to begin tracking ISIS activity in our community.

717
01:24:10,517 --> 01:24:11,298
We need to start.

718
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:21,362
It will be difficult, there will be imperfections, and those can be discussed with the police department about the challenges that they're facing

719
01:24:22,002 --> 01:24:26,468
in giving us numbers, but the fact is that we need transparency.

720
01:24:26,989 --> 01:24:33,137
Otherwise, the fear will rise, and that is not safe for our community either.

721
01:24:37,036 --> 01:24:41,262
There was a phrase earlier used, members of our community who don't deserve it.

722
01:24:42,323 --> 01:24:50,694
No one deserves what is happening right now with the ICE abductions, and I am going to call them abductions because they are.

723
01:24:51,135 --> 01:24:51,836
They're illegal.

724
01:24:52,336 --> 01:24:56,800
The people who are being taken and separated from their families are green card holders.

725
01:24:57,461 --> 01:24:58,742
They have student visas.

726
01:24:59,903 --> 01:25:09,491
They have temporary protective status, TPS, which was a very legal way of being in this country up until the president's recent executive order.

727
01:25:10,252 --> 01:25:19,375
They may be people who entered this country undocumented, but then since have followed the legal routes to establishing a residency here.

728
01:25:20,015 --> 01:25:26,477
These are people who are following the rules and are trying to make a good life for them and their families.

729
01:25:26,617 --> 01:25:28,558
We owe this to them.

730
01:25:29,638 --> 01:25:30,479
Let's be bold.

731
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:34,760
Let's be courageous in this time of fear and challenge.

732
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:35,540
Thank you.

733
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,021
Thank you.

734
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,300
I'm going to go to Zoom.

735
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,241
I'm going to go to Kathleen Mills-Curran.

736
01:25:44,261 --> 01:25:52,324
Kathleen, I'm going to request that you unmute and allow you to start your video, and then you'll be able to speak.

737
01:25:52,384 --> 01:25:54,124
And please provide your name and address for the record.

738
01:25:54,144 --> 01:25:54,904
You'll have three minutes.

739
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:56,765
Hello.

740
01:25:57,345 --> 01:25:57,745
Thank you.

741
01:25:57,985 --> 01:25:58,445
Can you hear me?

742
01:25:59,405 --> 01:25:59,586
Yes.

743
01:25:59,826 --> 01:26:00,146
Thank you.

744
01:26:00,846 --> 01:26:01,046
Great.

745
01:26:01,106 --> 01:26:01,466
Thank you.

746
01:26:02,186 --> 01:26:03,967
And thank you for providing Zoom access for this.

747
01:26:03,987 --> 01:26:04,687
That's very helpful.

748
01:26:05,497 --> 01:26:07,279
I want to speak in favor of the resolution.

749
01:26:07,859 --> 01:26:18,549
Many reports from local communities have talked to the families of people taken by ICE and established that it can be simply very difficult to find when a person has been arrested.

750
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:30,080
Since ICE agents are often working without identifying themselves by name or badge number and are sometimes working without clear warrants, it can be very difficult for families of people arrested by ICE to simply

751
01:26:30,473 --> 01:26:31,934
confirm what has happened.

752
01:26:32,694 --> 01:26:35,796
I think when the Medford police arrest something, it is a matter of public record.

753
01:26:36,356 --> 01:26:39,678
Families can find out full details to understand what has happened.

754
01:26:40,318 --> 01:26:46,742
And our daily police logs show even simple things like noise complaints or parking issues as part of the record of the police activities.

755
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:56,007
So I think that this resolution is entirely in keeping with the police department's mandate to report on the legal activities of the community.

756
01:26:56,767 --> 01:26:59,491
even if they are not the ones taking care of those activities.

757
01:26:59,891 --> 01:27:00,732
And thank you so much.

758
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:06,840
Thank you.

759
01:27:07,921 --> 01:27:08,823
We'll go back to the podium.

760
01:27:08,843 --> 01:27:09,964
Name and address for the record, please.

761
01:27:10,004 --> 01:27:10,725
You have three minutes.

762
01:27:11,846 --> 01:27:12,487
Micah Kesselman.

763
01:27:12,507 --> 01:27:13,949
I'm at 499 Main Street.

764
01:27:15,823 --> 01:27:18,784
First, I want to say I am fully in support of this resolution.

765
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:29,330
Those of you who've seen me talk before and heard me kvetch like you're not surprised, but I do really quickly want to correct some

766
01:27:31,041 --> 01:27:33,404
clear misunderstandings of what's going on.

767
01:27:33,645 --> 01:27:49,164
So what this resolution, there's nothing about it that would conflict with the or the welcoming city ordinance, like I don't see how that would even make logical sense, unless the welcoming city ordinance said no other reporting shall be allowed from the chief of from the MPD.

768
01:27:50,356 --> 01:27:52,737
with except for this, which would be insane.

769
01:27:53,838 --> 01:27:54,738
So maybe that's in there.

770
01:27:54,938 --> 01:27:56,779
That is, that's insane.

771
01:27:57,639 --> 01:28:08,284
Regardless, this is at minimum, a very bare bones transparency and reporting ask of the Medford police.

772
01:28:08,304 --> 01:28:09,845
I honestly,

773
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:15,992
It should be something that happens for all federal and state incursions, in my opinion.

774
01:28:16,272 --> 01:28:29,719
We should know when law enforcement from outside of our city, outside of our town, our community, are coming into our community and performing enforcement operations.

775
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:31,479
Like, that's just common sense.

776
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:36,922
And I'm a big supporter of strong towns and strong cities and self-sufficient, strong communities.

777
01:28:37,042 --> 01:28:38,142
And that's a big part of that.

778
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:48,552
I'll also just be clear for some of our counselors who seem to be under some other thought about it.

779
01:28:48,572 --> 01:28:49,952
Director, come to the chair, please.

780
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:56,114
Yeah, so answer our chair is clear on this.

781
01:28:57,774 --> 01:29:01,115
MPD said they could do this.

782
01:29:02,207 --> 01:29:02,807
at the budget hearing.

783
01:29:03,648 --> 01:29:04,469
They said they could do this.

784
01:29:05,129 --> 01:29:09,232
They didn't say that it's gonna be perfectly accurate, whatever, we'll get what we can get, but they said they can do this.

785
01:29:10,332 --> 01:29:14,535
So this was not put forward without consultation with the MPD.

786
01:29:14,555 --> 01:29:19,979
That's just counterfactual to say otherwise.

787
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:26,423
Moreover, I also wanna echo my neighbor's statement that

788
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:36,824
No resident deserves unlawful abridgment of their basic constitutional rights.

789
01:29:37,184 --> 01:29:43,026
No one on American soil deserves having their right of hobbyist corpus suspended.

790
01:29:43,466 --> 01:29:44,807
That's just not how that works.

791
01:29:45,787 --> 01:29:47,108
And that is what ICE is doing.

792
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:51,169
It's a fundamental right, a right from unlawful arrest.

793
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:55,171
No matter who you are, where you're from, no one deserves that.

794
01:29:56,179 --> 01:30:02,701
So yes, the MPD should be protecting every single person, even the worst criminals.

795
01:30:03,462 --> 01:30:09,144
Maybe, I don't know, maybe like Hitler's clone came back somehow.

796
01:30:09,824 --> 01:30:12,785
They still have to be charged by a court of law.

797
01:30:13,225 --> 01:30:14,926
Like you don't get to just arrest someone.

798
01:30:15,046 --> 01:30:17,487
I don't get to say, I don't like blah, blah, blah.

799
01:30:17,547 --> 01:30:18,868
And the cops come to pick them up.

800
01:30:19,308 --> 01:30:21,048
That's not how our country runs.

801
01:30:21,429 --> 01:30:23,749
And in fact, we had a really long bloody war.

802
01:30:23,829 --> 01:30:25,190
So it wouldn't be run that way.

803
01:30:26,169 --> 01:30:28,271
So let's be clear about that.

804
01:30:28,511 --> 01:30:33,856
And also, ICE is conducting prima facie illegal unlawful arrests.

805
01:30:34,457 --> 01:30:35,698
Like this is problematic.

806
01:30:36,219 --> 01:30:37,240
This is a huge issue.

807
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:42,725
The MPD is within their rights to stop illegal activities from happening.

808
01:30:43,265 --> 01:30:46,829
Just because someone claims to be a federal officer

809
01:30:47,685 --> 01:30:53,168
does not mean they can go around committing illegal assaults on people.

810
01:30:53,428 --> 01:30:54,428
Micah, you're over time.

811
01:30:54,448 --> 01:30:55,729
I am over time.

812
01:30:56,109 --> 01:30:59,791
I will hold my comments for a repeat at two minutes.

813
01:31:00,111 --> 01:31:00,651
Thank you.

814
01:31:00,671 --> 01:31:02,212
All right.

815
01:31:03,192 --> 01:31:05,814
Andy, sorry, just a minute.

816
01:31:05,874 --> 01:31:07,595
I need to take a minute and take everyone in order.

817
01:31:07,635 --> 01:31:11,296
You can have your second go at it once we've heard from everybody the first time.

818
01:31:13,257 --> 01:31:14,478
Andy, I'm going to unmute you.

819
01:31:15,485 --> 01:31:18,066
I know I see you, I see you in the hall, but I'm going to unmute you.

820
01:31:20,867 --> 01:31:22,588
Name and address for the record, please.

821
01:31:23,048 --> 01:31:24,208
And you'll have three minutes.

822
01:31:26,549 --> 01:31:27,729
Am I unmuted, sir?

823
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:29,470
Yes, we can hear you.

824
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:33,251
I'm going to need you to shut that off if you want to talk at the podium.

825
01:31:34,432 --> 01:31:35,112
For one second.

826
01:31:35,132 --> 01:31:37,853
We're going to get feedback if you do that.

827
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:39,294
We can hear you.

828
01:31:39,314 --> 01:31:39,734
It worked.

829
01:31:41,574 --> 01:31:43,215
It worked, so I'm going to take you at the podium now.

830
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:47,190
And for once, I could hear this thing.

831
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,871
Because usually, you people talk like you're on Wi-Fi.

832
01:31:52,712 --> 01:31:53,692
And I'm telling the facts.

833
01:31:53,772 --> 01:31:57,634
Even one of the ladies here said to me, well, I don't want to hold you up.

834
01:31:58,234 --> 01:32:06,536
Listen, Andrew Castanetti, Ace Medford, it's common sense.

835
01:32:08,477 --> 01:32:10,177
I agree with you all.

836
01:32:12,278 --> 01:32:12,378
All.

837
01:32:14,106 --> 01:32:25,294
We are a nation of laws, and we must enforce the laws, or else we don't have a nation no more.

838
01:32:26,675 --> 01:32:31,318
Not a nation, not a country worth a damn, especially for our children.

839
01:32:31,618 --> 01:32:34,060
If you have them, we're gonna get them.

840
01:32:36,061 --> 01:32:39,924
Thanks be to God and the Democratic Republic.

841
01:32:39,984 --> 01:32:41,185
Please save it, thank you.

842
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:43,951
Thank you.

843
01:32:43,971 --> 01:32:45,174
All right.

844
01:32:45,194 --> 01:32:50,467
If there are people who'd like to make a second comment for a minute, they can raise their hand on Zoom or come to the podium.

845
01:32:54,848 --> 01:32:55,708
Sharon, you're going to have a minute.

846
01:32:56,028 --> 01:33:01,929
Thank you, Sharon Gesso, 130 Circuit Road in Mass Avenue, long, long, long time resident.

847
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:11,851
I also want to just interject a comment someone brought up because I study a lot of these things.

848
01:33:11,951 --> 01:33:19,693
I have a memory also with my family that has worked as chief of anti-terrorism for this country.

849
01:33:20,833 --> 01:33:24,255
And he has to be in the big picture all the time.

850
01:33:24,275 --> 01:33:34,399
It can't be assuming that someone lawfully is doing a job that needs to be interrupted because of a social view.

851
01:33:34,419 --> 01:33:36,740
I just want to mention that.

852
01:33:38,101 --> 01:33:47,245
Many of the people who are masked now in ice were asked to do that because their families in the last month had been threatened.

853
01:33:48,085 --> 01:33:53,128
So they are assuming masks, you may like that you may not like that.

854
01:33:53,908 --> 01:34:04,094
I also say in about a month or so, maybe 10,000 to 12,000 of the people who had been deported, sent back, were given a free ticket.

855
01:34:04,834 --> 01:34:06,215
Some were smiling and waving.

856
01:34:08,156 --> 01:34:09,757
You can look it up and fact check it.

857
01:34:10,278 --> 01:34:15,421
The president gave each person on that particular flight $1,000 in a box of food.

858
01:34:18,762 --> 01:34:24,205
And about three to four people who had erroneously been arrested.

859
01:34:24,866 --> 01:34:28,708
That month is not such a bad percentage out of 10,000.

860
01:34:29,328 --> 01:34:32,390
So, I just wanted to share information.

861
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:33,110
Thank you.

862
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:41,275
You're next one more minute.

863
01:34:47,442 --> 01:34:59,121
erroneously arrested and just recently were announced that they're coming back after months of being exported illegally to a prison overseas.

864
01:34:59,481 --> 01:35:01,825
So gulags probably a fair word.

865
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:10,828
So to be clear, all these arrests that are done without due process are erroneous.

866
01:35:11,448 --> 01:35:18,455
There's no such thing as a valid arrest that is not done with the even bare minimum of due process.

867
01:35:19,196 --> 01:35:26,058
And as far as people who only criminals are getting deported, one, that's not true.

868
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:29,499
Mahmoud Khalil isn't back home yet.

869
01:35:29,919 --> 01:35:35,200
So there is a guy who's not a criminal, hasn't been charged with anything other than pissing off Marco Rubio.

870
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:36,501
So whatever.

871
01:35:39,382 --> 01:35:41,482
So that's clearly not the case.

872
01:35:43,683 --> 01:35:44,103
Moreover,

873
01:35:45,157 --> 01:35:46,878
Again, like this doesn't matter.

874
01:35:46,898 --> 01:35:52,041
So I also want to catch this real quickly in terms of just public safety here in Vancouver.

875
01:35:53,082 --> 01:35:54,022
I was on a run this morning.

876
01:35:55,263 --> 01:36:01,346
On my run, I spotted a bunch of squad cars at a house down a street, one of the side streets.

877
01:36:02,127 --> 01:36:02,927
Didn't know who they were.

878
01:36:03,488 --> 01:36:06,770
Some of them were cops, but a bunch of them were in plain clothes.

879
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:11,212
And some of the cars were cop cars, but some of the cars were unmarked vehicles.

880
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:12,713
I was like, okay.

881
01:36:13,394 --> 01:36:16,776
uh, thought about popping over and being like, uh, what the hell's going on?

882
01:36:16,816 --> 01:36:23,039
Because I sure as hell don't want to see anyone getting illegally abducted, which is what it is.

883
01:36:23,759 --> 01:36:27,962
Um, yeah, in my neighborhood, you're over again with that though.

884
01:36:28,022 --> 01:36:32,484
With that said, I called loose, checked it out and it turned out to be a narcotics.

885
01:36:33,344 --> 01:36:33,645
Great.

886
01:36:34,085 --> 01:36:36,466
I'm glad that the cops are doing their job and, you know,

887
01:36:36,907 --> 01:36:38,228
doing their job lawfully.

888
01:36:38,648 --> 01:36:41,489
However, this is a fear that is consistent.

889
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:54,094
And you don't want someone like me, and I'm sure many of you would agree, even those who don't agree with my views, going up to cops doing narcotics enforcement and saying, what the hell are you doing on my side street?

890
01:36:54,274 --> 01:36:56,235
Mike, I got to cut you off there, but thank you.

891
01:36:59,797 --> 01:37:02,558
Steve Schnapp, you're going to have one more minute.

892
01:37:07,869 --> 01:37:08,990
you should be able to start your video.

893
01:37:15,192 --> 01:37:15,593
Thank you.

894
01:37:16,633 --> 01:37:26,358
I just want to announce that the Medford Historical Society will be installing a new exhibit unveiling on June 29th

895
01:37:28,533 --> 01:37:31,194
It's about Medford's migrant history.

896
01:37:31,854 --> 01:37:43,878
And I would suggest that everybody who can go and get an education about Medford and its history of migration.

897
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:44,618
Thank you.

898
01:37:45,898 --> 01:37:46,479
Thanks, Steve.

899
01:37:46,579 --> 01:37:48,439
I'm planning to be there on opening day.

900
01:37:48,459 --> 01:37:57,182
Do we have any further comment from members of the public on the resolution?

901
01:37:59,462 --> 01:38:01,503
Seeing none of the chambers are on zoom.

902
01:38:01,604 --> 01:38:18,375
Council is our Oh, I would make a motion to amend the art just to officially amend the resolution to include what a number of counselors have recommended that the, um Report be delivered.

903
01:38:19,596 --> 01:38:23,038
Uh, with each City Council meeting.

904
01:38:23,058 --> 01:38:23,098
Um

905
01:38:28,133 --> 01:38:32,737
weekly report delivered at each regular City Council meeting.

906
01:38:32,777 --> 01:38:39,262
I have it as amended to request a weekly written report and a presentation of that report at Council regular meetings.

907
01:38:39,562 --> 01:38:39,882
Perfect.

908
01:38:40,162 --> 01:38:40,423
Great.

909
01:38:41,003 --> 01:38:41,904
And I would motion to approve.

910
01:38:42,844 --> 01:38:47,948
On the motion of Council Lazzaro to approve as amended by Council Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

911
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:52,272
Councilor Lemming?

912
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,001
No, I was just going to say what I mean, meetings are every two weeks.

913
01:38:58,161 --> 01:39:03,563
So that's, that's why I have a weekly written report presented at council regular meetings.

914
01:39:04,943 --> 01:39:05,484
Okay.

915
01:39:09,065 --> 01:39:09,245
Yes.

916
01:39:11,804 --> 01:39:16,227
They were friendly amendments by Councillor Collins, but I'm taking them as formally presented by Councillor Lazzaro.

917
01:39:17,568 --> 01:39:22,953
All right, on the motion to approve as amended by Councillor Lazzaro, seconded by Councillor Callahan.

918
01:39:22,973 --> 01:39:23,653
All those in favour?

919
01:39:24,514 --> 01:39:25,075
Opposed?

920
01:39:25,515 --> 01:39:26,436
Motion passes.

921
01:39:27,837 --> 01:39:29,178
Councillor Collins.

922
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:35,003
I motion to suspend the rules and take resolutions under suspension.

923
01:39:35,458 --> 01:39:38,020
I need to read something, and I apologize.

924
01:39:39,281 --> 01:39:42,163
There was one written comment on the previous resolution.

925
01:39:42,183 --> 01:39:43,985
I'm reading it into the record.

926
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:49,469
I'm in full support of Council Lizarra's resolution requiring monthly police reports on ICE activities in Menford.

927
01:39:49,989 --> 01:39:53,252
Weekly would be even better, given the increasing frequency of ICE detentions.

928
01:39:53,272 --> 01:39:54,933
We need to know what is going on in our community.

929
01:39:55,013 --> 01:39:55,814
We keep us safe.

930
01:39:55,874 --> 01:39:56,274
Thank you.

931
01:39:56,855 --> 01:39:58,556
Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street.

932
01:39:58,936 --> 01:40:00,638
Sorry, Ellen, that I didn't read that before.

933
01:40:00,778 --> 01:40:01,278
My apologies.

934
01:40:02,759 --> 01:40:12,902
All right, we have a motion from Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Seng to suspend the rules to take the paper under suspension.

935
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:22,305
It may be only distributed by email.

936
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:23,765
It's been distributed by email.

937
01:40:30,487 --> 01:40:31,068
All those in favor?

938
01:40:31,088 --> 01:40:32,068
Aye.

939
01:40:32,409 --> 01:40:32,949
Opposed?

940
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:34,631
Motion passes.

941
01:40:34,651 --> 01:40:54,809
25098 offered under suspension by Vice President Collins, whereas the Trump administration has deployed Marines and National Guard troops in the city of Los Angeles to quell protest, and whereas this blatant overreach and misuse of federal resources are already being legally challenged by the state of California as illegal,

942
01:40:55,669 --> 01:41:04,658
And whereas this dangerous escalation has been justified by disinformation, including incorrectly referring to residents, exerting their right to protest the government as quote insurrectionists.

943
01:41:05,339 --> 01:41:11,525
And whereas the Trump administration has stated the intention to levy even more brutal force upon other cities who protest ICE raids and detentions.

944
01:41:12,165 --> 01:41:28,094
and whereas this illegal overreach and the precedent that sets threatens every municipality, be it resolved that the Medford City Council condemns the deployment of the federal military into the City of Los Angeles and in the strongest terms possible, and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council stands in solidarity with the City of Los Angeles and its residents.

945
01:41:28,234 --> 01:41:29,335
Vice President Collins.

946
01:41:31,673 --> 01:41:32,433
Thank you, President Behrs.

947
01:41:32,453 --> 01:41:55,062
I want to thank members of the community who have been speaking out about this and urging city leaders to also speak out in vocal condemnation of the bizarre and jarring federal overreach that we see going on in the city of Los Angeles over the past several days.

948
01:41:58,046 --> 01:42:14,161
It is for me, despite writing a resolution about it, really hard to put into words how chilling it is to be living through a moment like this when, in my view as one counselor and one person, we see our federal administration

949
01:42:15,562 --> 01:42:33,435
not only seizing but manufacturing opportunities to perform a overreach and abuse of federal power, to seek to cow activists into submission, to punish people who are using their constitutionally protected right to protest.

950
01:42:35,596 --> 01:42:49,641
I think it is paramount and critical that in this moment, all communities, even though Medford may be very, very far away from Los Angeles, but existentially, we are all in the same boat right now.

951
01:42:49,661 --> 01:43:01,845
I think that these kind of conditions breed and multiply and exacerbate when we miss opportunities to say loudly and clearly

952
01:43:04,809 --> 01:43:05,910
that this is a crime.

953
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:11,712
This is a moral injury against the values upon which this nation was founded.

954
01:43:11,732 --> 01:43:14,394
This isn't a slippery slope.

955
01:43:14,414 --> 01:43:15,594
We're on the slippery slope.

956
01:43:15,614 --> 01:43:16,775
We're careening down it.

957
01:43:17,935 --> 01:43:24,138
And I think if any community or person was to think that as these

958
01:43:25,889 --> 01:43:40,383
assaults not only on individual people, communities, protesters, community organizations, vulnerable people, activists, et cetera, but also as the assaults on the very foundations of our democracy continue to get more and more blatant.

959
01:43:41,484 --> 01:43:48,491
It is obvious to me as one person that to fail to see that for what it is and call it for what it is will not protect us.

960
01:43:48,531 --> 01:43:49,812
Those are the conditions under which

961
01:43:52,903 --> 01:43:56,467
These malevolent forces will only get more powerful.

962
01:43:58,049 --> 01:44:02,414
I'm sure that we join with other communities in speaking out against this.

963
01:44:02,434 --> 01:44:10,643
It is every person's lawful right to protest their government, including their federal government and their state government and the local government.

964
01:44:11,463 --> 01:44:24,970
And the Trump administration has been chillingly clear that they have an intent to punish communities that protest illegal ICE raids and abductions.

965
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:28,192
And I don't think that ignoring that is going to make us any safer.

966
01:44:28,532 --> 01:44:31,634
Ignoring that paves the way for that to continue and get worse.

967
01:44:32,734 --> 01:44:33,495
So this is just a

968
01:44:36,078 --> 01:44:54,996
very, very small note of solidarity with the residents of this oppressed community, and I hope that we can stand together in this small show of solidarity with the residents of Los Angeles and the values that they are seeking to

969
01:44:57,925 --> 01:45:14,701
defend and amplify with their protests and one small vote of condemnation of this truly historic and crushing example of abuse of power by the current federal administration.

970
01:45:14,842 --> 01:45:15,702
Thank you for your consideration.

971
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:24,650
Thank you for the resolution, Vice President Collins.

972
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:41,961
One small point I'd like to make, and I'm not going to generally go into how horrifying this development is, but one thing I would like to point out about this situation is that the

973
01:45:43,292 --> 01:45:50,195
Marines that were sent in, 700 Marines, are not trained for crowd control.

974
01:45:50,215 --> 01:45:54,077
And that's an important thing for people to understand.

975
01:45:54,117 --> 01:46:05,983
The police department, when you have a local police force, they're trained to protect a group of people within a town or a city.

976
01:46:06,983 --> 01:46:09,364
Marines are trained to go into

977
01:46:10,898 --> 01:46:13,905
a hostile territory and they are trained to kill.

978
01:46:13,925 --> 01:46:16,971
That is what they are taught to do.

979
01:46:17,152 --> 01:46:18,534
They are not taught

980
01:46:19,488 --> 01:46:24,392
to do any sort of crowd control, quell protests, they are taught to kill.

981
01:46:24,432 --> 01:46:25,854
That is what they're used for.

982
01:46:25,914 --> 01:46:28,796
They are a military force that you send into a war zone.

983
01:46:28,816 --> 01:46:33,000
And when I read that 700 Marines were being sent into Los Angeles, that was

984
01:46:42,598 --> 01:46:43,818
That was particularly chilling.

985
01:46:45,839 --> 01:46:59,804
And that's not even saying anything about the national guardsmen that are there right now, standing there without orders, without a place to sleep, without a place to eat.

986
01:46:59,824 --> 01:47:04,105
That's not to mention the $134 million that this whole operation has costed.

987
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:08,371
It's sad.

988
01:47:08,951 --> 01:47:10,233
It's not.

989
01:47:11,695 --> 01:47:17,263
The military should not be used against protesters.

990
01:47:18,284 --> 01:47:19,125
That's all I have to say.

991
01:47:20,727 --> 01:47:22,350
Thank you, Councilor Lazaro.

992
01:47:24,549 --> 01:47:28,754
Thank you for bringing this forward, Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins.

993
01:47:29,655 --> 01:47:34,661
And I appreciate Councilor Lemming's perspective as well as an active duty member of the military.

994
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:36,363
I don't know that much about it.

995
01:47:36,643 --> 01:47:40,448
I did know my grandfather was a Marine, but I didn't know that that was their training.

996
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:44,370
Not active duty, sorry, reserve.

997
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:45,210
It's different.

998
01:47:45,411 --> 01:47:45,751
Thank you.

999
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:49,971
Again, I don't know that much about it.

1000
01:47:49,991 --> 01:48:09,895
I think that this has illuminated for me that it seemed for a while, like many people were sort of waiting, not trying to go too far or speak up too much or threaten or seem like they were

1001
01:48:10,978 --> 01:48:14,541
stepping on any toes and now we've gone past that.

1002
01:48:15,902 --> 01:48:27,952
And I think it's become very clear that it doesn't matter if you do what the administration asks you to do or if you don't.

1003
01:48:29,654 --> 01:48:38,221
So I think it's a good reminder to continue on your path in the direction of morality and

1004
01:48:39,018 --> 01:48:42,703
keeping your head on straight and doing what you know to be right.

1005
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:47,429
Because either way, this administration is going to do whatever it wants to do.

1006
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:55,680
And as long as we stay focused on taking care of our city and our people, we're just going to

1007
01:48:56,703 --> 01:48:58,424
hope that we can come out of it on the other side.

1008
01:48:58,444 --> 01:49:08,550
I think that it's important to express solidarity when we can, and I appreciate Vice President Collins bringing this forward.

1009
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:08,990
Thanks.

1010
01:49:12,452 --> 01:49:13,953
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1011
01:49:16,545 --> 01:49:17,225
Thank you.

1012
01:49:17,486 --> 01:49:24,711
It is my understanding that the last time the National Guard was brought into a state to assist was with the permission of the governor.

1013
01:49:24,751 --> 01:49:27,452
It was in 1992, during the Rodney King riots.

1014
01:49:27,593 --> 01:49:31,815
There were many millions of dollars of property damage, and I believe there were quite a few deaths.

1015
01:49:33,337 --> 01:49:36,699
And it was requested by the governor to aid and assist.

1016
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:44,164
Far, far worse had happened, certainly than anything we're seeing in Los Angeles right now.

1017
01:49:46,383 --> 01:49:48,884
There is no permission from the governor of California right now.

1018
01:49:48,924 --> 01:49:58,627
And the last time that the National Guard was sent in to any state without the permission of the governor was, I believe, after the Civil Rights Act.

1019
01:49:58,867 --> 01:50:02,528
It was Alabama in 1965 to enforce the Civil Rights Act.

1020
01:50:02,729 --> 01:50:03,409
Thank you very much.

1021
01:50:03,809 --> 01:50:04,189
Exactly.

1022
01:50:04,749 --> 01:50:09,911
In Alabama, 1965, to enforce the Civil Rights Act, it is

1023
01:50:11,722 --> 01:50:17,963
truly bizarre and disturbing that this is happening now.

1024
01:50:19,684 --> 01:50:33,707
And again, I really have to echo some of my fellow counselors in saying that I don't think that it helps us to sit by and try to not be noticed.

1025
01:50:35,447 --> 01:50:38,108
I think at this point, despite our

1026
01:50:39,141 --> 01:50:43,803
not having power at the national level or at the state level, I think that it is important that we speak up.

1027
01:50:43,923 --> 01:50:45,104
Thank you for putting this together.

1028
01:50:46,805 --> 01:50:47,505
Councilor Sang.

1029
01:50:49,006 --> 01:50:49,366
Thank you.

1030
01:50:49,386 --> 01:50:53,108
I appreciate and agree with everything that my fellow councilors have said about this issue.

1031
01:50:53,968 --> 01:51:08,375
The freedom to protest, freedom of speech is a sacred right, in my opinion, of humankind, but it lies at the very core of our country's history and our identity.

1032
01:51:09,114 --> 01:51:09,674
as a nation.

1033
01:51:10,975 --> 01:51:29,726
When the revolution started here in the Boston area, all those years ago, I think that those protesters would be deeply disappointed and deeply, deeply troubled about where our country is headed right now with our treatment of protesters.

1034
01:51:31,507 --> 01:51:35,610
And the deployment of Marines and of

1035
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:50,790
You know, this number of National Guards into the, you know, the protest area in LA is substantial and it's not something that we should look lightly over.

1036
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:58,476
I think we need to really understand that a lot of these protests, you know, there are

1037
01:51:59,567 --> 01:52:07,929
pictures of certain scenes, but I know many of these friends who are participating in these protests in LA.

1038
01:52:08,089 --> 01:52:22,513
And you can look from their live streams, their posts, everything, their reports, their articles that they're writing about it, that the vast majority of these protests are peaceful protests.

1039
01:52:24,688 --> 01:52:40,740
the federal government is trying to provoke a reaction to manufacture the conditions for which they can suspend liberties, create conditions where they can march in and just tell people to bow down.

1040
01:52:41,441 --> 01:52:51,028
And that's certainly not going to happen, certainly not something that we're going to stand for in Medford, certainly not something that us as your elected officials will stand for.

1041
01:52:52,949 --> 01:52:53,390
And I think

1042
01:52:54,721 --> 01:53:03,285
It's really, really, really scary looking at how this moment compares to other moments in history.

1043
01:53:04,406 --> 01:53:07,887
And, you know, I genuinely don't know.

1044
01:53:07,907 --> 01:53:16,971
I mean, I studied a lot of history in college, and a big focus of that history was, you know, the world leading to World War II and coming out of World War II.

1045
01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:22,203
this moment genuinely reeks of fascism.

1046
01:53:23,103 --> 01:53:35,470
And it reeks of the lead up, the build up, the manufactured incidents and attacks that led to the suspension of democracy in Germany in 1933.

1047
01:53:36,411 --> 01:53:42,274
And so I think we need to be very careful to make sure that that doesn't happen here in this country.

1048
01:53:43,435 --> 01:53:45,276
And it takes every single one of us to do that.

1049
01:53:48,799 --> 01:54:05,989
I think in addition to that, I think this issue highlights that, again, that these issues can be municipal issues too, they can be local issues because these protests were, you know, were protests at the city level, you know, at the Los Angeles level.

1050
01:54:06,429 --> 01:54:09,411
They were protesting a national issue, but that's a right, right?

1051
01:54:13,842 --> 01:54:20,703
LAPD has done some questionable actions, but they've also made the point that they ask the feds not to come in.

1052
01:54:20,983 --> 01:54:25,104
They ask the feds not to risk provoking the situation.

1053
01:54:25,844 --> 01:54:35,526
And I don't want to see the day where in Medford, the feds think that they can come in against anyone's requests here in Medford.

1054
01:54:35,726 --> 01:54:36,946
So I'll leave it at that.

1055
01:54:37,066 --> 01:54:41,207
And I thank Vice President Collins for sponsoring this motion.

1056
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:45,304
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1057
01:54:49,345 --> 01:54:56,488
The only other thing I don't really get here, and Councilor Lemming can correct me, is I don't understand how they're getting around posse comitatus.

1058
01:54:56,668 --> 01:55:00,810
You're not supposed to deploy the military to do police actions in the United States.

1059
01:55:02,771 --> 01:55:07,113
But this administration is declaring things, emergencies that are obviously not emergencies.

1060
01:55:07,173 --> 01:55:08,933
Apparently we've been under invasion for 10 years.

1061
01:55:08,993 --> 01:55:09,634
I had no idea.

1062
01:55:09,654 --> 01:55:12,935
Are there members of the public who'd like to speak on this?

1063
01:55:19,287 --> 01:55:21,268
Okay, we'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

1064
01:55:22,329 --> 01:55:22,970
You have three minutes.

1065
01:55:29,754 --> 01:55:30,395
Someone speaking?

1066
01:55:32,096 --> 01:55:33,196
Okay.

1067
01:55:33,216 --> 01:55:34,858
Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

1068
01:55:34,978 --> 01:55:36,038
Please try to stick to three minutes.

1069
01:55:36,279 --> 01:55:36,779
Sure, yeah.

1070
01:55:36,819 --> 01:55:38,120
Mike Acosta, 1499 Main Street.

1071
01:55:39,261 --> 01:55:42,143
Thank you, Councilor Collins, for bringing this to the table tonight.

1072
01:55:42,983 --> 01:55:48,427
This is not just important, this is local.

1073
01:55:49,319 --> 01:55:50,460
Absolutely, it's local.

1074
01:55:51,781 --> 01:55:55,584
We are all, all of our cities live in the United States.

1075
01:55:56,224 --> 01:56:09,114
This is a total overturning of how federal power is supposed to be invoked in our country against our own citizens.

1076
01:56:11,176 --> 01:56:12,217
When one of our

1077
01:56:13,412 --> 01:56:22,621
fellow cities on almost the opposite side of the country is being attacked by militant, militarized authoritarianism.

1078
01:56:24,143 --> 01:56:27,106
As far as I'm concerned, every city in the US is.

1079
01:56:27,386 --> 01:56:29,528
Every person in the US is.

1080
01:56:30,129 --> 01:56:36,736
It is insane that the federal government has deployed not just the National Guard,

1081
01:56:38,302 --> 01:56:49,115
But yeah, 700 Marines, actual military units into what is at best a local policing issue.

1082
01:56:49,956 --> 01:56:57,304
In reality it isn't because, and you might not know this if all you're doing is watching Fox coverage or even CNN to be honest.

1083
01:56:58,305 --> 01:57:01,467
It has been an overall very peaceful protest.

1084
01:57:01,547 --> 01:57:09,130
It had been until it was directly antagonized and escalated repeatedly by federal agents and agents provocateur.

1085
01:57:09,690 --> 01:57:12,972
So this is an entirely manufactured thing.

1086
01:57:13,452 --> 01:57:17,754
There was no risk of safety to any of these agents in the field.

1087
01:57:19,215 --> 01:57:25,558
And the only actual risk that ended up arising came because of their actions directly as a result of their actions.

1088
01:57:26,182 --> 01:57:30,843
and their actions were to actually attack the lawful protesters first.

1089
01:57:31,563 --> 01:57:41,946
I mean, keep in mind too that one news anchor was arrested or detained from CNN, which is wild.

1090
01:57:42,786 --> 01:57:53,329
And another one from, I think it was Australian, some Australian news channel, was on video, you can see aimed at and shot at.

1091
01:57:54,617 --> 01:57:58,379
So with non-lethal, or less lethal, shot at.

1092
01:57:58,620 --> 01:57:59,660
She's alive, thankfully.

1093
01:58:00,741 --> 01:58:05,184
That's buck wild and should concern and piss every single person off.

1094
01:58:05,864 --> 01:58:09,846
And I'll leave it at that so I don't get anyone here in trouble or myself on a list.

1095
01:58:10,006 --> 01:58:10,327
Thank you.

1096
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:11,547
Thank you.

1097
01:58:11,587 --> 01:58:15,890
All right, we'll stay at the podium.

1098
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:17,931
Seeing no hands on Zoom, name and address for the record.

1099
01:58:17,951 --> 01:58:18,892
You have three minutes.

1100
01:58:20,551 --> 01:58:21,791
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

1101
01:58:21,971 --> 01:58:28,213
Just when I thought I was out, I was down the stairs, someone brought up Los Angeles.

1102
01:58:29,794 --> 01:58:35,155
So the First Amendment is extremely important, in my opinion.

1103
01:58:36,456 --> 01:58:38,476
Besides, I'm a Woodstock graduate.

1104
01:58:40,317 --> 01:58:42,037
Also, I was one of the first of 100,000 protesters

1105
01:58:47,767 --> 01:58:50,368
on the Boston Common against the Vietnam War.

1106
01:58:52,449 --> 01:58:55,530
You see, we kids had problems.

1107
01:58:57,471 --> 01:59:01,493
A lousy effing Vietnam War and a damn draft.

1108
01:59:02,773 --> 01:59:06,074
These kids don't know what those problems are.

1109
01:59:07,535 --> 01:59:08,615
Thank you for agreeing.

1110
01:59:11,176 --> 01:59:13,717
That was in 1969, both events.

1111
01:59:15,618 --> 01:59:17,319
Peaceful protest is good.

1112
01:59:18,058 --> 01:59:25,480
question everything, but mostly peaceful nugget.

1113
01:59:30,702 --> 01:59:31,102
Thank you.

1114
01:59:31,202 --> 01:59:32,922
Is there more public comment on this resolution?

1115
01:59:32,942 --> 01:59:40,484
Yeah, go ahead.

1116
01:59:40,785 --> 01:59:41,605
Name and address for the record.

1117
01:59:41,625 --> 01:59:42,205
You have three minutes.

1118
01:59:43,978 --> 01:59:46,719
Hi, Beth Basciatelli, 39 Carolina Street.

1119
01:59:47,559 --> 01:59:48,740
I support the resolution.

1120
01:59:48,980 --> 02:00:01,003
I do think it's important for municipalities across the country to put on record that they disagree with what the administration is doing and that it is illegal.

1121
02:00:02,864 --> 02:00:12,127
I also think we need to introspect about, rather than just talk about the politics of this in a removed fashion, but talk about the impact on

1122
02:00:12,847 --> 02:00:13,829
our personal lives.

1123
02:00:14,910 --> 02:00:17,534
For me, I think this brings home two things.

1124
02:00:17,754 --> 02:00:24,424
One is, I've been to several protests in Boston over the last year with my children.

1125
02:00:24,444 --> 02:00:27,448
I probably won't bring them anymore.

1126
02:00:28,369 --> 02:00:30,390
I'm concerned for their safety.

1127
02:00:30,410 --> 02:00:31,730
I will continue to go.

1128
02:00:32,391 --> 02:00:47,457
But I think my husband and I, we are at a place where we're not quite sure if it's okay to bring our kids to witness or to practice their First Amendment rights and to witness us practicing ours.

1129
02:00:47,557 --> 02:00:50,258
And I find that to be very, very sad.

1130
02:00:50,278 --> 02:00:54,760
I also think because Boston is another city that

1131
02:00:57,711 --> 02:01:03,679
The administration has said that they would like to make an example of, given that Boston has been a sanctuary city.

1132
02:01:04,841 --> 02:01:12,492
I fear that we will be seeing some of similar actions, maybe not to the extent that they're happening in LA but I don't

1133
02:01:12,932 --> 02:01:14,753
think that we're that far from it.

1134
02:01:16,975 --> 02:01:28,682
So yeah, I personally have a lot of fear and I think the only way to combat fear is to raise our voices together and to say when something is wrong and illegal.

1135
02:01:28,922 --> 02:01:29,302
Thank you.

1136
02:01:31,263 --> 02:01:31,764
Thank you.

1137
02:01:37,907 --> 02:01:40,089
Anyone who hasn't talked yet want to talk on this item?

1138
02:01:43,553 --> 02:01:48,057
Seeing none in person or on Zoom, Michael, you have one more minute.

1139
02:01:48,157 --> 02:01:55,223
I wanted to make sure to add one more thing, just sort of following up on what the previous speaker just said.

1140
02:01:57,085 --> 02:02:06,353
No one should delude themselves into thinking that Massachusetts isn't on the top list after probably New York.

1141
02:02:06,433 --> 02:02:07,594
The US attorney

1142
02:02:08,410 --> 02:02:23,067
not even a month ago, I think, was whining and crying on Twitter, on X, Twitter, whatever, dumb nonsense, about how Massachusetters were being too mean to federal agents, and they were being so mean.

1143
02:02:24,168 --> 02:02:26,351
And that's on top of Tom Homan

1144
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:35,295
directing his legally indistinguishable from domestic terrorist force to target Boston.

1145
02:02:35,676 --> 02:02:45,143
So yeah, Massachusetts is absolutely on the list of like the first handful of cities that are gonna follow after LA if this isn't stopped and nipped in the bud.

1146
02:02:49,967 --> 02:02:50,427
Thank you.

1147
02:02:53,830 --> 02:02:56,192
Seeing no further public participation, is there a motion on the floor?

1148
02:02:59,012 --> 02:03:02,815
On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

1149
02:03:03,255 --> 02:03:03,915
All those in favor?

1150
02:03:04,936 --> 02:03:05,296
Opposed?

1151
02:03:05,376 --> 02:03:06,917
Motion passes.

1152
02:03:06,937 --> 02:03:06,917
25093.

1153
02:03:06,998 --> 02:03:24,610
Be it resolved that City Council discuss issues on Quincy Street, in particular regarding a large... On a motion to table the resolution by Councilor Sang, seconded by... Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1154
02:03:24,630 --> 02:03:26,291
All those in favor?

1155
02:03:28,024 --> 02:03:28,985
motion passes.

1156
02:03:31,047 --> 02:03:35,990
2, 5, 0, 9, 5, offered by Councilor Sang, Councilor Kahns, Councilor Callahan.

1157
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:44,736
Be it resolved that the City Council explore solutions to reduce incidents of heavy trucking on neighborhood streets lacking the capacity, including heavy commercial vehicle exclusions and home-roll petitions.

1158
02:03:45,837 --> 02:03:46,297
Who wants it?

1159
02:03:49,079 --> 02:03:49,860
Councilor Sang.

1160
02:03:51,494 --> 02:03:51,934
Thank you.

1161
02:03:52,935 --> 02:03:58,720
This is a resolution to discuss an issue that residents have been raising up, particularly in South Medford and Hillside.

1162
02:03:59,341 --> 02:04:09,689
But I know it's an issue in different parts of the city, especially in East Medford as well, that these large trucks are going down neighborhood streets that they're too big for.

1163
02:04:10,270 --> 02:04:13,453
And not only are they causing traffic, oftentimes they're getting stuck.

1164
02:04:14,837 --> 02:04:17,598
making turns in the streets as well.

1165
02:04:17,959 --> 02:04:21,561
And that's, you know, that creates even more knock on effects.

1166
02:04:21,841 --> 02:04:29,546
Not to mention, it's bad for pollution and bad for bad for safety of kids, you know, who are trying to cross the street and playing in the street.

1167
02:04:31,127 --> 02:04:37,872
There's not, you know, the laws are a little complex about this, because we can't just outright say, you can't drive on these streets.

1168
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:45,023
But what we can do as a city is start the process of applying for exemptions from heavy trucking.

1169
02:04:46,444 --> 02:04:49,145
It does require us to collect some data.

1170
02:04:49,686 --> 02:04:51,687
It requires us to do some work on our front.

1171
02:04:51,707 --> 02:04:53,508
So we'll need to work with city staff on this.

1172
02:04:54,128 --> 02:05:03,373
But what I was thinking is we can meet in public works, the public works committee to provide a forum for residents to come to us

1173
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:15,125
to tell us about their streets if they're seeing this happen, and for us to work with city staff to identify a few priority streets for us to apply for that exemption with.

1174
02:05:17,846 --> 02:05:18,307
Thank you.

1175
02:05:18,327 --> 02:05:21,108
Councilor Callahan.

1176
02:05:21,548 --> 02:05:21,868
Thank you.

1177
02:05:22,168 --> 02:05:26,591
My only was a friendly amendment, which is just what you said, which is to send it to the Public Works and Facilities Committee.

1178
02:05:27,351 --> 02:05:31,693
We have good discussions there, which include residents, as well as talking to staff.

1179
02:05:37,918 --> 02:05:39,819
Thank you for this resolution.

1180
02:05:39,839 --> 02:05:49,242
I know I had some questions because I received the email and the question that I'm glad that it's going to the subcommittee so we can get some answers.

1181
02:05:49,282 --> 02:05:56,805
I know that Councilor Caviello used to work so hard with the 18 whalers that were left overnight

1182
02:05:57,745 --> 02:06:06,630
with the engine still running and affecting our air quality in different areas of the community, especially I believe on commercial streets.

1183
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:09,772
So that might be something if we could add to that.

1184
02:06:09,832 --> 02:06:21,859
But I think that with this process, I think that one of the questions brought up that a resident asked that, what would this entail that they have a business on a secondary street

1185
02:06:22,479 --> 02:06:26,223
and usually a heavy truck does traverse that area.

1186
02:06:26,744 --> 02:06:32,449
So it'll be interesting to see how that could be explained to those residents or those businesses.

1187
02:06:32,489 --> 02:06:39,316
So I appreciate that and I would appreciate that and move with my colleagues.

1188
02:06:39,376 --> 02:06:39,696
Thank you.

1189
02:06:39,716 --> 02:06:45,742
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1190
02:06:47,861 --> 02:07:01,617
Thank you prison bears and I want to thank Councilor Callahan accounts were saying for co sponsoring this resolution with me I'm looking forward to workshopping this in collaboration with community members and city staff and committee.

1191
02:07:01,637 --> 02:07:05,082
I think that for a lot of people the need to

1192
02:07:05,622 --> 02:07:08,304
seek some sort of solution here is really obvious.

1193
02:07:08,944 --> 02:07:17,810
I frankly find it a little ridiculous that such big, huge commercial trucks are just a part of our residential neighborhood status quo.

1194
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:22,152
They are so clearly out of scope and scale for residential areas.

1195
02:07:22,432 --> 02:07:25,194
And it's just something that a lot of people have had to become inured to.

1196
02:07:27,015 --> 02:07:29,617
But it is pretty bizarre that a street that people

1197
02:07:29,957 --> 02:07:32,998
live on and walk on and walk their dogs on and ride a bike on.

1198
02:07:33,018 --> 02:07:40,060
In many areas of the city are also very, very frequently visited by gigantic commercial trucks.

1199
02:07:40,180 --> 02:07:40,900
It's not safe.

1200
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:43,941
It is detrimental to our local infrastructure.

1201
02:07:43,961 --> 02:07:49,362
It is detrimental to residents' very normal enjoyment of their neighborhood experience.

1202
02:07:50,202 --> 02:08:01,270
And for a lot of our residential streets we know that even just normal passenger car traffic is too much traffic and detrimental to our roads, not to mention the traffic.

1203
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:05,993
So it just makes all the sense in the world to me that it's time to look at a holistic approach to.

1204
02:08:07,033 --> 02:08:09,756
you know, not saying we have to ban commercial trucks in Medford.

1205
02:08:09,796 --> 02:08:11,018
Of course, that's not realistic.

1206
02:08:11,098 --> 02:08:14,601
They're carrying goods to places that need them for people that need them.

1207
02:08:15,362 --> 02:08:23,851
But we need a system to make sure that these are going on the roads that it makes sense that can support them and not residential streets where it makes no sense for them to be in where it's not safe.

1208
02:08:24,452 --> 02:08:24,752
Thank you.

1209
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:25,353
Motion to approve.

1211
02:08:37,678 --> 02:08:38,338
All those in favor?

1212
02:08:38,358 --> 02:08:40,739
Opposed?

1213
02:08:40,839 --> 02:08:41,680

Council on Aging, $206,057.

1229
02:09:30,888 --> 02:09:31,068
Insurance, $31,220,000.

1230
02:09:31,108 --> 02:09:34,850
And then total revised figure for the total City General Fund budget is $205,852,504.

1231
02:09:49,921 --> 02:09:53,443
For the enterprise fund, water and sewer has been revised to $26,941,022.

1232
02:09:53,523 --> 02:09:55,645
The total revised total for the water and sewer enterprise fund is $29,277,779.

1233
02:09:55,685 --> 02:09:58,206
And with that, we'll go to the chief of staff and the finance director.

1234
02:09:58,226 --> 02:10:01,208
We also have the superintendent of schools and our school finance chief and finance team here.

1235
02:10:16,278 --> 02:10:21,863
So we'll start with the Chief of Staff and then we'll come to you guys with any questions and updates.

1236
02:10:21,944 --> 02:10:32,874
But Madam Chief of Staff, if you could just speak to the revisions a little bit and not necessarily what they entail in detail, but if there's anything significant in any of those that you want to discuss.

1237
02:10:37,505 --> 02:10:39,386
Oh, sorry, I gotta turn on your microphone.

1238
02:10:39,487 --> 02:10:39,807
There you go.

1239
02:10:39,827 --> 02:10:41,928
It was green, so I assumed it was go.

1240
02:10:43,009 --> 02:10:43,570
Now it's red.

1241
02:10:44,210 --> 02:10:44,410
Good.

1242
02:10:44,790 --> 02:10:46,952
Red is good.

1243
02:10:48,994 --> 02:10:51,095
Thank you, President Behrs and members of the Council.

1244
02:10:52,436 --> 02:10:56,399
First off, I want to thank the Council for its engagement in the budget process.

1245
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:03,284
Year after year, the Council asks good questions at the budget hearings and greatly appreciate that.

1246
02:11:03,825 --> 02:11:06,747
From our office, I don't want to speak for

1247
02:11:07,848 --> 02:11:12,990
for our finance director, but, you know, we appreciate all the questions that every counselor asks.

1248
02:11:14,210 --> 02:11:29,755
Also, you know, as far as these amendments, one thing just for purposes of housekeeping is that there was a scrivener's error in terms of the language that follows the city total, the initial city total for $205 million.

1249
02:11:29,775 --> 02:11:30,735
The words there are a little bit

1250
02:11:36,072 --> 02:11:39,294
incorrect because they don't actually reduce the amounts that follow.

1251
02:11:39,734 --> 02:11:44,197
So the words that are there should really actually identify $205,304,412.76.

1252
02:11:44,237 --> 02:11:52,322
Again, just a scrivener's error, but I'd like to highlight that for you all.

1253
02:11:52,382 --> 02:11:54,804
And that's for the tax levy that is highlighted.

1254
02:11:55,024 --> 02:11:55,324
Correct.

1255
02:11:55,344 --> 02:12:01,288
So for purposes of the hopeful vote, that would be the correct language for this evening.

1256
02:12:01,308 --> 02:12:04,270
Could you just read that number again so we get it?

1257
02:12:04,290 --> 02:12:04,590
Certainly.

1258
02:12:05,915 --> 02:12:06,135
$205,304,412.76.

1259
02:12:05,955 --> 02:12:06,135
Great.

1260
02:12:14,314 --> 02:12:35,382
As far as highlighting items, I mean, I just will do my best to go through at a top level and I'm happy to answer any questions on the elections budget based on the timing in which we hired our elections manager and then when the budget was submitted, the actual amount that we are paying our budget manager and the amount that we'd originally projected are different.

1261
02:12:36,263 --> 02:12:40,585
Also, there was a minor error there where we missed the increase for the

1262
02:12:42,526 --> 02:12:54,275
contractual increase for an employee who is going to be going from a I forget the title but I believe it's a senior planner to a senior clerk to a principal clerk or vice versa.

1263
02:12:54,355 --> 02:12:55,015
I apologize.

1264
02:12:55,095 --> 02:12:56,496
I get that mixed up a bit.

1265
02:13:03,799 --> 02:13:08,182
DPW Cemetery, there was just a stipend that was there.

1266
02:13:08,542 --> 02:13:13,106
And admittedly, I do not have a full colored version in front of me.

1267
02:13:13,186 --> 02:13:19,750
So I don't have the red lettering that I had inserted for some of the other budget items.

1268
02:13:19,770 --> 02:13:22,873
So if you want to potentially tell me what those are, I can tell you.

1269
02:13:22,913 --> 02:13:25,735
It was elections, it was PBS.

1270
02:13:28,869 --> 02:13:29,970
I could read them off if you want to.

1271
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:33,191
I'm happy to go one by one if that's efficient.

1272
02:13:34,512 --> 02:13:45,358
For PDS, I believe that was simply a addition for the Affordable Housing Trust commissioners, for which I believe we have an ordinance that has a stipend for those commissioners with exception of the mayor.

1273
02:13:46,039 --> 02:13:46,359
Got it.

1274
02:13:47,239 --> 02:13:47,860
Facilities.

1275
02:13:49,415 --> 02:14:05,002
Facilities, I believe that was the adjustment moving the staff from the, effectively consolidating the staff from the other departments in the city to the facilities department.

1276
02:14:05,022 --> 02:14:07,343
So all the facilities staff were in one budget.

1277
02:14:07,943 --> 02:14:23,627
So namely the library maintenance person and custodian, same with the council on aging, but also now folded in the Chevalier budget into the facilities budget, which was a standalone budget previously, but it was only, as you all know, a salary budget.

1278
02:14:24,348 --> 02:14:24,568
Great.

1279
02:14:24,688 --> 02:14:27,908
And since you're going off memory, I can also read, I'll tell you if it's personal or ordinary.

1280
02:14:28,669 --> 02:14:29,529
Police personnel.

1281
02:14:31,212 --> 02:14:42,323
Police personnel, there was some adjustments that we made, if I'm not mistaken, downward because there were some numbers that we were carrying over inadvertently.

1282
02:14:43,404 --> 02:14:46,467
But I don't have that at the top of my mind on what exactly those are.

1283
02:14:46,487 --> 02:14:47,609
I can find that information.

1284
02:14:48,249 --> 02:14:50,672
We had parking enforcement ordinary expenses.

1285
02:14:51,569 --> 02:15:04,878
We did get some... In the parking department, we were effectively trying to split off the payment of specific devices from the police department.

1286
02:15:05,659 --> 02:15:14,905
These handheld devices that parking personnel use to enforce were effectively paid from the police department and they were split off and put into the parking department.

1287
02:15:16,406 --> 02:15:17,927
I'm just pulling up the original submission.

1288
02:15:17,947 --> 02:15:20,208
I might be able to give you the difference in the amount as well.

1289
02:15:20,529 --> 02:15:20,709
Sure.

1290
02:15:24,537 --> 02:15:25,998
We had recreation.

1291
02:15:26,018 --> 02:15:25,998
6 39 3 51.

1292
02:15:27,819 --> 02:15:29,419
That's personnel.

1293
02:15:29,439 --> 02:15:30,520
It's down about $2000.

1294
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:48,627
Yes, I know that when we were when our recreation director Kevin Bailey was here before the council, there was discussion about Training, and I remember hearing Director Bailey indicate that he had hoped that there would be some money in the budget for training.

1295
02:15:49,327 --> 02:15:56,413
I took that back and our interim budget manager and I analyzed that and we looked and we in fact were able to confirm that was there.

1296
02:15:57,734 --> 02:16:02,478
I'm not immediately remembering what that $2,000 is, but I can look into that as well if there are questions.

1297
02:16:03,219 --> 02:16:10,865
I know that we were able to effectively get everything that really Kevin was looking for in terms of that training amount.

1298
02:16:12,306 --> 02:16:12,987
Got it.

1299
02:16:13,027 --> 02:16:16,710
DPW Highway increased 20,000 in personnel and 60,000 in ordinary.

1300
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:24,764
Um, I don't have that one off the top of my mind.

1301
02:16:25,384 --> 02:16:32,431
And there were other some other GPW ones that I... Yeah, it looks like there were personnel adjustments, some slightly higher, some slightly lower.

1302
02:16:32,451 --> 02:16:34,573
2,000 lower in cemetery, 10,000 lower in parks, 6,000 lower in forestry.

1303
02:16:40,103 --> 02:16:58,696
Yes, a number of those would have ultimately been proposed increases in the overtime budgets, but the timing, the nature of the timing of the original budget submission and the original, the first revision to the budget submission was such that it was difficult to get those

1304
02:17:00,217 --> 02:17:03,439
numbers in it was just a Thursday and a Friday just the way it worked.

1305
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:07,382
So, there's, they're really slightly modified numbers in general.

1306
02:17:07,522 --> 02:17:12,766
Yeah, there's a $4,000 reduction in personnel on the Council on Aging budget, similar.

1307
02:17:15,444 --> 02:17:19,906
That is, I can't confirm that off the top of my head.

1308
02:17:19,946 --> 02:17:32,971
I'm wondering if it's the retirement of the administrative staff person, Suzanne Lentine, who's done an incredible job for, I honestly don't know how many years, but I've enjoyed working with her.

1309
02:17:33,191 --> 02:17:36,832
And that may be just the retirement there.

1310
02:17:37,232 --> 02:17:37,493
Got it.

1311
02:17:37,893 --> 02:17:38,533
We love Suzanne.

1312
02:17:40,687 --> 02:17:43,288
best wishes to Suzanne in connection with Venture.

1313
02:17:45,189 --> 02:17:52,092
Insurance, we had $31,105 million go up to $31,220 million.

1314
02:17:53,333 --> 02:18:00,537
Yes, we increased that to a degree as far as the additional FTEs that we were anticipating in the school department.

1315
02:18:00,797 --> 02:18:08,720
As the council may know, we effectively ended up bridging the gap with the school department, partly by

1316
02:18:09,921 --> 02:18:15,762
that we are going to be taking some capital items that they had planned for inside their budget and placing that outside their budget.

1317
02:18:16,102 --> 02:18:19,783
Some of those capital items are on the Council's agenda for this evening.

1318
02:18:20,824 --> 02:18:26,225
And so we certainly hope that those will also pass for the purpose of the school department.

1319
02:18:26,645 --> 02:18:34,747
And then we added some funding to the insurance budget to account for the additional FTEs.

1320
02:18:36,854 --> 02:18:47,445
And just to confirm, this should read, and to meet the appropriations, the sum of $205,304,412.76 be raised and appropriated from the fiscal year 26 tax levy and other general revenues of the city, and then the transfers should stay the same, and that hits that 205-852-504 number?

1321
02:18:47,465 --> 02:18:47,805
That's correct.

1322
02:18:47,825 --> 02:18:48,166
Thank you.

1323
02:18:48,186 --> 02:18:48,346
Great.

1324
02:19:00,702 --> 02:19:06,106
Do you have questions for the administration on the revisions to the fiscal 25 budget?

1325
02:19:06,406 --> 02:19:07,907
I see Councilor Scarpelli.

1326
02:19:08,608 --> 02:19:08,988
Thank you.

1327
02:19:09,649 --> 02:19:10,770
And thank you for presentation.

1328
02:19:11,951 --> 02:19:15,713
Just a few questions in the school department budget.

1329
02:19:15,874 --> 02:19:19,636
Is this with the, hopefully with the built-in increase for the paraprofessionals?

1330
02:19:19,696 --> 02:19:23,059
I know that they're in negotiations right now.

1331
02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:28,263
So is it, do we have enough in there to sustain what they deserve?

1332
02:19:29,864 --> 02:19:47,012
So I can't speak to the specifics, and I would certainly defer to the school department, but it's my understanding that paraprofessional increases are contained partially here, but also partially in some mechanics that we need to complete over the course of the next

1333
02:19:48,473 --> 02:19:58,139
Um, before June 30th, really, uh, as the council knows, question eight was a $4 million override that was passed by residents of the city.

1334
02:19:58,759 --> 02:20:02,842
Um, the school department has expects to be able to use

1335
02:20:04,111 --> 02:20:06,953
just shy of $2 million of that in this fiscal year.

1336
02:20:07,394 --> 02:20:16,581
But given the timing of contract negotiations, they are looking to carry some of that money to ensure that they can actually implement.

1337
02:20:16,681 --> 02:20:20,325
And that's what the director and the superintendent mentioned.

1338
02:20:20,405 --> 02:20:25,489
And so we hope, we anticipate, not hope, we plan for a paper to be forthcoming for 6-24.

1339
02:20:25,769 --> 02:20:29,552
That's great news.

1340
02:20:29,752 --> 02:20:31,774
Unfortunately, I don't see an increase in the fire line.

1341
02:20:31,814 --> 02:20:32,455
I know that we cut

1342
02:20:33,632 --> 02:20:37,395
two firefighters right now, but there's no movement there still.

1343
02:20:38,076 --> 02:20:38,956
That's correct.

1344
02:20:39,016 --> 02:20:41,599
We had to make a number of adjustments to the budget.

1345
02:20:41,639 --> 02:20:43,880
We made some adjustments to the police department budget.

1346
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:46,102
We made adjustments to the fire department budget.

1347
02:20:46,422 --> 02:20:51,346
As the council may recall, we had cut about 10 fire police personnel last year.

1348
02:20:51,366 --> 02:21:01,755
Um, we were looking to bring that number of uniformed officers to 112 to get closer to what the fire department numbers are, um, in terms of uniformed personnel.

1349
02:21:02,235 --> 02:21:06,296
but we're only able to really make a minor adjustment there.

1350
02:21:06,456 --> 02:21:14,979
And so the two departments don't have similar staffing, but we can continue to try to make that happen.

1351
02:21:15,679 --> 02:21:24,242
And I know that, do we get a figure yet on fixing the fire truck that we purchased from Lynn that's out of service?

1352
02:21:25,122 --> 02:21:26,643
Is that something that's in this budget or?

1353
02:21:27,088 --> 02:21:34,329
I don't have that immediately, but I can certainly follow up with the fire chief on that to see what the status of that is since the last discussion.

1354
02:21:34,789 --> 02:21:35,410
OK, thank you.

1355
02:21:35,450 --> 02:21:52,893
And I'd be remiss to keep asking, but is there anywhere in here that would, for transparency purposes, give us a note that we can't have the figures of all of the settlements with suits or anything, lawsuits?

1356
02:21:53,745 --> 02:21:58,126
that the city had to pay out, but is there, where would there be a line item for that?

1357
02:21:58,206 --> 02:21:59,447
Is that separate accounts?

1358
02:21:59,487 --> 02:22:04,528
Is it a private account that we don't see that we just talk in executive session?

1359
02:22:05,729 --> 02:22:07,929
Yes, so part of it is subject to executive session.

1360
02:22:08,410 --> 02:22:10,410
Some of it is paid out.

1361
02:22:10,910 --> 02:22:13,051
I think the council may recall it.

1362
02:22:13,071 --> 02:22:13,891
It's April 29th.

1363
02:22:13,931 --> 02:22:21,214
I just happened to be doing some administrative work on this matter recently, but at the April 29th meeting, the council did approve

1364
02:22:22,554 --> 02:22:23,575
I think five settlements.

1365
02:22:24,016 --> 02:22:34,166
I don't remember the aggregate amount of them, maybe in the vicinity of, honestly, I don't want to quote it because I don't even remember the aggregate amount, but I know I recall there was five settlements, but it was out of free cash.

1366
02:22:34,627 --> 02:22:37,670
Other times, it's really, it comes down to where the availability of funds are.

1367
02:22:38,351 --> 02:22:41,414
So other times it has been out of the law department budget.

1368
02:22:42,515 --> 02:22:44,537
So, but I don't have that immediately in front of me.

1369
02:22:44,557 --> 02:22:44,757
All right.

1370
02:22:44,798 --> 02:22:45,098
Thank you.

1371
02:22:47,450 --> 02:22:53,497
Two other questions for the Chief of Staff and the Finance Director on the revised budget proposal.

1372
02:22:57,722 --> 02:22:58,523
Vice President Collins.

1373
02:23:01,245 --> 02:23:07,567
Thank you both for being here again and thank you for all of the presentations that have accompanied the budget submission so far this season.

1374
02:23:09,728 --> 02:23:19,852
Really appreciate, as always, the thoroughness of the presentation and really happy to see the attendant free cash papers on the agenda tonight as I said a couple of weeks ago, those were

1375
02:23:21,032 --> 02:23:31,438
For me, a critical condition for casting a vote on the budget was just making sure that the community got to see us making those free cash appropriations in tandem with the final vote on the budget.

1376
02:23:31,458 --> 02:23:38,922
And I understand that we are expecting some additional appropriations into stabilization funds in, I think, probably in the next couple of weeks.

1377
02:23:38,942 --> 02:23:47,207
Could you just quickly speak to what we can expect to see at the next regular meeting in relation to stabilization fund appropriations from free cash?

1378
02:23:48,714 --> 02:23:49,314
Yes, thank you.

1379
02:23:50,295 --> 02:24:08,167
So we've kind of already touched on the school one, the discussion that we're having and that we're just checking with legal counsel on is potentially establishing a school stabilization fund to address the carryover from the question eight override that is effectively just implementing the

1380
02:24:09,962 --> 02:24:12,443
uh, question eight as presented to the voters.

1381
02:24:13,884 --> 02:24:25,210
Um, we also, as is presented on, um, at tonight's on the city council agenda are proposing to replenish the existing stabilization funds we have

1382
02:24:26,378 --> 02:24:34,870
Most notably, I think, is just the capital stabilization account where we've spent approximately $1.5 million and are looking to replenish that back to $5 million.

1383
02:24:35,170 --> 02:24:43,541
We spent a nominal amount of money out of the Water and Sewer Capital Stabilization Fund, small $100,000, which we're also proposing to replenish back to $2 million.

1384
02:24:45,103 --> 02:25:03,898
There's ongoing discussion as to further planning and I'm happy to distribute a draft document that exists at this point in terms of the city's free cash outlook and how that all kind of rolls into where we are today.

1385
02:25:04,178 --> 02:25:10,904
And if that would be okay, I will distribute this and then I will speak to it.

1386
02:25:11,952 --> 02:25:13,175
Great, yeah.

1387
02:25:13,215 --> 02:25:13,897
Can somebody grab that?

1388
02:25:13,917 --> 02:25:14,558
Thanks.

1389
02:25:20,974 --> 02:25:21,395
Thanks, Ted.

1390
02:25:47,305 --> 02:25:47,485
Thank you.

1391
02:25:47,505 --> 02:25:58,267
Thanks.

1392
02:25:58,287 --> 02:25:58,827
Thank you again.

1393
02:25:58,867 --> 02:25:59,487
BP Collins.

1394
02:26:00,287 --> 02:26:06,268
Um so what's presented before the council is the original free cash

1395
02:26:15,630 --> 02:26:17,031
And I think we might have a date here.

1396
02:26:17,051 --> 02:26:18,492
Yeah, that date.

1397
02:26:18,512 --> 02:26:19,973
See, this is why this is more draft.

1398
02:26:20,454 --> 02:26:21,474
Bob got that in early.

1399
02:26:21,494 --> 02:26:21,755
Wow.

1400
02:26:21,775 --> 02:26:22,675
Bob is the time travel.

1401
02:26:22,755 --> 02:26:24,677
I mean, we always talk about time travel.

1402
02:26:28,324 --> 02:26:35,710
So as the council knows, we had 28 million, 28.3 million certified and free cash as of 6-30-2024.

1403
02:26:35,730 --> 02:26:43,555
Of that amount we have used, we've allocated, we haven't actually spent it necessarily.

1404
02:26:43,615 --> 02:26:46,518
We've allocated $6.18 million, which would leave $22.12 million remaining.

1405
02:26:52,839 --> 02:27:03,542
and as seen in this graphic that's before the council, but for description purposes for the public, we estimate we have about $550 million in existing needs.

1406
02:27:04,563 --> 02:27:12,325
The largest chunks of those are obviously what we know to be some of the reports we've conducted and the assessments that the city has conducted.

1407
02:27:12,345 --> 02:27:19,767
$200 million for street and sidewalk backlog, $250 million in water and sewer infrastructure work.

1408
02:27:19,827 --> 02:27:22,308
Obviously, there's also retained earnings that can support that.

1409
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:24,869
that we're going to be able to replace.

1410
02:27:24,889 --> 02:27:24,929
Um.

1411
02:27:25,029 --> 02:27:36,075
Then there's, you know, 70 million in lead line replacements, and then we get into some of our I'll say smaller numbers, but not particularly smaller because the estimate for freedom way is $15 million.

1412
02:27:36,656 --> 02:27:38,157
Um Then we have.

1413
02:27:39,577 --> 02:27:41,558
Things that you know, going down in number $3

1414
02:27:48,713 --> 02:27:54,380
We've got the City Hall HVAC, which is an unknown cost at this point in time, which we're looking into.

1415
02:27:55,961 --> 02:28:01,448
City Hall bathrooms, it's wild what things cost these days, $1.5 million.

1416
02:28:01,588 --> 02:28:06,033
Oak Grove design and construction, $4 million.

1417
02:28:07,255 --> 02:28:08,697
have to address but hopefully not.

1418
02:28:08,717 --> 02:28:09,558
Our finance director is

1419
02:28:22,177 --> 02:28:32,300
is an ex-officio member of the Retirement Board, and both he and others, we work very closely together and we try to collaborate the best possible.

1420
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:35,321
So hopefully we'll be okay in that area.

1421
02:28:35,781 --> 02:28:43,483
I know dive equipment was one of the items that this council had presented in its write-up for items that it would like to see for FY26.

1422
02:28:44,403 --> 02:28:49,705
It's just one that we need to kind of look a little bit more closely at in terms of overtime potential impact.

1423
02:28:50,530 --> 02:28:51,491
and then Hagner Center.

1424
02:28:51,511 --> 02:28:55,355
I'm sorry, I tried to go in a descending order, but then I wasn't.

1425
02:28:55,955 --> 02:29:03,743
So in any event, that's a considerable amount of cost and limited amount of funding in the end.

1426
02:29:05,024 --> 02:29:05,164
Thanks.

1427
02:29:05,184 --> 02:29:07,767
I'm going to Councilor Zaro and then Councilor Callahan.

1428
02:29:09,083 --> 02:29:12,406
Just a quick thing about the overtime regarding the dive team.

1429
02:29:13,066 --> 02:29:26,334
When I spoke to Chief Evans when he was here presenting on the budget, he said that the way that it would be structured would be that there would be 12 individuals on the dive team, three people in each segment that is always on staff.

1430
02:29:26,354 --> 02:29:28,876
So it wouldn't have an overtime requirement.

1431
02:29:30,537 --> 02:29:32,358
Is there a timeline plan for

1432
02:29:35,157 --> 02:29:41,280
like when each of these things will be considered as part of the, do you have a timeline in mind?

1433
02:29:43,360 --> 02:30:03,128
As I think the mayor stated at the budget presentation, we're looking to review, this is basically one of our major summer projects, dive deeply into this, no pun intended whatsoever, because I do take that matter very seriously, and look at all of these areas and actually

1434
02:30:04,652 --> 02:30:12,580
go at a much more granular level than that's right here, including looking at the timeline in which we could potentially implement.

1435
02:30:12,620 --> 02:30:15,163
We have to obviously look at multiple ways.

1436
02:30:15,463 --> 02:30:22,110
As noted here, the city has to consider considering the amount of demand that there is on such a small pool of funding.

1437
02:30:22,573 --> 02:30:27,675
the city has to consider strategies to potentially use borrowing to accomplish a number of these things.

1438
02:30:28,195 --> 02:30:35,578
And this is mainly for illustrative and informational purposes, but there's a lot more work to be done behind the scenes of this.

1439
02:30:37,758 --> 02:30:42,880
I appreciate this all being written out like this.

1440
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:43,901
I think it's really helpful.

1441
02:30:43,981 --> 02:30:50,203
And I think it would be really useful for us to have this for the public to see how

1442
02:30:52,445 --> 02:30:59,067
how these things are all being thought of and balanced and how many demands there are on the city's funds.

1443
02:31:00,347 --> 02:31:12,511
My hesitation is just that the money is not, not spending it isn't making anything work better.

1444
02:31:13,051 --> 02:31:17,233
So I just think we know what the demands are.

1445
02:31:17,413 --> 02:31:21,374
Let's meet some of the demands and then meet the other demands

1446
02:31:22,199 --> 02:31:28,662
later with borrowing, like the things need doing is my perspective.

1447
02:31:29,222 --> 02:31:36,826
I find it, I sometimes start to get frustrated when we know what needs to be done, we have a list of things, just because we can't do everything all at once doesn't mean we do nothing.

1448
02:31:37,686 --> 02:31:38,007
That's all.

1449
02:31:38,267 --> 02:31:38,487
Thank you.

1450
02:31:40,357 --> 02:31:43,438
If I may, President Barras, thank you, Councilor Lozaro.

1451
02:31:43,978 --> 02:31:53,020
I empathize with the sentiment because I think that sometimes government moves at a snail's pace, and I have felt that way my entire career, and I continue to feel that way.

1452
02:31:53,100 --> 02:32:01,402
And I can tell you, we are definitively doing everything we can with the resources that we have and with the limited timing.

1453
02:32:01,462 --> 02:32:06,063
This month has been particularly busy in terms of budget, but also in terms of litigation.

1454
02:32:07,288 --> 02:32:20,292
What we don't want to do is effectively distribute funding without fully thinking it through, potentially distributing funding in such a way that we're not considering the entire organization.

1455
02:32:21,233 --> 02:32:22,373
I don't think we want to make

1456
02:32:22,946 --> 02:32:37,642
quick and rash decisions on some of these things when there's such a demand and such a need from our departments to only be fair to departments to look at things comprehensively is kind of how we're trying to approach things the best we possibly can.

1457
02:32:39,003 --> 02:32:40,385
You know, I can tell you that

1458
02:32:41,995 --> 02:33:01,734
The vehicles themselves need its own kind of like capital requests for vehicles from departments from police, fire and DPW themselves need an analysis to make sure that we're getting the best we can for the city in terms of should we consider alternatives to buying a new vehicle?

1459
02:33:03,195 --> 02:33:15,037
You know, and then, of course, the conversation as far as energy efficient or, you know, technologies that have that are better for the city and better towards our zero waste and zero emissions goals.

1460
02:33:15,557 --> 02:33:20,458
All of these things come into play and require more in depth analysis just as an example.

1461
02:33:21,018 --> 02:33:29,960
But it's There's just there's a lot and Admittedly, when sometimes we push and I think

1462
02:33:31,245 --> 02:33:36,246
our department heads are doing so, so much good work.

1463
02:33:36,846 --> 02:33:49,570
Sometimes when we push, we get different information back that really, just like this body, that informs a better process, rather than just accepting things as they come in and

1464
02:33:50,635 --> 02:34:03,263
And moving forward, we really need to analyze and be careful with our resources if we want to make sure that we don't use all of them before maybe another important thing that hasn't been fully baked yet comes to light.

1465
02:34:03,343 --> 02:34:05,485
For instance, City Hall, HVAC.

1466
02:34:06,285 --> 02:34:07,786
It's not fully baked yet at this point.

1467
02:34:08,146 --> 02:34:11,608
And candidly, we've had issues in terms of heating in

1468
02:34:13,098 --> 02:34:16,139
in the heating season, and we've actually had to close City Hall.

1469
02:34:17,079 --> 02:34:23,621
We can't continue to do that, so we need to plan for that, but that one isn't something that has a full number to it yet.

1470
02:34:23,701 --> 02:34:30,543
We need to have that information and be able to implement, and all of that requires a comprehensive review, in my opinion.

1471
02:34:35,725 --> 02:34:36,605
Thank you, Councilor Zahra.

1472
02:34:36,625 --> 02:34:37,545
Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

1473
02:34:41,168 --> 02:34:42,329
Thank you.

1474
02:34:42,349 --> 02:34:46,371
Um so I have been asking about this sort of behind the scenes.

1475
02:34:46,471 --> 02:34:48,733
I'm gonna just be more public now.

1476
02:34:49,553 --> 02:34:49,753
Um.

1477
02:34:50,914 --> 02:34:55,677
I understand that it's important for the city to have certain savings accounts.

1478
02:34:55,737 --> 02:34:56,758
The stabilization funds.

1479
02:34:56,798 --> 02:35:01,520
I understand that we need to maintain certain amounts of money in those accounts.

1480
02:35:02,201 --> 02:35:04,582
Um and if there's a certain amount that we should

1481
02:35:10,930 --> 02:35:19,596
I believe that we should not be seeing more than $20 million in excess of those accounts just lying around not being used.

1482
02:35:20,277 --> 02:35:29,263
And what I hope to see from the administration is, so this basically says, well, there's $550 million in existing needs.

1483
02:35:29,343 --> 02:35:30,784
Like, wow, it's so much more.

1484
02:35:30,844 --> 02:35:35,947
I don't wanna see the $550 million in needs that we have.

1485
02:35:36,147 --> 02:35:39,870
I want to understand how much of free cash needs to be maintained

1486
02:35:40,589 --> 02:35:47,717
because it is a smart move to maintain it, because that is what we need in order to keep our bond rating good and all of that.

1487
02:35:48,237 --> 02:35:51,461
And I want to have an idea of how we're going to spend the rest of the money.

1488
02:35:51,481 --> 02:35:54,424
I mean, we had $28 million a year ago.

1489
02:35:56,406 --> 02:36:01,392
We can't continue to put more money into, you know, I completely get it.

1490
02:36:02,324 --> 02:36:15,821
We need to have a certain percentage of your budget that you have to have as free cash at the end of every year, and I completely approve of conservative budgeting so that we do every year have some free cash like coming back into that free cash.

1491
02:36:16,142 --> 02:36:18,184
We can't just not spend it because

1492
02:36:19,857 --> 02:36:29,200
The way that certain things work, like our roads and other maintenance projects, the longer you allow them to become more and more dilapidated, then it costs 50 times as much to repair.

1493
02:36:29,740 --> 02:36:31,340
We can't just let this money sit there.

1494
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:36,822
And so that, I think, is what Councilor Lozaro was trying to say, that the money isn't doing anything.

1495
02:36:36,882 --> 02:36:40,623
And there are things more important that it could be doing and it should be doing.

1496
02:36:41,003 --> 02:36:46,125
So what I would like to see is, I get it if some of this free cash should remain as

1497
02:36:47,746 --> 02:37:00,386
uh you know in stabilization funds or even in the free cash account if there are reasons why that those should remain there i understand but i think we we shouldn't be taking i mean since i've gotten on the council it's a year and a half we don't have a plan for the

1498
02:37:02,233 --> 02:37:14,865
tens of millions of dollars in free cash that we have, we need to have a plan so that money can be used in a way that is smart and means that in the future we have to spend less money, right?

1499
02:37:15,005 --> 02:37:22,352
Those are things, like roads in particular, I just find it hard to believe that letting

1500
02:37:23,189 --> 02:37:28,613
plus million dollars in free cash sit around is better for the city than spending that money.

1501
02:37:28,993 --> 02:37:38,159
For example, on roads, and I also understand that if we're going to be spending on roads, we're going to increase our spending on roads, then we have to hire more engineers like these things can't happen immediately.

1502
02:37:38,179 --> 02:37:39,100
I get that.

1503
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:42,502
But to see this, a year later, that there isn't a plan.

1504
02:37:44,243 --> 02:37:46,743
that to me seems overdue.

1505
02:37:47,044 --> 02:37:50,484
And I would love to, I would actually love to hear from you.

1506
02:37:50,504 --> 02:37:54,465
And I thought this was what Councilor Lozano was asking for when she said timeline.

1507
02:37:54,825 --> 02:38:01,526
What I would like is not just a timeline for like when we're spending the money, I'd like a timeline for when can we see the thing I just described?

1508
02:38:02,066 --> 02:38:07,787
When can we see that the administration has a plan for how much of this $22.12 million remaining is going to be reserved

1509
02:38:11,479 --> 02:38:15,741
because I understand that, and there may be unknown expenses, there may be other things.

1510
02:38:16,161 --> 02:38:16,841
I get that.

1511
02:38:16,861 --> 02:38:20,223
That's what we have the stabilization funds for.

1512
02:38:20,663 --> 02:38:22,064
But I want to know timeline.

1513
02:38:22,104 --> 02:38:27,146
By the end of the summer, will we have an understanding of how this $22 million is going to be spent?

1514
02:38:28,066 --> 02:38:35,970
What is the timeline for us seeing a plan for free cash, including one for reserving some of it as savings?

1515
02:38:38,547 --> 02:38:39,207
Thank you, President.

1516
02:38:39,307 --> 02:38:42,549
I think that's I think that's a fair timeline end of the summer.

1517
02:38:42,929 --> 02:38:56,154
Um, you know, I. I can tell you based on what our plans are, as the mayor has stated, just kind of repeating a little bit, but, um We're gonna be doing a comprehensive review over the capital plan over the summer.

1518
02:38:56,794 --> 02:38:58,115
Um, we have

1519
02:39:00,130 --> 02:39:04,752
you know, the backlog is so significant that it's next to impossible to catch up on.

1520
02:39:05,172 --> 02:39:10,034
But we are trying to deploy multiple different strategies to solve that.

1521
02:39:10,554 --> 02:39:13,155
ARPA was a strategy that was used to solve that.

1522
02:39:13,215 --> 02:39:18,998
There was a lot of funding that was allocated to infrastructure through ARPA in general.

1523
02:39:21,139 --> 02:39:24,260
There's also inherent challenges and

1524
02:39:25,772 --> 02:39:34,171
You've, you've touched on them, but there's staffing challenges that their procurement challenges in order to actually complete certain projects.

1525
02:39:36,305 --> 02:39:48,715
I have seen, and I'm not saying that this is the case for Medford, because I haven't seen it here so much, but I have seen communities that allocate funding, but the funding sits and work doesn't get done because the resources don't exist.

1526
02:39:49,256 --> 02:39:53,319
So that's part of the calculus when we look at where is funding going to go?

1527
02:39:53,419 --> 02:39:54,860
It has to be able to be implemented.

1528
02:39:55,180 --> 02:40:00,725
Otherwise, it's really not a very thoughtful or comprehensive approach to capital planning.

1529
02:40:02,687 --> 02:40:04,188
There was one other item I wanted to touch on,

1530
02:40:07,112 --> 02:40:07,292
Um.

1531
02:40:10,714 --> 02:40:12,496
It's not immediately coming to me in terms of.

1532
02:40:15,918 --> 02:40:18,359
Of my answer, but it's it's.

1533
02:40:19,140 --> 02:40:28,585
It's um, I understand where the councils or whether where the members of the council have spoken on this by now have are coming from, and I would like to see us get to that.

1534
02:40:28,726 --> 02:40:29,006
Meet that

1535
02:40:35,078 --> 02:40:41,281
yes, staffing is absolutely, I completely understand that those are issues, but you can't start staffing if you don't have a plan.

1536
02:40:41,681 --> 02:40:45,944
So, the having of a plan, I think, is the thing that I'm looking for the timeline on.

1537
02:40:46,304 --> 02:40:50,406
So, I appreciate that you think that, you know, at the end of the summer is when we'll be able to see that.

1538
02:40:50,486 --> 02:40:50,746
Thank you.

1539
02:40:50,766 --> 02:40:53,328
Thank you.

1540
02:40:53,388 --> 02:40:54,328
That's her saying.

1541
02:40:55,629 --> 02:40:56,369
Thank you.

1542
02:40:56,529 --> 02:41:03,433
And to add to what you just said, I think it's hard to review a plan or hard to, you know,

1543
02:41:04,538 --> 02:41:07,140
talk to voters when we don't know exactly what that plan is.

1544
02:41:07,260 --> 02:41:20,211
And I think that's part of, I think you articulated the frustration decently well, but I think we're in a very unique position now where we've been fighting so long when it comes to recurring funds and making sure those are stable.

1545
02:41:20,251 --> 02:41:25,676
And I think we all have ideas about things that we wanna see more recurring staff for, right?

1546
02:41:25,736 --> 02:41:31,560
But I think we can basically agree that the recurring side of the equation, thanks to the voters,

1547
02:41:32,565 --> 02:41:33,166
pretty stable.

1548
02:41:33,226 --> 02:41:41,373
But I think now we're talking about the one-time expenses that we want to see in the city, these projects that I think all of our residents realize that have been building up.

1549
02:41:41,814 --> 02:41:47,259
And so I'm looking forward to the end of the summer when we can sit down together and review that plan.

1550
02:41:49,263 --> 02:42:03,977
I think all we're asking for, right, is for us to follow the state's guidance on how much free cash we should be having, and to make a noticeable dent into this $550 million number, and to see that plan.

1551
02:42:04,777 --> 02:42:10,783
And once we have that plan, we'll be better able and better positioned to ask, I think, some pretty important questions.

1552
02:42:11,625 --> 02:42:15,566
I think you make a really interesting point with the staffing, and I think that's important.

1553
02:42:16,686 --> 02:42:28,568
But it's hard for us to contribute ideas or to rethink the staffing question when we don't completely know what those concerns are.

1554
02:42:28,808 --> 02:42:32,809
And I think it just helps us have an open conversation when we have that plan.

1555
02:42:33,889 --> 02:42:36,290
So very much, I would look forward to that.

1556
02:42:36,958 --> 02:42:46,823
And I had questions, but I think maybe at this point, these are just more considerations as for things that I think the city council would like to see in that plan.

1557
02:42:47,343 --> 02:43:02,310
But I think we would be curious as to what types of projects, if you hold off, would cost so much more in the future and what we see costs increasing the most in what types of categories we see that in.

1558
02:43:02,811 --> 02:43:04,992
So that would help us guide

1559
02:43:05,867 --> 02:43:11,891
you know, us understanding why this order of projects and explaining that to voters.

1560
02:43:12,131 --> 02:43:19,376
I think we would be curious as to what things might help us in the future actually increase efficiency at City Hall as well.

1561
02:43:20,877 --> 02:43:21,378
I mean, I think

1562
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:38,856
Many of us think the accounting software might be an example of that, but you know, equipment like I think that this question ties in the last one, like maybe it makes sense to invest in certain vehicles, because that improves the efficient efficiency of certain, you know, forces that we have out in the city.

1563
02:43:39,237 --> 02:43:46,264
So I think those are things factors that I would be looking for in that plan that will hopefully get them some.

1564
02:43:53,117 --> 02:43:54,858
Vice President Collins, then Councilor Kelly.

1565
02:43:57,498 --> 02:43:58,439
Thank you, President Beres.

1566
02:43:58,459 --> 02:44:07,862
I appreciate this discussion and I think that I'm getting the sense not to speak for my fellow councilors, members of city staff, but I think that we're all feeling, you know, a similar tension with

1567
02:44:11,748 --> 02:44:21,677
all of us, you know, being heavily invested in wanting the city to do what we know that it needs to do and feeling that energy and feeling that urgency and impatience rather.

1568
02:44:21,697 --> 02:44:28,402
And I think that this conversation is going in a really productive conversation, in a really productive direction rather, sorry.

1569
02:44:30,864 --> 02:44:43,187
As we're talking about, you know, when can we expect to see a plan and how do we do the work of prioritizing and doing kind of a, like, how fast can we onboard assessment of these various needs that we know that we have?

1570
02:44:44,908 --> 02:44:51,470
For myself, I think that a couple of my fellow counselors were kind of already getting to this, but just to put it a different way, I think for myself,

1571
02:44:53,376 --> 02:45:11,963
One thing that makes me feel particularly I won't say frustrated, maybe like impatient is knowing that some of these in this very, very large like $550 million bucket of things that we know that we need and at least have for most of them like rough estimates for that there are some things that are

1572
02:45:13,830 --> 02:45:20,516
comparatively, still a lot of money, but a really small piece of that pie compared to other needs compared to the amount of free cash that we currently have.

1573
02:45:20,996 --> 02:45:26,100
And some of them would be relatively faster to onboard than others.

1574
02:45:27,341 --> 02:45:34,047
As we go forward, I would really love to see both the plan for what to appropriate, but also kind of the plan for

1575
02:45:34,707 --> 02:45:42,852
How to plan like the plan for what to onboard in in what level of priority kind of take those factors into account, like I was just out of interest as we were talking about this.

1576
02:45:43,833 --> 02:45:59,423
Looking at even I know this is what's on this chart is a really small sample of a lot of the needs that have been articulated that are in the milieu and under consideration, you know, we have things like the dive equipment which are.

1577
02:46:00,878 --> 02:46:04,139
0.56% of our overall remaining free cash balance.

1578
02:46:04,199 --> 02:46:14,744
And if we're going off of our amount of free cash to spend before we get to that best practice number of $10 million in reserve, then it's 1% of what we have to spend to get there.

1579
02:46:15,504 --> 02:46:25,548
And then we have other things that are like the whole pie, that we could spend that $12.12 million and still have many millions more to go before we fulfill them.

1580
02:46:25,948 --> 02:46:28,089
I think for myself, as we're putting the plan together,

1581
02:46:30,510 --> 02:46:33,171
really committed to seeing the fuller plan by the end of the summer.

1582
02:46:33,211 --> 02:46:36,012
I think that's realistic, certainly will be impatient to see it.

1583
02:46:38,633 --> 02:46:56,038
I would especially like to see prioritized the items that are a relatively smaller percentage of the overall number that we have to spend before getting to that $10 million number for amount that we really should keep in reserve, especially filtered through what is a relatively smaller number and what is their

1584
02:46:56,858 --> 02:46:59,720
Um, a more fleshed out plan for like the dive team.

1585
02:46:59,780 --> 02:47:02,081
We've heard about that from the Medford Fire Department.

1586
02:47:02,802 --> 02:47:09,586
Um, I know that that's something that has been, uh, on the mind, something that that department has been talking about wanting to onboard.

1587
02:47:10,186 --> 02:47:22,093
Um, and then there are other projects that, um, I think obviously should be intuitive to everybody that are a much longer planning process, things that have been planned for forever, things that will continue to have to be

1588
02:47:23,713 --> 02:47:29,876
planned on a longer time scale, like some of our major infrastructural overhauls.

1589
02:47:31,577 --> 02:47:37,620
All that to say, I would like to see a plan really as quick as it is possible to see one.

1590
02:47:37,660 --> 02:47:47,566
And as we're doing that, I think it would make a lot of difference to the community to see certain kind of quicker to ship, so to speak, projects fast tracked.

1591
02:47:49,506 --> 02:47:55,028
in the implementation plan, because there are things that we know that we need that we know that we can afford that we know we have a draft plan on that.

1592
02:47:55,648 --> 02:47:58,728
It's frustrating to see us not doing such as the dive team.

1593
02:47:59,869 --> 02:48:09,011
Because that's just a really visceral thing that I think a lot of us would like to see us be funding so the overall plan makes sense to me but just to put in a plug that I would love to see kind of a separate

1594
02:48:10,373 --> 02:48:21,832
fast track for those projects that we've already identified that we know will be cheaper and a little bit faster to implement than some of the longer term systemic projects that really have to go on on that really, really steady and slow pace.

1595
02:48:22,293 --> 02:48:22,513
Thank you.

1596
02:48:25,232 --> 02:48:44,598
I know, so there's been a lot of discussion on the dive team and I, you know, I think it's really very well could be as as Councilor Lozaro has stated a pretty simple and Councilor Collins has stated a pretty simple thing, but there are some nuances and some details that may be worth explaining to the Council at a high level.

1597
02:48:45,198 --> 02:48:51,141
to say I don't necessarily know all the answers to these questions and this isn't something that we're holding off just to hold off.

1598
02:48:51,421 --> 02:48:58,144
We're truly just trying to be prudent because when we take action, we want to make sure it's the right action.

1599
02:48:58,184 --> 02:48:59,445
We want to go in the right direction.

1600
02:48:59,485 --> 02:49:02,607
We want to see as much as we can possibly foresee.

1601
02:49:03,347 --> 02:49:05,128
I understand the three-person

1602
02:49:06,188 --> 02:49:12,873
scenarios, but one of the questions that I need to ask the fire chief is what happens if one of those members is not available?

1603
02:49:13,954 --> 02:49:21,580
Does that mean that another member in that group of 12 would now need to be called in on overtime to fill that?

1604
02:49:21,960 --> 02:49:23,461
Can the dive team function

1605
02:49:23,841 --> 02:49:30,827
with two people, or is that additional person coming in on overtime to fill that third person slot on that shift?

1606
02:49:31,988 --> 02:49:34,670
Also, there are some reoccurring costs.

1607
02:49:34,770 --> 02:49:39,294
I think they're smaller, but I do want to analyze them at a deeper level to understand what the impacts are.

1608
02:49:39,674 --> 02:49:45,419
As the Council knows, for FY 27, we're projecting major increases to the fiscal budget.

1609
02:49:45,779 --> 02:49:48,461
The Council has heard this before, but for the purposes of the public,

1610
02:49:49,522 --> 02:49:51,123
We obviously have our pension liability.

1611
02:49:51,464 --> 02:49:57,549
We're very close to a fully paid off pension, which pension liability, not a pension, because that's, that's probably never going to happen.

1612
02:49:58,149 --> 02:50:04,194
It's not realistic, but long story short for the public, you put

1613
02:50:05,497 --> 02:50:12,627
an extra amount of money into an account that accrues interest that actually helps support the cost of the pension into the long term.

1614
02:50:12,807 --> 02:50:13,769
It's a state mandate.

1615
02:50:14,009 --> 02:50:14,890
We're required to do it by 2040.

1616
02:50:16,052 --> 02:50:21,499
We are projecting to be able to do it by 2033, thanks to the Medford Retirement Board.

1617
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:30,707
And in the latter years of that pension liability, the number goes up much more fast, much faster than it does in other years.

1618
02:50:31,327 --> 02:50:34,190
And it is a significant increase year by year.

1619
02:50:35,271 --> 02:50:47,120
I know the pension board has a meeting, a retirement meeting at the end of this month that finance director Dickinson has briefed us on and can speak to more in depth if the council would like.

1620
02:50:47,440 --> 02:50:49,562
We also have the waste contract, which is increasing.

1621
02:50:49,882 --> 02:50:55,986
We also have insurances which are increasing year after year at an untenable rate that we're seeing across the Commonwealth.

1622
02:50:56,386 --> 02:51:15,458
We have the HVAC school bond that we anticipate will come on in FY27 with a roaring roughly $1.4 million, which through this council support, we have been able to tamp down to that number because otherwise it was projected to be in the $1.8 million range, if my memory's correct.

1623
02:51:16,819 --> 02:51:21,662
So depending upon interest, thank you, because we don't have a crystal ball, but we try to do our best.

1624
02:51:22,443 --> 02:51:25,405
So there's a lot that goes into all of this.

1625
02:51:25,665 --> 02:51:39,255
And I think the more important part is we need to have some in-depth conversations with our department heads who are proposing capital improvements and really chase out any threads that need to be chased out.

1626
02:51:39,535 --> 02:51:39,836
Thank you.

1627
02:51:41,277 --> 02:51:42,558
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1628
02:51:44,158 --> 02:51:46,059
I forgot to ask a couple of questions.

1629
02:51:46,260 --> 02:51:53,404
So more than half of this $550 million is the water and sewer infrastructure work plus the lead line replacement.

1630
02:51:54,405 --> 02:52:03,011
And I just wanted to ask how much of that, like we have the water and sewer enterprise fund.

1631
02:52:04,772 --> 02:52:12,177
How much do you think we will be using other savings accounts to work on one or both of those two items?

1632
02:52:13,609 --> 02:52:24,000
I think it's particularly hard to say, especially with the new... I think the lead line replacement is a relatively new piece of information to the city, all things considered.

1633
02:52:25,081 --> 02:52:29,545
We also, not too long ago, didn't really have the...

1634
02:52:30,875 --> 02:52:33,716
backlog work number either for water sewer.

1635
02:52:33,756 --> 02:52:35,997
So some of this is is rapidly developing.

1636
02:52:36,398 --> 02:52:46,142
I know that through work of our DPW and partnership with city departments and hiring of a consultant, we're still in the process of

1637
02:52:48,303 --> 02:52:52,967
evaluating the entire study because I believe rates are the last piece.

1638
02:52:52,987 --> 02:52:55,089
I don't believe we've seen that component as of yet.

1639
02:52:55,770 --> 02:52:59,854
And so I think it's early to be able to answer that question.

1640
02:52:59,914 --> 02:53:06,900
I wish I could answer it, but I think that rate study will inform this process because that rate study is considering that liability.

1641
02:53:07,320 --> 02:53:14,527
And then there is the question of whether, you know, the rates are the place to place that and how, what

1642
02:53:15,131 --> 02:53:16,592
legal avenues the city would have.

1643
02:53:16,692 --> 02:53:21,535
And now I'm just stating laws and nothing to do with things that have been discussed as of yet.

1644
02:53:21,635 --> 02:53:26,138
But should any of it be offset by general funds?

1645
02:53:26,218 --> 02:53:29,720
Because that discussion has not come up yet, because it's a little early in that process.

1646
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:36,885
And perhaps it probably never will come up, to be honest, because the idea behind an enterprise is the enterprise is self-sustaining.

1647
02:53:38,146 --> 02:53:44,470
The unique thing about Medford is, I don't know that it's all that unique, but by and large, most homeowners who have

1648
02:53:45,992 --> 02:53:48,339
most property owners also have water and sewer.

1649
02:53:53,968 --> 02:54:01,955
There are legal avenues that can be considered, but I anticipate it's somewhat of a tomato-to-model thing, and it probably just needs to be burdened by the enterprise.

1650
02:54:03,617 --> 02:54:11,043
Again, that's really premature commentary for me, and it's not to suggest anything other than it's early.

1651
02:54:11,484 --> 02:54:17,809
So if I may, it's entirely possible that we might dip into free cash for, you know,

1652
02:54:18,810 --> 02:54:26,292
or some other sort of savings account for that, but it's also quite likely that we may not because the rates might be put.

1653
02:54:26,932 --> 02:54:30,433
And that includes both the lead lines as well as the water and sewer infrastructure.

1654
02:54:31,033 --> 02:54:45,836
President Behrs, through you, speaking for myself as to, you know, the way I would look at it from my lens based on my experience and training, yes, I think that that's an accurate description, but I can't speak for the city at this point when I say that because it's too early.

1655
02:54:46,290 --> 02:54:59,295
I just wanted to add one thing, which is that there was also a historical practice of using Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund retained earnings to keep the rates down and not to invest in the capital needs of the system.

1656
02:54:59,355 --> 02:55:01,616
And that is one of the things that has driven us.

1657
02:55:01,896 --> 02:55:10,419
I don't know how much is related to that versus how much is related to the fact that the water and sewer infrastructure is 100, 220 years old, probably a lot more on the latter, but

1658
02:55:11,478 --> 02:55:14,320
There was a lot of use of retained earnings to keep rates low.

1659
02:55:14,921 --> 02:55:22,607
And so we're seeing I'm guessing the rate studies going to say there's going to need to be a significant increase in rates to address the fact that all the water mains are collapsed.

1660
02:55:22,647 --> 02:55:24,829
Well, in serious condition.

1661
02:55:24,849 --> 02:55:33,016
Yeah, one of those facts that the rates have kind of been artificially capped lower because because of that.

1662
02:55:41,077 --> 02:55:41,757
No, I'm sorry.

1663
02:55:41,777 --> 02:55:42,037
Thank you.

1664
02:55:42,718 --> 02:55:42,998
Great.

1665
02:55:43,218 --> 02:55:46,559
I'm going to go to Councilor Lemming and then Vice President Collins.

1666
02:55:48,140 --> 02:55:59,185
So at the beginning of this year, we had about $28 million in free cash, and we're seeing here the updated version was $22.12 million.

1667
02:55:59,205 --> 02:56:04,947
So at the beginning of the year, Medford had, as a percentage of its operating budget,

1668
02:56:06,737 --> 02:56:09,398
48%.

1669
02:56:06,797 --> 02:56:09,398
That amount of free cash is 14.48% of the operating budget.

1670
02:56:10,078 --> 02:56:10,959
Now that it's 22.12, it's like 11.3%.

1671
02:56:10,999 --> 02:56:13,340
The average across the Commonwealth is 9.4% across all of the 351 cities.

1672
02:56:13,380 --> 02:56:14,540
So Medford in terms of

1673
02:56:28,786 --> 02:56:36,714
At the beginning of the year, we ranked about number 44 in terms of cities that had free cash as a percentage of operating budget.

1674
02:56:36,734 --> 02:56:39,497
So pretty high, but not like necessarily an outlier.

1675
02:56:40,598 --> 02:56:48,465
Right now, considering the $22.12 million that we have remaining, we could spend about

1676
02:56:50,127 --> 02:56:58,232
$3.7 million right off the bat and be right at the average of the other cities in the Commonwealth as of this year.

1677
02:56:58,532 --> 02:57:04,615
So yeah, $3.7 million could be spent immediately.

1678
02:57:04,695 --> 02:57:13,701
And there are some parts of the operating budget I was noticing as well where you're sort of over budgeting for certain positions with the

1679
02:57:14,503 --> 02:57:20,746
you know, idea that that would be with the with the idea that we should have that many positions.

1680
02:57:20,846 --> 02:57:28,990
But for instance, the police department, they were saying that they had 90, I believe, just going off memory, it was 93.

1681
02:57:29,450 --> 02:57:33,192
They currently have they said three, an extra three were in the pilot pipeline, we're budgeting for 107.

1682
02:57:33,933 --> 02:57:36,514
And there were some other parts of the budget that were

1683
02:57:37,358 --> 02:57:37,958
similar to that.

1684
02:57:37,998 --> 02:57:43,660
So there's going to be more like, I assume that some of a lot of those unfilled positions are just going to be going into free cash.

1685
02:57:43,760 --> 02:57:56,505
So, you know, getting us down to that average, like an extra four or $5 million a year, it's not going to, I don't think it's necessarily going to solve every one of the city's problems.

1686
02:57:56,545 --> 02:57:59,926
What I personally like to see it spent on is areas where we

1687
02:58:00,726 --> 02:58:04,009
know that it will lead to some sort of growth in the city.

1688
02:58:04,029 --> 02:58:16,901
I do appreciate what I see on the next paper, which is some of those funding for some of the studies that I mentioned, which would at least allow the city to put out like starting bids on some of those.

1689
02:58:18,022 --> 02:58:23,386
But echoing what some of my colleagues have said, Medford does have a lot of needs right now.

1690
02:58:23,426 --> 02:58:27,470
And I do appreciate any areas that you could identify where we could sort of like

1691
02:58:29,633 --> 02:58:45,779
fund those, and that would lead to excessive growth in the future, which is kind of the parts that I've been trying to focus on during this term in terms of things like updating our linkage fees, which would lead to a lot more money in the future.

1692
02:58:46,819 --> 02:58:51,801
Again, I keep talking about this TDM study, which is, I would say, partially funded on this next paper.

1693
02:58:53,822 --> 02:59:02,089
Speaking as one counselor, I do like to see areas where we're spending free cash, which do promise pretty substantial growth in the future.

1694
02:59:02,169 --> 02:59:04,692
So those parts are very appreciated.

1695
02:59:04,712 --> 02:59:05,632
That's all I have to say.

1696
02:59:05,753 --> 02:59:05,953
Thank you.

1697
02:59:07,691 --> 02:59:15,634
I'm going to take the liberty to say President Bears through you to Councilor Lemming or Councilor Collins through you.

1698
02:59:17,674 --> 02:59:19,075
Yes, if that's okay.

1699
02:59:19,435 --> 02:59:19,755
Thank you.

1700
02:59:21,636 --> 02:59:34,260
Councilor Lemming, if you could just clarify for my understanding for future purposes, because I really think we're, I think it's based on what I'm hearing from the council today, I do think it's entirely possible to have

1701
02:59:35,320 --> 02:59:43,862
a conversation and put papers before this council to address some of the needs that we're talking about this summer.

1702
02:59:46,123 --> 02:59:55,385
But just when you refer to growth, are you talking about monetary growth or are you talking about infrastructure improvements in that context as to growth?

1703
03:00:00,743 --> 03:00:02,284
mainly monetary growth.

1704
03:00:02,304 --> 03:00:09,307
Like I do like to see the budget that we have be in a healthier state.

1705
03:00:09,927 --> 03:00:12,809
So that was what I was referring to when I said that just now.

1706
03:00:12,909 --> 03:00:25,915
I do appreciate what my colleague, Councilor Callahan was just saying about trying to also put the money towards those areas where if we don't,

1707
03:00:27,475 --> 03:00:43,183
If we don't fix them now it'll just end up the cost will just end up skyrocketing to fix them in the future, which, in my mind, also relates to the monetary growth issue because patching up those areas will end up saving us money.

1708
03:00:44,703 --> 03:00:48,765
like 10, 20 years down the line when it does end up getting torn up.

1709
03:00:49,305 --> 03:01:04,410
So that's the way I'm thinking about this is where can we apply money now so that the overall picture will be better 20 years in the future and we're not spending even more money than we normally would like fixing up a ton of roads.

1710
03:01:04,450 --> 03:01:13,633
So I do appreciate that distinction, but to me, it's sort of like they're one in the same in a lot of ways.

1711
03:01:14,638 --> 03:01:15,489
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1712
03:01:20,973 --> 03:01:23,835
I just had a super quick follow-up to Councilor Lemming's point.

1713
03:01:24,315 --> 03:01:37,445
I just want to make sure when you're looking at that $28.3 million from last year and the $22.12 million this year and comparing it to other cities, in comparison to other cities, are you taking their total amount of savings?

1714
03:01:37,505 --> 03:01:41,007
Because this $22.12 million does not include the stabilization funds.

1715
03:01:41,448 --> 03:01:43,469
And if you add those stabilization funds to the $22.12 million,

1716
03:01:45,060 --> 03:01:48,925
than I believe we're actually over the 28.3 million that we had a year ago.

1717
03:01:49,626 --> 03:02:00,621
So this may be more than the 14% that we were a year ago, and it might be that we have more to spend to be in line with other cities.

1718
03:02:08,996 --> 03:02:13,021
I was a bit of a sidebar here about what's on for schools.

1719
03:02:13,761 --> 03:02:16,344
Do you need an answer to what you just said, or am I going to counselor living.

1720
03:02:17,165 --> 03:02:17,426
Okay.

1721
03:02:20,509 --> 03:02:25,114
Right, so we were, I mean we, we were one of the very few.

1722
03:02:26,002 --> 03:02:29,583
municipalities that didn't already have some sort of a stabilization fund beforehand.

1723
03:02:29,663 --> 03:02:40,807
So the data that I was referring to, I just took from the Massachusetts State website, and it offers a breakdown of free cash from other municipalities this past year.

1724
03:02:40,907 --> 03:02:41,908
So it didn't

1725
03:02:42,828 --> 03:02:47,994
specify the size of the various stabilization funds in those cities.

1726
03:02:48,474 --> 03:02:59,246
But I'm also going with the assumption that those cities already had stabilization funds that Medford, for some reason, didn't for years and years beforehand.

1727
03:03:00,387 --> 03:03:03,371
But you are correct that that data is

1728
03:03:03,911 --> 03:03:16,158
available somewhere on the website, I would just have to pull it up and do some Excel macro magic to to get a get a better get a better picture of those of those percentages.

1729
03:03:21,320 --> 03:03:33,347
One other thing that I if I may add is one of the discussions that we've been having with the leadership of this council is, you know, potentially

1730
03:03:33,897 --> 03:03:42,644
And I should have mentioned this earlier, but potentially placing some of the free cash funds before June 30th into a stabilization fund.

1731
03:03:42,664 --> 03:03:47,267
I think this may have been what you were asking, Councilor Collins, and I didn't touch on that.

1732
03:03:47,347 --> 03:03:48,048
I should have.

1733
03:03:49,209 --> 03:03:53,973
Into a stabilization account before June 30th, so we're able to spend that free cash

1734
03:03:54,773 --> 03:04:06,822
in fiscal 26 to actually be able to do the things that we've all been talking about here tonight, those things that we know that we can get through, but we just need a little bit of capital, further capital planning.

1735
03:04:06,922 --> 03:04:12,887
So I just mentioned that to say, you know, that's all on the horizon and that's, that's, that would have to happen immediately.

1736
03:04:12,967 --> 03:04:21,714
So, yeah, I was going to bring that up if, if nobody else brought it up after everyone had a chance to speak, but since it's been brought up, I just wanted to say, I think

1737
03:04:25,285 --> 03:04:27,967
Getting our most bang for the buck is really important here.

1738
03:04:27,987 --> 03:04:32,390
And I appreciate the diligence in that.

1739
03:04:34,680 --> 03:04:39,663
I don't think spending 15 of the 22 million on Freedom Way would be the most responsible decision for us to do.

1740
03:04:40,203 --> 03:04:43,645
We could probably do it, but it probably isn't the best thing to do.

1741
03:04:45,526 --> 03:04:49,068
I also think, though, that the point is well taken about the plan and the timeline.

1742
03:04:49,088 --> 03:04:57,212
And I think there's one thing, which is we're taking a deep dive look at the capital plan and the CIP and how that translates to free cash.

1743
03:04:57,252 --> 03:05:01,594
We know that the order of magnitude of need is so much more significant than the available funding.

1744
03:05:03,821 --> 03:05:19,409
But I think there's another piece of this, which is just to be really clear and say, and it goes to the point of like establishing, either using one of the existing funds or establishing this fund for capital investments, right, which is we have a stabilization fund that is like the stabilization fund that is the reserve fund.

1745
03:05:20,129 --> 03:05:23,971
And that meets the purposes of what the state talks about when we're talking about having reserves.

1746
03:05:24,071 --> 03:05:27,973
And I think understanding that is our targeted reserve balance fund.

1747
03:05:27,993 --> 03:05:29,914
This is the fund we're really planning not to touch.

1748
03:05:29,994 --> 03:05:30,914
It's our rainy day fund.

1749
03:05:30,994 --> 03:05:32,095
It's our reserve balance fund.

1750
03:05:32,910 --> 03:05:38,632
we have a capital stabilization fund, and that's like, if a roof falls down, right now we're using it more for the ad hoc stuff, right?

1751
03:05:38,752 --> 03:06:01,038
But I think it really is more of the, we're keeping this reserve, we have the reserve fund, we have a capital stabilization fund, which is for things that happen during the year, for emergencies, capital needs, and then we have an investment fund, which maybe won't get there this year, but I think it should be all of the rest of the money that is available in reserves, the fund balance for the city essentially, right?

1752
03:06:01,908 --> 03:06:07,070
And that is the money that could go to these larger capital needs.

1753
03:06:07,790 --> 03:06:13,192
And to me I think really being clear with the public like, here's our reserve fund, this is the target and goal balance.

1754
03:06:13,812 --> 03:06:16,853
We're at that, and we will replenish that every year if we ever use it.

1755
03:06:17,533 --> 03:06:24,876
here's our capital stabilization fund for emergencies, and we are going to replenish that every year, and we're using it for capital emergencies.

1756
03:06:25,536 --> 03:06:32,358
And then here is our capital investment fund, and that is, you know, for these bigger questions.

1757
03:06:32,518 --> 03:06:42,182
And just having that delineation, instead of just having it be nebulously free cash, free cash, free cash, and then anyone can say whatever they want about free cash, even though may not be related to reality of free cash,

1758
03:06:43,863 --> 03:06:51,726
It gets much easier to explain to people why we have these fund balances, where they are, what are our targets and goals and what are their purposes.

1759
03:06:51,786 --> 03:07:06,373
And so that's the work that I think we've been talking about that you just raised that I really hope we can advance because we can do that and be a lot clearer about the system that we're using to hold these funds and why they are in the buckets that they're in.

1760
03:07:07,886 --> 03:07:19,175
And hopefully we have, you know, good growth years and the free cash is just essentially replenishing, you know, replenishing those stabilization funds and then the balance can go into an investment fund or however we would want to do that.

1761
03:07:21,389 --> 03:07:30,253
And then there's that other question of what are our needs and how do we get our most bang for the buck using that investment fund, you know, piece to fund our things.

1762
03:07:30,313 --> 03:07:38,056
And my understanding is that regardless of what bucket it's interest accruing, so, you know, that piece gets to live too.

1763
03:07:38,476 --> 03:07:46,220
And there'll be carryover and we're not, you know, I'm not of the mind of saying just because we have 500 million in need, we should spend all 22 million next year.

1764
03:07:47,008 --> 03:07:50,030
But I also agree that we need to be moving faster.

1765
03:07:50,110 --> 03:07:54,692
So those are some of the discussions we've been having just to put that context out there since you raised it.

1766
03:07:54,852 --> 03:07:57,694
And I think that would be really informative and helpful.

1767
03:07:58,574 --> 03:08:01,176
That first piece of just like, this is where the money is and why.

1768
03:08:01,956 --> 03:08:08,039
And quite frankly, as little of it as possible in free cash since that gets twisted.

1769
03:08:09,880 --> 03:08:11,281
That I think is really helpful.

1770
03:08:11,721 --> 03:08:16,104
And then that's not to diminish my fellow colleagues longer questions about

1771
03:08:16,816 --> 03:08:23,161
being more urgent on using the funds available for one-time projects and what is the plan as relates to capital plan.

1772
03:08:23,242 --> 03:08:26,144
So it's just those are the kind of two pieces that I really think about it.

1773
03:08:26,224 --> 03:08:30,648
And if you want to talk, since I just talked for a while, I'll go to Emily and Kit.

1774
03:08:31,529 --> 03:08:31,869
Thank you.

1775
03:08:31,909 --> 03:08:36,031
I think that's a very helpful characterization to the discussions we've been having.

1776
03:08:36,051 --> 03:08:44,695
I think the only thing that it reminds me of that I think is worth noting here is a little bit of historical timeline, where we've been.

1777
03:08:44,715 --> 03:08:48,857
And I'm going to try to avoid a slippery slope here the best I can.

1778
03:08:49,117 --> 03:08:53,279
But I just will say that as of December 31, 2024,

1779
03:08:59,597 --> 03:09:08,145
We were, which obviously was, you know, less than six months ago at this point, we were still closing in on the planning on ARPA.

1780
03:09:08,725 --> 03:09:13,049
Right, we had to commit every dollar under ARPA, less than six months ago.

1781
03:09:14,170 --> 03:09:15,531
So that was our

1782
03:09:16,472 --> 03:09:32,884
last in first out right that had to be our last in first out model, because we can't lose that money we could never turn to the city and say you know well we received $48 million in our but but we weren't able to commit that in time that was the highest priority we had.

1783
03:09:34,205 --> 03:09:34,745
at the time.

1784
03:09:35,046 --> 03:09:38,047
And we've successfully completed that task.

1785
03:09:38,447 --> 03:09:44,611
We will successfully complete the task of spending all that funding by 2026, same time frame.

1786
03:09:44,651 --> 03:09:52,015
But just a little quick look back to where we were, why we might have the dollars that we have is because we were committing the ARPA funds first.

1787
03:09:52,515 --> 03:09:53,596
It had to be done that way.

1788
03:09:53,916 --> 03:09:56,618
So now we're through the budget season, we're

1789
03:09:57,858 --> 03:10:00,781
We have other major and pressing topics in front of us.

1790
03:10:01,402 --> 03:10:08,789
We are 100% committed to do this capital planning, as the mayor has stated, and I can't say enough this summer.

1791
03:10:09,229 --> 03:10:11,811
So I understand where the counselors are coming from.

1792
03:10:11,871 --> 03:10:22,241
I just wanted to kind of just take a quick look back to where we were and present that as a part of the discussion so that it's not lost on anyone where we were coming from.

1793
03:10:23,683 --> 03:10:26,204
Thanks, and you know, I really appreciate that.

1794
03:10:26,544 --> 03:10:47,995
I know that it was a real rush to the finish line on the ARPA stuff, and I know how important that was, and that quite frankly, we wouldn't have this free cash reserves funding for capital investment question if we hadn't done that, and if we didn't have ARPA, and if the federal government had never come in, because that was basically what is the reason for most of these balances.

1795
03:10:49,316 --> 03:10:54,597
And I just want to say, I think one of these is kind of just financial question, like where's the money?

1796
03:10:54,637 --> 03:10:55,117
Why is it there?

1797
03:10:55,157 --> 03:10:56,438
What is the goal of each of these things?

1798
03:10:56,598 --> 03:11:02,279
And then there's how are we spending it, which is a much bigger question where like the prioritization comes in.

1799
03:11:02,299 --> 03:11:09,880
So that was just what I was trying to add by kind of framing those two buckets of process.

1800
03:11:11,721 --> 03:11:12,441
Councilor Lozano.

1801
03:11:14,521 --> 03:11:14,801
Thank you.

1802
03:11:14,841 --> 03:11:15,462
I just wanted to

1803
03:11:17,700 --> 03:11:32,386
because I kind of had this realization recently and I wanted to reiterate something that Councilor Callahan said and something that Councilor, or President Perez said, which is that the Capital Stabilization Fund is also a rainy day fund.

1804
03:11:32,666 --> 03:11:41,090
And in some contexts, people will say that a city's funds that it has

1805
03:11:41,706 --> 03:11:54,012
as rainy day funds, that it's counting when it's looking at your bond rating, includes the capital stabilization fund and free cash, but you can spend the capital stabilization fund when you need to, you can't always spend free cash.

1806
03:11:54,692 --> 03:12:08,679
So it feels to me that it's a little bit confusing to say that free cash is being spent on replenishing the stabilization fund, it's not being spent on anything, it's going into a fund that we would then spend on something else.

1807
03:12:09,401 --> 03:12:11,883
if it were to come up, it's not just being held.

1808
03:12:11,963 --> 03:12:16,167
We still have it, and it's more available then.

1809
03:12:17,889 --> 03:12:24,094
And that the percentage of our budget that is being held in Rainy Day Fund, I think is too big right now.

1810
03:12:24,915 --> 03:12:51,307
and that we should be spending it on projects so that I think there's a fiscal irresponsibility in holding on to money and not spending it on things that need to get done just the same as it is on spending it on too many things too quickly, just like in a household budget, if you're not making improvements to your daily, you know, the way that you need to make improvements, that can be just as irresponsible as spending too much.

1811
03:12:51,807 --> 03:12:52,127
So I

1812
03:12:55,153 --> 03:13:05,879
all of that, you can look online at the DLS website, as Councilor Lemming was saying, compare all the different cities and everybody's all over the place.

1813
03:13:05,979 --> 03:13:14,024
But I really think that we can afford to do a lot more work to keep the city running more smoothly, and we just have to be a little bit more bold.

1814
03:13:14,844 --> 03:13:16,005
So I'm done.

1815
03:13:16,085 --> 03:13:16,665
I'm stopping now.

1816
03:13:16,886 --> 03:13:17,166
Thank you.

1817
03:13:18,106 --> 03:13:19,247
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1818
03:13:21,715 --> 03:13:22,035
Thank you.

1819
03:13:22,135 --> 03:13:22,796
I appreciate that.

1820
03:13:22,836 --> 03:13:23,616
And this is sorry.

1821
03:13:23,636 --> 03:13:28,820
This is a clarification that I wanted to make my point that was like about a half an hour ago, so I'll just make it super, super quickly.

1822
03:13:28,860 --> 03:13:30,741
I really appreciate the clarity around the dive team.

1823
03:13:30,781 --> 03:13:38,887
And I know that we've been bringing that up, perhaps a disproportionate, or at least for myself, a disproportionate amount, because it's something we've talked about recently, something that's on this sheet.

1824
03:13:39,888 --> 03:13:47,613
And maybe this is distinct from the point that other counselors were making, but for me, that is just one example and kind of a host of things at that tier that are relatively quick to ship.

1825
03:13:47,674 --> 03:13:49,535
I would also put into that category some of the

1826
03:13:51,017 --> 03:13:59,362
transportation and cycling network related improvements that we talked about in the committee of the whole in the past couple of months.

1827
03:13:59,402 --> 03:14:01,524
I think those kind of fit a lot of the same metrics.

1828
03:14:01,984 --> 03:14:04,746
So again, I don't want to, I don't want to restart our conversation on that topic.

1829
03:14:04,786 --> 03:14:06,267
And I understand the complexity around that.

1830
03:14:06,307 --> 03:14:14,852
I know there's complexities and questions to answer with any of these funding decisions, but more just to illustrate the point that for me, there's this, there is this category of

1831
03:14:16,192 --> 03:14:45,259
really meaningful in a lot of cases, community safety related improvements that we could probably onboard really quickly that would make a relatively small percentage dent in the amount of money that we're trying to either put into the appropriate stabilization fund or spend in the shorter term instead of appropriating into a stabilization fund that I think would be really, really meaningful for the community to see us onboarding in the context of the grander planning

1832
03:14:45,519 --> 03:14:51,683
appropriation work that we are going to be doing, both by the end of this fiscal year and over the next few months.

1833
03:14:52,564 --> 03:14:53,844
So I just wanted to make that clarification.

1834
03:14:54,265 --> 03:14:54,625
Thank you.

1835
03:14:58,107 --> 03:14:58,267
Thanks.

1836
03:14:58,287 --> 03:14:59,608
Do we have any further questions?

1837
03:15:09,031 --> 03:15:14,155
Seeing none, do we have any comments from members of the public on the proposed fiscal 26 budget?

1838
03:15:15,656 --> 03:15:15,856
Yes.

1839
03:15:16,436 --> 03:15:18,538
Name and address for the record, please, if three minutes.

1840
03:15:19,319 --> 03:15:19,999
Sure.

1841
03:15:20,159 --> 03:15:20,780
Sure.

1842
03:15:20,860 --> 03:15:22,321
Michael Kesselman, 49 Main Street.

1843
03:15:22,761 --> 03:15:24,242
I just had a question.

1844
03:15:24,863 --> 03:15:28,045
So one of the things, you know, we're talking about when

1845
03:15:29,502 --> 03:15:37,107
looking at the free cash is that you know what isn't moved to replenish the civilization fund is then like invested in some whatever index or whatever.

1846
03:15:37,927 --> 03:15:38,688
I are there.

1847
03:15:38,708 --> 03:15:43,390
Well, I guess I'm just saying you guys but are there local.

1848
03:15:45,727 --> 03:16:00,070
like vehicles for that type of investment that could actually funnel development as an investment in the city of Medford rather than going into some hedge fund or whatever index fund.

1849
03:16:00,090 --> 03:16:08,892
I guess that would be some sort of like what I'm curious about because then that makes that investment actually productive for the city while is actually accruing value at the same time.

1850
03:16:09,332 --> 03:16:11,232
And that would effectively be a win-win.

1851
03:16:11,992 --> 03:16:14,193
So I don't know if that's something you can even really look at or consider.

1852
03:16:15,938 --> 03:16:22,582
I'm going to look at Bob the whole time because I think I'm going to watch his face as I make mistakes and what I'm about to say and maybe Bob can correct them.

1853
03:16:23,263 --> 03:16:28,746
But my understanding what we're talking about here funds that are in the stabilization fund are free cash.

1854
03:16:29,527 --> 03:16:37,492
Essentially the city's cash assets that are not committed to something that the treasurer

1855
03:16:39,346 --> 03:16:52,321
It makes it that those are we basically pull that with other cities in through this through a state vehicle, and that that is how we hold those but I'm not 100% sure I'm going to go to the treasurer holds.

1856
03:16:53,387 --> 03:17:03,877
All of the city's funds, they're cut up according to Mass General Law, so the city has trust funds, for instance, that are managed in a trust vehicle.

1857
03:17:05,658 --> 03:17:12,585
Obviously, the treasurer needs to have available funds for cash flow for things like payroll and AP warrants.

1858
03:17:13,746 --> 03:17:17,389
The bulk of the money, she's enjoined by law

1859
03:17:19,169 --> 03:17:26,592
about how she can actually invest it, but a good portion of it is in an MMDT account, which is, I believe, what you were talking about.

1860
03:17:26,632 --> 03:17:27,493
It's a state account.

1861
03:17:27,553 --> 03:17:28,693
They're all interest-bearing.

1862
03:17:29,153 --> 03:17:33,755
Mass Municipal Depositors Trust, is that right?

1863
03:17:33,795 --> 03:17:37,017
MMDT, Mass Municipal Depositors Trust, is that the acronym?

1864
03:17:38,052 --> 03:17:38,932
I can never remember.

1865
03:17:38,952 --> 03:17:39,813
It's the NMDT.

1866
03:17:41,533 --> 03:17:47,136
Obviously, the treasurer tries to make sure that she has enough cash flow to meet the city's ongoing obligations.

1867
03:17:47,716 --> 03:17:54,698
And the rest of it is invested in the highest interest account she can get.

1868
03:17:55,439 --> 03:17:58,060
So yes, the city makes money.

1869
03:17:58,080 --> 03:18:04,742
I think this year we're on target to make about $1.5 million in interest.

1870
03:18:06,803 --> 03:18:11,145
just on the general fund's cash reserves.

1871
03:18:12,026 --> 03:18:15,608
That's been declining over the years as we've gradually spent all the ARPA money.

1872
03:18:16,108 --> 03:18:22,211
So it's included in all our projections for revenue for the recap.

1873
03:18:23,092 --> 03:18:32,877
And I think what Mike is asking is, you know, could the city invest those cash reserves in some sort of local bank that funds local businesses or something?

1874
03:18:32,937 --> 03:18:33,858
Is that what you're asking?

1875
03:18:35,008 --> 03:18:43,276
Yeah, yeah, basically, because it seems to me, I mean, I feel like a lot more discussion about like financial systems and whatever.

1876
03:18:43,596 --> 03:18:49,422
But I mean, that money is it's just sitting there in some sort of like index fund or whatever interest that has nothing to do with our city.

1877
03:18:49,482 --> 03:18:54,767
It's sort of generalized to like, like state spending, maybe probably just whatever on the market.

1878
03:18:56,925 --> 03:19:13,229
But if there was a way to route those investments into like a purely local focused thing, I mean, then those would actually be productive, even as they were accruing value, they would also be assisting the development of the city to further accrue, you know, increase our tax base.

1879
03:19:13,769 --> 03:19:23,312
So like, that's like, that was really my question was like, is there any way to localize that those investment vehicles so that they're actually doing two for one sort of thing?

1880
03:19:24,986 --> 03:19:27,167
Does that make sense, vaguely at least?

1881
03:19:28,347 --> 03:19:29,047
Go ahead, Bob.

1882
03:19:30,388 --> 03:19:37,910
Through you, we'd have to make sure that we were in compliance with mass general law, obviously.

1883
03:19:37,990 --> 03:19:44,952
And I would say that I believe a good amount of it is invested in Brookline Bank, right over there.

1884
03:19:46,812 --> 03:19:49,073
That's where I believe a lot of the

1885
03:19:50,753 --> 03:19:58,316
day-to-day cash that the city uses is sequestered.

1886
03:19:58,876 --> 03:20:12,561
Honestly, we'd have to talk to the legal department to figure out exactly what would need to be done to formalize that type of investment vehicle like us, is what I'd say.

1887
03:20:13,462 --> 03:20:14,042
I'm not sure

1888
03:20:15,965 --> 03:20:20,010
The treasurer handles the legal ramifications of it.

1889
03:20:20,738 --> 03:20:23,440
You know, there's a bunch of things involved.

1890
03:20:23,500 --> 03:20:27,223
For instance, we're not allowed to keep all of our money in one bank.

1891
03:20:28,083 --> 03:20:40,452
It's supposed to be, you know, there's percentages that have to be kept aside so that if one bank has a problem, then we don't lose our, you know, we can still get all our money.

1892
03:20:40,953 --> 03:20:47,918
So there's a bunch of different restrictions on how we actually invest the money.

1893
03:20:50,596 --> 03:20:50,936
Thanks.

1894
03:20:51,496 --> 03:21:02,601
It sounds like suffice it to say that in the short term, state law governs a bunch of this and we are keeping our cash assets in the places required by law and also the places that gain the most interest.

1895
03:21:03,541 --> 03:21:11,684
And looking at some more locally focused places to put the city's cash assets would need to be studied more and make sure it complies with the law that the state has.

1896
03:21:16,310 --> 03:21:20,431
All right, any further comment from members of the public on the budget?

1897
03:21:26,173 --> 03:21:30,135
Seeing none, any last comments from members of the council on the budget?

1898
03:21:32,215 --> 03:21:33,276
Vice President Collins.

1899
03:21:35,837 --> 03:21:45,600
Pending any further comments from my fellow councilors, members of the public, I would make a motion to approve the fiscal year 2026 budget submission as amended.

1900
03:21:46,803 --> 03:21:48,124
by the mayor.

1901
03:21:49,204 --> 03:21:50,085
Great.

1902
03:21:50,105 --> 03:22:00,271
And so we have the revised submission and then there was one amendment tonight which was just correcting the words around the, I have it here, the $205,304,412.76.

1903
03:22:00,311 --> 03:22:01,691
Great.

1904
03:22:12,660 --> 03:22:13,561
Is there a second on the motion?

1905
03:22:14,121 --> 03:22:15,243
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1906
03:22:15,263 --> 03:22:20,389
I just want to thank the administration and our department heads and members of the Council, members of the public.

1907
03:22:22,251 --> 03:22:28,919
This is our second time around with the budget ordinance, and I know it was a lot of work to pass the ordinance, and I think we're seeing some of the fruits of that.

1908
03:22:28,959 --> 03:22:29,921
We are here on June 10th.

1909
03:22:31,400 --> 03:22:35,021
On what is I think our ninth or 10th meeting on the budget.

1910
03:22:35,221 --> 03:22:39,722
I have no a colleague in Somerville, they're just starting department head budget presentations tonight.

1911
03:22:40,182 --> 03:22:46,004
So, and to be honest, my first few years on the council that is where we were to we got a budget.

1912
03:22:46,784 --> 03:22:51,945
Early June we frantically rushed and with night meetings and you know marathon.

1913
03:22:52,957 --> 03:23:07,549
four to eight to 12 hour Saturday session, which I don't think is really best practice to get through our budget hearings and budget meetings and, you know, then come down to the wire of is the budget going to pass?

1914
03:23:07,589 --> 03:23:09,611
Are we going to have to schedule a special meeting?

1915
03:23:09,731 --> 03:23:12,213
And are we going to get it done by June 30th?

1916
03:23:12,354 --> 03:23:14,295
And what does a one 12th budget look like?

1917
03:23:14,375 --> 03:23:15,296
And those were the days.

1918
03:23:15,556 --> 03:23:15,716
So,

1919
03:23:17,938 --> 03:23:42,254
I just want to note that the process, I think, starting a lot earlier, being collaborative, engaging the council early in the process, working closely together with the administration, with our finance director, chief of staff, the mayor, the whole finance team, that we really are, again, as I said before, seeing the fruits of that collaborative process to create that ordinance and in a way that I think brings a lot more

1920
03:23:43,215 --> 03:23:50,757
stability and consistency and, you know, as much certainty as you can ever have in municipal budgeting to the process.

1921
03:23:51,258 --> 03:23:54,639
And so I just wanted to thank everyone for their involvement in that.

1922
03:23:55,479 --> 03:24:04,102
Thank our colleagues on the school committee for the work that they do as well with their process, which is also in recent years started moving much earlier and

1923
03:24:05,955 --> 03:24:09,938
I think it also gives a lot of opportunity for public engagement as well.

1924
03:24:10,278 --> 03:24:21,007
So I'm really heartened that we are where we are, that our budget process is the way that it is and that it is working so well.

1925
03:24:21,027 --> 03:24:26,050
I think it's really a testament to the collaboration between this council and the city administration.

1926
03:24:26,070 --> 03:24:33,896
And I'm glad it's an ordinance and hopefully they'll keep following it for a long time after all of us are not here doing it.

1927
03:24:35,175 --> 03:24:41,560
feels a lot better than sitting here on June 28th at 2 a.m.

1928
03:24:41,700 --> 03:24:44,522
That was some fun times, y'all.

1929
03:24:45,503 --> 03:24:56,912
So with that, we have a motion from Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Sang, the Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Submission Revision as amended.

1930
03:24:57,873 --> 03:24:58,974
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1931
03:24:59,795 --> 03:25:00,415
Councilor Kallion.

1932
03:25:01,976 --> 03:25:02,717
Vice President Collins.

1933
03:25:04,758 --> 03:25:12,983
Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

1934
03:25:13,323 --> 03:25:18,887
Yes, six the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes and the fiscal year 2026 budget is approved.

1935
03:25:20,548 --> 03:25:26,451
All right, 25096 submitted by Mayor Brian Alango Kern, appropriation of free cash and retained earnings.

1936
03:25:26,731 --> 03:25:32,295
Dear President Behrs and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the appropriation of

1937
03:25:33,108 --> 03:25:35,129
One, free cash in the amount of $2,136,519.19 on the following items.

1938
03:25:35,149 --> 03:25:36,990
$1,469,519.19 to replenish the capital stabilization fund to $5 million.

1939
03:25:37,010 --> 03:25:37,571
Current balance, $3,530,480.81.

1940
03:25:37,611 --> 03:25:39,552
$271,000 for school network switches and wireless access points project.

1941
03:25:59,522 --> 03:26:03,285
$216,000 for school mini split replacement project.

1942
03:26:03,505 --> 03:26:12,051
$100,000 for nexus studies for inclusionary zoning, linkage fees, and transportation demand management, and $80,000 for supplementary tree planting funding.

1943
03:26:12,571 --> 03:26:14,473
The balance of free cash before this vote is $22,160,443.13.

1944
03:26:14,653 --> 03:26:17,515
Two, retained earnings from the water sewer enterprise in the amount of $462,000.00 on the following items.

1945
03:26:29,096 --> 03:26:34,866
100,000 to replenish the water sewer capital stabilization fund to $2 million current balance $1,900,000 150,000 to replace a water backhoe number 70.

1946
03:26:41,460 --> 03:26:50,983
$82,000 for improvements to Doonan Street Booster Station, $80,000 for Oak Grove Cemetery water service design, and $50,000 for Rosina Street Small Sewer Extension.

1947
03:26:51,483 --> 03:26:56,685
The balance of retained earnings in the water sewer enterprise before this vote is $10,953,475.

1948
03:26:57,065 --> 03:27:00,906
Respectfully submitted, Breanna Legaucurne, Mayor.

1949
03:27:02,347 --> 03:27:02,967
Madam Chief of Staff.

1950
03:27:07,408 --> 03:27:09,189
Thank you, President Behrs and members of the Council.

1951
03:27:11,262 --> 03:27:13,986
would be remiss if I didn't thank the council for its vote.

1952
03:27:14,046 --> 03:27:21,136
And again, thanking the council for everything you've done, every one of you throughout this budget season.

1953
03:27:21,597 --> 03:27:25,142
And I appreciate the budget ordinance as well, because I don't miss those days either.

1954
03:27:25,482 --> 03:27:27,385
So thank you for everything.

1955
03:27:27,645 --> 03:27:30,446
we have a number of questions on this paper regarding free cash and retained earnings.

1956
03:27:31,606 --> 03:27:33,567
We've talked about a number of these already.

1957
03:27:34,027 --> 03:27:35,768
I don't really have all that much to say.

1958
03:27:35,788 --> 03:27:37,808
At this point, I'm happy to answer any questions.

1959
03:27:37,909 --> 03:27:46,391
But in in the interest of the council's time, I'll just simply say that we have members of the school department here who are available to answer questions on the school items.

1960
03:27:47,072 --> 03:27:48,952
We have a member of our city city

1961
03:27:55,127 --> 03:28:01,929
and sewer items as well as some combination of our city engineer and myself in terms of the supplementary tree planting.

1962
03:28:02,849 --> 03:28:06,851
Because I'm not certain that the DPW commissioner will be able to make it.

1963
03:28:06,991 --> 03:28:13,693
He too is in a traffic commission meeting, and we were told that it was expected to be long, but I'm not sure what's where it stands as a writing.

1964
03:28:14,013 --> 03:28:14,373
Oh, it's done.

1965
03:28:14,533 --> 03:28:19,755
Okay Um, so you know if there's if there's a pressing need, we may be able to get our DPW commissioner as well.

1966
03:28:21,043 --> 03:28:23,124
So that's my briefest version.

1967
03:28:23,384 --> 03:28:24,264
Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

1968
03:28:24,324 --> 03:28:30,807
I do want to offer you are here if there's anything you'd like to add about the items.

1969
03:28:31,067 --> 03:28:32,007
Owen's saying no.

1970
03:28:32,527 --> 03:28:35,328
Noelle, Jerry, I think only if we have questions.

1971
03:28:38,783 --> 03:28:39,203
Thank you.

1972
03:28:39,223 --> 03:28:42,727
I appreciate these expenditures.

1973
03:28:42,947 --> 03:28:51,356
They all seem very reasonable and like a valuable use of both free cash and the Water Enterprise Fund.

1974
03:28:51,376 --> 03:28:56,961
I will just say, and I will probably continue to be very annoying about this,

1975
03:28:58,197 --> 03:29:14,022
that the funding for the fire department dive team is something that I will not stop talking about until I hear an adequate reason why we're not doing it.

1976
03:29:14,182 --> 03:29:15,722
It costs $120,000.

1977
03:29:16,803 --> 03:29:23,065
And if we have questions for the fire department, we should ask them and then get answers.

1978
03:29:23,145 --> 03:29:23,785
And then if it's,

1979
03:29:25,026 --> 03:29:27,688
not sustainable, I would love to hear why.

1980
03:29:30,630 --> 03:29:48,303
Anything on this list that is a matter of somebody who died and it could prevent it happening again, I would love to know what it is, but that's one that is related to something like that.

1981
03:29:51,685 --> 03:30:02,047
Similarly, I would love to see free cash expenditures used on our most dangerous roads that we have the capacity to fix that are city run streets.

1982
03:30:03,427 --> 03:30:13,529
So just putting that bug in everybody's ear and just letting you know, I will continue to be annoying, but for these expenditures, I love to see it.

1983
03:30:13,689 --> 03:30:14,589
Let's do a little bit more.

1984
03:30:14,929 --> 03:30:15,549
Thank you so much.

1985
03:30:18,110 --> 03:30:19,310
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1986
03:30:20,404 --> 03:30:22,487
I'm basically with Councilor Zara.

1987
03:30:22,527 --> 03:30:28,233
I think I do want to point out how helpful a lot of this is.

1988
03:30:31,093 --> 03:30:43,379
Honestly, special shout out to Councilor Lemming for his work on the linkage fees, the TDM, the nexus studies, and advocating for that, organizing us to push for it as well.

1989
03:30:44,619 --> 03:30:56,685
I think back to the first, I believe the first resolution I co-sponsored, Councilor Lemming worked a lot on that resolution, and this represents progress on that resolution.

1990
03:30:57,926 --> 03:30:58,066
And

1991
03:30:59,277 --> 03:31:02,318
to translate it from jargon into real effects.

1992
03:31:02,738 --> 03:31:15,003
This gives us the groundwork to study affordable housing, to build more affordable housing, to know how to strategize and how to do it in a way that best serves our community and our transit.

1993
03:31:16,144 --> 03:31:19,487
and encourages the use of green transit.

1994
03:31:20,468 --> 03:31:28,935
A lot of the school projects, these are a lot of projects that students and teachers and parents alike have been clamoring for a while.

1995
03:31:29,536 --> 03:31:32,819
It goes hand in hand with a lot of the funding that we've passed.

1996
03:31:33,519 --> 03:31:34,860
over the last few months.

1997
03:31:35,901 --> 03:31:39,323
And 80,000 for tree planting is also very important.

1998
03:31:40,023 --> 03:31:50,049
And while I suspect we'll need a lot more for that to really go at the trees deficit that we're seeing every year, it is forward progress.

1999
03:31:51,930 --> 03:31:56,173
I also echo Councilor Lazaro's sentiments and the sentiments, I think,

2000
03:31:57,310 --> 03:32:03,259
echoed, like generally stated tonight, that we'd love to see even more being done in this.

2001
03:32:04,260 --> 03:32:09,969
The dive team being very important, both to the fire department, to the city, and to our residents.

2002
03:32:12,532 --> 03:32:25,623
We, you know, talked, I think, over multiple meetings, some in budget meetings, some outside, about work that we could do in our parks, work that we could do with public facilities, whatnot.

2003
03:32:26,183 --> 03:32:31,187
That's all, you know, I can assure the public this Council will keep fighting for those going forward.

2004
03:32:31,942 --> 03:32:40,145
And that that will be part of the conversation when we talk about free cash and how we're going to develop that that free cash spending plan.

2005
03:32:40,765 --> 03:32:49,889
So, I do also want to take this opportunity and think school staff city staff, especially those who have waited so long here tonight.

2006
03:32:53,517 --> 03:33:00,844
And those who've waited for long meetings in the weeks past, the budget process is an arduous process.

2007
03:33:01,784 --> 03:33:06,929
No budget is perfect, but this one has been more painless than a lot of the other ones I remember.

2008
03:33:07,069 --> 03:33:14,556
And I think it reflects the spirit of cooperation and goodwill that we have working in the City Hall right now.

2009
03:33:16,227 --> 03:33:27,493
you know, I think it's a relationship built on trust and understanding that progress will come and that we'll have to make difficult decisions going forward, and that we will commit to making difficult decisions, especially about spending.

2010
03:33:28,553 --> 03:33:31,775
But I'm grateful for the collaboration here.

2011
03:33:31,795 --> 03:33:34,977
Thanks, Councilor Lemming.

2012
03:33:36,689 --> 03:33:38,870
like to echo my colleague's views on this.

2013
03:33:39,110 --> 03:33:48,713
I am glad and I'm glad to see the funding for the Nexus studies that we've been asking for for a while.

2014
03:33:49,013 --> 03:34:01,277
Just to clarify to anybody watching City Council meetings at 1024 in the evening, these studies are going to be used by the Planning Department to put out bids to

2015
03:34:05,317 --> 03:34:13,750
outside firms who will determine the amount that we need to raise our linkage fees to the modern day.

2016
03:34:13,870 --> 03:34:20,621
Now, the linkage fees are the amount of money that we charge developers as a city who might want to

2017
03:34:21,582 --> 03:34:29,794
so that we can put funding towards our roads, our police and fire, our parks, and our water and sewer lines.

2018
03:34:29,834 --> 03:34:36,244
And more recently, we have an ordinance going through to put linkage fees towards affordable housing.

2019
03:34:37,164 --> 03:34:41,847
Now these amounts have not been updated since the 1990s.

2020
03:34:42,067 --> 03:34:50,293
So they've basically been eaten by inflation this whole time, even though it was the responsibility of the city to update these every three years.

2021
03:34:50,313 --> 03:34:54,695
It's just, we got in the habit of not doing that ever since they were first instituted.

2022
03:34:54,755 --> 03:34:59,238
So this is a area where the city is just hemorrhaging money.

2023
03:34:59,659 --> 03:35:05,502
And this very small investment is a way to stop doing that.

2024
03:35:07,363 --> 03:35:15,814
the they will allow us to figure out how much we should be charging these developers because so far we've been really we really haven't been doing that.

2025
03:35:16,375 --> 03:35:22,043
The other the other part of this is the transportation demand management study.

2026
03:35:22,663 --> 03:35:47,651
which will allow the city to essentially integrate with the Mystic Valley TMA to create incentives for local developers to put money towards things like buses to allow more local transportation within Medford, as well as a number of other benefits that being included in those regional developer networks will bring to the city.

2027
03:35:49,832 --> 03:36:02,021
$100,000 may not necessarily be enough to fund all of these studies, but it will allow the planning office to start putting out bids in order to get that back.

2028
03:36:02,061 --> 03:36:11,649
And so we might have to, we might be put in a position where we'll have to approve more funding for them in the future, depending on what prices they get back from consultants.

2029
03:36:11,689 --> 03:36:14,251
But in any case, I'd like to thank the city for putting this in front of us.

2030
03:36:15,572 --> 03:36:16,793
And that's all I have to say.

2031
03:36:18,580 --> 03:36:19,320
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

2032
03:36:20,341 --> 03:36:23,223
I got two quick questions, one for Owen, one for our schools team.

2033
03:36:24,984 --> 03:36:29,006
Owen, and if you could come to the podium.

2034
03:36:31,088 --> 03:36:33,249
What is the Oak Grove Cemetery water service design?

2035
03:36:33,269 --> 03:36:34,129
What are we designing?

2036
03:36:35,670 --> 03:36:41,134
That is basically upgrading the two-inch line that's like really, really, really old to like a six-inch line.

2037
03:36:41,234 --> 03:36:45,156
There's hydrants in there, and then upgrading the system throughout the, about 400 linear feet.

2038
03:36:46,959 --> 03:36:50,101
And then the booster station at Doonan Street, is that just to get water up the hill?

2039
03:36:50,561 --> 03:36:50,741
Yeah.

2040
03:36:51,081 --> 03:36:51,662
OK, great.

2041
03:36:52,042 --> 03:36:52,922
OK.

2042
03:36:53,363 --> 03:37:08,251
And Noel and Jerry, just, it's probably a yes-no question, so I'm sorry to make you stand up for it, but both of these items, the network switches and wireless access, are these both, is the mini-split thing about the heat in the network rooms?

2043
03:37:08,711 --> 03:37:08,911
Yes.

2044
03:37:09,612 --> 03:37:09,912
OK.

2045
03:37:10,152 --> 03:37:13,794
And then how much is the network switches and wireless access points, that's a little different?

2046
03:37:15,085 --> 03:37:15,405
Yes.

2047
03:37:15,545 --> 03:37:26,769
So all across the network, there's various points that have to be refreshed to keep the network coming along.

2048
03:37:26,889 --> 03:37:30,450
So it's a larger project.

2049
03:37:30,850 --> 03:37:34,811
This will be partially e-rate funded as well.

2050
03:37:35,051 --> 03:37:35,131
OK.

2051
03:37:35,511 --> 03:37:39,413
But it's a major refresh of our network.

2052
03:37:40,533 --> 03:37:40,733
Great.

2053
03:37:40,874 --> 03:37:45,560
If you could, and I don't expect you guys to answer this, if you could get back to us just with an understanding of

2054
03:37:46,528 --> 03:37:52,310
How will this make more spaces at the schools more available for the use for hybrid meetings?

2055
03:37:52,370 --> 03:37:56,651
We had a hybrid meeting at the Andrews a few weeks ago, and the internet just wasn't up to snuff.

2056
03:37:56,671 --> 03:37:59,332
We couldn't really keep the people on Zoom, and it was kind of an issue.

2057
03:37:59,372 --> 03:38:00,873
So if you could just get back to us on that.

2058
03:38:00,993 --> 03:38:01,273
Sure.

2059
03:38:01,733 --> 03:38:04,234
I mean, it could fix some of that.

2060
03:38:04,254 --> 03:38:08,455
There could be a bandwidth issue that we would have to address as well.

2061
03:38:08,795 --> 03:38:08,996
Sure.

2062
03:38:09,316 --> 03:38:13,777
But that would be great if more of the spaces were available for use for hybrid meetings, because we're pretty short on that right now.

2063
03:38:14,037 --> 03:38:14,337
OK.

2064
03:38:14,617 --> 03:38:14,857
Yes.

2065
03:38:15,018 --> 03:38:15,418
Thanks, guys.

2066
03:38:16,518 --> 03:38:16,878
Thank you.

2067
03:38:17,239 --> 03:38:22,823
Any more questions from members of the Council on these two requests?

2068
03:38:24,804 --> 03:38:27,306
Any comment from members of the public on this paper?

2069
03:38:31,209 --> 03:38:31,450
Sure.

2070
03:38:34,007 --> 03:38:36,169
Yeah, I'm Mikey Kesselman again, 499 Main Street.

2071
03:38:36,509 --> 03:38:43,294
It's tangentially related to this, but I actually think it's important to bring up some time with studies.

2072
03:38:44,055 --> 03:38:58,025
And as some of you may be aware, I am actually Medford's rep on the MCAC, Massport Citizens Advisory Committee.

2073
03:39:01,456 --> 03:39:03,437
because no one has replaced me.

2074
03:39:03,477 --> 03:39:05,378
I've been looking for someone to replace me for over a year and a half.

2075
03:39:05,458 --> 03:39:16,041
So if you're interested in watching this, and you want to have a position where you get to hear people have really sad stories and have no power to do anything about it, and then hear a bunch of other people say, you're not selling it.

2076
03:39:16,321 --> 03:39:20,483
If you hate airplane noise, and you want to take over for Micah, who has done a good job.

2077
03:39:21,283 --> 03:39:22,043
Yes, that'd be great.

2078
03:39:22,604 --> 03:39:24,124
Please, I'll help you through it.

2079
03:39:24,644 --> 03:39:24,904
Anyway.

2080
03:39:27,416 --> 03:39:42,987
would be remiss if I didn't strongly encourage that when you're performing cities, especially when it comes to housing and suitability for habitation in different parts of the city, to consider noise studies, too, as part of that.

2081
03:39:43,127 --> 03:39:50,052
Because there are certain corridors in our city that whether people

2082
03:39:51,001 --> 03:40:07,194
realize it or not, to a not insignificant, really no portion of the population is insignificant, but to a chunk of the population that live under them, have documented deleterious health effects on them.

2083
03:40:08,255 --> 03:40:11,298
So it really does need to be taken more seriously and taken into consideration.

2084
03:40:11,718 --> 03:40:17,383
That's also not to forget to mention that one of our schools is directly under a flight path.

2085
03:40:18,430 --> 03:40:28,817
too, which has noise issues and also has likely negative impacts on learning outcomes for those impacted by it.

2086
03:40:28,877 --> 03:40:36,801
It's also just insane to have airplanes aimed at your schools when they can just be moved anywhere, like 100 feet to the left or something.

2087
03:40:37,682 --> 03:40:45,807
So I just wanted to sort of advocate for that since I had the chance to, and it's, yeah, it's about this paper, so thanks.

2088
03:40:48,522 --> 03:40:55,564
On the question, we had the motion from Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang.

2089
03:40:56,505 --> 03:40:59,546
Seeing no further public comment in person or on Zoom, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2090
03:41:03,547 --> 03:41:04,187
Councilor Callahan.

2091
03:41:05,187 --> 03:41:06,008
Vice President Collins.

2092
03:41:07,148 --> 03:41:07,968
Councilor Lozaro.

2093
03:41:08,608 --> 03:41:09,169
Councilor Lemming.

2094
03:41:09,909 --> 03:41:10,509
Councilor Scarpelli.

2095
03:41:12,758 --> 03:41:14,359
Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

2096
03:41:14,479 --> 03:41:16,460
Yes, I'm in favor of the negative, the motion passes.

2097
03:41:17,100 --> 03:41:20,982
We have two ordinances eligible for third reading, flood ordinance and parking ordinance.

2098
03:41:24,123 --> 03:41:28,645
Motion to take papers 25067 and 25078 off the table.

2099
03:41:30,446 --> 03:41:34,288
Second by Councilor Sang, seconded by Vice President Collins.

2100
03:41:34,308 --> 03:41:34,888
All those in favor?

2101
03:41:35,897 --> 03:42:04,531
opposed motion passes to 5067 amendments to the flood ordinance chapter 46 article two in City Council April 29 2025 approved first reading advertised May 29 2025 Medford transcript and several journal in Council June 10 2025 eligible for third reading on the motion to approve for third reading by Vice President Collins seconded by Councilor saying this is the flood ordinance amendments.

2102
03:42:19,555 --> 03:42:21,137
Yes, 067, yes.

2103
03:42:21,437 --> 03:42:24,640
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2104
03:42:25,841 --> 03:42:35,449
Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lozaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

2105
03:42:35,549 --> 03:42:37,931
Yes, the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

2106
03:42:39,132 --> 03:42:41,614
25078, amendments to the parking ordinance, chapter 78, article 3.

2107
03:42:45,114 --> 03:42:49,801
Motion by Councilor San Buenaventura to approve for third reading, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

2108
03:42:49,821 --> 03:43:00,457
Are we ready for third?

2109
03:43:19,763 --> 03:43:30,572
Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lozaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

2110
03:43:30,812 --> 03:43:32,634
Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

2111
03:43:32,654 --> 03:43:35,256
The motion passes and the ordinance is ordained.

2112
03:43:36,257 --> 03:43:41,621
Public participation to participate outside of Zoom, email ahertobeesatmenford-ma.gov.

2113
03:43:42,802 --> 03:43:44,284
Do we have any further public participation?

2114
03:43:48,217 --> 03:43:51,339
Mike, you have someone for nine minutes.

2115
03:43:52,179 --> 03:43:54,460
This is one of the things I wanted to stay for.

2116
03:43:56,101 --> 03:44:03,364
So I've been thinking a lot about this issue of policing in Medford, obviously.

2117
03:44:04,565 --> 03:44:13,409
So I think that there's some things that need to be understood too by the council is that

2118
03:44:15,065 --> 03:44:16,246
Cops aren't legal experts.

2119
03:44:17,167 --> 03:44:25,136
They don't know the meets and bounds of the laws, nor the authority that is granted or denied them.

2120
03:44:25,536 --> 03:44:30,881
They are told it, but they're not lawyers.

2121
03:44:31,402 --> 03:44:33,264
They're not scholars.

2122
03:44:33,424 --> 03:44:34,685
They're cops.

2123
03:44:34,866 --> 03:44:35,386
They do their job.

2124
03:44:35,426 --> 03:44:36,447
They try to do their job.

2125
03:44:36,487 --> 03:44:36,968
That's what they are.

2126
03:44:37,661 --> 03:44:37,981
there to do.

2127
03:44:38,121 --> 03:44:52,472
So I really encourage to not have blind deference to a police officer's statement that we're not legally allowed to do something.

2128
03:44:52,893 --> 03:44:56,916
They have no basis for that, more often than not.

2129
03:44:57,096 --> 03:44:59,838
The other thing I really want

2130
03:45:00,740 --> 03:45:11,627
people to hear is that a big part of this is because our municipal police force, like most municipal police forces, take a large amount of money from federal grants.

2131
03:45:12,547 --> 03:45:18,151
Their federal funding is a big portion of how they finance themselves.

2132
03:45:19,072 --> 03:45:28,057
And that is why there is so much deference and tiptoeing and pussyfooting about what they can and can't do when it comes to federal enforcement.

2133
03:45:30,816 --> 03:45:37,464
But they're not like the federal government is the only one that can challenge the validity of a federal grant.

2134
03:45:37,985 --> 03:45:50,040
So I have said this elsewhere, but I think, you know, if necessary, the threat of challenging federal grant money from the city is a valid way to get the

2135
03:45:51,420 --> 03:45:54,103
an uncooperative agency to cooperate.

2136
03:45:55,003 --> 03:45:58,346
It's a last resort and it sucks, but it's something to consider and think about.

2137
03:45:58,366 --> 03:46:01,229
And I'll just leave it at that.

2138
03:46:01,249 --> 03:46:03,131
So that's my public comment.

2139
03:46:05,533 --> 03:46:05,913
Thank you.

2140
03:46:07,795 --> 03:46:11,418
Any further discussion either in person or on Zoom for public participation?

2141
03:46:14,201 --> 03:46:17,824
Seeing none in the chambers and no hands on Zoom, is there a motion on the floor?

2142
03:46:19,299 --> 03:46:21,544
On the motion adjourned by Councilor Kellyanne, seconded by?

2143
03:46:22,486 --> 03:46:23,589
Seconded by Councilor Zaro.

2144
03:46:23,629 --> 03:46:24,311
All those in favor?

2145
03:46:25,092 --> 03:46:25,473
Opposed?

2146
03:46:25,553 --> 03:46:26,997
Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

2147
03:46:27,037 --> 03:46:27,317
Thank you.
