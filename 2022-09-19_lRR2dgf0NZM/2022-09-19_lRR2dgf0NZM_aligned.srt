On a motion to enter into executive session, to enter into mass general laws, chapter 30A, section 121A, executive session of the Medford School Committee, to conduct a strategy session on the basis of that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining or litigating positions of the Medford School Committee, specifically the Medford School Committee will be discussing ongoing collective bargaining

negotiations with nine separate labor units, as well as discussing a grievance filed by the MTA.

4
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,323
Motion by Member McLaughlin to go into executive session, seconded by?

5
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:35,244
Second.

6
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,085
Member Graham, roll call, vote.

7
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:39,286
Member Graham.

8
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:39,686
Yes.

9
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:40,847
Member Hayes.

10
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:41,367
Yes.

11
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:42,448
Member Kretz.

12
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:43,068
Yes.

13
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,089
Member McLaughlin.

14
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:44,789
Yes.

15
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:45,450
Member McStone.

16
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:45,730
Yes.

17
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,550
Member Rousseau.

18
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:46,791
Yes.

19
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,451
Mayor Longo.

20
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:48,031
Yes.

21
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:53,835
So in the affirmative, zero in the negative, we're gonna head into executive session and we will come back on the floor, hopefully right around six o'clock.

22
01:07:29,124 --> 01:07:30,005
Good evening, everybody.

23
01:07:30,045 --> 01:07:30,965
Sorry, we're a few minutes late.

24
01:07:30,985 --> 01:07:49,416
We're in executive session to discuss a few things, but one thing we need to announce is that we have voted unanimously to approve the contracts, new contracts for our nurses in the Memphis Public Schools, the Carpenters Union, as well as the administrative assistance.

25
01:07:52,218 --> 01:07:57,561
Next up, we have the consent agenda, which is bills and payrolls, committee of the whole meeting minutes from June 29th, 2022.

26
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:11,739
regular school committee meeting minutes September 12 2022 motion to sever the committee of the whole minutes meeting minutes from June 29 December by member Russo second amendment goff and all those in favor.

27
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:14,380
Hi, all those opposed motion is severed.

28
01:08:17,402 --> 01:08:21,103
Can I just ask a question I didn't have bills in payrolls in my packet.

29
01:08:21,123 --> 01:08:22,564
Is that intentional.

30
01:08:24,204 --> 01:08:24,464
I did.

31
01:08:30,892 --> 01:08:35,193
That's what I'm looking at.

32
01:08:35,213 --> 01:08:36,393
Yeah, that's what I have to.

33
01:08:36,513 --> 01:08:37,433
Oh, no, that's what I have.

34
01:08:38,993 --> 01:08:40,514
Other additional bills and payrolls.

35
01:08:42,894 --> 01:08:43,634
This is what we have.

36
01:08:44,574 --> 01:08:48,015
We didn't get that.

37
01:08:48,755 --> 01:08:49,595
No, it's okay.

38
01:08:49,915 --> 01:08:51,756
Do you want a motion to table until next?

39
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:54,536
Motion to approve the remaining consent agenda.

40
01:08:54,976 --> 01:08:59,177
Motion to approve the remaining consent agenda agenda by member Graham seconded by

41
01:08:59,986 --> 01:09:01,406
Second, Member McLaughlin.

42
01:09:01,466 --> 01:09:02,227
All those in favor?

43
01:09:02,247 --> 01:09:02,587
Aye.

44
01:09:02,947 --> 01:09:03,047
Aye.

45
01:09:03,107 --> 01:09:03,927
All those opposed?

46
01:09:03,947 --> 01:09:07,588
Is there a motion to table the Committee of the Whole minutes or?

47
01:09:08,668 --> 01:09:10,089
I just had questions about them.

48
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:10,729
Okay.

49
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:11,849
Member Russo?

50
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:12,789
Thank you.

51
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:17,791
So this meeting, reviewing the minutes, it says I was absent.

52
01:09:17,891 --> 01:09:24,092
I actually was on an advanced notice vacation and actually did not receive notice of the meeting.

53
01:09:24,152 --> 01:09:26,893
And I think the minutes should be updated to say

54
01:09:27,817 --> 01:09:30,259
I don't know what they need to say, but I was not absent.

55
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:32,621
I was not notified of the meeting.

56
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:42,929
So it's a very important distinction since I missed only one meeting ever for illness and I take attendance very seriously.

57
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:48,394
So I don't know what, if we want to just change the way it says absent to say absent, failure to notify.

58
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:49,194
Yes.

59
01:09:50,155 --> 01:09:50,876
That's acceptable.

60
01:09:51,536 --> 01:09:53,498
Point of, I guess I have a question.

61
01:09:55,022 --> 01:09:57,543
If member Rousseau is finished, I'll move on to member McLaughlin.

62
01:09:58,464 --> 01:10:02,347
So wasn't there an email sent out to all of us that there was a meeting?

63
01:10:04,088 --> 01:10:04,328
Yes.

64
01:10:04,428 --> 01:10:14,295
And prior to the email, I had told administration I was away and without internet service or cell phone service, and we had no posted meetings at that point in time.

65
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:18,859
If I recall, wasn't there a conversation that if there was a meeting, you did not want to attend it?

66
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:21,581
I certainly would never have said that I didn't want to attend a meeting.

67
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:27,699
I guess I had some recollection of when we were discussing the possibility of attending a meeting that you didn't want to attend.

68
01:10:28,179 --> 01:10:34,661
I didn't think the meeting was appropriate but I certainly would have attended any meeting I was invited to as I always have.

69
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:36,041
Hmm, I think that's.

70
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:44,945
Yeah, I guess I don't recall it quite that way but it's okay for if folks want to vote to have, I think failure to notify us a little bit.

71
01:10:47,318 --> 01:10:51,220
harsh language, I guess we did notify you did not have internet access, so.

72
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,701
No internet access.

73
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:53,921
Yeah, no internet access.

74
01:10:53,982 --> 01:10:55,082
I'm not okay with that.

75
01:10:55,202 --> 01:10:57,944
I've made a motion to amend them to say failure to notify.

76
01:10:57,964 --> 01:10:59,384
If there's no second, then.

77
01:10:59,664 --> 01:11:00,025
Second.

78
01:11:11,971 --> 01:11:15,633
Motion by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

79
01:11:17,987 --> 01:11:18,567
Roll call vote.

80
01:11:19,088 --> 01:11:19,608
Member Graham?

81
01:11:19,848 --> 01:11:20,069
Yes.

82
01:11:20,829 --> 01:11:21,329
Member Hayes?

83
01:11:23,531 --> 01:11:23,751
Yes.

84
01:11:25,873 --> 01:11:26,093
Yes.

85
01:11:27,474 --> 01:11:28,134
Member McLaughlin?

86
01:11:28,695 --> 01:11:28,895
No.

87
01:11:29,736 --> 01:11:30,376
Member McStone?

88
01:11:30,596 --> 01:11:30,756
Yes.

89
01:11:31,877 --> 01:11:32,378
Member Rossell?

90
01:11:32,398 --> 01:11:32,618
Yes.

91
01:11:32,678 --> 01:11:33,418
Mayor Longo?

92
01:11:34,659 --> 01:11:34,839
Yes.

93
01:11:34,899 --> 01:11:36,501
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

94
01:11:37,161 --> 01:11:38,022
Motion passes.

95
01:11:38,202 --> 01:11:39,663
Is there a motion for approval of the minutes?

96
01:11:41,044 --> 01:11:41,784
I have one more question.

97
01:11:41,844 --> 01:11:42,205
I'm sorry.

98
01:11:43,283 --> 01:11:49,528
I'm reading the minutes, since this is the first time, aware of the meeting, I mean I was aware that there was a meeting while I was away, but

99
01:11:51,860 --> 01:12:00,647
I'm reading it and there's a lot of like there's all these motions with no language that says what the motion was there's like motion to accept what was perhaps talked about.

100
01:12:01,287 --> 01:12:06,431
I just don't know how anybody can take action off of these minutes without actual language saying what was approved.

101
01:12:06,752 --> 01:12:09,574
So, this is a comment I, I wasn't there.

102
01:12:10,214 --> 01:12:13,337
I'm assuming when it says motion to accept changes.

103
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:24,658
that there were really changes, but reading through the minutes, I don't think anybody who wasn't present could reasonably know what it was was being asked to happen and by whom.

104
01:12:25,438 --> 01:12:33,365
So those are comments on the minutes, but I would still vote to approve them because there's nothing being asked to happen here as far as I can tell.

105
01:12:40,811 --> 01:12:42,132
So did you make a motion to approve them?

106
01:12:42,933 --> 01:12:43,153
Sure.

107
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:48,712
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by... Second, Member McLaughlin.

108
01:12:48,812 --> 01:12:49,532
All those in favor?

109
01:12:49,552 --> 01:12:50,132
Aye.

110
01:12:50,352 --> 01:12:51,052
All those opposed?

111
01:12:51,673 --> 01:12:52,573
Minutes are approved.

112
01:12:53,233 --> 01:12:55,473
We have no reports of subcommittee.

113
01:12:55,493 --> 01:13:05,095
And then there's a motion for suspension of the rules by Member Kretz to take out of number six, which are reports of the superintendent.

114
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:08,216
Number four, request for approval for trip to France.

115
01:13:08,976 --> 01:13:12,997
Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment and Innovation.

116
01:13:13,547 --> 01:13:15,828
and world language teacher, Marie Nyland.

117
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:26,075
Good evening.

118
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:34,460
Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

119
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:40,003
I'd like to take a moment to say that you'll remember at the start of the pandemic

120
01:13:40,746 --> 01:13:48,247
And I think it was either January or February, one of the first things that the district did was to cease any international travel.

121
01:13:48,347 --> 01:13:52,888
This was prior to the statewide and nationwide closure of schools.

122
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:58,609
And one of the things that we did, we had 39 students who were going to be traveling to Europe.

123
01:13:59,489 --> 01:14:01,150
We suspended that trip.

124
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:06,711
We're able to secure students money back and in large part.

125
01:14:07,171 --> 01:14:09,011
And we are here tonight

126
01:14:10,232 --> 01:14:17,719
for these two phenomenal members of our staff to request approval to start that process for a trip this April.

127
01:14:18,519 --> 01:14:23,925
And I will turn it over to Miss Bebo and Miss Nyland to go through the further details.

128
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:24,425
Thank you.

129
01:14:26,787 --> 01:14:28,749
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

130
01:14:28,769 --> 01:14:29,510
How are you?

131
01:14:30,214 --> 01:14:31,235
So long, I was here.

132
01:14:32,516 --> 01:14:34,017
Basically, I'm gonna do the same story.

133
01:14:34,098 --> 01:14:48,550
I'm gonna ask for your vote for Medford High School world language students to go on a trip on April 2023 during the April vacation.

134
01:14:52,745 --> 01:14:55,347
Okay, so let me see.

135
01:14:55,367 --> 01:15:00,430
We're gonna be working with the same company, which was Travel by Design.

136
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:05,433
I think you all got the itinerary and the insurance.

137
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:14,321
wording that I had given to Mr. Cushing, and he read it, and it looks like everything is good with that.

138
01:15:15,481 --> 01:15:18,662
So basically, yeah, we haven't advertised it yet.

139
01:15:18,762 --> 01:15:34,488
However, I am teaching a level four French class this year, and since they were my level one French students, I kind of promised them we were gonna have this trip when they were seniors, and they're seniors this year.

140
01:15:35,519 --> 01:15:39,465
Like Mr. Cushing was saying, we had to cancel the last one.

141
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:41,427
We had 39 seniors going.

142
01:15:41,487 --> 01:15:42,309
It was phenomenal.

143
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:44,992
We were working with the same company.

144
01:15:45,032 --> 01:15:48,557
They did get all their money back except the $100, which was the airline.

145
01:15:49,142 --> 01:15:51,344
a deposit that they had put.

146
01:15:51,785 --> 01:15:58,791
So basically this year, it's the exact same thing, because I'm working with Travel by Design, same person, Giuseppe Tarzia.

147
01:15:59,172 --> 01:16:00,012
We love him.

148
01:16:00,113 --> 01:16:01,274
He's fantastic.

149
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,836
And it's the same price.

150
01:16:03,956 --> 01:16:06,078
It looks like the price hasn't gone up.

151
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:12,985
So on your itinerary, in the last page, you'll see the price range.

152
01:16:14,642 --> 01:16:22,267
Now, the only difference this year, well, 2023, is that we want to limit the numbers to about 25 to 30.

153
01:16:23,347 --> 01:16:31,972
30 would be like on the high end, and it would be an exception to somebody who really, really wants to go and is a senior, and this will be their last chance to go.

154
01:16:31,992 --> 01:16:34,634
And then we'll put them on the list.

155
01:16:34,954 --> 01:16:38,256
But 25, 26 is, I think, the max we're going to go with.

156
01:16:39,008 --> 01:16:41,930
this coming trip.

157
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:44,631
The chaperones are six to one.

158
01:16:44,832 --> 01:16:45,952
That's why I love this company.

159
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:48,654
I actually have worked with the Education Foundation.

160
01:16:48,674 --> 01:16:49,914
There's a lot of travel companies.

161
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:52,936
Giuseppe here does such a great job, six to one.

162
01:16:53,477 --> 01:16:59,280
So if we have 25, I think he'll, no, well, it's four, but I think he'll throw in the five.

163
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,568
the fifth one for free, fifth chaperones for free.

164
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:04,928
We usually ask an administrator to join us.

165
01:17:05,408 --> 01:17:14,571
And then we ask the world language teachers so they can have a chance to go and then we'll take it from there.

166
01:17:14,611 --> 01:17:20,492
Then we usually ask the history teachers because they know their history and France and all that great stuff.

167
01:17:22,073 --> 01:17:22,993
Let me see, what else?

168
01:17:23,073 --> 01:17:24,653
So insurance.

169
01:17:25,533 --> 01:17:27,474
Yeah, so the last time, of course,

170
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:30,889
Hopefully there's another pandemic, who knows, right?

171
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:33,871
In April, but please know, right?

172
01:17:34,031 --> 01:17:40,636
So we have this form here, which is extra insurance that most of the families took.

173
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,959
It's an extra $100 and this covers everything.

174
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:54,647
So a natural disaster, God forbid, a death in the family of the traveler, they get their full money back, except that $100 again, that's the airlines.

175
01:17:55,148 --> 01:17:56,592
Okay, so that's good to know.

176
01:17:56,952 --> 01:17:57,875
They'll have to do that.

177
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:01,363
We have, you know, the itinerary is right there.

178
01:18:01,383 --> 01:18:02,225
Is there any questions?

179
01:18:03,353 --> 01:18:08,737
Before people says something to Yes, thank you.

180
01:18:09,777 --> 01:18:13,440
So I just wanted to.

181
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:21,945
First, thank you so much for styling I wanted to just formally announced that Miss bill motherbo is our coordinator of world language.

182
01:18:22,446 --> 01:18:23,546
And we are so happy.

183
01:18:24,987 --> 01:18:27,869
We are so happy to have you on board this year.

184
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:33,447
supporting world language programming.

185
01:18:33,487 --> 01:18:41,770
So I just wanted to say congratulations and welcome and thank you for taking on that challenge to support world languages at the high school.

186
01:18:42,491 --> 01:18:50,594
And so I want to make sure that I will do something again, we'll be introducing and announcing more of the new administrators this year.

187
01:18:51,074 --> 01:18:53,875
But while you were here today, I didn't want to miss that opportunity.

188
01:18:54,655 --> 01:19:00,482
And I also just wanted to share how excited I was about that yellow form.

189
01:19:00,962 --> 01:19:06,348
When Miss nylon was like now it's the $100, because it was very stressful.

190
01:19:07,729 --> 01:19:09,851
When we had to cancel that trip.

191
01:19:10,732 --> 01:19:17,857
And it was a lot of students, a lot of money that families sacrificed and the kids worked and saved.

192
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:20,639
And then the pandemic had started.

193
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:31,446
So, thankfully now we have the insurance in place and I look forward to offering our students more expeditionary learning opportunities.

194
01:19:32,706 --> 01:19:34,187
all over the world when possible.

195
01:19:35,447 --> 01:19:49,913
I'm not sure, Miss Nyland, did you say, or did you share with the committee yet, if you're not able to get 25 students that are in the French program that want to attend, what do you do then with the remaining seats?

196
01:19:50,313 --> 01:19:50,593
Correct.

197
01:19:50,933 --> 01:19:54,615
So we start by advertising to the French

198
01:19:55,345 --> 01:20:02,412
language students who are taking French at the high school, and we reach out to sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

199
01:20:03,253 --> 01:20:10,120
Freshmen, not yet, they have to be sophomores, so we're not gonna bring any freshmen at this time.

200
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:10,981
So we reach out to them.

201
01:20:11,021 --> 01:20:18,568
We have about, how many in the French department, about total, like sophomores, juniors,

202
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:23,728
80, 80, 90.

203
01:20:22,048 --> 01:20:23,728
So we keep it open for them.

204
01:20:23,748 --> 01:20:26,089
They get priority for about two weeks.

205
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:31,972
And then if the numbers are not coming in, we reach out to all the world language students.

206
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:34,813
So that would be the Italian students and the Spanish students.

207
01:20:35,473 --> 01:20:38,214
And it happens.

208
01:20:38,235 --> 01:20:39,455
25 comes quickly.

209
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:42,176
I mean, and that's why we got to 39 the last time.

210
01:20:42,196 --> 01:20:44,737
I literally could not have, I couldn't send kids away.

211
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,218
And they were all seniors.

212
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:47,358
This was going to be their senior trip.

213
01:20:47,378 --> 01:20:48,459
You know how they go on a senior trip.

214
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:51,282
to go to France on their senior trip.

215
01:20:51,422 --> 01:20:52,983
How great is that with us?

216
01:20:54,364 --> 01:20:56,825
So we couldn't say no, so the number was really up there.

217
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:02,048
And we had all the chaperones lined up anyway, and they were awesome chaperones.

218
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,109
I think we had like eight chaperones coming with us.

219
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,071
And then of course we have to cancel everything.

220
01:21:06,351 --> 01:21:11,614
So that's, I think, the process on how we recruit or the list.

221
01:21:12,394 --> 01:21:12,955
That's wonderful.

222
01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:14,095
Exciting.

223
01:21:14,676 --> 01:21:16,997
If there's no questions, is there a motion for approval?

224
01:21:17,878 --> 01:21:18,318
Member Graham?

225
01:21:19,889 --> 01:21:20,329
Thank you.

226
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:37,888
Um, I'm so excited to see these trips returning, and thank you for taking the time to organize, I just had a couple of questions about the insurance, so I think what I'm understanding is that, in general, the cancellation policy

227
01:21:38,912 --> 01:21:42,975
is 60 to 31 days, you get half of your package back.

228
01:21:44,016 --> 01:21:51,682
20 to 15 days, you get 75%, or sorry, you get a penalty of 75%, meaning you'd get 25% back.

229
01:21:52,482 --> 01:21:56,846
And then zero to 14 days, you don't get anything back on land.

230
01:21:57,366 --> 01:22:04,871
But then if you have canceled for any reason, you can get up to 75% back, is that correct?

231
01:22:08,561 --> 01:22:19,309
Like, I'm just trying to make sure I understand like what this is, because it actually doesn't seem that different than what we were grappling with, like right before the pandemic, where the students were essentially getting nothing back.

232
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:27,054
And I was just curious if the insurance had evolved at all since then, given like, you know, the last two and a half years.

233
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:36,541
And I think the other important thing that I think I just wanna make sure I'm clear about is that airfare is not covered by this insurance.

234
01:22:36,721 --> 01:22:37,442
Is that correct?

235
01:22:39,861 --> 01:22:44,924
The airfare, it is, except for the $100, right?

236
01:22:44,944 --> 01:22:52,247
Remember, they did get all the money back except for minus 100, that's it, which was a deposit for the airline at that time.

237
01:22:54,148 --> 01:22:55,849
I don't think that's what this says, though.

238
01:22:55,869 --> 01:23:00,211
Okay, so you see how there's two reasons?

239
01:23:00,751 --> 01:23:08,535
So if there's a death in the family or a natural disaster,

240
01:23:09,505 --> 01:23:11,446
they're going to get the full amount back.

241
01:23:12,347 --> 01:23:18,650
If for any reason, like anxiety, or they get cold feet, then this amount applies.

242
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:23,673
Where, you know, 14 to zero days, you see what you're seeing on that on that one?

243
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:31,637
Okay, if you read it says option is highly recommended for protection from trip cancellations due to anxiety, or such a sensitivity of travel.

244
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:34,609
That's where this is gonna apply.

245
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:41,972
But if there's like a natural disaster, like we had, I made it very clear with Giuseppe, they're getting all their money back.

246
01:23:43,292 --> 01:23:44,072
Do you see what I'm saying?

247
01:23:44,993 --> 01:23:58,557
Okay, so this form governs what happens if you cancel for any reason, which is in addition to getting your money back for like the other reasons that are listed.

248
01:24:00,051 --> 01:24:02,473
in the details of this, is that correct?

249
01:24:03,134 --> 01:24:11,300
Correct, but the reasons that you get your full money back has to be natural disasters or death in the family, but you cannot travel.

250
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:20,567
But if you just don't wanna go because you changed your mind and you have anxiety for traveling, you're not getting your money back.

251
01:24:22,869 --> 01:24:23,470
See what I'm saying?

252
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:28,734
Okay, and airfare is or isn't included.

253
01:24:29,392 --> 01:24:30,052
in the refund?

254
01:24:31,072 --> 01:24:31,993
Good question.

255
01:24:32,013 --> 01:24:33,493
I can let you know.

256
01:24:33,513 --> 01:24:34,173
Okay.

257
01:24:35,073 --> 01:24:36,974
I just wanna make sure people are clear.

258
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:42,975
For natural disaster and death in the family, the airfare, yes, it is included.

259
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:43,535
Okay.

260
01:24:43,595 --> 01:24:44,236
It's included.

261
01:24:45,156 --> 01:24:52,177
And for cancel for any reason, if you take the insurance and you cancel, is your airfare refunded to you?

262
01:24:56,738 --> 01:24:57,699
I'm trying to read this.

263
01:25:01,161 --> 01:25:04,342
I'm not going to answer that yet because I don't want to give you the wrong answer.

264
01:25:04,382 --> 01:25:19,304
Yeah, I just want to make sure that I think this is like there's a lot of information here and I just want to make sure that we're explaining it to families so we're not relying on them to read this like 20 page like fine print insurance policy because I don't think that they will.

265
01:25:19,344 --> 01:25:23,145
And I think there were a lot of families that were really, really, really surprised.

266
01:25:24,345 --> 01:25:28,786
And I know it all worked out financially OK when we had to cancel that trip, but.

267
01:25:30,259 --> 01:25:35,562
It was sort of heartbreaking to listen to students who thought they were going to lose a lot of money and just the issue.

268
01:25:35,962 --> 01:25:36,543
Just real quick.

269
01:25:36,563 --> 01:25:42,706
The issue at that time with those trips was that there had not been a federal declaration.

270
01:25:42,786 --> 01:25:44,447
There is not that state declaration.

271
01:25:44,567 --> 01:25:51,891
It was the Medford public schools is making travel at this time, not something we're going to do.

272
01:25:52,392 --> 01:25:54,393
So that's where we were at that crossroads.

273
01:25:54,833 --> 01:26:04,217
Once those declarations came forward from the federal government, from the state government, that then triggered these clauses of natural disaster and things of that nature.

274
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:05,158
Okay.

275
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:09,880
And each family will get the insurance policy.

276
01:26:10,222 --> 01:26:18,224
Yes, I was just going to add, if you allow me, that when we present this to families, we make sure that we are very clear on the distinction that Ms.

277
01:26:18,264 --> 01:26:31,366
Nyland just provided you, meaning the distinction between the cancellation, of course, for natural disaster or death in a family versus if a child decide then not to travel anymore for personal reason.

278
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:36,247
We're going to make sure that we have those distinction clear with the family members.

279
01:26:36,387 --> 01:26:36,707
Perfect.

280
01:26:36,767 --> 01:26:37,328
Thank you.

281
01:26:37,368 --> 01:26:38,028
Member Russo?

282
01:26:38,688 --> 01:26:39,008
Thank you.

283
01:26:42,001 --> 01:26:53,664
So if a student tests positive for COVID in the morning that they're leaving, this policy, according to its own little notes at the bottom, has not been updated since July 1 of 2015.

284
01:26:53,784 --> 01:26:59,506
So definitely, they didn't update it specific for COVID, which I guess is fine.

285
01:27:00,106 --> 01:27:07,308
But I'm assuming that if the FAA still requires tests, do they require testing anymore, or is it just a free-for-all on planes?

286
01:27:09,608 --> 01:27:12,589
They do not require us to France might well require a test.

287
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:14,850
And I know that again, who knows?

288
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:15,450
Right.

289
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:16,010
Yeah.

290
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:21,371
But so if they test positive the morning of because they test positive a week before, it's not really relevant.

291
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:22,232
Correct.

292
01:27:22,652 --> 01:27:27,953
Are they just out the whole cost because they can't get on the plane because France decides that it's not accepting Americans who won't?

293
01:27:29,694 --> 01:27:32,975
Well, they shouldn't get on the plane, right?

294
01:27:33,095 --> 01:27:34,095
If France let them in.

295
01:27:35,406 --> 01:27:42,030
I'm just worried about that because it seemed, I mean, more and more people I know now have COVID than I feel like at any point in the pandemic all at once.

296
01:27:43,311 --> 01:27:51,036
And, you know, it's not a puddle jump to Provincetown or something, it's a long flight to be sitting with a bunch of other people if you have COVID.

297
01:27:51,756 --> 01:27:55,719
It's also not, in my opinion, appropriate to ask our students to

298
01:27:56,599 --> 01:28:13,455
make that decision it needs to be clear ahead of time what they will do in that case and then that I know you don't have an answer to all that right now but this, this seems to imply that there are two different policies, there's the cancel for any reason, and then the optional cancel for any reason.

299
01:28:14,116 --> 01:28:17,920
The second one, which is the more expensive and that's the one that's $100 or is the first one $100.

300
01:28:24,385 --> 01:28:36,418
So, so, so the first one is included and then if you want extra you see how up on top where it says and charge $100 for optional see far insurance you see the first I did.

301
01:28:36,658 --> 01:28:36,818
Yep.

302
01:28:36,938 --> 01:28:37,259
Thank you.

303
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:44,226
So, um, I guess until we have an answer on the student who test positive for code but the day before the morning of.

304
01:28:46,232 --> 01:28:49,555
I'm, I'm a little uncomfortable with just one part of this.

305
01:28:50,015 --> 01:28:58,181
If, if the optional cancel for anything covers a student who tests positive the morning of the first flight.

306
01:29:00,002 --> 01:29:04,886
I feel like maybe we should make it a policy this year that people have to pony up the hundred dollars.

307
01:29:05,444 --> 01:29:07,945
If it doesn't cover that scenario, then there's no point.

308
01:29:09,265 --> 01:29:16,767
But I just know that students who test positive and their families and some students who work part-time jobs for a long time for this.

309
01:29:17,447 --> 01:29:24,569
If the whole trip goes out the window the morning of because they have COVID and the policy says they get nothing back.

310
01:29:25,589 --> 01:29:28,551
we all know the way they'll be standing the following Monday.

311
01:29:28,912 --> 01:29:33,715
I would be there as a parent, even if I didn't expect any results.

312
01:29:34,276 --> 01:29:50,969
So I just feel like if for $100, if we can make sure that people testing positive only a couple of months, a few months from now, are gonna get something back, I would be open to that as a member, making that a requirement for this year.

313
01:29:51,329 --> 01:29:53,871
But without knowing that, I don't know how to proceed with that.

314
01:29:55,598 --> 01:29:56,219
Member Hayes.

315
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:09,807
Yeah, I just wanted to point out, and maybe you still want like hard and fast COVID counts, but on page three under coverages, it does talk about medically imposed restrictions being covered.

316
01:30:10,327 --> 01:30:13,349
So I would assume that would be a medically imposed restriction.

317
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:17,152
It's number two under coverage.

318
01:30:20,514 --> 01:30:23,015
There's lots of number twos.

319
01:30:23,216 --> 01:30:23,776
2A, yep.

320
01:30:25,285 --> 01:30:30,692
Your, your family members, traveling companions or business partners that was sickness or injury.

321
01:30:35,599 --> 01:30:38,002
I guess there's man.

322
01:30:38,223 --> 01:30:40,466
Remember, so thank you.

323
01:30:41,126 --> 01:30:42,188
That's great to see.

324
01:30:43,868 --> 01:30:46,909
The issue of course is medically imposed restrictions.

325
01:30:46,949 --> 01:30:47,849
So if the U.S.

326
01:30:49,009 --> 01:30:54,211
doesn't mind if people with COVID get on planes and France does, this is a U.S.

327
01:30:54,271 --> 01:30:55,151
based policy.

328
01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:58,792
Are they going to be like, wow, we're fine with you getting on a plane.

329
01:31:00,052 --> 01:31:01,333
It's where you land, it doesn't.

330
01:31:01,553 --> 01:31:07,954
So I feel like this is the kind of question that definitely has probably been asked so far during the pandemic.

331
01:31:09,315 --> 01:31:10,375
I don't have answers though.

332
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:15,670
Mayor.

333
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:17,031
Member Graham.

334
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:18,451
Can I just make a suggestion?

335
01:31:18,491 --> 01:31:41,540
I think I would like to make a motion that we approve this field trip contingent on our legal counsel doing a review of this insurance policy and ensuring that the way this is explained to parents is in compliance with the weeds of this insurance policy so that parents know precisely what the policy will and won't cover

336
01:31:43,189 --> 01:31:45,830
in general, but also specific to COVID scenarios.

337
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:50,491
Motion for approval as amended, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

338
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:51,891
All those in favor?

339
01:31:51,911 --> 01:31:53,011
Aye.

340
01:31:53,051 --> 01:31:53,791
All those opposed?

341
01:31:54,432 --> 01:31:55,212
Motion passes.

342
01:31:55,632 --> 01:31:56,052
Thank you.

343
01:31:56,292 --> 01:31:57,712
Have fun.

344
01:31:57,952 --> 01:31:59,593
Thank you.

345
01:31:59,613 --> 01:32:00,333
Happy signups.

346
01:32:01,273 --> 01:32:07,054
Motion to revert back to the regular order of business by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kretz.

347
01:32:07,274 --> 01:32:08,054
All those in favor?

348
01:32:08,635 --> 01:32:09,455
All those opposed?

349
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:10,455
We have our

350
01:32:11,365 --> 01:32:15,146
Superintendents updates and comments Dr Maurice Edward Vincent.

351
01:32:20,728 --> 01:32:21,348
Good evening.

352
01:32:24,449 --> 01:32:25,810
The method public schools.

353
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:31,532
We have begun to host curriculum and meet the teacher information nights at all of our schools.

354
01:32:34,226 --> 01:32:41,231
This past week, both middle schools, the McGlynn Middle and the Andrews Middle School held their events.

355
01:32:43,493 --> 01:32:49,598
The McGlynn Elementary School and the Brooks Elementary School also welcomed parents and caregivers.

356
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:59,242
This week, the Missittuck Elementary School will be holding theirs on Thursday the 22nd from 530 to 730 p.m.

357
01:32:59,862 --> 01:33:06,930
and next week, the Roberts Elementary School and Medford High School will be holding their events on September 29th.

358
01:33:09,085 --> 01:33:26,009
It is critical and important, very important that parents and caregivers can put names to faces and feel the ability or want to be as actively an active participant in the child's educational success this year.

359
01:33:27,469 --> 01:33:31,910
Also, we are very happy just to have the opportunity for parents to come in person.

360
01:33:34,998 --> 01:33:38,523
once again get back to running schools in a normal way.

361
01:33:39,024 --> 01:33:45,914
So thank you and I hope as many parents as possible come to support curriculum nights and meet the teacher nights.

362
01:33:48,021 --> 01:34:00,763
Yesterday, I want to applaud Mustang alum, Mr. Dave McGillivray, who directs the Boston Marathon for hosting the successful inaugural Run Medford event yesterday.

363
01:34:00,783 --> 01:34:08,044
A number of our school PTOs were able to raise funds as runners and walkers.

364
01:34:10,005 --> 01:34:16,246
All ages throughout the district and the community were able to enjoy this beautiful and historic race day.

365
01:34:17,106 --> 01:34:23,753
Our own Mayor Brianna Rungelkorn was just one of the hundreds of runners who participated yesterday.

366
01:34:23,773 --> 01:34:29,298
And I don't know Mayor, you were sharing that you ran a very fast mile.

367
01:34:29,338 --> 01:34:30,579
Do you want to tell us that number?

368
01:34:30,599 --> 01:34:34,543
No, I just want to say how sorry I am.

369
01:34:35,784 --> 01:34:37,226
Anyway, it was a beautiful event.

370
01:34:37,326 --> 01:34:39,248
I know you did it in under six minutes.

371
01:34:41,525 --> 01:34:42,946
Six minutes and 50 seconds.

372
01:34:42,966 --> 01:34:46,067
So that's fabulous, fabulous.

373
01:34:47,147 --> 01:34:54,930
So thank you to our Mustang alum, Mr. Dave McGillivray for bringing such a wonderful event to Medford.

374
01:34:56,471 --> 01:35:09,934
I also want to wish and thank our HELLO students at Tufts University for reaching out to partner with McGlynn Middle School to provide an afterschool program on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

375
01:35:10,934 --> 01:35:24,177
This student-run organization was designed by the HELLO Community Action Partners, a social justice initiative to provide direct community action to students in both Medford and Somerville.

376
01:35:25,177 --> 01:35:32,882
On Tuesdays, Hillel presents engineering activities, and on Thursdays, it presents art activities.

377
01:35:33,763 --> 01:35:40,267
Both days, the Hillel students will also offer tutoring and homework support for our students.

378
01:35:41,388 --> 01:35:46,451
The program will begin tomorrow and will run weekly until December 9th.

379
01:35:48,933 --> 01:35:54,417
I also would like to express a very special thanks to Mr. Anthony Petrellis,

380
01:35:55,731 --> 01:36:02,716
He's a grade five teacher at the McGlynn Elementary School, and he hosts Beyond the Podcast.

381
01:36:04,418 --> 01:36:12,304
He hosted a cornhole tournament at John Brewer's Tavern to raise funds for autism message boards.

382
01:36:13,576 --> 01:36:28,148
Anthony works collaboratively with the Doug Flutie Junior Foundation for autism, and was able to raise enough funding to be able to purchase three more autism boards for our remaining elementary school playgrounds.

383
01:36:28,869 --> 01:36:31,852
The McGlynn, the Brooks, and the Missituck.

384
01:36:32,632 --> 01:36:36,315
Last year, one was placed at the Roberts Elementary School.

385
01:36:37,276 --> 01:36:44,618
Our partnership with the Flutie Foundation enables our students affected by autism to live life to the fullest.

386
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:53,801
Thank you, Anthony and the Flutie Foundation for your dedication to helping all our students better communicate with our teachers and staff.

387
01:36:56,082 --> 01:37:04,865
I also want to share that currently the Medford Family Network is in the process of collecting new or gently used Halloween costumes.

388
01:37:05,526 --> 01:37:08,128
for infants and children up to the age of eight.

389
01:37:08,829 --> 01:37:11,711
Donations can be dropped off at the MFN office.

390
01:37:14,374 --> 01:37:22,380
Also on September 15th, that marked the beginning of National Hispanic Heritage Month.

391
01:37:22,981 --> 01:37:24,542
It runs until October 15th.

392
01:37:26,092 --> 01:37:35,076
It is an annual celebration of the history and culture of the United States, Latinx and Hispanic communities who have enriched our country.

393
01:37:36,236 --> 01:37:40,618
This year's theme is inclusivity for a stronger nation.

394
01:37:41,598 --> 01:37:50,062
To encourage that all voices are represented and welcomed to help build stronger communities, including ours here in Medford.

395
01:37:52,751 --> 01:38:00,560
Also, on an athletic front, our middle school teams, they will begin their GBL competitions this week.

396
01:38:02,122 --> 01:38:07,528
The fall middle school sports teams are baseball, softball, and cross country.

397
01:38:10,111 --> 01:38:11,672
A few key upcoming events.

398
01:38:12,827 --> 01:38:22,400
This Wednesday, September 21st, the Medford Vocational Technical High School cordially invites you to the dedication of their memorial garden.

399
01:38:23,161 --> 01:38:29,029
The ceremony will take place at 2.50 in the Vocational High School Courtyard.

400
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:42,248
On Saturday, September 24th, this Saturday, the Mustang Band and Color Guard will be hosting the New England Scholastic Band Associations competition.

401
01:38:43,547 --> 01:38:46,909
This event will begin at 4pm at Hormel Stadium.

402
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:51,373
There will be 11 other high schools that will be competing.

403
01:38:52,634 --> 01:38:54,755
Our students have been practicing really hard.

404
01:38:55,015 --> 01:38:57,317
It's really a fun family event.

405
01:38:58,058 --> 01:39:00,159
And I believe it's about $10 a ticket.

406
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:03,659
and there will be concessions.

407
01:39:03,739 --> 01:39:06,902
So it's a big fundraiser for our band as well.

408
01:39:07,402 --> 01:39:14,769
So I hope you're able to come out and support the New England Scholastic Band event this Saturday at Hormel.

409
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:28,661
On Monday, September 26th, there will be no school as we wish all of our Jewish students, staff, and families a happy and healthy new year.

410
01:39:31,545 --> 01:39:36,548
On Wednesday, September 28, please mark your calendars.

411
01:39:37,689 --> 01:39:48,777
The city's Board of Health will be offering the Omicron booster, which is the new one that just came out, from 3 to 6pm at the Council on Aging.

412
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:52,059
Please register on the city's website.

413
01:39:56,676 --> 01:40:02,840
As I mentioned, next Thursday will be both the high school and the Roberts Elementary Schools back to school nights.

414
01:40:05,182 --> 01:40:07,884
At the Roberts, they do have a schedule 515 to 745 p.m.

415
01:40:07,904 --> 01:40:11,426
Grades four and five are 515 to six.

416
01:40:11,587 --> 01:40:14,088
Grades K and one, 610 to 655.

417
01:40:14,148 --> 01:40:15,649
Grades two and three, seven to 745 p.m.

418
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:32,918
In closing, I would like to share two quotes with you.

419
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,303
The first one is in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month.

420
01:40:39,944 --> 01:40:45,749
I will quote Lin-Manuel Miranda, the American actor, singer, producer, and playwright.

421
01:40:47,731 --> 01:40:51,794
The fun for me in collaboration is working with other people.

422
01:40:52,815 --> 01:40:54,196
It just makes you smarter.

423
01:40:54,997 --> 01:40:55,658
That's proven.

424
01:40:57,315 --> 01:41:05,302
Collaboration has always been an important part of both my leadership and educational platforms, and I will continue to do so.

425
01:41:07,143 --> 01:41:16,090
Lastly, Queen Elizabeth II was laid to rest today after an unprecedented 70-year reign.

426
01:41:17,351 --> 01:41:25,098
For a long time, the Queen was one of very few women leading at a time when our world was very male-dominated.

427
01:41:26,491 --> 01:41:48,327
She once said, and I find this fitting for where we are right now, we may hold different points of view, but it is in times of stress and difficulty that we most need to remember that we have much more in common than there is dividing us.

428
01:41:49,988 --> 01:41:51,109
May she rest in peace.

429
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:51,990
Thank you.

430
01:41:55,353 --> 01:42:00,195
Thank you, Dr. Number two we have superintendents goals for 2022 2023.

431
01:42:00,356 --> 01:42:03,877
I'm going to turn it over to you again.

432
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:06,859
Thank you.

433
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:15,863
So before you, you have my goals proposed goals for school year 2223.

434
01:42:20,603 --> 01:42:27,187
I'll be presenting on three goals the district improvement goal, the student learning goal, and the professional practice goal.

435
01:42:33,553 --> 01:42:43,001
For 2223, the Medford Public Schools will improve the systems and structures that directly impact student services and operations.

436
01:42:43,841 --> 01:42:53,409
Improved outcomes or plans to improve outcomes will be seen in student transportation, communications, and facilities operations.

437
01:42:55,070 --> 01:43:02,877
The goal is to continue maintaining a learning environment built upon the pillars of safety, equity, and consistency,

438
01:43:04,537 --> 01:43:14,304
creating a culture that values consistent communication and creating structures that promote healthy transportation to school.

439
01:43:16,546 --> 01:43:24,912
So one of the things we are proposing to do is to establish modern and accessible bicycle racks at schools.

440
01:43:26,613 --> 01:43:31,957
We would like to leverage partnerships with safe routes to schools for walking school buses,

441
01:43:32,884 --> 01:43:38,307
Bicycle lanes and other options to reduce carbon and promote student welfare.

442
01:43:38,327 --> 01:43:51,074
Three, consistent communication to families across all schools and student services such as athletics, counseling, career services and student governance.

443
01:43:53,280 --> 01:44:03,547
Four, we would like to begin the process for a school bus RFP that examines busing options beyond the MBTA.

444
01:44:03,567 --> 01:44:14,254
We would also like to convene the capital planning committee to examine building systems and create a replacement timeline.

445
01:44:16,021 --> 01:44:23,708
We would like to fully collaborate with MSBA, Massachusetts School Building Authority, to improve facilities and building systems.

446
01:44:25,109 --> 01:44:39,202
Some of the outcomes that we would hope to see by the end of this school year, bicycle racks updated at the middle and high school complexes, walking school bus routes clearly defined,

447
01:44:40,734 --> 01:44:45,881
Bicycle lanes painted on city streets and school access roads.

448
01:44:49,245 --> 01:44:56,995
Looking into purchasing a communication platform that is used regularly by all schools and student servicing groups.

449
01:44:58,755 --> 01:45:04,239
such as talking points, which we have invested in this year, possibly some mores and others.

450
01:45:04,299 --> 01:45:11,585
We're still continuing to research additional communication platforms that can be used consistently across all schools.

451
01:45:13,146 --> 01:45:27,538
We have launched a new website and the hope is in the near future to launch a new district smartphone app, which is connected to the newly updated website.

452
01:45:29,326 --> 01:45:49,586
Also, by the end of the school year to be well on our way with the school bus contract that responds to our student transportation needs and have the capital planning committee review can conduct reviews at each of our schools.

453
01:45:53,843 --> 01:46:02,910
Under my student learning goal, because again student learning goals do take time to see results.

454
01:46:03,971 --> 01:46:08,014
We are still prioritizing early literacy in Medford public schools.

455
01:46:09,475 --> 01:46:13,539
And so as we are working on prioritizing early literacy.

456
01:46:15,239 --> 01:46:28,205
We would like to continue to implement interventions in literacy to improve outcomes for all of our students by deepening teacher and principal knowledge, again, of early literacy practices.

457
01:46:29,285 --> 01:46:38,330
And at the same time, we would like to be maintaining a district-wide focus on instruction and assessment through the continued use of NWEA MAP.

458
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:41,051
Some of the key actions,

459
01:46:42,503 --> 01:46:47,806
We're going to continue to support the development of our early literacy program.

460
01:46:48,747 --> 01:47:02,755
We are continuing to work closely with DESE and following the DESE guidelines, which includes our dyslexia guidance through the implementation of the enhanced core reading instruction program, ECRI.

461
01:47:04,256 --> 01:47:09,940
Continue to provide professional development for our teachers, supporting coaching,

462
01:47:11,414 --> 01:47:18,497
We are continuing our partnership with Hill for Literacy during this school year for 22-23 school year.

463
01:47:20,218 --> 01:47:32,524
And the continued use, this will now, we are coming upon our first year of NWEA MAP, which is again, the Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress.

464
01:47:33,204 --> 01:47:37,146
So we are continuing to use the NWEA MAP assessment.

465
01:47:38,496 --> 01:47:47,623
So for outcomes, we want to see consistent, full implementation of ECRI across all K-2 classrooms within the district.

466
01:47:49,945 --> 01:48:07,318
And we will be able to identify and see that visible implementation of the science of reading, the best practices that are being taught to our teachers during literacy blocks, also through conducting early literacy learning walks district-wide.

467
01:48:08,539 --> 01:48:15,084
And we will be very intentional and strategic about our analysis of data and literacy outcomes.

468
01:48:16,886 --> 01:48:23,171
Looking at progress from the beginning of the year and then looking at our mid year benchmarks and end of the year benchmarks.

469
01:48:25,573 --> 01:48:27,414
Beneath that it says accountability.

470
01:48:27,434 --> 01:48:29,996
And this is new for this year.

471
01:48:30,016 --> 01:48:31,678
And I say that

472
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:43,422
This will be the measurable goal that I would hope at the end of the year, we are able to see our students achieving.

473
01:48:46,303 --> 01:48:51,444
It's an ambitious goal, but my hope is that we will be able to see significant movement.

474
01:48:52,084 --> 01:49:02,887
We would like to see 100% all of our students at the four elementary schools in the aggregate demonstrate growth again,

475
01:49:04,426 --> 01:49:09,431
at the 50th percentile or higher based on the RIT scores.

476
01:49:13,616 --> 01:49:23,966
Now, although this is our early literacy goal, but an additional accountability measure, we would like to see not only at the elementary levels,

477
01:49:25,131 --> 01:49:36,912
Throughout the rest of the district, grades six through 10, 100% of all students in the aggregate demonstrating equal growth at the 50th percentile or higher.

478
01:49:38,993 --> 01:49:50,384
And we would like to see 65% of our students meet or exceed their projected growth targets on the NW EA map assessments.

479
01:49:51,305 --> 01:49:52,426
By the spring of 23.

480
01:49:52,667 --> 01:49:55,389
And so last spring.

481
01:49:58,170 --> 01:50:02,373
a partial presentation on NWEA MAP was presented.

482
01:50:03,033 --> 01:50:09,718
There were other indicators that other pieces of information that needed to be presented as well.

483
01:50:10,298 --> 01:50:16,122
And so right now, schools are still administering the beginning of year assessments.

484
01:50:16,803 --> 01:50:27,590
So when we complete the beginning of year assessments for NWEA MAP this year, we will be presenting to the committee the results of the fall.

485
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:48,017
And looking at the results of last year, and showing a comparison from one year because now we have a full, full year cycle to look at from the beginning of the year last year to how we performed the beginning of the year this year to see what direction our students are moving.

486
01:50:49,099 --> 01:50:55,562
And we are hoping we're very optimistic that we're going to see positive movement continued positive movement and growth.

487
01:50:55,983 --> 01:51:09,170
So I will be presenting that to the committee in the in the coming weeks, once all of that data is available and addressing as many pieces that were on the original request

488
01:51:10,345 --> 01:51:23,194
as many pieces of possible that we are able to present now that we have more data to be able to paint a fuller picture of how NWEA map is in Medford public schools.

489
01:51:25,276 --> 01:51:32,080
At the bottom of that goal I have a small star just showing that the RIT scale is a stable scale.

490
01:51:33,201 --> 01:51:41,591
Similar to feet in inches that accurately measure student performance, regardless of age grades or grade level.

491
01:51:42,753 --> 01:51:48,960
And so this is the information that we will be using my third and final goal.

492
01:51:50,101 --> 01:51:51,742
is my professional practice goal.

493
01:51:53,003 --> 01:51:59,567
And my previous years that I was presenting my professional practice goal.

494
01:52:01,027 --> 01:52:08,712
I always listed this up because I participated in Jesse's new superintendents induction program.

495
01:52:09,292 --> 01:52:16,456
which is where the NSF NSP came from, and I participated in the supplemental programming that they had.

496
01:52:18,117 --> 01:52:23,760
And so now I have transitioned, and I am now participating in leading now.

497
01:52:25,021 --> 01:52:27,682
And I am part of mass ready.

498
01:52:27,702 --> 01:52:46,828
And these are two additional professional development groups, leading now is a national group, and working with superintendents from across the nation, and mass ready is Massachusetts school superintendents that are participating in professional development around.

499
01:52:48,408 --> 01:52:52,412
Racial equity diversity and inclusion so it's referred to as ready.

500
01:52:52,913 --> 01:52:55,515
And so I am actively participating.

501
01:52:56,396 --> 01:52:59,078
I am helping to support and co facilitate.

502
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:09,409
When asked at many of these events, and supporting and mentoring and working with other superintendents.

503
01:53:10,712 --> 01:53:22,032
And I also some of the outcomes that I have listed again continuing to leverage the expertise and collective knowledge of superintendents across the state.

504
01:53:24,564 --> 01:53:47,772
Seeking input and incorporating suggestions from our own NPS race equity task force, leading and learning about ready and providing mentorship, and also continuing to work collaboratively with our Middlesex County DA's office, their anti-bias, anti-hate task force.

505
01:53:48,472 --> 01:53:51,373
And I presented, I was part of a,

506
01:53:51,853 --> 01:53:59,199
panel last week, speaking to the new assistant DAs that have just come on for this first year.

507
01:53:59,659 --> 01:54:01,560
So I am continuing to do that work.

508
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:07,204
And these professional development sessions take place on a monthly basis.

509
01:54:08,485 --> 01:54:09,906
And those are my goals for this year.

510
01:54:10,307 --> 01:54:10,687
Thank you.

511
01:54:12,929 --> 01:54:14,110
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

512
01:54:15,471 --> 01:54:17,252
Any questions of member Rousseau?

513
01:54:17,827 --> 01:54:18,227
Thank you.

514
01:54:18,247 --> 01:54:28,793
I really appreciate these questions, and honestly, maybe it's new or I've just not heard of it the capital planning committee would consist of who exactly.

515
01:54:29,854 --> 01:54:35,917
So, as of right now, it's mostly central office, but we would definitely like to.

516
01:54:37,865 --> 01:54:53,917
Broaden broaden that the capital planning work, and we can work in collaboration with one of the subcommittees I'm sure we can definitely do that but we wanted to at least have the district improvement goal.

517
01:54:54,617 --> 01:54:56,239
be inclusive of.

518
01:54:57,420 --> 01:55:06,507
I'm trying to think of how it was awarded to me the other aspects of the district that aren't always connected to academics and learning but are equally important.

519
01:55:07,148 --> 01:55:11,792
And I would be remiss to say that I have had the opportunity to speak with many members.

520
01:55:12,472 --> 01:55:21,576
and many conversations and received feedback and consult for many of you to help inform these goals.

521
01:55:22,096 --> 01:55:31,121
So I do hope that everyone can kind of see some, a little bit of trying to, their input.

522
01:55:31,681 --> 01:55:37,824
That is my hope and that I will continue to work collaboratively with the committee.

523
01:55:38,364 --> 01:55:39,244
Thank you, Mayor.

524
01:55:41,954 --> 01:55:42,254
Thank you.

525
01:55:42,855 --> 01:56:04,114
So this is the timeline for replacement this is not looking at what we might replace systems with right, because I just want to be sure, like, we don't presently have a policy requiring any new equipment be carbon neutral or not be a carbon based, but if this is just a timeline like this system in this building is going to die in this year, this one's going to die in this year.

526
01:56:05,285 --> 01:56:06,626
This will just lay out a roadmap.

527
01:56:07,107 --> 01:56:17,417
And then at some future date in a dream world when those dates arrive, we would be then talking about how to spend money and what to replace them with right is that.

528
01:56:18,118 --> 01:56:19,279
Yes, that is it.

529
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:23,463
And we also when possible we always work collaboratively.

530
01:56:24,364 --> 01:56:48,895
with Alicia hunt and like consulting with her, like the project, you know for solar panels or just different things like that where she, she will always support us I think there's even some, you know, with the bicycle racks and just trying to do things to enhance the community and be thinking of health and safety.

531
01:56:50,336 --> 01:56:52,037
We definitely would partnership with.

532
01:56:53,397 --> 01:56:58,700
create partnerships with the community and the city for the advancement of the district.

533
01:56:59,080 --> 01:56:59,361
Thank you.

534
01:56:59,381 --> 01:57:01,982
I mean I just replaced my water heater like three or four years ago.

535
01:57:02,628 --> 01:57:05,950
And I got rid of the regular water heater and I got an on-demand water heater.

536
01:57:06,370 --> 01:57:14,354
And the only thing MassAve had at the moment was, maybe it was five years, was a gas-based on-demand water heater, which I got, which is great.

537
01:57:14,534 --> 01:57:16,015
It won't die for 35 years.

538
01:57:16,115 --> 01:57:19,777
But that also means for 35 years, I can't be carbon neutral in my house.

539
01:57:20,337 --> 01:57:27,361
So when we're making decisions along that, it doesn't feel like the superintendent's goals is the place to insert policy like that.

540
01:57:27,721 --> 01:57:29,862
But I just wanted to be clear that this is not about

541
01:57:31,653 --> 01:57:39,796
planning for spending money, because we all know that the carbon free versions will always be more well they'll be more expensive for a long time.

542
01:57:40,256 --> 01:57:42,356
But thank you for clarifying what that means.

543
01:57:43,617 --> 01:57:43,917
Thank you.

544
01:57:45,377 --> 01:57:46,118
Member Graham.

545
01:57:47,458 --> 01:57:53,220
Thank you for this, I had a couple of suggestions and maybe a question so

546
01:57:54,156 --> 01:58:02,080
In the district improvement goal, last year we approved a climate and culture assessment at the middle school and the high school.

547
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:19,448
And it sort of struck me as I was reading through these bullets that when we talk about some of the goals around communication, that that could be really enlightening and informative, especially as you are now in the schools a little bit more prominently than you've been able to be in the past.

548
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:22,209
So one outcome,

549
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:28,903
suggestion that I would have is to have those climate and culture assessments completed in this year.

550
01:58:30,264 --> 01:58:31,265
That was one suggestion.

551
01:58:31,285 --> 01:58:46,475
On the early literacy component, I thought that we were planning to do an evaluation of the literacy curriculum this year.

552
01:58:46,535 --> 01:58:50,198
Is that still the plan for the elementary literacy?

553
01:58:50,925 --> 01:58:55,072
Mr Lucy, can you please come forward to share what the timeline there was.

554
01:58:56,034 --> 01:58:59,420
I don't have the specifics let me ask Mr Lucy, thank you.

555
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:04,919
There we go.

556
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:05,700
Good evening.

557
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:06,661
Yes, we are.

558
01:59:06,701 --> 01:59:11,244
We're going to be using our partnership with Hill for Literacy, the company.

559
01:59:11,304 --> 01:59:21,032
They're going to start in January, and they're going to do what's called a core program review, which means they'll be working with all of the staff in each building.

560
01:59:21,292 --> 01:59:23,794
So everyone will kind of have a hand in that process.

561
01:59:24,214 --> 01:59:29,498
And it should culminate with a selection of a new program by May.

562
01:59:30,839 --> 01:59:31,660
Great, thanks.

563
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:32,741
Yeah, no problem.

564
01:59:32,921 --> 01:59:34,482
So I think that is another, like,

565
01:59:35,189 --> 01:59:44,869
substantive piece of work that's a really well aligned with this literacy goal that you might want to include in the outcomes that that process

566
01:59:46,162 --> 01:59:47,143
gets underway and is completed.

567
01:59:47,843 --> 01:59:51,585
And then I had one question under the accountability.

568
01:59:52,906 --> 01:59:55,468
I did really like that there were some numbers here.

569
01:59:55,508 --> 01:59:56,308
So thank you for that.

570
01:59:57,309 --> 02:00:05,094
One question I had on the last bullet, we say 65% of students will meet or exceed their projected growth targets by spring.

571
02:00:05,594 --> 02:00:08,796
And I just was curious what that number was last year.

572
02:00:09,156 --> 02:00:12,038
So how many did actually meet last year?

573
02:00:13,564 --> 02:00:26,867
So last year, I don't have the hard number because one of the, with the NWEA map, there are a few exceptions that I wanna like share.

574
02:00:27,187 --> 02:00:32,648
One, for example, we are providing the assessment three times a year.

575
02:00:35,048 --> 02:00:37,969
However, in the winter administration,

576
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:46,564
The window of the NW map assessment is the same window of time that our English learners are taking the access test.

577
02:00:47,485 --> 02:00:52,968
So during that window of time we do have students that will not be double tested.

578
02:00:53,769 --> 02:00:58,091
So, we're not going to have 100% complete data, which is why.

579
02:01:02,970 --> 02:01:08,593
We actually had a really rich discussion back at Central on what would be a reasonable number.

580
02:01:09,793 --> 02:01:18,757
So we have, you know, due to test fatigue for some students, so we're not going to like, you know, give them the double whammy.

581
02:01:21,957 --> 02:01:29,963
Also, we have some students that it could be, you know, maybe due to the interventions that they're having or it could be extreme.

582
02:01:31,104 --> 02:01:40,091
Maybe anxiety or distress around assessment taking that we would not want to have this in house assessment.

583
02:01:42,072 --> 02:01:45,757
know, harm them, because we're thinking about the whole child.

584
02:01:45,917 --> 02:01:59,274
We also know that there's mobility that takes place with some of our students, they may start, they could potentially leave or they may come midway through the year and so we don't have beginning of year data.

585
02:02:01,926 --> 02:02:11,230
And so, with all of those pieces we were thinking about how do we show student growth, we know that all students will grow all students will learn.

586
02:02:12,051 --> 02:02:23,936
And so that was where we came up with a conservative number of 65% because we do know that there are some special populations that will not be.

587
02:02:26,906 --> 02:02:27,586
participating.

588
02:02:27,646 --> 02:02:32,987
So last year, we didn't have consistent data across the board.

589
02:02:33,027 --> 02:02:34,728
It was the first time that it was being given.

590
02:02:36,648 --> 02:02:39,509
Some students love taking tests.

591
02:02:39,549 --> 02:02:43,309
They take it as a challenge, and they gave it their all.

592
02:02:43,549 --> 02:02:45,570
It was the first time that it was administered.

593
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:50,191
There were some technical glitches that ended up happening.

594
02:02:50,871 --> 02:02:53,732
And so due to all of those reasons,

595
02:02:55,892 --> 02:03:01,034
We said 65% would be like a reasonable number.

596
02:03:01,574 --> 02:03:12,077
Also there's some information like with the bell curve and, you know, there's a percentage that will maybe not show as much growth, and some that will show significant growth.

597
02:03:12,697 --> 02:03:15,478
And so we were going back and forth but

598
02:03:16,258 --> 02:03:20,580
Trying to say what is a reasonable accountability measure.

599
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:26,963
And so that was where we came up with the 65% being reasonable.

600
02:03:27,823 --> 02:03:30,184
And as we were looking at the data.

601
02:03:33,424 --> 02:03:55,015
there were ebbs and flows, there were some stronger pockets, there were some pockets that we were looking at, but there were so many factors with the pandemic, with kids that were still out, with quarantining, there were just so many factors that we felt like the initial data was a little shaky, it was a first time out, and that this is gonna be the real year.

602
02:03:55,775 --> 02:03:58,017
And so by the end of this year,

603
02:03:59,229 --> 02:04:17,744
we will calculate where we land and we're not sure, like I'm saying 65 and the data could say that it's really 55 or the data could say, you said 65, but actually it's 75%, which would be even more fabulous.

604
02:04:18,284 --> 02:04:24,569
So we're really trying to get as many students assess this year and then use that data

605
02:04:25,370 --> 02:04:27,431
To, you know, propel us to the next level.

606
02:04:27,791 --> 02:04:33,354
So since this is the first time that I was putting an accountability metric.

607
02:04:34,114 --> 02:04:40,957
I really didn't want to say 100% of students are going to meet or exceed, knowing that some students will only take two assessments.

608
02:04:41,617 --> 02:05:01,705
Some students, you know, for whatever reason, where, you know, we're thinking about them, the whole child that we know we have to remove some students from the SS assessment cycle that we said you know we can feel pretty certain that 65% of students that we can probably get 65% of our students to take.

609
02:05:06,217 --> 02:05:11,667
all you know portions of the assessment, and then look at our performance based on that.

610
02:05:12,669 --> 02:05:17,397
Okay, so I, I think as we go forward, like this is really.

611
02:05:18,579 --> 02:05:45,473
somewhat of a uh educated guess at this point because the data last year first year of the use of the tool and the pandemic was just like murky enough that there wasn't a great number there but as we go forward like we'll know at the end of this year like what is the number this year so that next year that number can be more than it is this year so and i think that's what i that was my question was like how can we demonstrate that we are

612
02:05:46,624 --> 02:06:00,494
wanting more than we got last year in relative terms, but it sounds like we can't do that quite yet because the data is murky enough that we need to, we're gonna use the 65 as like a starting point this year and then go from there.

613
02:06:00,794 --> 02:06:15,185
Yes, but the other two bullets, the 100%, based on a presentation that I did in the late spring, we were able to show growth, even though all students didn't grow the same amount,

614
02:06:16,724 --> 02:06:21,969
All students showed growth and the hope is that we will continue to have.

615
02:06:23,798 --> 02:06:26,039
100% growth in the aggregate.

616
02:06:26,119 --> 02:06:31,461
So that is something where I didn't lower it to say 90% or 88%.

617
02:06:31,501 --> 02:06:35,762
We're trying to keep that number as high as possible.

618
02:06:36,122 --> 02:06:40,523
So no matter what your starting point is, you need to show growth by the end of the year.

619
02:06:41,044 --> 02:06:44,525
And so we're pretty confident that we're going to be able to show growth.

620
02:06:45,085 --> 02:06:49,486
And we want to show growth at 50th percentile or higher.

621
02:06:49,506 --> 02:06:49,546
So

622
02:06:52,447 --> 02:07:02,353
we're still going to be, you know, staying very positive and wanting to see us get to that very high number or as close to that number as possible.

623
02:07:03,094 --> 02:07:03,394
Awesome.

624
02:07:03,514 --> 02:07:03,794
Thank you.

625
02:07:03,814 --> 02:07:04,575
Motion to approve.

626
02:07:06,276 --> 02:07:08,337
Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin.

627
02:07:09,158 --> 02:07:10,679
Seconded by- Seconded.

628
02:07:10,899 --> 02:07:11,539
Member Kratz.

629
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:13,821
All those in favor- Can I just ask a question?

630
02:07:14,861 --> 02:07:18,263
Are we, there were a couple of suggestions that were made.

631
02:07:18,343 --> 02:07:20,065
Are we approving as amended or

632
02:07:22,028 --> 02:07:44,447
I wrote it down, I'm gonna, I will revise it, add climate and culture assessment at middle and high school as an outcome under the district improvement goal, and to add Hill for Literacy core program review under key actions, and then the outcomes will be new selected elementary literacy program.

633
02:07:44,927 --> 02:07:48,870
So I will, I wrote it down, I'll make those revisions.

634
02:07:49,331 --> 02:07:50,812
Motion for approval as amended.

635
02:07:51,753 --> 02:07:52,554
All those in favor?

636
02:07:53,014 --> 02:07:53,234
Aye.

637
02:07:53,394 --> 02:07:54,154
All those opposed?

638
02:07:55,375 --> 02:07:56,095
Paper passes.

639
02:07:56,375 --> 02:07:57,516
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

640
02:07:57,676 --> 02:07:58,636
Thank you.

641
02:07:58,896 --> 02:08:03,399
Last up for reports of the superintendent, number three, report on induction and mentoring.

642
02:08:03,959 --> 02:08:04,179
Ms.

643
02:08:04,219 --> 02:08:13,303
Suzanne Galluzzi, Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instructions, and Dr. Bernadette Riccidelli, Director of Professional Learning and Student Assessment.

644
02:08:14,484 --> 02:08:14,784
Welcome.

645
02:08:20,247 --> 02:08:21,127
Good evening.

646
02:08:23,268 --> 02:08:25,849
Okay, I'm just starting with the introductions.

647
02:08:26,289 --> 02:08:30,710
I'm so pleased to be here this evening with Dr. Riccadeli.

648
02:08:33,371 --> 02:08:41,953
She's going to speak this evening to you about our MPS Educator Induction and Mentoring Program.

649
02:08:43,034 --> 02:08:47,875
But I just wanna say that since Dr. Eduard Vincent restructured,

650
02:08:48,508 --> 02:08:57,761
Dr. Riccadeli and I have been working very closely together so that we're aligned in some of this work and I look forward to our partnership moving forward.

651
02:08:58,201 --> 02:09:01,446
So without further ado.

652
02:09:02,426 --> 02:09:06,631
She's going to discuss the program and then I'll just kind of wrap up at the end.

653
02:09:06,871 --> 02:09:07,892
Okay, thank you.

654
02:09:08,132 --> 02:09:09,754
Thank you, Miss Lucy and good evening.

655
02:09:10,835 --> 02:09:14,880
Mail will go current superintendent Edward Vincent and members of the Metro school committee.

656
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:19,245
So I'm pleased to be here tonight to talk about our induction and mentoring program.

657
02:09:19,725 --> 02:09:26,530
which I consider a really important part of our professional learning journey that our teachers go on.

658
02:09:27,090 --> 02:09:28,631
It's where we first meet them.

659
02:09:29,132 --> 02:09:37,157
It's where we first acclimate them to Medford in our system here, in our culture, in our community.

660
02:09:39,078 --> 02:09:42,721
And we've been doing this for a number of years, although the title has changed.

661
02:09:43,221 --> 02:09:45,963
My work in this area has been going on for

662
02:09:48,129 --> 02:09:50,610
since a mentor since the early 2000s.

663
02:09:52,390 --> 02:10:00,872
So our program in Medford is consistent with what the Massachusetts Department of Education is looking for in an induction and mentoring program.

664
02:10:01,752 --> 02:10:12,835
We are required to file reports with them each year, and they actually have yet to ask for it for the last school year.

665
02:10:12,915 --> 02:10:17,436
So I will be filing a report once that request comes through.

666
02:10:19,305 --> 02:10:30,432
So the components of the program that are consistent that I'm going to talk about are the, the first and oriented orientation program for new educators prior to the first week of school.

667
02:10:30,913 --> 02:10:34,015
So I'm not saying teachers here I'm saying educators because this applies

668
02:10:34,895 --> 02:10:43,365
more than just teachers, it applies to counselors and therapists, all of our professional staff.

669
02:10:43,905 --> 02:10:45,527
And later on, as Ms.

670
02:10:45,547 --> 02:10:48,651
Pelosi will talk about, eventually it will cover administrators.

671
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:53,717
There's still a lot of work to be done before that program can be up and running.

672
02:10:56,420 --> 02:11:05,948
So we have organized a robust mentoring program that provides new educators with ongoing peer support commencing prior to the first day of school.

673
02:11:06,828 --> 02:11:13,414
So during that orientation week, many of them have an opportunity to meet with their assigned mentor.

674
02:11:15,475 --> 02:11:21,260
Most of them should, some of them get to meet with their assigned mentor prior to that first week of school.

675
02:11:21,846 --> 02:11:27,728
It's really important that their mentor be introduced to them, and they get to know them as soon as possible.

676
02:11:28,328 --> 02:11:38,751
I think that's where the need is the greatest is when they are when they are brand new program also provides ongoing district provided educational workshops that

677
02:11:39,315 --> 02:11:41,018
that occur throughout the school year.

678
02:11:41,478 --> 02:11:54,277
So in the past we've had a limited number of those workshops, we have expanded the offerings this year to include seven different workshops, beginning September 29, and going through the school year.

679
02:11:54,817 --> 02:11:56,457
to support new teachers.

680
02:11:56,497 --> 02:11:59,498
So we think this is a really positive aspect to our program.

681
02:11:59,958 --> 02:12:03,019
There's only so much that we can do in that orientation week.

682
02:12:03,539 --> 02:12:08,040
So this year long program makes it a more fulfilling experience.

683
02:12:08,700 --> 02:12:16,842
One might argue that all of those topics that we covered throughout the year should be covered in the beginning of the year, but we're limited in that orientation week.

684
02:12:17,522 --> 02:12:22,883
So by the end of the year, we feel that they're getting a pretty full compliment of

685
02:12:24,932 --> 02:12:32,282
of opportunities to reflect, to learn, to grow, and be ready for the next year.

686
02:12:34,212 --> 02:12:43,321
And then lastly, our program provides an opportunity for reflection for participants as a means for program leaders to assess and adjust the needs of our new educators.

687
02:12:43,841 --> 02:12:58,335
So the last meeting of the year that's going to occur in May is gonna be one of those summit meetings where they're gonna give us candid feedback and we're gonna grow and reconstruct a program that is even better than the one we've constructed this year.

688
02:13:01,067 --> 02:13:04,990
All right, so the leadership team for Medford includes Ms.

689
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:10,654
Colussi, me, Donna Lasky is our elementary mentor coordinator.

690
02:13:10,894 --> 02:13:15,698
She is a grade four teacher at the McGlynn elementary school.

691
02:13:16,138 --> 02:13:19,700
She has been a mentor coordinator for the district for about six years.

692
02:13:20,381 --> 02:13:23,683
Prior to this year, she was the mentor coordinator for all of the grades.

693
02:13:24,204 --> 02:13:27,806
And then this year we decided to bring in the secondary mentor coordinator.

694
02:13:28,207 --> 02:13:30,008
And that person is Patricia Killebride,

695
02:13:30,348 --> 02:13:35,191
Patricia is a middle school special education teacher at the McGlynn Middle School.

696
02:13:35,611 --> 02:13:51,741
So Donna and Patricia, Patricia as we call her, were busy, very busy through the month of August, helping plan for the events, planning for the workshops, and connecting new teachers and therapists and counselors with their mentors.

697
02:13:52,401 --> 02:13:58,725
So I think they might be watching tonight, so a big shout out to them because I really do appreciate

698
02:13:59,548 --> 02:14:00,288
Appreciate their help.

699
02:14:03,029 --> 02:14:09,250
So this mentoring leadership team that we have formed, we're engaged in a number of activities.

700
02:14:10,870 --> 02:14:16,031
We select mentors and we run a training program for mentors.

701
02:14:16,131 --> 02:14:23,312
The last mentor training class occurred the winter of 2019 and with COVID we've been delayed.

702
02:14:23,372 --> 02:14:25,793
So the next mentor training program will occur

703
02:14:27,538 --> 02:14:32,521
late fall 2022, early winter 2023.

704
02:14:34,042 --> 02:14:41,485
So we look for nominations from administrators, from building principals, from department administrators.

705
02:14:42,486 --> 02:14:49,849
We look for people who are really interested in being positive and conveying best practice to our newest people.

706
02:14:52,762 --> 02:14:55,823
So we develop and we administer the mentor training program.

707
02:14:55,923 --> 02:14:59,405
As I just said, we develop a system for mentor accountability.

708
02:14:59,585 --> 02:15:08,288
So mentors are required to report their, to log in, I should say, log in their hours that they spend with their assigned mentee or mentees.

709
02:15:08,688 --> 02:15:14,310
In some case, some mentors have more than one person to mentor.

710
02:15:16,737 --> 02:15:21,363
We've come up with the determination of a process for matching and assigning mentors to teachers.

711
02:15:21,963 --> 02:15:33,017
So when we look at what would be the best match, I mean, ideally, it would be the person in the next classroom, it would be the person teaching the same grade, it would be the person teaching the same subject on the high school level.

712
02:15:33,737 --> 02:15:35,098
it'd be the person in the same building.

713
02:15:35,979 --> 02:15:37,580
That's not always possible.

714
02:15:37,640 --> 02:15:40,062
So we try to match as best we can.

715
02:15:40,943 --> 02:15:47,588
Hence the need for another training class to occur because we've lost a few mentors along the way.

716
02:15:47,608 --> 02:15:49,029
We've had several retirements.

717
02:15:49,089 --> 02:15:52,752
We really need to bolster our pool of qualified mentors.

718
02:15:54,281 --> 02:16:04,493
And then lastly, this leadership team establishes opportunities for group mentoring and peer groups for the beginning teachers or incoming teachers.

719
02:16:04,513 --> 02:16:10,640
So those series of workshops, seven workshops that I just talked about is something that we plan.

720
02:16:12,264 --> 02:16:17,047
Alright, so moving forward to induction week, it was a really busy induction week.

721
02:16:17,967 --> 02:16:24,671
It occurred from August 22 to August 26, which is the same week that all of the administrators are back for our meetings.

722
02:16:25,131 --> 02:16:33,556
So we really juggle our schedule to try to accommodate what we need to do as an administrative team with what we need to do to provide

723
02:16:35,891 --> 02:16:39,913
education and you know mentorship to our new teachers.

724
02:16:40,594 --> 02:16:56,862
So on Monday, August 22, it was pretty much a technology pickup day there was some school brains, very brief school brains clever teach point smart edu set up with people so they could actually get on login and have their have their credentials.

725
02:16:58,789 --> 02:17:01,653
Some hiring occurred after this point.

726
02:17:01,854 --> 02:17:07,262
So throughout the week, we were trying to play catch up with people who had been hired later in the week.

727
02:17:08,243 --> 02:17:09,845
On Tuesday, there was the...

728
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:16,873
We welcomed all the administrators, welcomed the new teachers over at the McGlynn Middle School cafeteria.

729
02:17:16,893 --> 02:17:23,757
And I think there was at least one school, one, if not more school committee members were able to attend that, which was great.

730
02:17:25,058 --> 02:17:28,920
We introduced the mentoring and induction program to the new teachers.

731
02:17:28,980 --> 02:17:36,065
Superintendent did a nice overview, a nice opening remarks to our new staff.

732
02:17:37,839 --> 02:17:48,610
Later in the day, they teachers met with either their principal director or other leadership person we had different schedules out, they could meet with their with their leaders.

733
02:17:49,271 --> 02:17:54,917
And then the at the end of the day, Paul deliver and I went over an educator evaluation training with.

734
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:56,280
with the group.

735
02:17:56,940 --> 02:17:59,321
Wednesday was a really fun day it was a tour of Medford.

736
02:17:59,741 --> 02:18:18,246
So I don't know if you've seen on the blog or if you've seen on social media, Joseph's bus company was wonderful to provide the bus at very low cost, so that our group of 50 plus new teachers could tour the city, so they went to the Royal House, they went to Tufts University.

737
02:18:19,378 --> 02:18:30,244
They went to the new library and they came here to City Hall in which I know that they met you Mayor Gohert and perhaps others here.

738
02:18:30,484 --> 02:18:32,085
So that was a really exciting day.

739
02:18:32,145 --> 02:18:38,728
And then after that, they went back to the high school, to the bistro, and they were treated to a luncheon from the Medford Teachers Association.

740
02:18:39,449 --> 02:18:45,172
On Thursday, the focus was on curriculum training for elementary and then for secondary.

741
02:18:46,773 --> 02:18:57,941
They engaged in the various student orientation programs that were occurring at the middle and the on the high school, and on Friday was a more extensive school brains training and a disability awareness seminar.

742
02:18:58,601 --> 02:19:00,863
So you can see the the breath here.

743
02:19:03,143 --> 02:19:10,829
Again, this is enhanced with the larger year-long program that we established.

744
02:19:12,310 --> 02:19:21,537
You can see, for those maybe looking at home, we had a picture of, you had it up Tufts University, again, Royal House, the library, and City Hall.

745
02:19:27,765 --> 02:19:31,866
So I've referenced a number of times the ongoing year-long support.

746
02:19:31,986 --> 02:19:36,967
So topics include student engagement, relationship building, and management.

747
02:19:37,467 --> 02:19:37,627
Ms.

748
02:19:37,647 --> 02:19:42,248
Galussi and I will be presenting to the group on September 29th on that topic.

749
02:19:43,168 --> 02:19:50,870
Other topics include supporting students in the Medford Public Schools, educator evaluation, including showcasing your evidence,

750
02:19:52,017 --> 02:20:04,193
time management and self-care, bias and assessment curriculum and learning, cyber safety and technology integration, and then lastly, that share-a-thon evaluation, reflection, and feedback.

751
02:20:04,574 --> 02:20:09,380
Again, all really important topics that we're spreading throughout the year.

752
02:20:12,193 --> 02:20:12,694
Thank you.

753
02:20:13,234 --> 02:20:26,353
So Dr. Riccadeli highlighted on this piece just a little bit, but as of last year, the Department of Education now has similar requirements for induction and mentoring for administrators.

754
02:20:27,715 --> 02:20:29,357
Don't really know what took so long, but.

755
02:20:29,810 --> 02:20:30,330
Here we are.

756
02:20:30,450 --> 02:20:41,953
So one of the things that Dr. Riccadeli and I are doing is pretty much trying to build that program very quite similarly to what you just heard for educators.

757
02:20:42,553 --> 02:20:51,135
So that the professional development and mentoring opportunities for new administrators are also sustained throughout the year.

758
02:20:51,475 --> 02:20:54,735
So they will have their, just as the teachers do, these,

759
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:14,492
ongoing professional development opportunities that you just heard referenced, the seven, that is in addition to, as Dr. Riccadeli mentioned, the individual mentor sessions that teachers have to cover various other topics.

760
02:21:14,953 --> 02:21:25,238
So that similar platform we're utilizing right now to create the administrator one, and we'll have a little bit more detail for you on that once it's finalized.

761
02:21:27,574 --> 02:21:29,574
And if you have any questions, please let us know.

762
02:21:29,975 --> 02:21:30,675
Thank you very much.

763
02:21:31,015 --> 02:21:31,655
Thank you very much.

764
02:21:31,855 --> 02:21:32,615
Member McLaughlin.

765
02:21:33,315 --> 02:21:33,715
Thank you.

766
02:21:33,755 --> 02:21:34,715
Thanks for the presentation.

767
02:21:34,735 --> 02:21:37,456
I had a couple of questions.

768
02:21:39,236 --> 02:21:45,858
It's good to see that mentoring program and great to see Trish Calbride and both of the mentor supervisors.

769
02:21:46,418 --> 02:21:50,939
I'm wondering how many mentors are there and how many new teachers are there?

770
02:21:51,919 --> 02:21:56,120
So there are 60 new teachers, six zero.

771
02:21:57,538 --> 02:22:03,262
And right now, I'm thinking of our list, we have 48 active mentors.

772
02:22:04,963 --> 02:22:07,684
And as you said, some of them have more than one mentee.

773
02:22:08,184 --> 02:22:11,827
Yes, some of them do have more than one mentee.

774
02:22:12,007 --> 02:22:18,310
So we have 48 mentors, there are a few that for whatever reason, couldn't take a new educator this year.

775
02:22:18,731 --> 02:22:21,332
So in several cases, we've had to double up.

776
02:22:21,952 --> 02:22:24,254
And in the past, I mean, people have had three

777
02:22:25,575 --> 02:22:27,497
That's what I was wondering do any have three or more.

778
02:22:28,338 --> 02:22:32,883
There may be one person with three this year, and that was more of a voluntary.

779
02:22:32,903 --> 02:22:38,229
That was it well it's all voluntary, but I think this person that reached out.

780
02:22:38,489 --> 02:22:40,091
Thank you.

781
02:22:40,151 --> 02:22:40,491
And then the.

782
02:22:42,549 --> 02:23:04,943
list of sort of events was really helpful in the list of the professional development right is that the professional development that they're being offered that was the list on the fourth page and i'm just wondering who provides that professional development is that internal or external that's going that's a little bit of both so we are still kind of finalizing and

783
02:23:05,814 --> 02:23:20,659
putting the finishing touches on some of that, but we are looking to capitalize on the resource that we do have within the district, as well as partnering with some of our organizations externally from Metro Public Schools.

784
02:23:20,919 --> 02:23:22,440
So it kind of depends on the topic.

785
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:24,860
Thank you.

786
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:30,422
And is there any DEI training at all, diversity, equity, inclusion?

787
02:23:31,483 --> 02:23:34,344
So part of that, I believe, let me just pull it up.

788
02:23:37,205 --> 02:23:46,014
The part of that is, well, first of all, I do want to just say that part of that work, it's not another.

789
02:23:46,554 --> 02:23:51,259
So it's kind of the equity piece, the DEI piece is woven into everything that we do.

790
02:23:51,979 --> 02:23:57,485
But specifically the topic about bias and assessment curriculum and learning will cover

791
02:23:58,021 --> 02:23:58,722
a piece of that.

792
02:23:59,282 --> 02:24:03,105
And that's where we're looking for both internal and external partnerships.

793
02:24:03,345 --> 02:24:04,426
Okay, thank you.

794
02:24:05,046 --> 02:24:08,749
And then the Friday, the disability awareness, can you tell me a little bit more about that?

795
02:24:08,769 --> 02:24:16,374
I know that Suzanne Campbell, Susanna Campbell was doing a large portion of that prior to her leaving.

796
02:24:16,414 --> 02:24:22,399
And I know that they had had like a six week or something, not for new teachers, but for professional development as a whole.

797
02:24:22,939 --> 02:24:23,720
So can you tell me?

798
02:24:31,434 --> 02:24:35,077
I guess we were timed out.

799
02:24:35,897 --> 02:24:39,620
We're going to be partnering with Joan Bowen, director of student services.

800
02:24:40,320 --> 02:24:47,265
I believe, I don't want to speak for her, but I believe that work is now being done by Lauren Perillo and Kim Clinton.

801
02:24:48,026 --> 02:24:52,749
Oh, and Julie Santos.

802
02:24:52,829 --> 02:24:59,774
So both coordinators, excuse me, special education coordinator Lauren Perillo and special education coordinator Julie Santos.

803
02:25:04,204 --> 02:25:05,105
Sorry, my mic was off.

804
02:25:05,485 --> 02:25:07,086
And how long was that training?

805
02:25:07,227 --> 02:25:11,830
I know the one previous, and again, this is for mentors versus staff.

806
02:25:11,971 --> 02:25:15,634
So I think that what you're talking about is during induction week on the Friday.

807
02:25:16,995 --> 02:25:21,138
So that workshop was provided by Kim Clinton and Lauren Perillo.

808
02:25:21,619 --> 02:25:23,560
And that was an overview.

809
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:26,723
This is what we do in Medford.

810
02:25:26,743 --> 02:25:28,224
This is what we're looking for.

811
02:25:28,705 --> 02:25:31,367
This is what we're required to do.

812
02:25:32,067 --> 02:25:45,553
So it really was an introduction to get everyone up on the same page with regard to requirements, access, and with regard to special education requirements.

813
02:25:46,293 --> 02:25:46,634
Thank you.

814
02:25:46,734 --> 02:25:50,195
So that was interned as like special education or disability awareness?

815
02:25:51,036 --> 02:25:51,776
Included both.

816
02:25:52,576 --> 02:25:54,017
I don't know, Joan, if you have anything.

817
02:25:54,377 --> 02:26:00,600
So it was definitely taking the disability awareness workshop that we do in the spring and really

818
02:26:01,653 --> 02:26:07,539
fine tuning it for I think it was about an hour long that they spoke to the new staff members.

819
02:26:09,942 --> 02:26:18,490
It wasn't long enough, but we encourage them to when we do offer this workshop in the spring for them to continue the work.

820
02:26:19,271 --> 02:26:22,835
The topics were about special education but also what

821
02:26:23,235 --> 02:26:30,907
what a disability looks like in your classroom so what an accommodation may look like a visible verse invisible disability that.

822
02:26:31,268 --> 02:26:37,718
So it was a broader topic that we hope that we will get more in depth with the disability awareness

823
02:26:38,615 --> 02:26:41,316
but also they work with their special education coordinators.

824
02:26:41,456 --> 02:26:53,122
They have monthly department meetings that we go over this and we will reach out to any general education teachers, you know, with any information or questions that they may have about it as well.

825
02:26:53,703 --> 02:26:54,043
Thank you.

826
02:26:54,103 --> 02:27:03,888
And I guess that just one more question, Mary, if you don't mind that our special education teachers and general education teachers integrated across mentor mentoring.

827
02:27:06,113 --> 02:27:07,073
I'm not sure what you mean.

828
02:27:07,273 --> 02:27:13,415
Are they mentoring each other or is it strictly special ed, special ed, gen ed, gen ed?

829
02:27:14,035 --> 02:27:15,056
Not necessarily.

830
02:27:15,096 --> 02:27:22,038
It could be a general education veteran teacher who's mentoring a special education teacher and vice versa.

831
02:27:22,158 --> 02:27:24,758
So it just depends on the numbers and who's available.

832
02:27:25,378 --> 02:27:25,959
Right.

833
02:27:26,199 --> 02:27:33,441
So when we talk about what the best way to match, location matters, grade level matters,

834
02:27:34,642 --> 02:27:36,223
you know, department.

835
02:27:37,003 --> 02:27:41,444
So in some cases, yes, a lot of thought goes into those matches.

836
02:27:41,504 --> 02:27:48,287
And I, you know, Donna and Tricia do that with consultation with me and Ms.

837
02:27:48,307 --> 02:27:49,187
Galussi as well.

838
02:27:49,687 --> 02:27:51,908
So it's, it crosses.

839
02:27:51,928 --> 02:27:53,389
So that's the best way I can answer it.

840
02:27:58,110 --> 02:27:58,450
Thank you.

841
02:27:59,891 --> 02:28:01,131
Thank you so much for the presentation.

842
02:28:01,151 --> 02:28:01,652
Thank you.

843
02:28:01,732 --> 02:28:02,332
Great to hear.

844
02:28:02,412 --> 02:28:02,612
Yes.

845
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:09,562
We have number seven, presentations of the public, not to begin before seven.

846
02:28:09,883 --> 02:28:13,745
Regular meetings of the school committee include this presentation of the public agenda item.

847
02:28:14,545 --> 02:28:20,749
To give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee, a resident may only present once at a meeting.

848
02:28:20,969 --> 02:28:27,233
These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but not an opportunity for dialogue of the committee.

849
02:28:27,333 --> 02:28:33,697
If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request the item be added

850
02:28:34,127 --> 02:28:36,228
to a subsequent regular meeting.

851
02:28:36,729 --> 02:28:51,657
The details for submitting a presentation can be found in our policy, public comment and presentations to the public and pursuant to policy BEDH, public comment and presentations to the public, any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item for up to three minutes.

852
02:28:52,118 --> 02:28:55,179
The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

853
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:57,060
The speaker must begin

854
02:28:58,271 --> 02:29:02,172
their comments by providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside.

855
02:29:02,733 --> 02:29:08,354
A welcoming, inclusive community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

856
02:29:08,715 --> 02:29:11,796
We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

857
02:29:12,816 --> 02:29:16,957
Employees in Medford Public Schools are exempt from the residency requirement of this policy.

858
02:29:17,498 --> 02:29:21,259
The voice of our employees is welcomed on all matters before the body.

859
02:29:21,719 --> 02:29:27,161
When a non-Medford resident employee is participating in public comment or submitting a presentation of the public,

860
02:29:27,602 --> 02:29:31,967
they will include their home address and identify themselves and as employee of the Metro Public Schools.

861
02:29:32,528 --> 02:29:37,674
We do have a resident on the call who would like to make a presentation.

862
02:29:37,694 --> 02:29:41,679
It's a parent speaking regarding before and after school program, Ms.

863
02:29:46,585 --> 02:29:47,366
Chiara Vannucci.

864
02:29:51,690 --> 02:29:52,811
So good evening, everyone.

865
02:29:53,131 --> 02:29:56,472
My name is Chiara Vannucci and I'm a resident at 65 Summer Street.

866
02:29:57,113 --> 02:30:08,038
I'm presenting tonight on behalf of the group of parents for better met for public schools that initiated this discussion on before and after school program crisis about two years ago.

867
02:30:09,178 --> 02:30:09,699
Next slide.

868
02:30:10,459 --> 02:30:14,121
In the presentation, I'll touch on these three main points listed here.

869
02:30:15,267 --> 02:30:15,947
So next slide.

870
02:30:16,167 --> 02:30:26,372
First of all, so at present, we don't know how many kids are enrolled in the afterschool program this year with respect to how many have applied and to the student total.

871
02:30:27,133 --> 02:30:36,998
So this table here was provided at a school committee meeting last spring, but it's not clear if the last column for year 2022 is up to date.

872
02:30:37,798 --> 02:30:43,341
Also, if the way the listed number is inclusive of all the grades, since it doesn't look like that's the case.

873
02:30:44,321 --> 02:30:49,746
Meaningful numbers should be broken down on enrolled and wait-listed students by grade.

874
02:30:50,406 --> 02:30:54,129
And we will need to compare those numbers with the total number of students.

875
02:30:55,130 --> 02:31:03,457
So we all know that a lack of afterschool is in part a consequence of hiring challenges that all school districts have faced during the pandemic.

876
02:31:03,917 --> 02:31:12,524
But in addition to that, Medford is facing a very specific challenge with respect to the lack of salary increase for teachers and paraprofessionals for over many years.

877
02:31:13,405 --> 02:31:13,825
Next slide.

878
02:31:15,506 --> 02:31:27,731
So some action taken by the administration so far are the approval of staff wages increases for all different professionals involved in the after school and before school programs.

879
02:31:28,251 --> 02:31:35,314
And it is, but it isn't clear if these salary raises proposed in this table have already been implemented for this school year.

880
02:31:36,614 --> 02:31:43,377
Also, there is a plan for introducing a sliding scale theme, which is great, but we don't know the details of this plan as of yet.

881
02:31:44,790 --> 02:31:52,955
that administration is also working with the paraprofessional union to create a new role that would also infuse the staff for the after-school program.

882
02:31:53,495 --> 02:32:02,021
That sounds like a great plan and seems the appropriate long-term school solution to secure more stable staff for the after-school program.

883
02:32:02,641 --> 02:32:07,324
But frankly, it doesn't seem possible that these new roles will be approved on time for the next school year.

884
02:32:08,044 --> 02:32:13,588
So we definitely want to see from the school committee follow-up discussions on all of these actions.

885
02:32:14,701 --> 02:32:15,382
So next slide.

886
02:32:16,483 --> 02:32:32,598
So for more short term solutions we think the school should partner with private programs, we know that there were ongoing discussion with two existing centers in Medford, in particular on expansion to include younger kids in the Medford youth center that is currently accepting only older kids.

887
02:32:33,479 --> 02:32:39,361
Then during the summer there were also discussion with other childcare providers such as for example power kids and kids corner.

888
02:32:40,082 --> 02:32:45,524
And the main issues seem to be the lack of affordable space in Medford where this association can host the kids.

889
02:32:46,244 --> 02:32:49,646
Apparently there are many issues with respect to using the school space.

890
02:32:50,666 --> 02:33:01,832
However, we know that some private programs like Kids2Pro were running a summer camp at the Brooks this past summer, and several other school districts let private programs use their school space.

891
02:33:02,373 --> 02:33:04,514
Why this cannot be done in Medford?

892
02:33:05,194 --> 02:33:10,857
In addition, if school space is used, we can save money because we don't need to bus the kids to other after-school locations.

893
02:33:11,738 --> 02:33:18,162
Also, at the beginning of the summer, the mayor told the parents that she would help the schools find affordable spaces to rent the private programs.

894
02:33:19,002 --> 02:33:20,964
but there has been no update since June.

895
02:33:21,924 --> 02:33:27,809
And there are many other options that could be explored, like for example, partnering with the Medford Family Networks and others.

896
02:33:28,449 --> 02:33:33,073
So we expect to receive detailed updates on these points at the next school committee meeting.

897
02:33:34,213 --> 02:33:34,694
Next slide.

898
02:33:36,158 --> 02:33:46,284
So finally, we also ask the school to release ASAP the data for school year 2022-23 and upload them on the Medford Public School website.

899
02:33:46,784 --> 02:33:48,946
In particular, we wanna see enrollment data.

900
02:33:49,406 --> 02:33:54,449
So both application and acceptance rate broken down per school and per grade.

901
02:33:55,770 --> 02:34:02,794
We also wanna see acceptance rates at school versus acceptance rates in Medford private programs and comparison with other districts.

902
02:34:03,809 --> 02:34:16,212
We also wanna be more involved into the expansion strategy for the program and we want to receive regular updates either via email and recurring dedicated meetings where we can have an open and direct discussion with the school administration.

903
02:34:16,812 --> 02:34:22,894
Last but not least, we want to know what the contribution of the Medford Mayor will be to find a solution to this problem.

904
02:34:23,594 --> 02:34:30,276
As mentioned, the mayor already promised to help identify space to be rented to private program at affordable rates.

905
02:34:31,436 --> 02:34:37,418
In addition, perhaps the city could also use city staff to support after school and before school operations.

906
02:34:37,458 --> 02:34:41,819
For example, resources from the Medford Recreation Department and the Economic Development Department.

907
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:46,461
And of course, any type of budget support would be highly appreciated by the Medford community.

908
02:34:47,161 --> 02:34:52,603
So again, we do expect a follow-up discussion on this topic during the next school committee meeting.

909
02:34:53,023 --> 02:34:54,103
Thank you all for the attention.

910
02:34:59,105 --> 02:34:59,425
Thank you.

911
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:14,919
Would you like somebody to suspend the rules to allow Mr Murphy to speak.

912
02:35:16,700 --> 02:35:25,327
Suspend the rules to speak, yes, member credits, seconded by member McLaughlin, all those in favor of those posts, Mr Murphy.

913
02:35:33,473 --> 02:35:33,893
Thank you, Mayor.

914
02:35:35,827 --> 02:35:36,147
I know Ms.

915
02:35:36,167 --> 02:36:02,541
Fidelicari is on the call as well, and this is certainly a topic that we have presented before you on several occasions, both with respect to the service that the district provides at our elementary schools, dealing with afterschool care, and with the very real challenges that we know families in Medford and other communities

916
02:36:03,341 --> 02:36:20,537
are facing in terms of making sure that their families needs for after school care being met, so that they're the students and the families can be fully engaged as members of the Medford public schools community.

917
02:36:21,338 --> 02:36:23,420
So, I want to say first.

918
02:36:25,376 --> 02:36:49,789
in response to the presentation by the community member, that this is an issue that has been prioritized by this school committee, as evidenced by the number of times that you've asked us to both present on the program, as well as the reforms that some of which were referenced in that presentation that we put into place over the course of the last two years.

919
02:36:51,210 --> 02:37:10,803
I can say very briefly, in response to some of the questions, that upon your vote to raise the levels of pay last year for the nine-unit personnel whose positions are funded by the Afterschool Revolving Fund, those pay increases were put in place for FY23.

920
02:37:12,584 --> 02:37:16,427
I will also say, and we can certainly elaborate upon this at a future presentation,

921
02:37:17,929 --> 02:37:31,418
because as we know, this issue is not going away, nor is it in any way isolated to Medford, that it is not just a matter of the rate of pay.

922
02:37:31,798 --> 02:37:35,221
We've compared ourselves to other districts, to other programs.

923
02:37:36,001 --> 02:37:39,484
We know that we do pay a competitive rate for this work.

924
02:37:39,924 --> 02:37:46,589
It's also a low-wage workforce issue, and we are facing low-wage workforce depletion issues,

925
02:37:47,069 --> 02:37:49,851
in this role, and as you know, many others.

926
02:37:50,572 --> 02:37:57,936
So, in terms of capacity, staffing is one issue, infrastructure is another.

927
02:37:58,797 --> 02:38:09,584
And I just, again, I want to keep this brief because this is not necessarily going to be an extended presentation, although certainly this is an area that we'll be briefing you on as the school year goes forward.

928
02:38:11,468 --> 02:38:16,849
We are, at our four elementary schools, oversubscribed with respect to interest.

929
02:38:17,449 --> 02:38:34,874
We have wait lists at three of the four elementary schools that, as we work through our staffing issues, we hope to and are addressing, those three schools being the Roberts, McGlynn, and Missituck.

930
02:38:35,474 --> 02:38:36,834
At the Brooks Elementary School,

931
02:38:37,734 --> 02:38:46,137
is well, we have a substantial wait list and we are over capacity with regard to staff and infrastructure.

932
02:38:46,797 --> 02:38:58,622
And there is no strategic and prudent solution that we can put into place based on the level of demand within the Brooks Elementary School community.

933
02:38:59,262 --> 02:39:06,445
And when I say there's no strategic or prudent solution, what I'm saying is absent some other major changed variable,

934
02:39:07,506 --> 02:39:28,081
that is beyond the scope of the Medford Public Schools to provide, in order for us to take in more students in that program, we would both be diverting attention and resources away from our core mission, and we would be absorbing risk and liability that we are not comfortable taking on.

935
02:39:28,701 --> 02:39:32,844
The reality is that to run a program of the magnitude

936
02:39:33,359 --> 02:39:45,842
that would be commensurate with the demand in that particular school community would require a major difference in terms of staffing structure and resources that would have to be allocated.

937
02:39:46,202 --> 02:39:54,185
I'm referring to administrative oversight, health oversight, as behavioral interventionists and support systems.

938
02:39:56,265 --> 02:40:02,767
With these types of programs, there is a scale that if you reach, you are putting students in danger.

939
02:40:03,396 --> 02:40:09,859
And we are not going to exceed that level, regardless of the public demand.

940
02:40:10,439 --> 02:40:20,544
And so I want to articulate that as clearly as possible, that we will continue to be as responsive as we can, and provide as much support and service to the community as we can.

941
02:40:21,244 --> 02:40:31,030
Again, in order to serve the purpose, not just of becoming a daycare facility, but for members of the Medford Public Schools community to be fully fledged members of the Medford Public Schools community.

942
02:40:31,371 --> 02:40:33,352
That is the goal that we share with this committee.

943
02:40:33,712 --> 02:40:39,436
We're grateful to the mayor for her support and the number, the amount of dialogue we've had with her administration.

944
02:40:39,776 --> 02:40:46,300
So this is a goal, but it is not a goal that is going to supersede our core educational mission.

945
02:40:46,741 --> 02:40:48,622
And there are logistical limitations

946
02:40:49,898 --> 02:40:52,139
that we run up against, that won't change.

947
02:40:52,879 --> 02:41:01,181
With respect to how we will continue to whittle the wait list down to the best we can at the other three school communities, which there's just at the moment, there's less demand.

948
02:41:01,821 --> 02:41:04,762
That's information that changes is very fluid.

949
02:41:04,782 --> 02:41:08,102
It changes on a daily basis or certainly a weekly basis.

950
02:41:08,302 --> 02:41:17,485
And later in the year, we will provide additional updates about some of the other staffing strategies we're using to try to offer as much support as possible.

951
02:41:17,525 --> 02:41:19,385
So we can at least have an equal level of support

952
02:41:19,781 --> 02:41:21,161
across the four elementary schools.

953
02:41:22,422 --> 02:41:23,162
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

954
02:41:23,422 --> 02:41:24,763
We look forward to an update.

955
02:41:26,023 --> 02:41:30,524
We have continued business 2022-40 offered by member Rousseau.

956
02:41:30,604 --> 02:41:31,645
This is a second reading.

957
02:41:31,825 --> 02:41:33,425
The following policies are rescinded.

958
02:41:33,906 --> 02:41:36,826
They are no longer necessary because state law covers these matters.

959
02:41:37,607 --> 02:41:45,449
We have no specialized language expanding upon the laws and the MCAS policy manual no longer offers these policies in their template system.

960
02:41:45,929 --> 02:41:47,790
ACH, affirmative action policy,

961
02:41:48,675 --> 02:42:11,227
ADB drug free environment CFAA duties of a principal CHB and see in BGD school committee review of regulations CHC regulations dissemination CL administrative reports and CLA administrative reports to the school committee CLB incident reports member so motion for approval.

962
02:42:13,092 --> 02:42:13,452
So much.

963
02:42:13,693 --> 02:42:15,675
Yes, I'd like to motion for approval by members.

964
02:42:15,695 --> 02:42:20,039
So second, I'm going to remember Graham before we call before we call the roll.

965
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:22,442
Member McLaughlin does have a question.

966
02:42:22,562 --> 02:42:22,922
Thank you.

967
02:42:23,042 --> 02:42:26,085
I just heard I was hearing the BLB for the incident reports.

968
02:42:26,145 --> 02:42:27,046
We're sorry.

969
02:42:28,328 --> 02:42:29,249
Incident reports.

970
02:42:31,911 --> 02:42:34,754
CLB, CLB, the last one.

971
02:42:35,515 --> 02:42:36,456
It's reports about

972
02:42:44,625 --> 02:42:45,465
Okay, thank you.

977
02:43:25,343 --> 02:43:30,083
The first is regarding sanctuary laws for transgender students.

978
02:43:30,103 --> 02:43:31,964

979
02:43:31,984 --> 02:43:32,544

Resolution passes.

1022
02:45:19,097 --> 02:45:31,126
The votes of the member school committee are considered binding on the delegate unless the language as presented that 9-12-22 meeting is different from the language up for final adoption at the delegate assembly on November 4th, 2022.

1023
02:45:33,921 --> 02:45:46,184
The reason votes are otherwise considered guidance is that the exact language voted on during the assembly can be modified by amendments during the assembly and returning to the school committee for a vote on the final language is not possible.

1024
02:45:47,624 --> 02:45:50,525
We do not have any new business or reports requested.

1025
02:45:50,545 --> 02:45:53,746
We do have two condolences, if you mind if I read them.

1026
02:45:53,946 --> 02:46:02,588
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of John Fagone, a senior custodian who worked at the McGlynn and Roberts School.

1027
02:46:03,857 --> 02:46:22,767
member school committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Mary Barrett, a former second grade teacher at the Fulton Elementary School, and the first female ever appointed to the board of directors of the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame, and the first female to be appointed to chair the Hockey East College Tournament Committee.

1028
02:46:22,787 --> 02:46:25,249
If we all may take a moment of silence.

1029
02:46:27,310 --> 02:46:27,570
Thank you.

1030
02:46:41,187 --> 02:46:48,913
Our next regular meeting will be Monday, October 3 at 6pm here in the Alden Memorial Chambers, as well as on Zoom.

1031
02:46:50,475 --> 02:46:51,556
Is there a motion to adjourn?

1032
02:46:55,359 --> 02:46:59,482
Motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member McStone.

1034
02:47:00,983 --> 02:47:01,644
All those opposed?
