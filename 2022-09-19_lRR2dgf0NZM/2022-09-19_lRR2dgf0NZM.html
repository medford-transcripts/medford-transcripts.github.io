    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=225.51s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=226.01s">Member</a>  Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=226.59s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=226.851s">Mayor</a>  Longo.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=227.811s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=228.091s">So</a>  in the affirmative, zero in the negative, we're gonna head into executive session and we will come back on the floor, hopefully right around six o'clock.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4049.124s">Good</a>  evening, everybody.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4050.045s">Sorry,</a>  we're a few minutes late. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4050.985s">We're</a>  in executive session to discuss a few things, but one thing we need to announce is that we have voted unanimously to approve the contracts, new contracts for our nurses in the Medford Public Schools, the Carpenters Union, as well as the administrative assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4072.218s">Next</a>  up, we have the consent agenda, which is bills and payrolls, committee of the whole meeting minutes from June 29th, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4079.574s">regular</a>  school committee meeting minutes September 12 2022 motion to sever the committee of the whole minutes meeting minutes from June 29 December by member Ruseau second amendment goff and all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4092.299s">Hi,</a>  all those opposed motion is severed.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4097.402s">Can</a>  I just ask a question I didn't have bills in payrolls in my packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4101.123s">Is</a>  that intentional. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4104.204s">I</a>  did.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4110.892s">That's</a>  what I'm looking at.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4115.213s">Yeah,</a>  that's what I have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4116.513s">Oh,</a>  no, that's what I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4118.993s">Other</a>  additional bills and payrolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4122.894s">This</a>  is what we have.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4124.574s">We</a>  didn't get that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4128.755s">No,</a>  it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4129.915s">Do</a>  you want a motion to table until next?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4132.496s">Motion</a>  to approve the remaining consent agenda.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4134.976s">Motion</a>  to approve the remaining consent agenda agenda by member Graham seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4139.986s">Second,</a>  Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4141.466s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4142.247s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4142.947s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4143.107s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4143.947s">Is</a>  there a motion to table the Committee of the Whole minutes or?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4148.668s">I</a>  just had questions about them.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4150.489s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4151.269s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4152.349s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4154.35s">So</a>  this meeting, reviewing the minutes, it says I was absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4157.891s">I</a>  actually was on an advanced notice vacation and actually did not receive notice of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4164.152s">And</a>  I think the minutes should be updated to say <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4167.817s">I</a>  don't know what they need to say, but I was not absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4170.82s">I</a>  was not notified of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4173.882s">So</a>  it's a very important distinction since I missed only one meeting ever for illness and I take attendance very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4183.15s">So</a>  I don't know what, if we want to just change the way it says absent to say absent, failure to notify.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4188.934s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4190.155s">That's</a>  acceptable.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4191.536s">Point</a>  of, I guess I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4195.022s">If</a>  member Rousseau is finished, I'll move on to member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4198.464s">So</a>  wasn't there an email sent out to all of us that there was a meeting?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4204.088s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4204.428s">And</a>  prior to the email, I had told administration I was away and without internet service or cell phone service, and we had no posted meetings at that point in time.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4215.336s">If</a>  I recall, wasn't there a conversation that if there was a meeting, you did not want to attend it?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4219.319s">I</a>  certainly would never have said that I didn't want to attend a meeting.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4223.137s">I</a>  guess I had some recollection of when we were discussing the possibility of attending a meeting that you didn't want to attend.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4228.179s">I</a>  didn't think the meeting was appropriate but I certainly would have attended any meeting I was invited to as I always have.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4235.061s">Hmm,</a>  I think that's. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4236.682s">Yeah,</a>  I guess I don't recall it quite that way but it's okay for if folks want to vote to have, I think failure to notify us a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4247.318s">harsh</a>  language, I guess we did notify you did not have internet access, so.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4251.46s">No</a>  internet access. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4252.781s">Yeah,</a>  no internet access.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4253.982s">I'm</a>  not okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4255.202s">I've</a>  made a motion to amend them to say failure to notify. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4257.964s">If</a>  there's no second, then.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4259.664s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4271.971s">Motion</a>  by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4277.987s">Roll</a>  call vote.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4279.088s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4279.848s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4280.829s">Member</a>  Hays?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4283.531s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4285.873s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4287.474s">Member</a>  McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4288.695s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4289.736s">Member</a>  Mustone?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4290.596s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4291.877s">Member</a>  Rossell? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4292.398s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4292.678s">Mayor</a>  Longo?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4294.659s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4294.899s">Six</a>  in the affirmative, one in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4297.161s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4298.202s">Is</a>  there a motion for approval of the minutes?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4301.044s">I</a>  have one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4301.844s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4303.283s">I'm</a>  reading the minutes, since this is the first time, aware of the meeting, I mean I was aware that there was a meeting while I was away, but <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4311.86s">I'm</a>  reading it and there's a lot of like there's all these motions with no language that says what the motion was there's like motion to accept what was perhaps talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4321.287s">I</a>  just don't know how anybody can take action off of these minutes without actual language saying what was approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4326.752s">So,</a>  this is a comment I, I wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4330.214s">I'm</a>  assuming when it says motion to accept changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4335.27s">that</a>  there were really changes, but reading through the minutes, I don't think anybody who wasn't present could reasonably know what it was was being asked to happen and by whom. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4345.438s">So</a>  those are comments on the minutes, but I would still vote to approve them because there's nothing being asked to happen here as far as I can tell.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4360.811s">So</a>  did you make a motion to approve them? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4362.933s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4364.191s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member Ruseau, seconded by...

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4412.619s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4414.84s">I'd</a>  like to take a moment to say that you'll remember at the start of the pandemic <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4420.746s">And</a>  I think it was either January or February, one of the first things that the district did was to cease any international travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4428.347s">This</a>  was prior to the statewide and nationwide closure of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4433.708s">And</a>  one of the things that we did, we had 39 students who were going to be traveling to Europe. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4439.489s">We</a>  suspended that trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4441.27s">We're</a>  able to secure students money back and in large part. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4447.171s">And</a>  we are here tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4450.232s">for</a>  these two phenomenal members of our staff to request approval to start that process for a trip this April. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4458.519s">And</a>  I will turn it over to Miss Bebo and Miss Nyland to go through the further details. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4464.125s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nyland]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4466.787s">Good</a>  evening, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4468.769s">How</a>  are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4470.214s">So</a>  long, I was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4472.516s">Basically,</a>  I'm gonna do the same story. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4474.098s">I'm</a>  gonna ask for your vote for Medford High School world language students to go on a trip on April 2023 during the April vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4492.745s">Okay,</a>  so let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4495.367s">We're</a>  gonna be working with the same company, which was Travel by Design. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4500.47s">I</a>  think you all got the itinerary and the insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4506.458s">wording</a>  that I had given to Mr. Cushing, and he read it, and it looks like everything is good with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4515.481s">So</a>  basically, yeah, we haven't advertised it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4518.762s">However,</a>  I am teaching a level four French class this year, and since they were my level one French students, I kind of promised them we were gonna have this trip when they were seniors, and they're seniors this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4535.519s">Like</a>  Mr. Cushing was saying, we had to cancel the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4539.505s">We</a>  had 39 seniors going. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4541.487s">It</a>  was phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4542.329s">We</a>  were working with the same company. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4545.032s">They</a>  did get all their money back except the $100, which was the airline. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4549.142s">a</a>  deposit that they had put. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4551.785s">So</a>  basically this year, it's the exact same thing, because I'm working with Travel by Design, same person, Giuseppe Tarzia. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4559.172s">We</a>  love him. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4560.113s">He's</a>  fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4562.475s">And</a>  it's the same price. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4563.956s">It</a>  looks like the price hasn't gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4567.039s">So</a>  on your itinerary, in the last page, you'll see the price range. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4574.642s">Now,</a>  the only difference this year, well, 2023, is that we want to limit the numbers to about 25 to 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4583.347s">30</a>  would be like on the high end, and it would be an exception to somebody who really, really wants to go and is a senior, and this will be their last chance to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4591.992s">And</a>  then we'll put them on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4594.954s">But</a>  25, 26 is, I think, the max we're going to go with. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4599.008s">this</a>  coming trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4602.69s">The</a>  chaperones are six to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4604.832s">That's</a>  why I love this company. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4605.992s">I</a>  actually have worked with the Education Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4608.674s">There's</a>  a lot of travel companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4610.735s">Giuseppe</a>  here does such a great job, six to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4613.477s">So</a>  if we have 25, I think he'll, no, well, it's four, but I think he'll throw in the five. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4620.407s">the</a>  fifth one for free, fifth chaperones for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4622.748s">We</a>  usually ask an administrator to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4625.408s">And</a>  then we ask the world language teachers so they can have a chance to go and then we'll take it from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4634.611s">Then</a>  we usually ask the history teachers because they know their history and France and all that great stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4642.073s">Let</a>  me see, what else? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4643.073s">So</a>  insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4645.533s">Yeah,</a>  so the last time, of course, <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4648.527s">Hopefully</a>  there's another pandemic, who knows, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4651.87s">In</a>  April, but please know, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4654.031s">So</a>  we have this form here, which is extra insurance that most of the families took. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4660.656s">It's</a>  an extra $100 and this covers everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4664.319s">So</a>  a natural disaster, God forbid, a death in the family of the traveler, they get their full money back, except that $100 again, that's the airlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4675.148s">Okay,</a>  so that's good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4676.952s">They'll</a>  have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4678.717s">We</a>  have, you know, the itinerary is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4681.383s">Is</a>  there any questions?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4683.353s">Before</a>  people says something to Yes, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4689.777s">So</a>  I just wanted to.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4694.62s">First,</a>  thank you so much for styling I wanted to just formally announced that Miss bill motherbo is our coordinator of world language. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4702.446s">And</a>  we are so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4704.987s">We</a>  are so happy to have you on board this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4710.586s">supporting</a>  world language programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4713.487s">So</a>  I just wanted to say congratulations and welcome and thank you for taking on that challenge to support world languages at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4722.491s">And</a>  so I want to make sure that I will do something again, we'll be introducing and announcing more of the new administrators this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4731.074s">But</a>  while you were here today, I didn't want to miss that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4734.655s">And</a>  I also just wanted to share how excited I was about that yellow form. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4740.962s">When</a>  Miss nylon was like now it's the $100, because it was very stressful. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4747.729s">When</a>  we had to cancel that trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4750.732s">And</a>  it was a lot of students, a lot of money that families sacrificed and the kids worked and saved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4758.417s">And</a>  then the pandemic had started. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4761.239s">So,</a>  thankfully now we have the insurance in place and I look forward to offering our students more expeditionary learning opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4772.706s">all</a>  over the world when possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4775.447s">I'm</a>  not sure, Miss Nyland, did you say, or did you share with the committee yet, if you're not able to get 25 students that are in the French program that want to attend, what do you do then with the remaining seats?</p>

    <p>[Nyland]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4790.313s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4790.933s">So</a>  we start by advertising to the French <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4795.345s">language</a>  students who are taking French at the high school, and we reach out to sophomores, juniors, and seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4803.253s">Freshmen,</a>  not yet, they have to be sophomores, so we're not gonna bring any freshmen at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4810.2s">So</a>  we reach out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4811.021s">We</a>  have about, how many in the French department, about total, like sophomores, juniors, <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4820.667s">80,</a>  80, 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4822.048s">So</a>  we keep it open for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4823.748s">They</a>  get priority for about two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4826.73s">And</a>  then if the numbers are not coming in, we reach out to all the world language students. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4832.412s">So</a>  that would be the Italian students and the Spanish students. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4835.473s">And</a>  it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4838.235s">25</a>  comes quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4839.915s">I</a>  mean, and that's why we got to 39 the last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4842.196s">I</a>  literally could not have, I couldn't send kids away. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4845.257s">And</a>  they were all seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4846.238s">This</a>  was going to be their senior trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4847.378s">You</a>  know how they go on a senior trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4849.741s">to</a>  go to France on their senior trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4851.422s">How</a>  great is that with us? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4854.364s">So</a>  we couldn't say no, so the number was really up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4857.566s">And</a>  we had all the chaperones lined up anyway, and they were awesome chaperones. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4862.108s">I</a>  think we had like eight chaperones coming with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4864.43s">And</a>  then of course we have to cancel everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4866.351s">So</a>  that's, I think, the process on how we recruit or the list.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4872.394s">That's</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4873.615s">Exciting.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4874.676s">If</a>  there's no questions, is there a motion for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4877.878s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4879.889s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4880.71s">Um,</a>  I'm so excited to see these trips returning, and thank you for taking the time to organize, I just had a couple of questions about the insurance, so I think what I'm understanding is that, in general, the cancellation policy <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4898.912s">is</a>  60 to 31 days, you get half of your package back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4904.016s">20</a>  to 15 days, you get 75%, or sorry, you get a penalty of 75%, meaning you'd get 25% back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4912.482s">And</a>  then zero to 14 days, you don't get anything back on land. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4917.366s">But</a>  then if you have canceled for any reason, you can get up to 75% back, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4928.561s">Like,</a>  I'm just trying to make sure I understand like what this is, because it actually doesn't seem that different than what we were grappling with, like right before the pandemic, where the students were essentially getting nothing back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4940.169s">And</a>  I was just curious if the insurance had evolved at all since then, given like, you know, the last two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4947.114s">And</a>  I think the other important thing that I think I just wanna make sure I'm clear about is that airfare is not covered by this insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4956.721s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Nyland]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4959.861s">The</a>  airfare, it is, except for the $100, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4964.944s">Remember,</a>  they did get all the money back except for minus 100, that's it, which was a deposit for the airline at that time.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4974.148s">I</a>  don't think that's what this says, though.</p>

    <p>[Nyland]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4975.869s">Okay,</a>  so you see how there's two reasons? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4980.751s">So</a>  if there's a death in the family or a natural disaster, <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4989.505s">they're</a>  going to get the full amount back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4992.347s">If</a>  for any reason, like anxiety, or they get cold feet, then this amount applies. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=4999.29s">Where,</a>  you know, 14 to zero days, you see what you're seeing on that on that one? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5004.333s">Okay,</a>  if you read it says option is highly recommended for protection from trip cancellations due to anxiety, or such a sensitivity of travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5013.649s">That's</a>  where this is gonna apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5014.629s">But</a>  if there's like a natural disaster, like we had, I made it very clear with Giuseppe, they're getting all their money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5023.292s">Do</a>  you see what I'm saying?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5024.993s">Okay,</a>  so this form governs what happens if you cancel for any reason, which is in addition to getting your money back for like the other reasons that are listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5040.051s">in</a>  the details of this, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Nyland]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5043.134s">Correct,</a>  but the reasons that you get your full money back has to be natural disasters or death in the family, but you cannot travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5051.84s">But</a>  if you just don't wanna go because you changed your mind and you have anxiety for traveling, you're not getting your money back.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5062.869s">See</a>  what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5063.49s">Okay,</a>  and airfare is or isn't included. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5069.392s">in</a>  the refund?</p>

    <p>[Nyland]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5071.072s">Good</a>  question.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5072.013s">I</a>  can let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5073.513s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5075.073s">I</a>  just wanna make sure people are clear.</p>

    <p>[Nyland]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5077.114s">For</a>  natural disaster and death in the family, the airfare, yes, it is included. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5082.995s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5083.595s">It's</a>  included.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5085.156s">And</a>  for cancel for any reason, if you take the insurance and you cancel, is your airfare refunded to you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5096.738s">I'm</a>  trying to read this.</p>

    <p>[Nyland]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5101.161s">I'm</a>  not going to answer that yet because I don't want to give you the wrong answer.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5104.382s">Yeah,</a>  I just want to make sure that I think this is like there's a lot of information here and I just want to make sure that we're explaining it to families so we're not relying on them to read this like 20 page like fine print insurance policy because I don't think that they will. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5119.344s">And</a>  I think there were a lot of families that were really, really, really surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5124.345s">And</a>  I know it all worked out financially OK when we had to cancel that trip, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5130.259s">It</a>  was sort of heartbreaking to listen to students who thought they were going to lose a lot of money and just the issue.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5135.962s">Just</a>  real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5136.563s">The</a>  issue at that time with those trips was that there had not been a federal declaration. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5142.786s">There</a>  is not that state declaration. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5144.567s">It</a>  was the Medford public schools is making travel at this time, not something we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5152.392s">So</a>  that's where we were at that crossroads. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5154.833s">Once</a>  those declarations came forward from the federal government, from the state government, that then triggered these clauses of natural disaster and things of that nature.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5164.958s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5167.239s">And</a>  each family will get the insurance policy.</p>

    <p>[Vilma Bibeau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5170.222s">Yes,</a>  I was just going to add, if you allow me, that when we present this to families, we make sure that we are very clear on the distinction that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5178.264s">Nyland</a>  just provided you, meaning the distinction between the cancellation, of course, for natural disaster or death in a family versus if a child decide then not to travel anymore for personal reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5191.566s">We're</a>  going to make sure that we have those distinction clear with the family members.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5196.387s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5196.767s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5197.368s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5198.688s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5202.001s">So</a>  if a student tests positive for COVID in the morning that they're leaving, this policy, according to its own little notes at the bottom, has not been updated since July 1 of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5213.784s">So</a>  definitely, they didn't update it specific for COVID, which I guess is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5220.106s">But</a>  I'm assuming that if the FAA still requires tests, do they require testing anymore, or is it just a free-for-all on planes? <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5229.608s">They</a>  do not require us to France might well require a test.</p>

    <p>[Nyland]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lRR2dgf0NZM&t=5232.769s">And</a>  I know that again, who knows?</p>
