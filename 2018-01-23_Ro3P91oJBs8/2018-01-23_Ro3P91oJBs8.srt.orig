1
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:34,244
[SPEAKER_07]: George, I was with a bunch of friends from summer.

2
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you do my best?

3
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:38,838
[SPEAKER_12]: So, January 23rd, 2018.

19
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:31,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Dear Mr. President and City Councillors, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honourable Body approve the following loan order.

20
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:48,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it ordered that the sum of $669,000.00 be and hereby is appropriate to pay the cost of a custom fire pumper truck or trucks, including the payment of all costs incidental and related thereto in that

21
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,265
[SPEAKER_12]: to meet this appropriation.

22
00:05:53,325 --> 00:06:12,889
[SPEAKER_12]: The city treasurer, with the approval of the mayor, is authorized to borrow the said sum under and pursuant to Chapter 44, Section 7, Section 1 of the Massachusetts General Laws as amended and supplemented, or pursuant to any other enabling authority, and to issue bonds or notes of the city.

23
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Therefore, and further,

24
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:26,419
[SPEAKER_12]: that the mayor is authorized to seek, contract for, and expend any federal or state funds available for this purpose in addition to or to supplement the amount appropriate herein.

25
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:41,712
[SPEAKER_12]: In that, any premium received upon the sale of any bonds or notes approved by this order, lest any such premium applied to the payment of costs of issuance of such bonds or notes may be applied to the payment costs approved by

26
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:54,383
[SPEAKER_12]: This order in accordance with Chapter 44, Section 20 of the General Laws, thereby reducing the amount authorized to be borrowed to pay such costs by a like amount.

27
00:06:56,293 --> 00:07:09,022
[SPEAKER_12]: In further order, that the City Treasurer is authorized to file an application with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Municipal Finance Oversight Board to qualify under Chapter 44 of the Massachusetts General Laws, any and all bonds or notes.

28
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:15,667
[SPEAKER_12]: The City is authorized by this vote or pursuant to any prior vote of the City in any connection therewith.

29
00:07:16,488 --> 00:07:25,955
[SPEAKER_12]: to provide such information and execute such documents as the Municipal Finance Oversight Board of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may require.

30
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:30,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Sincerely, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

31
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,580
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the City Treasurer here.

32
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:36,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you like to speak on this?

33
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

34
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Ann Marie Irwin, Treasurer-Collector, City of Medford.

35
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:50,064
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very straightforward borrowing of $669,000 to purchase one new fire truck.

36
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:55,247
[SPEAKER_05]: It would most likely be a short-term borrowing of less than a year.

37
00:07:55,287 --> 00:08:04,912
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd do a bond anticipation note and then roll it into something when we had a bigger group of borrowings to warrant a bond.

38
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:15,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

39
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Treasurer, how are you?

40
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:18,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm well, thanks.

41
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:18,441
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you?

42
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm well.

43
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:20,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick question for you.

44
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:30,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you anticipate that this appropriation would have any effect in setting us back in our endeavors to create a new police station and then a five-year plan for breaking ground on a new fire station?

45
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:32,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in the least, no.

46
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:32,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

47
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:50,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, we've certainly been strong advocates of this Council has, all of us without exception, for the Fire Department and to promote public safety.

48
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:53,573
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to move approval on this matter, Mr. President.

49
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:57,555
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, I do make the motion for approval on this loan request.

50
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:10,705
[SPEAKER_13]: and that we move forward with it in all due haste for the betterment of the Fire Department and for the protection of the citizens of Medford.

51
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:25,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I have one question regarding the piece of apparatus to the Chief, and it's a matter that concerns me, as I notice in, if I may, through the Chair, ask the Chief, I know he's present here with us tonight, I notice that

52
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:42,424
[SPEAKER_13]: More recent, newer pieces of equipment have a rather loud and quite visible reflective stripe pattern in the back of the apparatus.

53
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:49,767
[SPEAKER_13]: It may in fact be mandated by occupational safety standards.

54
00:09:50,708 --> 00:10:10,396
[SPEAKER_13]: But I must say, Mr. President, if I can, through you to the Chief, that I find this addition to the apparatus to be something that detracts from the aesthetic of the pieces and I would hope that with this new pump we could do something that

55
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:17,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Promote safety for the firefighters while at the same time isn't as loud.

56
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,440
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd rather invest that into the siren for loudness.

57
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,600
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two sirens, by the way.

58
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

59
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:27,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a requirement.

60
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:28,202
[SPEAKER_02]: You're correct.

61
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,122
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a requirement under the NFPA.

62
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:34,784
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the manufacturer would not release the truck without that.

63
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:38,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you can vary the colors a little bit.

64
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:42,198
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's still going to be loud believe me.

65
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:44,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Mr. President.

66
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you President Carviela.

67
00:10:51,360 --> 00:11:00,402
[SPEAKER_04]: While we have the Chief here, could we just stay a minute and just get an update from you with regards to the turnout gear and potential washer and dryer.

68
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:02,502
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the turnout gear was delivered.

69
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:03,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It was delivered.

70
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:04,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It came in with some

71
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:09,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Deficiencies.

72
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:13,337
[SPEAKER_02]: The suspender system was the incorrect system.

73
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:21,720
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a certain patch that goes on the jacket that was supposed to be a certain color and size.

74
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,840
[SPEAKER_02]: That was incorrect.

75
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:34,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the names and spellings, which that happens anyway, but they took it all back last week and they're gonna make it right.

76
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:36,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just waiting for the delivery of that.

77
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And did they give you a time frame on that?

78
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:44,249
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but what they've always told me, we'll get it back as soon as we can.

79
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:54,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and then with regards to, I know there was a grant that was being applied for the washing machine for the turnout gear.

80
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:56,634
[SPEAKER_04]: What is any update on that?

81
00:11:56,694 --> 00:12:01,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that grant didn't come through, so I purchased two washing machines.

82
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:04,249
[SPEAKER_02]: We've taken delivery of those.

83
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,913
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be installing those, uh, hopefully in the very near future.

84
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:16,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting to get, uh, some, um, construction work done before we can install the plumb for both washes.

85
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:20,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And those washing machines will cut, will be able to clean the turn oak.

86
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:20,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is correct.

87
00:12:21,004 --> 00:12:22,105
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll make three total.

88
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:23,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

89
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then with regards to, um,

90
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:34,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who the question would be for, but from what we were just told, it's going to be a one year.

91
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:37,426
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to Vaughan for one year.

92
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:39,288
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could just get a little more detail on that.

93
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:51,359
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be a bond anticipation of a ban, which is a short-term borrowing in anticipation of doing a bond.

94
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,267
[SPEAKER_05]: In order to do a bond, sometimes the expenses incurred in doing a bond are

95
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:11,706
[SPEAKER_05]: They're higher, so we like to do bond anticipation notes and wait until we have a group of smaller notes and then do a bond for those smaller notes.

96
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:16,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so with that being said, we anticipate another how many bonds coming down the line?

97
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:30,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right now the only thing we have, the only things we have that aren't bonded are, we have the Riverside Plaza project, which I believe has a balance of about $300,000, and we have the

98
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:42,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the City Hall repairs, which we still have to bond, and that's about $1.8 million.

99
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,362
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would put those all together with this borrowing as well to do a long-term bond.

100
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:54,144
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the only three that we would group together, anything else?

101
00:13:54,265 --> 00:14:02,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, depending on, some are longer term, so it would depend on the circumstances, but that would be the likelihood.

102
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the total we're thinking of going out to bond for?

103
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:12,718
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be 2.8 million?

104
00:14:12,738 --> 00:14:14,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Approximately.

105
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just take a look at what I have here.

106
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:25,610
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also have, I mean we haven't talked about any of the other things, I'm sorry.

107
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Just add them on top, yeah.

108
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, so we have the Winthrop Street.

109
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:45,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And drainage project, that's an older one, and DPW borrowing, and then we have the Riverside Plaza and the City Hall.

110
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:57,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So those combined, the DPW and the Winthrop Street Drainage Project are 650, this is 670, and then 300 for Riverside and 1.8 for City Hall repairs.

111
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:08,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Three of those projects we're already doing.

112
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:13,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the total we're going to hope to go out to bond for?

113
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:24,343
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll probably be around $3,600,000 approximately, depending on what gets grouped together.

114
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some of them are shorter term.

115
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:31,514
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're anticipating doing that sometime in 2018?

116
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:38,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm hoping to meet with some of our financial advisors at the end of February.

117
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:43,742
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to keep a close eye on the rates just in case anything starts to creep up.

118
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:45,503
[SPEAKER_05]: We would do that sooner rather than later.

119
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:46,644
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's the current rate?

120
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:52,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it depends on what we go out for, how long the term is.

121
00:15:52,128 --> 00:15:53,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they average anywhere from 2%, 3%, 4%.

122
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:58,952
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just gonna try and get the best rate we can.

123
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:01,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we looking for a 20-year on that?

124
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:04,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it depends on what's included in it.

125
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:12,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Some things you can't go out that long on because there are restrictions under Chapter 44, Section 7 on how long you can bond for.

126
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:22,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And this fire pump or truck is gonna, is it gonna be replacing a truck or is it?

127
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:23,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

128
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:25,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So one will be taken out of service?

129
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:30,281
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually I'm going to use the one that it replaces as a reserve piece.

130
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:36,264
Okay.

131
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:37,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good for now, thank you.

132
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:40,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Come so much.

133
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:42,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr President.

134
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:48,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Chief, can you just explain the necessity of replacing a piece of equipment?

135
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,528
[SPEAKER_03]: How old is that piece that you're going to be replacing?

136
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:59,290
[SPEAKER_02]: The current piece engine four on Riverside Avenue is a 2000 and 2005 PS truck, so that that truck is.

137
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:07,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost 13 years old.

138
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:08,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking 13 years old now.

139
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:10,881
[SPEAKER_02]: That was engine one.

140
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:15,104
[SPEAKER_02]: When that was brand new in 2005, it was at headquarters.

141
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:22,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we replaced engine one and engine two three years ago, we moved that one down to engine four.

142
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So where will you be storing the truck that you're replacing?

143
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:28,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Where?

144
00:17:29,454 --> 00:17:30,315
[SPEAKER_02]: In one of the stations.

145
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:35,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have room now to store trucks and whereabouts?

146
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:51,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are several trucks that I'm trying to dispose of with this transaction or on something that Council President Carvajal apprised me of through a gentleman dealer.

147
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:53,413
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mass Municipal Association.

148
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:58,657
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several ways that we can do it, but I was trying to get some dollar value for them.

149
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:03,419
[SPEAKER_02]: See through the through the manufacturer.

150
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So using the backup truck or you gonna sell the backup truck know the backup drops.

151
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saving that there are others that we have.

152
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:13,648
[SPEAKER_02]: There are others that are older.

153
00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:20,041
[SPEAKER_03]: So that that truck's going to go on engine four?

154
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:20,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

155
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:26,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is a typical life expectancy of a truck of that nature?

156
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:31,296
[SPEAKER_02]: A truck that goes with the runs that that company does per year.

157
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Twelve years, maybe.

158
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:36,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten, twelve.

159
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:37,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends.

160
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on the care and the maintenance.

161
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,084
[SPEAKER_02]: The maintenance will be done internally?

162
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:42,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

163
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:46,327
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't contract for any outside maintenance?

164
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:49,629
[SPEAKER_02]: No, only some of the maintenance that's under warranty, of course.

165
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,570
[SPEAKER_02]: But after warranty, you know, we're responsible.

166
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:53,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And how long is the warranty?

167
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:59,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it comes with a two-year warranty, but bumper to bumper.

168
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,016
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are certain components that are longer.

169
00:19:03,163 --> 00:19:04,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me take a look, I'll tell ya.

170
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:17,595
[SPEAKER_02]: The cab, there's a two-year standard warranty with the truck.

171
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:22,318
[SPEAKER_02]: The cab itself has a 15-year structural warranty.

172
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:26,421
[SPEAKER_02]: The body, same thing, 15 years.

173
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:34,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Five years on the engine, five years on the pump, and a 10-year on the pump plumbing, the plumbing itself.

174
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,608
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lifetime frame and cross-member warranty.

175
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:42,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the warranties that it comes with.

176
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:46,729
[SPEAKER_02]: When do we anticipate this pump will be at Engine 4?

177
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:50,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the contract is signed, up to nine months from now.

178
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine months?

179
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

180
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be a similar situation like the turnout gear?

181
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:57,991
[SPEAKER_02]: That being?

182
00:19:59,351 --> 00:20:02,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Turnout gear has been a little over two and a half years, I believe?

183
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:07,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the turnout gear went out, we were supposed to get that turnout gear in the fall, and the

184
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:16,934
[SPEAKER_02]: The distributor kinda messed up on me, so.

185
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:19,176
[SPEAKER_02]: In regards to what?

186
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:19,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Time.

187
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:24,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I was promised it so long and then he just kept moving it, moving it, moving it.

188
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,281
[SPEAKER_02]: For whatever reason.

189
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:29,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just recently sent back all the turnout gear?

190
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,084
[SPEAKER_02]: All of it.

191
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:33,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on the fact that you said there were some patches or?

192
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,047
[SPEAKER_02]: There were several things.

193
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:38,469
[SPEAKER_02]: The suspenders that came with the pants were the wrong ones.

194
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:40,492
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the wrong ones.

195
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:42,113
[SPEAKER_02]: That's number one.

196
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,274
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a certain patch that's on the jacket.

197
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:46,936
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the wrong patch.

198
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:58,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of the lettering and the spelling, which isn't a big deal, but I'm not going to hand out turnout gear and piecemeal it to have it fixed.

199
00:20:58,582 --> 00:21:02,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So we sent it all back, and he's going to fix it as soon as he can get it done.

200
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:03,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

201
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we can distribute it.

202
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:05,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

203
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:10,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, regarding, uh, you mentioned you purchased the washers.

204
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:10,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

205
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:12,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to be located at the headquarters.

206
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:13,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

207
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did not purchase any additional dryers.

208
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:18,035
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

209
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:31,400
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that was our original thought process, but, um, we, we've changed that because the manufacturer and the manufacturer does suggest that you do air dry it.

210
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:36,990
[SPEAKER_02]: for the care of the fabric and you get longer life out of it.

211
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:44,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You can dry them, certain temperatures, certain times, but it is suggested that you air dry it.

212
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:50,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's been the consensus throughout the membership that we do air dry it.

213
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:55,404
[SPEAKER_02]: And how long does it take to dry in a dryer compared to air dry?

214
00:21:56,745 --> 00:22:02,870
[SPEAKER_02]: A dryer could take up to six hours, five hours, air drying it, maybe a day or so.

215
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:08,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So dry, when they put those in the dryers, those heavy-duty dryers, it takes up to six hours?

216
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:09,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

217
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:12,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on how many turnout gears go into the unit?

218
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

219
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:18,463
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you air dry it, it's one day compared to... Well, it's not just sitting.

220
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:29,348
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have fans all... We have the whole elaborate setup that we're going to set up when we... at headquarters, with fans, oscillating fans.

221
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:31,709
[SPEAKER_02]: In the same area where they're housed now?

222
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:32,810
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

223
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:35,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are you going to be doing that?

224
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:43,920
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be housed where the wire department used to be, in the back of my building.

225
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:50,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the plans for the police station, that building is still going to maintain?

226
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:51,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that portion, yes.

227
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,129
[SPEAKER_03]: That portion of the building is still going to be there?

228
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:53,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

229
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:55,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

230
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,997
[SPEAKER_02]: The uh, can you give us a training tower update?

231
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:06,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, training tower, in fact, I placed another call, uh, I was away last week, and I did receive a call from a gentleman from the state.

232
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:16,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, state delegation has been working to try to acquire the property, whether it be through a land swap or some, something, I don't, I'm not really privy to that.

233
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:22,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Uhm, but the gentleman that contacted me, I've called him twice now.

234
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:27,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I called him last Thursday, and I called him again today, and I haven't heard back from him.

235
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:29,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what he's looking for, what he's going to ask me.

236
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:32,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I assume that's plan A?

237
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:34,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

238
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a plan B?

239
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:37,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Regarding what, the training facility?

240
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:38,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

241
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:38,957
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

242
00:23:39,237 --> 00:23:40,898
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the place I, we needed to go.

243
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:42,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

244
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,599
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what happens if it doesn't come to fruition?

245
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we got a problem.

246
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:53,461
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no plan B. I feel very confident that we're going to get the property.

247
00:23:55,841 --> 00:23:57,462
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be helpful just as one member.

248
00:23:57,663 --> 00:23:57,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

249
00:23:58,123 --> 00:24:00,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know there's a lot of discussions going on.

250
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:03,467
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't been kept up on this at all.

251
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:05,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's been kind of dormant, to be honest with you.

252
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:07,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me take a step back.

253
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,792
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have other options, but they weren't.

254
00:24:10,812 --> 00:24:13,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I had three options that I had presented to the mayor.

255
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:17,678
[SPEAKER_02]: This is being the one that I prefer, and everybody prefers.

256
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,820
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two others, but they're not as

257
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:28,419
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not as ideal as what we have currently, what we're looking for.

258
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:32,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to think about them, to be honest with you.

259
00:24:33,486 --> 00:24:33,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

260
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:37,311
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it doesn't come through, you have to have another plan, right?

261
00:24:37,331 --> 00:24:38,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've got two of them.

262
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:41,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they're out there.

263
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:48,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so do we have a timeline when, when this, I, I have, we don't have a timeline established.

264
00:24:48,437 --> 00:24:56,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was one thing the council asked when this, I was also started, I was trying to get the property acquired by the end of the year, as was the state delegation.

265
00:24:57,782 --> 00:25:02,525
[SPEAKER_02]: But here we are today, it's mid January and that hasn't happened yet, right?

266
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:06,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're going to be staring down, uh,

267
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:11,974
[SPEAKER_02]: The current academy training facility very shortly, maybe in the spring.

268
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:14,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

269
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:21,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And the firefighters were promised that this would be a work in progress.

270
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has been.

271
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It really has been.

272
00:25:23,842 --> 00:25:25,663
[SPEAKER_03]: You just said there was nothing's been done.

273
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:26,403
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been dormant.

274
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,345
[SPEAKER_02]: You're dealing with the state.

275
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:31,227
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I do?

276
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:48,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, I, I, you know, I've gone through a whole, uh, uh, period of, of drafting, uh, what we want on the, the, the land, the committee that we had established.

277
00:25:49,138 --> 00:25:56,282
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my deputies spent countless hours, uh, mapping this whole thing out on the property.

278
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:59,344
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we've contacted several different state departments and, uh,

279
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:05,544
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this one more hurdle that we have to get over, and that's what we're trying to do.

280
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

281
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:09,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, Chief, I think we should have a timeline.

282
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:19,453
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have something that we can look at and say we're meeting our target goals, because we have no idea other than to say, well, things seem to be going on.

283
00:26:19,593 --> 00:26:21,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been very dormant for quite some time.

284
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:25,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, I was hoping, and we were shooting for,

285
00:26:26,397 --> 00:26:29,119
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of the year, they will have the property acquired by the city.

286
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was told in the fall.

287
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:31,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

288
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:33,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that didn't happen.

289
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:38,106
[SPEAKER_03]: So come this June, just a hypothetical, come this June, no movement.

290
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:40,368
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens?

291
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:42,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

292
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

293
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:45,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to think about it.

294
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:47,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have to think about it.

295
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:48,655
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want me to say?

296
00:26:48,695 --> 00:26:52,658
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go build it somewhere else and then a month later, then we get the property?

297
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:56,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand, Chief.

298
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:05,744
[SPEAKER_03]: If your plan is to take state property and rely on the state, which you just said, well, it's the state, that's your plan.

299
00:27:05,764 --> 00:27:07,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm relying on a whole host of people.

300
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:11,026
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our own city property, too, that we don't have to rely on the state.

301
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,587
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not ideal for our use.

302
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:14,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It really isn't.

303
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:21,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, as part of building the new police station, the firefighters were promised a bill of goods.

304
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:24,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all heard it behind this reel.

305
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:24,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I know exactly.

306
00:27:24,932 --> 00:27:27,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to make sure that we're following through.

307
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:27,855
[SPEAKER_02]: We are.

308
00:27:28,636 --> 00:27:29,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe me, we are.

309
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:35,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The union and myself and the committee, we're all working pretty close together to try and get this thing done.

310
00:27:36,502 --> 00:27:37,023
[SPEAKER_02]: We really are.

311
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:44,883
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could just keep us updated, Chief, on what's happening, because surely we don't get anything from the administration.

312
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:49,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you want to ask me, I'd be glad to offer anything.

313
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:49,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Call me.

314
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:52,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what's going on.

315
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:57,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but we should be receiving some type of communication saying where we are in the process.

316
00:27:57,946 --> 00:27:58,867
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm asking, Chief.

317
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:00,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's a big request.

318
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:03,050
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, to find out where we are in the process.

319
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,892
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an important training tower.

320
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:11,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, we wouldn't be trying to find a building chief to do it.

321
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:15,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the last four months, you'd be getting the same report.

322
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:17,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

323
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:19,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing has happened.

324
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:21,269
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I would know nothing's going on.

325
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:33,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I don't get anything, I'm not sure what's happening, and I have to hear scuttlebutt from different people saying, some people saying all the process is working well, other people saying... It is, it is, but don't listen to scuttlebutt.

326
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:34,612
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know the truth, ask me.

327
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:35,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you the truth.

328
00:28:35,832 --> 00:28:35,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

329
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:37,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, send us a communication.

330
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:39,253
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're all on the same page.

331
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:44,494
[SPEAKER_03]: My last question, Chief, and I'm sorry to throw all this at you, but... It's all right.

332
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:45,795
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't see you too often, so...

333
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:48,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take advantage of the opportunity.

334
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:49,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing, isn't it?

335
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:50,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

336
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:56,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Chief, we're bonding for a new truck and that's great.

337
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:01,447
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have many, many needs in our fire stations.

338
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:03,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Many, many needs.

339
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:04,377
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

340
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:11,799
[SPEAKER_03]: From heating, windows, air conditioning, kitchens, subfloors that are still sub-par.

341
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:13,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the list goes on and on.

342
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Showers, locker rooms.

343
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:28,884
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have yet to see, and I know you did a lot of homework a few years back on putting together a capital improvement plan, and some of it was implemented, but I've yet to see any request

344
00:29:30,624 --> 00:29:44,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I haven't seen anything, Chief, from you requesting that we start putting some money into these stations that we know, you know, we don't have a plan to rehab all our stations right now or rebuild our stations.

345
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:50,550
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we really need to put together a capital plan to start addressing some of the needs.

346
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:58,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been asking for the funds since the last rehab, each and every year.

347
00:29:59,333 --> 00:29:59,873
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens?

348
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:06,741
[SPEAKER_02]: We all do the budget together, we all know, nothing, nothing, I haven't been a lot of the money.

349
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:08,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking capital, capital plan.

350
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:09,883
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I'm talking about.

351
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:13,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, as you know, the budget is the budget is the budget, it's been the same way for 30 years.

352
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:18,129
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at a capital plan to address the needs.

353
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been there, it's been there, I don't know, it's been there.

354
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:25,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I think we really need to revisit the chief.

355
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,802
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I revisited every budget year.

356
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:32,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking outside of the budget.

357
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:38,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about a capital plan that I do revisit every budget year, whether it be staffing.

358
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:43,535
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment, stations, all of that, personnel.

359
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:46,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the physical plant itself.

360
00:30:46,536 --> 00:30:48,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me the money, and I'll get it done.

361
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:51,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, unfortunately, we don't appropriate that.

362
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:53,359
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from the city administration.

363
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need them.

364
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:02,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to sit down, like this council's been requesting, and put together a capital plan to start addressing some of the needs.

365
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:08,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I don't think we can go much longer with some of the conditions I saw, Chief, honestly.

366
00:31:09,855 --> 00:31:11,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're in the buildings, you see them.

367
00:31:12,157 --> 00:31:12,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

368
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:15,761
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were 100% correct.

369
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:17,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are health and safety concerns.

370
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:18,464
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

371
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:21,427
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking fire alarms in a fire station that aren't working.

372
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:23,770
[SPEAKER_03]: You're aware of that, Chief.

373
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I am, but they are being fixed.

374
00:31:26,212 --> 00:31:32,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're being fixed, but, I mean, we're talking fire alarms at a fire station.

375
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:37,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Chief, Chief, you know, these are important issues, and I know you know the report.

376
00:31:38,014 --> 00:31:39,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knows that more than me.

377
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:39,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

378
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:53,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hoping maybe if it's a lack of the administration to address the issues, maybe we should sit down with the Public Safety Committee, the subcommittee of the council, and start looking at some of these issues that need to be addressed.

379
00:31:54,457 --> 00:31:59,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise we're gonna be facing, like we did with the DPW yard, all of a sudden it's condemned.

380
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the place, you couldn't have anyone in the building.

381
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:09,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're looking at a police station that, quite frankly, probably should be condemned also.

382
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:12,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're gonna be looking at individual fire stations.

383
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:13,808
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not there yet.

384
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:15,809
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not there, but we're getting there, Chief.

385
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:16,389
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not there.

386
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:20,912
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys do a pretty good job keeping those buildings up, believe me.

387
00:32:21,012 --> 00:32:23,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but they're firefighters, they're not maintenance people.

388
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:26,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's part of their duties, to maintain the station.

389
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:31,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, but this goes far beyond paint and washing of a floor.

390
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:40,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about structural, I'm talking about the replacement of windows and doors and a lot of things, Chief.

391
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:41,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand, I understand.

392
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:44,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to have a conversation.

393
00:32:44,907 --> 00:32:45,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

394
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:48,207
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with this council regarding capital plan.

395
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:48,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

396
00:32:48,988 --> 00:32:49,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Be glad to do it.

397
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:50,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chief.

398
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:50,828
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

399
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:52,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Nice.

400
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:53,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Move approval of the question, Mr. President.

401
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:55,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're talking about a pump truck, right?

402
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Del Rosso.

403
00:32:58,691 --> 00:32:59,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Move the question.

404
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:04,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

405
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:23,501
[SPEAKER_10]: If we can, I know that the Chief mentioned, could we get the word out to our state delegation that we get an update from them that this committee, this council is requesting a timeline for the purchase of the land that we've been requesting for some time, and they've done such hard work.

406
00:33:25,342 --> 00:33:28,483
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Council Marks is right about what we talked about.

407
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:34,125
[SPEAKER_10]: The tower coming down and the new tower being built was supposed to be simultaneous.

408
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,846
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we can do that, I appreciate it.

409
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:38,047
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a motion please.

410
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:39,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

411
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:43,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Member Kern.

412
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:43,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Last question.

413
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you President Carviello.

414
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:53,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe our city administration can just update us on what bonds are coming offline this year.

415
00:33:55,182 --> 00:34:03,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we could also, as part of the paper, just get an updated spreadsheet of what we're looking at from now until 2037.

416
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:09,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have that with me, but I'd be happy to provide that to you with what's coming off.

417
00:34:12,012 --> 00:34:13,993
[SPEAKER_05]: How far out do you want it in a couple of years?

418
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:28,200
[SPEAKER_04]: What's coming off the next one, two, three years, and also it is broken down in the system where we can see into the future up to 2037, just the 20 years, so we can see what's coming off each year.

419
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:36,384
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could get an updated one, especially if you'll be coming for additional bonds to group together, if we could get that before the next bond request.

420
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:37,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.

421
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:38,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

422
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:52,472
[SPEAKER_03]: In the form of a motion that we also meet with the chief to discuss a capital improvement plan for the fire department.

423
00:34:52,672 --> 00:35:06,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Counselor Scott Pelley has a motion to get an update from the state delegation on the lands and if you want to make a separate one on the, or you want to run it in with his.

424
00:35:07,643 --> 00:35:09,524
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the two separate issues.

425
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:10,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

426
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:10,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours is for the land.

427
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:12,246
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the capital.

428
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:19,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's vote on the loan order first, and then we'll come back to those two issues.

429
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:27,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight, that this loan order take its first reading.

430
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:29,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:35:53,271 --> 00:36:02,945

[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

434
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:06,610
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor.

[SPEAKER_12]: And on the motion by Councilor Mox that the City Council meet with the Chief to discuss a capital plan.

436
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:18,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you like to do that in the Committee of the Whole, Councilor Mox?

437
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:20,273
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be probably the best.

438
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:28,078
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Mox that we meet with the Chief in the Committee of the Whole to discuss a capital plan, seconded by Councilor Falco.

439
00:36:28,198 --> 00:36:28,819
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

441
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

442
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:32,741
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you got?

443
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:33,622
[SPEAKER_12]: You going to tell?

444
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:41,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, breakdown before any other bond expenditure comes before us, just a breakdown, 20 years of bond debt.

445
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:49,236
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kern, that the Treasurer provide us with a breakdown of all the bonds, the bonds of 20 years?

446
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:52,498
[SPEAKER_04]: How they're looking at it, 20 years out.

447
00:36:52,998 --> 00:36:57,862
[SPEAKER_12]: A bond ratio of what you have on the 20-year schedule.

[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam Treasurer.

454
00:37:07,988 --> 00:37:08,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

455
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:08,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all.

456
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:09,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate it.

457
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:11,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor DelaRusso.

458
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to take papers under suspension and in the hands of the clerk.

459
00:37:17,913 --> 00:37:23,216
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Vice President DelaRusso to take papers under suspension and in the hands of the clerk.

460
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:23,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by...

461
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:31,983
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could, we have a resident that would like to speak, that's actually me tonight, so Andrew will allow the resident to speak.

462
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,346
[SPEAKER_12]: On this suspension, could we get the resident first?

463
00:37:34,506 --> 00:37:34,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

464
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:42,555
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Todd Ching.

465
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:44,256
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 9 Harris Road.

466
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:47,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you members of the City Council.

467
00:37:48,097 --> 00:37:50,137
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here tonight with my wife Emily.

468
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:52,038
[SPEAKER_00]: We live on 9 Harris Road.

469
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:57,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming here tonight to speak about street cleaning and street sweeping.

470
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Harris Road, it's in Hillside.

471
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:03,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Boston Ave.

472
00:38:03,663 --> 00:38:14,673
[SPEAKER_00]: So here tonight to kind of just kind of give some feedback about street thing where on the morning of November 29th, our car was both ticketed and towed.

473
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:19,277
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of happened that we received no real notifications.

474
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:24,702
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, at the time actually weren't aware kind of of some of the city.

475
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:29,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Notifications as far as the email and texting alerts, since signed up for those, they're great.

476
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:33,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely would recommend all residents to sign up for those.

477
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:37,913
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of the ticket ended up being $50 plus the tow was $143.

478
00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:39,834
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm starting a small business, almost $200.

479
00:38:39,874 --> 00:38:42,096
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of money for any resident, I think, to pay.

480
00:38:42,116 --> 00:38:42,777
[SPEAKER_00]: We're renters.

481
00:38:52,725 --> 00:39:03,333
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of really felt that there isn't enough in place for a lot of residents to really know about the schedule of street sweeping as it occurs.

482
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:07,677
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a landline for any kind of landline notifications.

483
00:39:07,717 --> 00:39:10,859
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no signs posted anywhere near our streets.

484
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:19,406
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't regularly commute through Medford Square, where I know there was a marquee posted to kind of look up street cleaning dates on the website.

485
00:39:20,368 --> 00:39:22,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Så, in addition to all of this...

486
00:39:24,021 --> 00:39:52,175
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened is once we even got the ticket, got the tow, we started the appeal process through Park Medford, had originally called them on the phone, asked to talk to supervisor just to kind of give some feedback, was put on hold for 20 minutes and then call hung up on, went in person to their office to then file the appeal, never heard back on the appeal at all, never received any kind of notification back, took basically until about a week and a half,

487
00:39:52,375 --> 00:40:21,641
[SPEAKER_00]: week-and-a-half ago where we received a notice of an overdue citation which did include the phrase quote late fees have now been added and that failure to make payment within 15 days of this date of this notice could result in additional late fees again we never even heard back on our appeal interestingly enough when I called Park Medford this time they responded to say oh sorry about your notice that says they're late fees there actually aren't late fees so don't worry about that you know not

488
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:24,382
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that we didn't really have any other avenues on this.

489
00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:32,444
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously paid through everything, but again, that's $200 we wish we had, but we don't and it is what it is.

490
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:39,226
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to the mayor's office twice now on the issue and never heard back.

491
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:42,527
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to members of the city council.

492
00:40:42,727 --> 00:40:43,327
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank

493
00:40:44,807 --> 00:40:51,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Marks & Lungo-Kern, some of whom were very sympathetic to the issue.

494
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:54,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, it seems like there's more that can be done.

495
00:40:55,135 --> 00:41:01,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I did post something to Nextdoor, which has a pretty large community here in Medford.

496
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:06,865
[SPEAKER_00]: There were really three themes that emerged from that Nextdoor thread.

497
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:18,770
[SPEAKER_00]: was just overall kind of a wide dissatisfaction with Park Medford, and I've noticed Councillor Scarpelli kind of nodding his head on everything, you know, appreciate your sympathy on that.

498
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:29,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of including some of the time it takes also, you know, for them to kind of respond to notifications that around parking permits too, there seemed to be a lot of complaints in their responses.

499
00:41:30,775 --> 00:41:38,438
[SPEAKER_00]: The second kind of overall theme was that numerous people had had kind of issues getting responses from the mayor's office over issues like this.

500
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, you know, a simple acknowledgement would go a long way.

501
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:48,461
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of the third theme was just that there are a lot of stories like ours of people who, especially after they've moved to Medford,

502
00:41:49,181 --> 00:42:03,569
[SPEAKER_00]: have gotten their car ticketed and towed for street cleaning and just not feeling like enough is being done for residents, especially new residents, who might not be aware of Medford's unique street sweeping policy.

503
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:13,916
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking all of this into consideration, I wanted to thank and offer some possible solutions that I think could be fairly useful to

504
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:19,690
[SPEAKER_00]: improving the overall process for residents.

505
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:26,776
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, one is just obviously reevaluating the current street sweeping and how it's done just the twice a year.

506
00:42:27,516 --> 00:42:34,403
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of it's sometimes it's sometimes it's April, sometimes it's May, sometimes it's October, sometimes it's November.

507
00:42:34,923 --> 00:42:40,508
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this by November 29th, our street, you know, it's pretty late in the fall.

508
00:42:40,628 --> 00:42:43,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Even some of the gutters were starting to get nearly full.

509
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:46,913
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of doesn't seem totally sufficient.

510
00:42:47,033 --> 00:43:02,301
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think if we were to move to kind of more of a monthly street cleaning like some of the neighboring cities have, that would also enable us to have street signs that would say, hey, on the third Wednesday, move your car between seven and noon.

511
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:06,463
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, that's on you, because those signs would be available for everyone.

512
00:43:07,223 --> 00:43:13,886
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not something that's within the budget, I think even just sending out simple mail notices to residents would be good.

513
00:43:13,906 --> 00:43:19,789
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just today received in the mail this notice about the recycling, something like this would be great.

514
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:33,435
[SPEAKER_00]: About street cleaning, I think especially in the fall, right after you'd have kind of peak move-in time for new residents who are on that kind of September 1st move-in date, especially kind of in the hillside area near Tufts, which is where we are.

515
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:45,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Second thing too, I think it's just kind of improving notifications around the notices system, kind of those email texting alerts and phone call alerts.

516
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:58,063
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, again, some kind of mailer, you know, and maybe this already happens, but encouraging some kind of mailer to be sent, especially kind of around that September, October timeline so that new residents kind of can know to sign up for those alerts.

517
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:03,904
[SPEAKER_00]: and be more aware of, you know, impending street cleaning and kind of other things.

518
00:44:04,804 --> 00:44:27,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Third is just kind of doing a more thorough investigation on Park Medford just to see, you know, I don't know if there's any kind of SLA in place with Park Medford to where they're supposed to respond to things, to where they're supposed to do things within a timeline, but it seems like there's a pretty clear pattern based on some of the feedback I received on the next door thread where they're just not really doing an adequate job to serve this community.

519
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:42,234
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the fourth thing would just be kind of improving overall communications to the city in terms of more engagement, especially with the mayor's office to be able to raise issues like this and get responses.

520
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thank members of the city council for responding.

521
00:44:47,475 --> 00:44:54,620
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not great that the mayor's office didn't respond to two of these complaints raised to residents.

522
00:44:55,441 --> 00:45:04,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, evaluating new systems in terms of looking at how to engage over social media, over other avenues that maybe haven't traditionally been part of.

523
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:14,975
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that the city of Medford engages with its residents, especially considering some of the changing demographics of Medford, I think would go a long way.

524
00:45:15,975 --> 00:45:21,019
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's everything that I have on my list, and I just want to, again, thank you for your time.

525
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

526
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:26,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

527
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:30,587
[SPEAKER_10]: To our residents, I apologize for what you've gone through.

528
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:39,534
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that I got a phone call this week with a similar concern with a visiting nurse visiting a disabled resident.

529
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:45,597
[SPEAKER_10]: her car being towed and ticketed and not having notifications.

530
00:45:45,657 --> 00:45:57,403
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that there was something in the past that there was some concerns of timelines of posting, but I think that, you know, we've had going back and forth, but that posting that actually

531
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:01,565
[SPEAKER_10]: The actual posting on the street, I think is important.

532
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:05,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I think not everybody has the notification system in place.

533
00:46:06,207 --> 00:46:08,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And some seniors don't see it.

534
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:11,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when you have visitors, they don't understand the process either.

535
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,791
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that these are the concerns that we have.

536
00:46:14,811 --> 00:46:25,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I know we talked about in the past, something I thought was a great idea in the past, was one of my colleagues brought this up as part of the new Medford people that are moving in, a welcome package.

537
00:46:25,797 --> 00:46:36,552
[SPEAKER_10]: where you might have gotten some information about being notified via texting if you had A, B, or C. So maybe we can look into that.

538
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:37,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that...

539
00:46:40,292 --> 00:47:02,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Park Medford has, we've had them in front of us numerous times and customer service issues and maybe it's time that we make it as a resolution that we call for a committee of the whole meeting with the Park Medford people and bring them back in especially, you know, when you're probably going to be getting into one of the busiest

540
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:08,687
[SPEAKER_10]: snow months in February and these issues coming about again.

541
00:47:08,847 --> 00:47:17,219
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that and then again during spring sweeping that we get some resolutions and some ideas that we can help our residents.

542
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:31,694
[SPEAKER_10]: And last but not least, I think that, do we, help me out Mr. President, do we have a liaison from City Hall for the Park Method concerns?

543
00:47:32,074 --> 00:47:38,560
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe that might be put out there too, that we have that liaison that the residents can go to.

544
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's very important.

545
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:43,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So make it as a resolution that we look into some time.

546
00:47:44,706 --> 00:47:50,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Relatively soon that we have a meeting with the representatives from.

547
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:55,774
[SPEAKER_10]: And we could bring them back in and get some ideas.

548
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:59,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that we've had some issues about permit parking residents parking.

549
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:03,019
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had some issues with the sweet street sweeping with the.

550
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the guidelines, when they're ticketing, when they're not ticketing again.

551
00:48:09,224 --> 00:48:15,309
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we can meet again, maybe get some, I know they have a huge turnaround there too.

552
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:24,417
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think I'd like to get an update and see what they've done to rectify their customer service issues that we've had in the past.

553
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:25,498
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

554
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:27,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, sorry about that.

555
00:48:30,414 --> 00:48:31,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you President Carviello.

556
00:48:31,915 --> 00:48:34,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Todd for coming in.

557
00:48:34,637 --> 00:48:38,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he and I went back and forth quite a bit.

558
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:50,728
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not the only one that got told that over the period of time when they were doing street sweeping, but this is a really unfortunate situation.

559
00:48:52,830 --> 00:49:07,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the only way we had to notify residents were the signs in Medford Square, the reverse 911, and supposedly from what I hear, the police were going down the streets with the megaphone.

560
00:49:08,683 --> 00:49:13,187
[SPEAKER_04]: With regards to the complaints I've received, that wasn't the case on every street.

561
00:49:13,307 --> 00:49:28,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe they probably did as much as they could, but there were a number of complaints that came in with regards to no megaphone notification, and that's kind of the last minute notification, and it really helps those that either don't know about the reverse 911 or haven't signed up for it yet.

562
00:49:31,258 --> 00:49:37,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I do sympathize and I think that this city needs to get it together a little better.

563
00:49:38,927 --> 00:49:46,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, getting a response from the mayor's office, that seems to be a recurring complaint.

564
00:49:46,135 --> 00:49:51,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm receiving an email and although Lauren, who helps us out, is very responsive to us,

565
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:58,246
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really unfortunate to hear time and again that people are not getting a response from the mayor's office.

566
00:49:58,806 --> 00:50:00,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that improves.

567
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:15,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've discussed it plenty of times, but I'm not sure if we've discussed the issue with regards to permanent signage and a permanent street sweeping schedule in the last two years since we've had new administration.

568
00:50:15,218 --> 00:50:19,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Council Marks and I, in the past we've been on the council when we've

569
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:22,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Todd said monthly, but right now we do twice a year, I believe.

570
00:50:36,496 --> 00:50:48,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it be twice, three times, four times, or as much as monthly for street sweeping, whatever we can afford, that we make it a permanent schedule and we put permanent notification on our streets.

571
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:50,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the simplest way.

572
00:50:50,202 --> 00:50:54,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if at first it's just twice a year or we can add another.

573
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,245
[SPEAKER_04]: time or two, something needs to be done.

574
00:50:57,265 --> 00:51:01,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a big sign in Medford Square is great, but it's not enough.

575
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:12,268
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't reach people who aren't traveling through Medford Square, and that's a majority of people who live in Medford because people who live in Medford avoid Medford Square if they can, especially during rush hour.

576
00:51:12,848 --> 00:51:15,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that really needs to be looked at.

577
00:51:15,328 --> 00:51:22,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe this council in the last couple years has asked that that be looked into, although we may have, but I know it's been asked in the past.

578
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ask that that be looked into.

579
00:51:24,911 --> 00:51:30,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And my last resolve would be that we also look into our appeal process.

580
00:51:31,015 --> 00:51:41,623
[SPEAKER_04]: When I ever got a second or third email from Todd saying, I haven't heard back from my appeal, yet they're sending me letters with a late fee.

581
00:51:42,383 --> 00:51:43,104
[SPEAKER_04]: That's absurd.

582
00:51:43,124 --> 00:51:51,994
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely absurd and we've complained about it before because we've got the complaints where people, it's taken 4, 5, 6, 7 months to hear back on their appeal.

583
00:51:52,414 --> 00:52:00,924
[SPEAKER_04]: We have somebody in City Hall who looks at each appeal and this is something that we need to get a handle on and a decision should be rendered within 30 days.

584
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:13,932
[SPEAKER_04]: City Hall should be communicating with Park Medfit on these appeals, and notices for late fees should not go out until 30 days after that appeal decision is rendered to the resident.

585
00:52:14,652 --> 00:52:15,553
[SPEAKER_04]: That just makes sense.

586
00:52:15,793 --> 00:52:24,477
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense, and it's something that should have been done from the get-go, and that's something that has to be worked on through the mayor's office with Park Medfit on board.

587
00:52:25,118 --> 00:52:28,059
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that is long overdue, and we need to get a handle on it.

588
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are my couple points, and I thank Todd again for coming up, and hopefully we can get some resolve here.

589
00:52:35,742 --> 00:52:50,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Park Medford, when I emailed them on the specific ticket, weren't very helpful, but there's avenues in place that we can put in place, that the city administration should put in place, so this doesn't happen to residents in the future.

590
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:53,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

591
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:55,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

592
00:52:56,483 --> 00:52:57,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Mr. President.

593
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:02,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I too want to thank Todd and a number of other people that have contacted us on this very issue.

594
00:53:04,631 --> 00:53:16,742
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I would disagree with Councilor Longo-Curran, almost every year for the past 10 years that I can remember, we've brought up as a council requesting the city administration set up a full-fledged

595
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:19,024
[SPEAKER_03]: street sweeping program.

596
00:53:19,884 --> 00:53:34,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was because of these very incidences that we found out that the lack of notification, although the city believes 911 is proper notification, in my opinion, the city now is abusing 911.

597
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:38,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And most people, the minute they hear Barry Clemente, they hang up.

598
00:53:40,098 --> 00:53:49,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's gonna be the method that the city uses to notify people to move their car, or otherwise they'll be towed, it's not proper notification in my opinion.

599
00:53:51,026 --> 00:53:56,511
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we requested year after year, permanent signage is the only way to go.

600
00:53:56,531 --> 00:54:00,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is a large city, seven square miles.

601
00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:03,730
[SPEAKER_03]: 800 streets.

602
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:14,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we need a proper program that residents, because residents, when I talk to them and say, you know what, if we knew what's going to happen, we'll move our car.

603
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:20,358
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the inconsistency over the years that residents don't know what's happening.

604
00:54:20,418 --> 00:54:21,199
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard from Todd.

605
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:26,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd said if there's a sign out there, you know, the third Wednesday of every month, my car will be off the street.

606
00:54:27,384 --> 00:54:28,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's not, shame on me.

607
00:54:29,605 --> 00:54:30,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's right.

608
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:44,877
[SPEAKER_03]: But one year when you have the posting on telephone poles and trees of paper signs, the following year you have just the police going around with blowhorns, the following year they're only using electronic signs in certain locations around the city.

609
00:54:45,517 --> 00:54:49,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not consistent, and I can see why residents are confused.

610
00:54:49,879 --> 00:54:51,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the council.

611
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:54,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to think I'm in the know, and I get confused.

612
00:54:56,301 --> 00:54:57,802
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not rocket science.

613
00:54:58,142 --> 00:55:02,463
[SPEAKER_03]: They do it in every other surrounding community, and they're successful, Mr. President.

614
00:55:02,843 --> 00:55:06,505
[SPEAKER_03]: We only sweep twice a year, and we can't get the program correct.

615
00:55:06,525 --> 00:55:11,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if we swept once a month in the summer and spring months?

616
00:55:13,153 --> 00:55:14,474
[SPEAKER_03]: What would it be like then?

617
00:55:15,415 --> 00:55:16,755
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't even get this correct.

618
00:55:17,596 --> 00:55:29,144
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really have to start off with a program that makes sense, proper signage, proper notification of residents in this community, and once everyone's on the same page, they'll know, Mr. President.

619
00:55:29,604 --> 00:55:38,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I hear from the city administration saying, well, if we do the third Wednesday of every month or whatever it might be, then it's difficult for residents to find parking.

620
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Other communities, they do odd-even street sweeping.

621
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:45,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not taking 100% of the parking away from residents.

622
00:55:45,794 --> 00:55:50,457
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still giving them the ability to park on one side or the other during street sweeping time.

623
00:55:51,257 --> 00:55:52,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the things, really.

624
00:55:53,278 --> 00:55:55,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure why it takes so long to implement.

625
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:03,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure why this administration doesn't see this as a need in this community to implement a full-fledged program.

626
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:11,545
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we started a pilot program back some, I think it's 8 or 10 years ago, to sweep major thoroughfares.

627
00:56:12,646 --> 00:56:14,047
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a pilot program.

628
00:56:14,548 --> 00:56:14,948
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

629
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:17,250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still in the pilot stage.

630
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:19,332
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been 10 years.

631
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:23,723
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't progressed at all in this community.

632
00:56:24,963 --> 00:56:27,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I feel your frustration.

633
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:28,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear what you're saying.

634
00:56:29,405 --> 00:56:32,026
[SPEAKER_03]: The city administration runs the day-to-day operations.

635
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:36,068
[SPEAKER_03]: This falls under the day-to-day operations of the city.

636
00:56:36,968 --> 00:56:43,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're a legislative body and people are welcome to come up, but really this is an issue the city administration should be working on.

637
00:56:45,867 --> 00:56:52,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And to get a reverse 911 call that you may not be, you may be a new resident, not have access, whatever the issue may be.

638
00:56:53,512 --> 00:56:55,313
[SPEAKER_03]: You may just have gone on vacation.

639
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:59,816
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a host of issues, like Councilor Scott Pelley said, you may be a visiting nurse.

640
00:57:00,496 --> 00:57:06,360
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a million different reasons why you may come into the city and not be aware of the program that's taking place.

641
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's unfortunate, Mr. President.

642
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:16,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I agree with Councilor Locco's sentiments on this about the permanent signage around the community.

643
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:23,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that will solve most of the issues that I hear from residents, and I would support that, Mr. President.

644
00:57:25,336 --> 00:57:26,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

645
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:32,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Every year, every single year, we have the same exact problems with street sweeping.

646
00:57:33,656 --> 00:57:36,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And quite frankly, we're just not good at it.

647
00:57:36,778 --> 00:57:45,003
[SPEAKER_09]: It paralyzes IDPW every two years, sorry, every year, biannually, two times a year it paralyzes IDPW and nothing else can get done.

648
00:57:45,023 --> 00:57:48,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And we really need to look at what we're doing and how we're delivering these services.

649
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:52,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Based on the current staffing levels and with the current equipment that we have, we cannot

650
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:59,894
[SPEAKER_09]: implement a successful street sweeping program, which leads us to the possibility that we have to look elsewhere to see how we're going to deliver this service, Mr. President.

651
00:58:00,635 --> 00:58:02,857
[SPEAKER_09]: There are individuals in this community that expect a service.

652
00:58:03,758 --> 00:58:10,103
[SPEAKER_09]: There are individuals that are moving into this community that have come from communities that have delivered great services to their residents, and we're lacking in that regard, Mr. President.

653
00:58:10,483 --> 00:58:13,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of it surrounds DPW and the staffing thereof.

654
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:16,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's safe to say that DPW is the most understaffed

655
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:20,631
[SPEAKER_09]: department in the community, and it's the most vital department in our community.

656
00:58:20,671 --> 00:58:22,452
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the backbone of Medford.

657
00:58:22,672 --> 00:58:23,693
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what makes the city run.

658
00:58:24,273 --> 00:58:26,775
[SPEAKER_09]: If we don't have water, our schools aren't open.

659
00:58:27,115 --> 00:58:29,457
[SPEAKER_09]: If we don't have roads to drive on, the police aren't coming.

660
00:58:29,477 --> 00:58:36,481
[SPEAKER_09]: DPW is the most important department that we have here in the community, Mr. President, and I think we're failing them at this point in time.

661
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:42,265
[SPEAKER_09]: We really need to take a long-time look at the investment that we're making there and the way that we're deploying our limited resources in this point in time.

662
00:58:43,726 --> 00:58:48,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to see a street sweeping program in place that's effective, that's much more frequent than twice a year.

663
00:58:49,646 --> 00:58:57,012
[SPEAKER_09]: that makes sense in that when it happens, it doesn't paralyze the city so that nothing else can happen because that's what happens.

664
00:58:57,052 --> 00:59:05,940
[SPEAKER_09]: We have 20 plus zones in this community that need to get swept and two times a year when this is going on through a period of four, six or eight weeks, that's all that the focus is on.

665
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,142
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all that the focus is on, Mr. President.

666
00:59:08,402 --> 00:59:11,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And with all that focus and all that attention that this program gets, we still do it terribly.

667
00:59:12,365 --> 00:59:13,246
[SPEAKER_09]: We still do it terribly.

668
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:15,628
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can certainly agree with

669
00:59:16,008 --> 00:59:21,911
[SPEAKER_09]: The experiences that the speaker has had, because I think we've all experienced them, we've all shared them.

670
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:32,115
[SPEAKER_09]: The only difference, I think, between Mr. Ching's experience and our experience is that it happens to us every year and we're getting beat over the head with it and saying, okay, this is what it is, what are we going to do?

671
00:59:32,255 --> 00:59:32,715
[SPEAKER_09]: What can we do?

672
00:59:32,755 --> 00:59:35,396
[SPEAKER_09]: We're begging, we're pleading, we're asking, can we do something different?

673
00:59:35,736 --> 00:59:36,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we do something different?

674
00:59:36,857 --> 00:59:40,318
[SPEAKER_09]: And we haven't gotten much further than asking, Mr. President.

675
00:59:40,378 --> 00:59:44,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilman Mox is right, we need to meet, we need to sit down, we need to figure out how we're deploying our resources and what's going on.

676
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:53,243
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think when you look at Todd, it's a perfect example of an individual that's moved here from another community where service delivery has been a priority.

677
00:59:53,663 --> 00:59:55,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And the services that are being delivered are excellent.

678
00:59:55,764 --> 00:59:58,105
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's come to Medford and he's seeing the deficiencies that are here.

679
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:02,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm sure after four, five, six months, you're going to fall in love with Medford.

680
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:03,466
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to love living here.

681
01:00:03,486 --> 01:00:06,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be the greatest place that you've ever been because that's how we all feel.

682
01:00:08,128 --> 01:00:09,830
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to tell you, I had a bad experience.

683
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:10,991
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to really enjoy living here.

684
01:00:11,011 --> 01:00:12,112
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to really like living here.

685
01:00:12,452 --> 01:00:13,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have some work to do.

686
01:00:13,773 --> 01:00:25,442
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can wholeheartedly agree with the gentleman, Mr. President, that we can do a better job in this regard, that we're certainly failing in this regard, and that it's been a topic that this council has discussed for a number of years over and over again until we're blue in the face trying to improve on it.

687
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:29,906
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I support the motions that have been made on behalf of the resident.

688
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:30,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, move for approval.

689
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:34,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

690
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank the President for coming down tonight.

691
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:41,485
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an issue that, like my colleagues have said, it comes up every year.

692
01:00:42,686 --> 01:00:51,013
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes up numerous times during the year, and the city this size, and with, I believe it's over 50 miles worth of roadway we have here in our city,

693
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:55,515
[SPEAKER_06]: We really should be getting our streets swept on a regular basis.

694
01:00:56,136 --> 01:01:00,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think especially when you have, when it's on a regular basis, you know when to move your car.

695
01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:07,382
[SPEAKER_06]: It's automatic, like you said, if it's a certain, if it's a Thursday of the month or whatever they determine, you automatically know.

696
01:01:08,163 --> 01:01:15,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think that we need to, we definitely need to come up with a plan and have something in place where it's done on a regular basis.

697
01:01:16,141 --> 01:01:22,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I also agree that the appeal system, I think, needs to be looked at because that is something that I have received numerous calls on.

698
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:27,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Appeals, people have filed appeals, they're getting no notice at all.

699
01:01:28,409 --> 01:01:36,994
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very discouraging because, you know, we have the parking program in place for a reason and I do agree that we need to meet with them again.

700
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:46,660
[SPEAKER_06]: We met with them, I think it was last year, but I think a meeting on a yearly basis at least is a good step in the right direction.

701
01:01:47,221 --> 01:02:06,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But specifically, I'd like to ask, if we could make this part of the report, when we do meet with the parking people, the parking management company, if we could actually ask them specifically for the number of tickets issued, how many appeals,

702
01:02:09,618 --> 01:02:14,845
[SPEAKER_06]: how they were resolved in the duration it took for them to get resolved.

703
01:02:16,446 --> 01:02:19,289
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to add those metrics when we look at this.

704
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:24,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we need to know, is the parking management company doing their job?

705
01:02:24,614 --> 01:02:26,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the appeals process working?

706
01:02:26,655 --> 01:02:32,080
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like it's not working from the people that I've talked to.

707
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need this information.

708
01:02:34,382 --> 01:02:37,946
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we're going to find out if this is working or not.

709
01:02:38,126 --> 01:02:39,387
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't sound like it's working.

710
01:02:40,468 --> 01:02:49,410
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I'm hearing, in addition to the regular numbers that they provide for their revenue and whatnot, you need to have these numbers as well.

711
01:02:50,070 --> 01:03:07,375
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I could offer a separate resolution and I could put it in writing afterwards, if we could get a cost analysis from the DPW director to actually put a program in place where there actually is signage throughout the community on every street.

712
01:03:08,195 --> 01:03:11,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if we're going to look at this, we need to look at it the right way.

713
01:03:11,756 --> 01:03:16,116
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to have numbers at the meeting to actually see what this is going to cost.

714
01:03:16,516 --> 01:03:18,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there's a cost associated with it.

715
01:03:19,117 --> 01:03:21,697
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be sweeping on a regular basis.

716
01:03:21,717 --> 01:03:25,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, it's at least once a month, but signage needs to be there.

717
01:03:27,378 --> 01:03:36,420
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could have the DPW put together a cost analysis to do sweeping once a month between the months of, we'll say, April and November.

718
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:45,864
[SPEAKER_06]: get how much it would cost to have signage throughout the community.

719
01:03:46,704 --> 01:03:50,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Briefly, thank you President Carviello and thank you Councilor Falco.

720
01:03:50,787 --> 01:03:59,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to ask the, those are good questions for Park Medford, but if we could also get them answered by whatever department head is handling the appeals in City Hall.

721
01:03:59,953 --> 01:04:03,035
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could get those numbers from her, I mean her as well.

722
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:12,801
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be helpful.

723
01:04:12,821 --> 01:04:15,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

724
01:04:15,884 --> 01:04:16,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Falco.

725
01:04:16,584 --> 01:04:18,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So is Allie Fisk actually handling the appeals?

726
01:04:19,307 --> 01:04:19,347
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

727
01:04:19,527 --> 01:04:20,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

728
01:04:20,328 --> 01:04:25,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Neil Osborne actually handles the appeals, but she is the liaison to Park Method.

729
01:04:26,013 --> 01:04:29,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

730
01:04:31,598 --> 01:04:32,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

731
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

732
01:04:34,841 --> 01:04:36,303
[SPEAKER_12]: So did you want to make a motion, Counselor?

733
01:04:37,568 --> 01:04:40,330
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like five motions, so I gotta know.

734
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:45,375
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, by Councilor Scott-Pelly and Scott-Pelly.

735
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:50,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scott-Pelly would meet with Park-Method.

736
01:05:05,604 --> 01:05:09,126
[SPEAKER_11]: to discuss ticketing, towing, customer service issues.

737
01:05:09,146 --> 01:05:14,830
[SPEAKER_12]: We will schedule a committee of the whole meeting with Park Method again within the next couple of weeks.

738
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:15,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scott Pelly?

739
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

740
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:19,032
[SPEAKER_12]: And get that done.

741
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:21,894
[SPEAKER_12]: As amended by Councilor Lonego-Curran.

742
01:05:22,995 --> 01:05:25,496
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just want to make sure our city clerk has the amendments.

743
01:05:28,364 --> 01:05:30,005
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just to meet with Park.

744
01:05:30,085 --> 01:05:31,345
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to do separate motions.

745
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:31,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

746
01:05:32,326 --> 01:05:39,949
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley that the City Council meet in the community hall with Park Medford, seconded by Councilor Marks.

747
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:40,610
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

748
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:41,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

749
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:42,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

750
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,012
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor McCurry.

751
01:05:48,273 --> 01:05:55,258
[SPEAKER_11]: City administration looking to permanent signage and scheduling on street sweeping.

752
01:05:56,158 --> 01:06:07,965
[SPEAKER_11]: And with an amendment is, it doesn't really go with it, but to look into the appeals process and the issuance of latent fees, which really relates to.

753
01:06:08,466 --> 01:06:14,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And that we create a system where those appealing hear about their appeal within 30 days.

754
01:06:16,251 --> 01:06:18,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do the street sweeping one first.

755
01:06:19,536 --> 01:06:26,686
[SPEAKER_12]: The motion by Councilor Longo-Kern that the city set up a system for permanent street sweeping and schedule.

756
01:06:34,363 --> 01:06:35,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

757
01:06:35,664 --> 01:06:36,324
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

758
01:06:36,484 --> 01:06:36,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

759
01:06:37,645 --> 01:06:46,829
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor O'Connor that Park-Metford... No, we look into the appeals process and the issues of late fees.

760
01:06:46,889 --> 01:06:50,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And the issues of late fees by Park-Metford.

761
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:57,994
[SPEAKER_04]: The City Administration work to try to give people notice of their appeal within 30 days.

762
01:06:58,154 --> 01:07:00,455
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I think I would like it to re-read if that's okay.

763
01:07:02,007 --> 01:07:09,514
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's a negotiated term, then our mayor, we ask politely that she renegotiate that term.

764
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:14,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to hear in your appeal six to nine months after you've appealed is absurd.

765
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,703
[SPEAKER_12]: On a motion by Councilor O'Karen, seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

766
01:07:19,723 --> 01:07:20,583
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

767
01:07:21,344 --> 01:07:22,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

768
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:26,789
[SPEAKER_12]: On a motion by Councilor Falco that we set up a cost analysis.

769
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

770
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:35,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, just so y'all know, if you want.

771
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:38,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Nathan Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

772
01:07:39,074 --> 01:07:39,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford.

773
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:43,596
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to the Park Medford website, how can I appeal my citation?

774
01:07:43,856 --> 01:07:49,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Answer, you can appeal your citation online at, and it gives a link, or you can visit the office.

775
01:07:49,578 --> 01:07:53,419
[SPEAKER_08]: All appeals will be reviewed within 30 days, and you will be informed of the result.

776
01:07:54,219 --> 01:07:54,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Go click on the link.

777
01:07:57,459 --> 01:08:02,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Technology server error in slash application resource cannot be found.

778
01:08:02,642 --> 01:08:04,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, it gives you an error page.

779
01:08:05,944 --> 01:08:06,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Will be with them.

780
01:08:06,644 --> 01:08:07,645
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a problem now.

781
01:08:11,027 --> 01:08:13,148
[SPEAKER_08]: But to answer the question, sounds like 30 days.

782
01:08:13,168 --> 01:08:14,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there policy?

783
01:08:20,788 --> 01:08:34,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, I agree, but for some reason we do the appeals here at City Hall, so we have a department head at City Hall that isn't related to Park Medford, and there's a problem there with communication, and you know, obviously City Hall needs to be a little faster on that.

784
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:42,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after, whether it's pending or waiting for a decision, City of Medford should be now then relaying it to Park Medford as

785
01:08:43,065 --> 01:08:54,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's gonna take us another 60 days, hold off on sending a late notice, you know, we have, things are going wrong, like you just read to us, I mean, just, we have, we need to, we need to figure this out.

786
01:08:55,129 --> 01:08:59,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Violent agreement, but just, even their own website, like, right now, if you try it, doesn't work.

787
01:09:00,687 --> 01:09:02,369
[SPEAKER_08]: We will address that.

788
01:09:02,829 --> 01:09:03,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

789
01:09:04,071 --> 01:09:06,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion by Councilor Falco.

790
01:09:07,254 --> 01:09:20,628
[SPEAKER_11]: That was Councilor Longo, but we should add Councilor Falco's request to that resolution, which is the number of tickets, number of appeals, the resolution date of the appeal.

791
01:09:46,366 --> 01:09:49,929
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Mox.

792
01:09:50,349 --> 01:09:52,611
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor.

793
01:09:52,631 --> 01:09:53,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

794
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:12,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew Paul Castagnetti, East Medford, Massachusetts.

795
01:10:13,697 --> 01:10:14,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be very brief.

796
01:10:14,698 --> 01:10:18,500
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important to clean our streets, even if it's only twice a year.

797
01:10:19,001 --> 01:10:21,002
[SPEAKER_01]: After all, we don't want the plague, as they say.

798
01:10:22,623 --> 01:10:30,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say thank you, Councilor Scott Pelley, for bringing up the old-fashioned common-sense approach.

799
01:10:31,499 --> 01:10:33,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been thinking this for years.

800
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,242
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to have a one-tenth of a cent flyer.

801
01:10:38,622 --> 01:10:41,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten flyers for a penny, maybe.

802
01:10:42,324 --> 01:10:52,188
[SPEAKER_01]: To have them plastered throughout on the vehicles the day prior and on telephone poles and, excuse me, Tom Lincoln, but on trees also.

803
01:10:53,608 --> 01:10:56,670
[SPEAKER_01]: At the risk of causing rubbish, however it's not plastic,

804
01:10:58,058 --> 01:11:01,781
[SPEAKER_01]: It will biodegrade and end up in the Mystic River and the ocean like everything else.

805
01:11:03,022 --> 01:11:05,424
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand the shortage of manpower.

806
01:11:05,544 --> 01:11:10,828
[SPEAKER_01]: DPW employees, in my opinion, are overworked and probably underpaid.

807
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:19,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially also when you have absentee owners that have tenants that have no clue.

808
01:11:21,315 --> 01:11:33,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with your present advertising, if it's only twice a year, I would highly recommend the good common sense approach by Councilor Scott Peller, possibly put an amendment to that.

809
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:35,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, thank you for listening.

810
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:36,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

811
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:38,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

812
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:39,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

813
01:11:41,001 --> 01:11:45,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if we could, I know Councilor Falco, did you ask for the number of appeals every year?

814
01:11:48,289 --> 01:11:55,014
[SPEAKER_06]: So how many appeals?

815
01:11:59,597 --> 01:12:11,466
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so, so Mr. President, I think that's going to be very telling because prior to Park Method, as if anyone's been in the city for a number of years, we had no parking enforcement at all for all intents and purposes.

816
01:12:12,267 --> 01:12:16,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And the appeals process, if and when a ticket was handed out,

817
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:28,813
[SPEAKER_03]: That person that was responsible used to be the assistant city solicitor back some years ago, and he would handle all the appeals, even though we didn't hand out a lot of parking tickets.

818
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:42,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at some point they moved it from the legal department to the Office of Diversity and Compliance, and that person who has a full-time job is now responsible for also doing the appeals.

819
01:12:43,237 --> 01:12:57,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And when Park Method came into the community, one of the questions we asked, and I remember it vividly, was the fact that now we're going to have an outside company come in and start doing ticketing, it's going to increase the ticketing tenfold.

820
01:12:58,325 --> 01:13:08,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a department head that already has a job that's doing hearings kind of on the side because we don't do much ticketing, now going to be inundated with the appeals process,

821
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:16,554
[SPEAKER_12]: He appeals, he hears the appeals that Park Method gives you an appeal.

822
01:13:16,634 --> 01:13:21,177
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't like the decision Park Method gives you, you then appeal it to the next one.

823
01:13:21,317 --> 01:13:28,201
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, Park Method shouldn't even be involved in any type of appeal process because they're the ones issuing the ticket.

824
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think they should be involved.

825
01:13:30,662 --> 01:13:37,106
[SPEAKER_03]: But needless to say, we have a department head now, in my opinion, that's probably not able to keep track of

826
01:13:37,506 --> 01:13:48,896
[SPEAKER_03]: The number of appeals that they're getting in that office, and that process, I think, will be telling when we find out how many appeals that that particular department head is handling.

827
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:55,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're going to find out that's the reason why they can't get back within 30 days, which is unacceptable.

828
01:13:55,381 --> 01:14:02,722
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that was the main reason why we wanted this to be a separate entity and a separate body.

829
01:14:02,962 --> 01:14:04,183
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a position in itself.

830
01:14:04,563 --> 01:14:08,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to any other community, the hearings offices, that's their job.

831
01:14:08,523 --> 01:14:11,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to Somerville, go to Boston, that's what they do.

832
01:14:11,884 --> 01:14:15,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Over here, it's the department head that handles appeals also.

833
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:21,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you're going to find the reasoning why these appeals and the communication is because

834
01:14:23,386 --> 01:14:30,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of an adjunct to a role that someone already has, you know, full-time position.

835
01:14:30,912 --> 01:14:31,632
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I want to say.

836
01:14:31,652 --> 01:14:35,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

837
01:14:35,175 --> 01:14:36,516
[SPEAKER_12]: 18-045 offered by Councilor Knight.

838
01:14:37,096 --> 01:14:48,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the city solicitor draft a city zoning ordinance enabling the establishment of taprooms, breweries, and beer gardens in the city of Medford.

839
01:14:48,604 --> 01:14:49,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

840
01:14:49,645 --> 01:14:51,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

841
01:14:51,606 --> 01:14:57,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Here in Massachusetts, there's a great, great demand for craft breweries, especially here in the region.

842
01:14:58,231 --> 01:15:10,479
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts website and the Department of Agriculture, Mr. President, there are 110 craft breweries that are open to the public in Massachusetts, 28 of which are located in greater Boston.

843
01:15:10,579 --> 01:15:13,140
[SPEAKER_09]: We're seeing craft brewery markets share.

844
01:15:14,341 --> 01:15:19,765
[SPEAKER_09]: grow by 32% while large market holders like Anheuser-Busch have seen their market share decrease by 70%, Mr. President.

845
01:15:19,785 --> 01:15:20,065
[SPEAKER_09]: 7%, I'm sorry.

846
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:22,167
[SPEAKER_09]: In 1980, in Massachusetts, there were 50 craft breweries.

847
01:15:22,187 --> 01:15:25,309
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2015, there were 3,739, one of those being Medford Brewery Company, right here in the city of Medford.

848
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:48,767
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a certain economic impact, Mr. President, that these craft breweries are having in the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and I think that the city of Medford has an opportunity right now to get their fair share and their piece of the pie.

849
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:58,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Across the commonwealth, it has the potential to generate 26,000 jobs in the craft brewing industry, Mr. President.

850
01:15:58,295 --> 01:16:01,017
[SPEAKER_09]: 29 cents of every dollar spent goes towards business and personal taxes.

851
01:16:02,737 --> 01:16:08,799
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2016, the craft brewing industry generated $766 million in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

852
01:16:09,759 --> 01:16:12,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been given credit for revitalizing underutilized parcels.

853
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:21,784
[SPEAKER_09]: If we go over to Everett, we'll see the night shift brewery is in an old warehouse that has been abandoned for a number of years, and now it's a vibrant and thriving destination for people young and old.

854
01:16:22,084 --> 01:16:30,947
[SPEAKER_09]: It increases the demand for manufacturing jobs, Mr. President, in canning, bottling, and labeling, which is a dying industry in this region and in the United States of America.

855
01:16:31,747 --> 01:16:36,549
[SPEAKER_09]: And it also increases the demand for locally sourced ingredients to develop the products.

856
01:16:37,529 --> 01:16:45,131
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, to date, has created 7,000 supply-side jobs, such as warehousing and deliveries and trucking, Mr. President.

857
01:16:45,151 --> 01:16:49,493
[SPEAKER_09]: So the craft brewing industry is an industry in Massachusetts that's growing.

858
01:16:49,533 --> 01:16:50,353
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in high demand.

859
01:16:50,893 --> 01:16:55,715
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we look at our neighboring communities, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville,

860
01:16:56,735 --> 01:17:01,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Brookline, Haverhill, Worcester, they all have craft breweries.

861
01:17:01,499 --> 01:17:03,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of which have craft brewery ordinances, Mr. President.

862
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:12,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And what this does is it allows these individuals who are involved in craft brewing, and craft brewing is a certain and specifically defined entity, Mr. President.

863
01:17:12,146 --> 01:17:13,227
[SPEAKER_09]: It's small and it's independent.

864
01:17:14,508 --> 01:17:15,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Less than 25% of it is.

865
01:17:16,953 --> 01:17:20,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Business can be owned by a large entity, and they have to produce small batches.

866
01:17:20,756 --> 01:17:24,539
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really a down-home, community-based type of endeavor, Mr. President.

867
01:17:24,559 --> 01:17:27,121
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're seeing success across the region.

868
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:31,485
[SPEAKER_09]: If we go to Vermont, the craft brewing industry in Vermont is thriving right now.

869
01:17:31,525 --> 01:17:32,085
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a $300 million industry.

870
01:17:33,967 --> 01:17:40,152
[SPEAKER_09]: second only to the tourism industry, and it actually is the equivalent of the money that they bring into Vermont for skiing, the craft brewing industry.

871
01:17:40,792 --> 01:18:00,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm putting this resolution forward, Mr. President, asking that the city solicit a draft of city ordinance to allow the establishment of taprooms and to govern the safe establishment of taprooms here in the community as an opportunity for us to take a look at it as we begin a discussion on zoning and capture some of these revenues that are being generated across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the city of Medford.

872
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:03,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

873
01:18:03,832 --> 01:18:06,735
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Counselor Knight, seconded by Counselor Scott Pelley.

874
01:18:06,775 --> 01:18:07,416
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

875
01:18:07,736 --> 01:18:07,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

876
01:18:08,277 --> 01:18:09,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

877
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:11,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Offered by Counselor.

878
01:18:13,412 --> 01:18:38,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council follow up to the October 17th, 2017 Committee of the Whole meeting and reserve a portion of the February 6th City Council meeting for a presentation on Community Outreach Campaign and Municipal Energy Aggregation, be it further resolved

879
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:50,475
[SPEAKER_12]: that the posting of such be read into the City Council record at each meeting preceding February 6, 2018, published on the City website, and publicized through an informational message.

880
01:18:50,816 --> 01:18:51,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

881
01:18:51,996 --> 01:18:53,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

882
01:18:53,758 --> 01:18:56,319
[SPEAKER_09]: This Council is very familiar with energy aggregation.

883
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,801
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a discussion that we've had multiple times.

884
01:18:59,242 --> 01:19:05,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in 2015, our Energy and Environment Committee began looking at energy aggregation.

885
01:19:07,229 --> 01:19:13,483
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2016, the City of Medford adopted a Climate Action Plan, which included a commitment to reduce our city's reliance on carbon-based energies.

886
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:21,358
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2016, our city's Energy and Environment Committee adopted energy aggregation as its number one priority, Mr. President.

887
01:19:21,719 --> 01:19:25,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Since 2016, it has been an agenda item in every single one of their meetings.

888
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:31,424
[SPEAKER_09]: In May of 2016, we had a Committee of the Whole meeting on energy aggregation.

889
01:19:31,584 --> 01:19:33,285
[SPEAKER_09]: It was paper 16534.

890
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:41,809
[SPEAKER_09]: A presentation was made by the administration of good energy, and the paper was introduced the following week by the mayor to the city council floor.

891
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:46,251
[SPEAKER_09]: The paper was tabled and brought up again in August.

892
01:19:46,931 --> 01:19:54,892
[SPEAKER_09]: The paper was voted on in August and failed, Mr. President, 6-1, Councilor Falco being the only Councilor supporting municipal aggregation in Medford at the time.

893
01:19:56,112 --> 01:19:59,933
[SPEAKER_09]: In April of 2017, there was another Committee of the Whole presentation.

894
01:20:01,513 --> 01:20:05,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper 17382 was referred to our Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, Mr. President.

895
01:20:06,554 --> 01:20:08,895
[SPEAKER_09]: In May, this paper was reported out with no recommendations.

896
01:20:10,192 --> 01:20:19,840
[SPEAKER_09]: In October of 2017, Mr. President, we met with representatives from the city of Melrose who ran the community outreach campaign, and we had a number of questions about how they made their program successful.

897
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information.

898
01:20:23,623 --> 01:20:24,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Councillor Marks.

899
01:20:24,664 --> 01:20:25,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to clarify.

900
01:20:25,845 --> 01:20:35,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that the committee reported out to be sent to a committee of the whole, so there was a recommendation to send it to a committee of the whole.

901
01:20:35,954 --> 01:20:36,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

902
01:20:37,014 --> 01:20:38,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the records reflect that.

903
01:20:39,156 --> 01:20:40,298
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the committee's vote.

904
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:41,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I stand corrected.

905
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,103
[SPEAKER_09]: No recommendations for action.

906
01:20:43,123 --> 01:20:49,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to refer to the Committee of the Whole, but no recommendations to, you know, change the program, ask any questions, provide us with any information.

907
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,796
[SPEAKER_09]: But here, that's the end of it.

908
01:20:51,816 --> 01:20:52,257
[SPEAKER_09]: You are correct.

909
01:20:52,297 --> 01:20:53,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It was reported out to the Committee of the Whole.

910
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if I could?

911
01:20:56,201 --> 01:20:57,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

912
01:20:57,462 --> 01:21:17,737
[SPEAKER_03]: We did ask, I hate to interrupt you, we did ask the city solicitor who did report back to us whether or not that we could file a home rule petition to make this whole process an opt-in rather than an opt-out process, and we did get a response back from the city solicitor, so we did have questions and got responses back from the city solicitor that attended the meeting.

913
01:21:20,539 --> 01:21:28,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Mr. President, if you want, it's 5-9-17 is the date that the committee report was adopted, and the minutes of the city council meeting would show that on 5-9-16, what exactly the committee report said.

914
01:21:29,366 --> 01:21:33,229
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being, I stand corrected in terms of Councilman Marks' regard that there was no recommendation.

915
01:21:33,249 --> 01:21:35,010
[SPEAKER_09]: They did make a recommendation to go to the committee of the whole.

916
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:39,834
[SPEAKER_09]: In the interim, they did ask questions to vet the issue that was before them, so absolutely.

917
01:21:41,275 --> 01:21:53,704
[SPEAKER_09]: In October of 2017, we had a committee of the whole, Mr. President, Papal 17382, and there was a presentation again, and this presentation was on community outreach strategies and municipal aggregation and what they did in the city of Melrose to make it successful.

918
01:21:54,524 --> 01:21:56,746
[SPEAKER_09]: There was some discussion at this October meeting.

919
01:21:57,086 --> 01:22:10,437
[SPEAKER_09]: that we'd like to have this presentation made public for individuals in the community to come and appear before the council and hear what's going on, and learn about the outreach strategy, and learn about what direction the city is going to be going in, or what direction the city may go in.

920
01:22:10,457 --> 01:22:17,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to invite a friend from Melrose, Martha over here, to discuss the community outreach campaign.

921
01:22:17,422 --> 01:22:22,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been in contact with our Office of Energy and the Environment, and they said that the date of February 6th would be fine.

922
01:22:22,867 --> 01:22:31,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I've conferred with Councilor Falco, who has also made some calls on this, and it's an issue that I think that he and I both support wholeheartedly, and I would like to see come to fruition, Mr. President.

923
01:22:32,362 --> 01:22:37,309
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I move for approval on the paper, and yield the floor to the Council, my co-sponsor.

924
01:22:39,231 --> 01:22:40,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

925
01:22:40,113 --> 01:22:43,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Consul.

926
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:52,351
[SPEAKER_06]: This issue has been batted around a number of times, different meetings, and I think we need to find a solution.

927
01:22:53,412 --> 01:22:54,152
[SPEAKER_06]: put this to a vote.

928
01:22:54,532 --> 01:23:01,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the biggest things that came forward was the community outreach campaign and how that was going to work.

929
01:23:01,154 --> 01:23:09,315
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where a lot of the questions were with regard to how it's going to work if we put it in place and how it's going to move forward.

930
01:23:09,335 --> 01:23:12,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of our colleagues had questions on that.

931
01:23:12,116 --> 01:23:19,457
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's important that we have this meeting on the 6th and get that presentation moved forward on this issue.

932
01:23:19,497 --> 01:23:20,297
[SPEAKER_06]: It's long overdue.

933
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:25,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to voice my approval with this as well.

934
01:23:26,282 --> 01:23:27,484
[SPEAKER_06]: And I move approval.

935
01:23:27,604 --> 01:23:27,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

936
01:23:27,985 --> 01:23:28,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

937
01:23:28,786 --> 01:23:29,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

938
01:23:30,288 --> 01:23:31,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, Mr. President.

939
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:34,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we did have a vote on this.

940
01:23:34,394 --> 01:23:38,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this hasn't been an issue that was voted down as Council Nights at six to one.

941
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:48,609
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a vote on the issue, and then we had subsequent other meetings with additional information, and that's, I guess, where the council stands now.

942
01:23:49,470 --> 01:24:02,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if Councilor Knight spoke to Martha recently in Melrose, but I just read an article that I don't have with me tonight, that the town of Melrose has put the program on hold.

943
01:24:02,963 --> 01:24:14,211
[SPEAKER_03]: until at least November of 2000, October or November 2018, they're unable to get a rate that's lower than the basic rate of National Grid.

944
01:24:14,732 --> 01:24:31,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And they thought, the article I read said that in the interest of the rate payers of the town of Melrose, that they thought it was best that they put the program on hold, and I assume from what I read, everyone reverts back to where it was before, and then at some point,

945
01:24:32,004 --> 01:24:37,107
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to revert back, I guess, when the rates are more acceptable for that town.

946
01:24:37,207 --> 01:24:44,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to hear what Martha has to say because these are the very things that I've been speaking about for the last two years.

947
01:24:45,092 --> 01:24:49,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all in favor, Mr. President, of having people have a choice.

948
01:24:49,675 --> 01:24:57,820
[SPEAKER_03]: But in my opinion, when the state legislature created this law and had everyone automatically opt into the program,

949
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't buy that, Mr. President.

950
01:25:01,882 --> 01:25:11,989
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is such a great program, and it may be, you know, aggregating and so forth, then why not have it voluntary that people opt into the program?

951
01:25:12,369 --> 01:25:18,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And once word gets out there that, hey, look, I saved and so forth, the numbers will start to increase.

952
01:25:19,034 --> 01:25:20,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one concern I had.

953
01:25:21,037 --> 01:25:23,401
[SPEAKER_03]: The other concern I had was the outreach.

954
01:25:23,921 --> 01:25:33,134
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have probably the fifth highest, fourth or fifth highest percentage of seniors in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts living here in Method, Massachusetts.

955
01:25:34,175 --> 01:25:42,607
[SPEAKER_03]: My concern is I represent everyone in the community, not just the advocates that want to go green or reduce their carbon footprint, which is great.

956
01:25:43,148 --> 01:25:48,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I represent the seniors also and the people that may not have a grasp when they get something in the meal.

957
01:25:49,516 --> 01:25:57,262
[SPEAKER_03]: That tells them they have to opt out, and this is how you opt out, and this is what aggregation is, and the kilowatts, and they're not going to understand, Mr. President.

958
01:25:57,983 --> 01:26:09,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, depending on the outreach, and the nature outreach, and knowing how this city works, that we can't run a street sweeping program and basic city things, I don't see this.

959
01:26:10,772 --> 01:26:23,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see the outreach working in this community, and I have a lot of concerns regarding those that may not be in the know to opt out of a program that they may not want to participate in.

960
01:26:23,938 --> 01:26:28,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the, I think, legitimate concerns that I have as a member of the council.

961
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:30,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not opposed to this.

962
01:26:31,362 --> 01:26:33,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should do a tri-city.

963
01:26:33,803 --> 01:26:37,669
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's so great to have aggregation, why just Method stand alone?

964
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:39,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's join with other communities.

965
01:26:39,813 --> 01:26:41,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make it even cheaper for our residents.

966
01:26:42,938 --> 01:26:44,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take it a step further.

967
01:26:47,429 --> 01:27:05,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard enough on this issue to know where I stand on it, and the reasoning that I have is the opt-out, which I think is un-American to be quite honest with you, and I also believe

968
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:17,588
[SPEAKER_03]: The notification, how we do community outreach, has always been inadequate in this community, and I can't see this being any different unless someone could tell me otherwise.

969
01:27:18,669 --> 01:27:28,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that reason, Mr. President, I don't support the municipal aggregation, and I've been very consistent on my opposition to this from day one.

970
01:27:29,316 --> 01:27:34,860
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't wavered on this at all, and coming to find out that Melrose, from what I read, now is

971
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:40,291
[SPEAKER_03]: who came before us and said, this is such a great program, now it's not part of the program.

972
01:27:41,672 --> 01:27:43,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that should raise some eyebrows.

973
01:27:43,392 --> 01:27:46,853
[SPEAKER_12]: If you could find that article and send it to the other councilors, it would be appreciated.

974
01:27:47,834 --> 01:27:54,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe if you go under the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, this is how I found it, it wasn't in the newspaper.

975
01:27:54,776 --> 01:28:00,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if you look under municipal aggregation, there's a section that lists all the cities and towns.

976
01:28:00,417 --> 01:28:02,098
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to file an annual report.

977
01:28:02,518 --> 01:28:20,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And as part of this reporting package, there was a blurb, it was only a paragraph or two, that explained that Melrose, for at least the time being, is out of the municipal aggregation business because the rate was not one that was acceptable to their community.

978
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:21,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

979
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:23,678
[SPEAKER_03]: How's the knife?

980
01:28:24,718 --> 01:28:42,123
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my understanding that pursuant to the way that the municipal energy aggregation law is structured, if the municipality that you reside in is unable to secure a rate that's lower than the fair market rate that's out there, then the program stops and everybody maintains in the fair market rate.

981
01:28:42,143 --> 01:28:49,705
[SPEAKER_09]: So the city would be precluded from moving forward if they can't secure a rate that's lower than the rate that's currently existing based upon the current service providers, my understanding, Mr. President.

982
01:28:50,265 --> 01:28:51,306
[SPEAKER_09]: But with that being said, I think...

983
01:28:54,477 --> 01:28:55,879
[SPEAKER_03]: People opt into the program again.

984
01:28:55,899 --> 01:29:03,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if they're coming out of the program right now, they're going back to national grid becomes the distributor becomes the carrier.

985
01:29:03,968 --> 01:29:04,729
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens?

986
01:29:07,098 --> 01:29:10,960
[SPEAKER_09]: If you revert back to National Grid... Everybody's out.

987
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:20,906
[SPEAKER_09]: The community's no longer aggregating the electricity load, so they're going back to the... So to get back into it, what do you have to do, another vote of the council, or what happens?

988
01:29:20,926 --> 01:29:26,229
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a legal question, and that's one of the questions and the concerns that I had, because one of the concerns that I had about energy aggregation was this.

989
01:29:26,289 --> 01:29:31,392
[SPEAKER_09]: We give a blanket approval, and we say, okay, go ahead and go and pursue energy aggregation.

990
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:36,295
[SPEAKER_09]: But then some of the concerns that you have may come up about outreach and the ability to communicate effectively with the residents.

991
01:29:36,835 --> 01:29:39,536
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a certain disconnect between a certain segment of our population.

992
01:29:41,196 --> 01:29:51,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this an open-ended approval to allow this to go on from now until the end of time, similar to the interpretation that we got about the negotiations of the cable contract?

993
01:29:51,778 --> 01:30:04,341
[SPEAKER_09]: So the question that I would like to get clarified from the city solicitor before this is taken to a vote is whether or not the city administration can be required to come back before this council at the expiration of each term of the contract to get the approval.

994
01:30:05,422 --> 01:30:07,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's something that we can take a look at.

995
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:12,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be important, Mr. President, because the program may not be going so well, but we're meeting our goals that are set forth in the Climate Action Plan.

996
01:30:13,229 --> 01:30:20,015
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to be incumbent upon us as stewards of government to make sure that, you know, the services that are being delivered are being delivered appropriately and effectively.

997
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:22,998
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can certainly understand some of the concerns that Councilor Marks has.

998
01:30:23,758 --> 01:30:30,280
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also have concerns of my own relative to the direction that our country is going in terms of its commitment to protecting the environment.

999
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:37,923
[SPEAKER_09]: And our city's commitment that we've made, just saying that we're going to become carbon neutral and that we're going to make a commitment to reducing our reliance on fossil and carbon-based fuels.

1000
01:30:38,623 --> 01:30:41,004
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think it would be great to hear from Martha.

1001
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:45,726
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we can get some information from her as to what's going on in the city of Melrose, why they are where they are.

1002
01:30:46,226 --> 01:30:52,688
[SPEAKER_09]: And although they had a very successful community outreach plan, why they're not aggregating their electrical load right now?

1003
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:57,515
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Nights, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1004
01:30:58,316 --> 01:30:58,997
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

1005
01:30:59,718 --> 01:31:00,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

1006
01:31:02,608 --> 01:31:06,952
[SPEAKER_12]: I know just recently DPW was on Riverside Ave and did some great work filling some of the potholes.

1007
01:31:06,972 --> 01:31:11,815
[SPEAKER_12]: I would ask that a pothole patrol be established in order to look at some of the major thoroughfares throughout the community.

1008
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:39,353
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, both on the Winchester line up by the high school and also on the Boston Ave area of Winthrop Street needs to be looked at.

1009
01:31:39,413 --> 01:31:44,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Grove Street is a complete nightmare with some huge potholes.

1010
01:31:44,774 --> 01:31:47,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Salton Stall to High Street off of Grove Street.

1011
01:31:47,915 --> 01:31:52,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, some giant potholes in that area and throughout the community.

1012
01:31:52,717 --> 01:31:55,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand from talking to

1013
01:31:57,358 --> 01:32:01,982
[SPEAKER_03]: a member of the DPW that it's difficult this time of year to buy the asphalt.

1014
01:32:02,962 --> 01:32:05,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they do go, there's lines to purchase it.

1015
01:32:06,465 --> 01:32:13,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess you can't pre-order or so forth unless you have an area within your DPW that you can do your own asphalt.

1016
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:17,073
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure the cost and so forth with that.

1017
01:32:17,113 --> 01:32:19,875
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is an important issue.

1018
01:32:19,955 --> 01:32:22,137
[SPEAKER_03]: The weather is warming up now.

1019
01:32:22,757 --> 01:32:25,299
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll probably still get some cool and, you know,

1020
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:30,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Inclement weather and snow, but we need to really fix those potholes that are out there.

1021
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:35,779
[SPEAKER_03]: It's becoming a dangerous commute for residents and pedestrians.

1022
01:32:36,762 --> 01:32:38,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1023
01:32:38,543 --> 01:32:51,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I haven't noticed it so acutely here in our community, but in a community to the south of us where their efforts are often touted as being superior and model-like and utopian.

1024
01:32:53,429 --> 01:33:04,253
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought I was going to lose the filling in my teeth today driving through that community with the amount of potholes I encountered in such a short drive.

1025
01:33:05,193 --> 01:33:06,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor LaRusso.

1026
01:33:06,334 --> 01:33:07,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lococo-Carran.

1027
01:33:07,675 --> 01:33:09,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1028
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:11,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Councilor Moxley for bringing this up.

1029
01:33:11,939 --> 01:33:16,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really tough because I think usually come

1030
01:33:18,099 --> 01:33:25,303
[SPEAKER_04]: From March and April, when snow is kind of over, and we start complaining about the potholes and the streets are in rough shape.

1031
01:33:26,383 --> 01:33:29,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're only in January, where we're probably going to see more snow.

1032
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:34,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And the potholes are as bad as you usually see them in the spring.

1033
01:33:34,248 --> 01:33:36,689
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel bad for our DPW.

1034
01:33:37,149 --> 01:33:38,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they're working hard.

1035
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:39,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've seen them out.

1036
01:33:40,391 --> 01:33:44,713
[SPEAKER_04]: They were out in Cruz working on the ice a couple weeks ago.

1037
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:52,411
[SPEAKER_04]: But the potholes are worse than I've ever seen them as early as, you know, mid-January.

1038
01:33:53,111 --> 01:34:03,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only the potholes, but the plows are going over the potholes, and it's just like crumpling on some streets, just rocks crumpling all over the streets because the potholes are just getting dug up.

1039
01:34:03,893 --> 01:34:15,315
[SPEAKER_04]: So I too maybe would just amend this and ask for a timeline of when, I thought it was usually around March and April when we start fixing the potholes, so are we gonna,

1040
01:34:15,755 --> 01:34:23,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to keep to that schedule or are we going to do what I guess Councilman Marks wants us to do and buy some asphalt and do it sooner than later?

1041
01:34:23,697 --> 01:34:39,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And also ask the administration, amend it further, ask the administration should we look into hiring an outside company to help our DPW with this problem because Councilman Marks named a number of streets.

1042
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe I got three emails for different potholes

1043
01:34:42,781 --> 01:34:44,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was the freezing.

1044
01:35:01,267 --> 01:35:03,690
[SPEAKER_04]: What's made it so, so bad, so early.

1045
01:35:04,311 --> 01:35:13,542
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we could just look for some help for our DPW and create a timeline that this can get done, because we're going to see a lot of people having tire issues.

1046
01:35:13,642 --> 01:35:17,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, when you talk about some of these streets, they're huge.

1047
01:35:17,246 --> 01:35:18,327
[SPEAKER_04]: These potholes are huge.

1048
01:35:18,387 --> 01:35:20,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a tire goes in them, we're going to have a problem.

1049
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:32,013
[SPEAKER_04]: probably some small claims in our legal department, and we want to try to do anything to avoid that, even if it is getting some outside help for our DPW.

1050
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:33,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1051
01:35:33,133 --> 01:35:34,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Counsel Knight.

1052
01:35:34,253 --> 01:35:37,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, this I think is a resolution that I've supported annually since my election.

1053
01:35:38,954 --> 01:35:50,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week, we passed a resolution at the request of the highway superintendent that the number be given to his office for anybody that would like to report a pothole, in addition to a C-click fix mechanism that we have on the website.

1054
01:35:51,178 --> 01:35:54,000
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, that number is 781-393-2402, Mr. President.

1055
01:35:54,101 --> 01:35:59,306
[SPEAKER_09]: So if anybody has a portal they'd like to report, 781-393-2402.

1056
01:35:59,326 --> 01:36:01,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1057
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:03,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarbelli.

1058
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:04,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

1059
01:36:04,411 --> 01:36:11,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, uh, this came about, my suggestion came about a few months back when we had the issues concerning our, uh,

1060
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:16,522
[SPEAKER_10]: repaving of sidewalk panels.

1061
01:36:17,242 --> 01:36:27,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And we did a little investigation from some of the communities from the south and that have pothole crews and cement crews.

1062
01:36:27,986 --> 01:36:31,608
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe it was a team of three and one truck.

1063
01:36:31,748 --> 01:36:39,551
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think I still have the numbers that the homework that we did that showed what it would cost for that

1064
01:36:40,771 --> 01:37:00,057
[SPEAKER_10]: That truck and the crew that would work in multiple facets for the DPW, but focused on the day-to-day pothole and then in the spring and summer and early fall working on replacing panels, which would alleviate the every few years of the $250,000

1065
01:37:03,838 --> 01:37:05,620
[SPEAKER_10]: payment out to an outside agency.

1066
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:18,328
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that a lot of the questions we're getting in the last couple of weeks about our DPW concerns about plowing and they don't plow, DPW doesn't get it out there and the complaints about they're not plowing our streets.

1067
01:37:18,348 --> 01:37:21,530
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when they plow our streets, the potholes are coming.

1068
01:37:22,131 --> 01:37:29,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know we're all not saying it's their fault, but the truth of the matter is, again, we have to revisit what they have for staffing and what we're giving them to work.

1069
01:37:30,496 --> 01:37:38,198
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a big, beautiful DPW home, but if we don't have anything in that, what are we doing for them?

1070
01:37:38,258 --> 01:37:55,962
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we as a council should actually look when it comes to budget time and add this to the resolution that, again, the DPW director looks into purchasing with the cost of a crew of three, and they would work as a pothole crew and a cement crew.

1071
01:37:57,702 --> 01:38:00,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighbor communities do to alleviate such issues.

1072
01:38:00,646 --> 01:38:11,979
[SPEAKER_10]: So where you're talking about six guys on the water department that's saying a lot being fictitious here and they're out correcting burst pipes.

1073
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:16,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course they're not going to get out to do a pothole, and we know that.

1074
01:38:17,682 --> 01:38:23,683
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking about individuals that we've been talking about, the sore covers that are falling in.

1075
01:38:23,783 --> 01:38:33,426
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about sidewalks that we're putting into our surprise budget annually to replace panels.

1076
01:38:33,926 --> 01:38:36,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're talking about potholes as early as January.

1077
01:38:36,306 --> 01:38:41,388
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we should actually take an active look at a resolution, not just

1078
01:38:43,628 --> 01:38:48,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if we can put that in a resolution that if we ask the DPW director to look into a feasibility study of

1079
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:11,902
[SPEAKER_10]: What it would cost for three employees, because that's what other communities use, the truck that's used for both the hot top and the cement and the equipment that's needed.

1080
01:39:12,382 --> 01:39:24,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if I recall, and I don't have my paperwork in front of me, but I think at the time we were looking at $250,000 allotted for replacing of the panels, the cement panels.

1081
01:39:24,784 --> 01:39:26,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that was last term.

1082
01:39:26,784 --> 01:39:29,225
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I presented that through a study,

1083
01:39:29,865 --> 01:39:40,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that a neighboring community would be drastically under $250,000 to put crews in place that can do multiple activities like that.

1084
01:39:40,467 --> 01:39:53,350
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think we should start looking long and hard at what we're placing for outside services and looking to see how we can bring it and keep it in our own DPW house.

1085
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:54,471
[SPEAKER_10]: So, thank you.

1086
01:39:57,818 --> 01:39:58,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1087
01:39:58,879 --> 01:40:13,445
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great suggestion Councilor Scott Pelley offered, and maybe when this year's budget comes up, we can stand up as a council and let the Mayor know what we'd like to see within the budget, and that may be a good idea at that point also.

1088
01:40:14,726 --> 01:40:17,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make part of the report, Mr. President.

1089
01:40:18,007 --> 01:40:22,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I happen to live near intersecting State and City Road.

1090
01:40:23,169 --> 01:40:31,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you firsthand, every year, the state and the city debate on who's going to fill the potholes because the roads intersect.

1091
01:40:32,471 --> 01:40:34,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And the potholes just stay there all year.

1092
01:40:34,851 --> 01:40:37,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's many roads like that throughout the community.

1093
01:40:38,512 --> 01:40:50,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And this city has to do a better job in communication with the state highway and so forth to make sure that whosever responsibility it is, we pay taxes, both state and city taxes.

1094
01:40:51,414 --> 01:40:55,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Whosever responsibility it is, it has to be done, and it has to be taken care of.

1095
01:40:56,118 --> 01:41:08,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think as a community we should turn a blind eye and say, well that's a foot onto the state road, which happens to be Middlesex Ave, which happens to be hundreds of people that pay taxes in this community.

1096
01:41:10,291 --> 01:41:17,354
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't go back to them and say, sorry, that pothole is eight inches onto state road.

1097
01:41:17,974 --> 01:41:23,096
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unacceptable in my opinion, and those particular areas need to be addressed.

1098
01:41:23,416 --> 01:41:27,777
[SPEAKER_03]: If the state doesn't do it, the city better fill them, Mr. President, in my opinion.

1099
01:41:28,578 --> 01:41:28,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1100
01:41:29,979 --> 01:41:40,330
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Scapelli, Councilor Longo, and Councilor Falco.

1101
01:41:41,712 --> 01:41:43,534
[SPEAKER_12]: And Councilor Marks will amend it as well.

1102
01:41:45,396 --> 01:41:47,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1103
01:41:49,252 --> 01:41:50,013
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

1104
01:41:50,693 --> 01:41:51,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

1105
01:41:52,174 --> 01:42:04,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I have a resolution here by Councilor Longo Kern, Councilor Knight, Councilor Scott Pelley, and Councilor Falco, all regarding the Murray Hill area, and I'm going to read it all at once.

1106
01:42:10,185 --> 01:42:23,574
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so we'll start with the first one by Councilman O'Connor, be it resolved that the poles at the stop signs at Murray Hill Road and Falzev, as well as Grover and Murray Hill Road, be painted yellow in the interest of public safety.

1107
01:42:23,594 --> 01:42:28,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it further resolved that the lines in the word STOP be painted at that intersection.

1108
01:42:28,397 --> 01:42:30,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, be it resolved that the Department of Public Works

1109
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:35,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Places signs showing where Method starts on Murray Hill Road.

1110
01:42:37,141 --> 01:42:42,803
[SPEAKER_12]: And offered by Councilor Knight, Scarpelli and Falco being resolved at the Memphis City Council.

1111
01:42:43,183 --> 01:42:54,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Request that the Method Police Department Traffic Division conduct directed patrols on Murray Hill Road during rush hours for the purpose of enforcing

1112
01:42:55,382 --> 01:43:00,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Speed and traffic restriction on said roadway.

1113
01:43:00,926 --> 01:43:02,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Longo Kern.

1114
01:43:02,667 --> 01:43:04,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Caravaglio.

1115
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:08,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all got the emails and we know the problems up at Murray Hill Road.

1116
01:43:08,431 --> 01:43:13,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not traverse Murray Hill Road or else I abstain from voting on it.

1117
01:43:14,995 --> 01:43:25,943
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there's a serious problem there and it's something that's Councilor Scarpelli and Falco and I on the subcommittee for the Malden Ad Hoc Malden Hospital site have met with the neighbors and discussed it.

1118
01:43:25,983 --> 01:43:28,085
[SPEAKER_04]: We've asked to do traffic studies.

1119
01:43:28,285 --> 01:43:29,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was done during the vacation week.

1120
01:43:30,466 --> 01:43:32,848
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully we can get another study done out there.

1121
01:43:33,188 --> 01:43:38,072
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are just simple approaches that the residents are requesting.

1122
01:43:38,092 --> 01:43:39,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like there's a

1123
01:43:40,213 --> 01:43:48,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Tremendous amount of traffic there and people are not adhering to safety rules of the road, which is stop at a stop sign.

1124
01:43:49,081 --> 01:43:55,947
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has happened where other residents on different streets have made suggestions and the suggestions have helped.

1125
01:43:56,047 --> 01:43:59,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can paint the poles yellow, I don't think that's too much to ask.

1126
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:06,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And also there's no lines where usually stop sign has a line where you come up and you stop the line and you proceed.

1127
01:44:06,376 --> 01:44:08,919
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no lines at these two intersections.

1128
01:44:08,979 --> 01:44:18,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's something that can easily help with the not stopping at stop sign problem as well as the word stop.

1129
01:44:18,228 --> 01:44:20,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Just anything to make it more clear to the

1130
01:44:21,451 --> 01:44:23,112
[SPEAKER_04]: driver that you need to stop.

1131
01:44:24,313 --> 01:44:26,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Safety needs to be adhered to.

1132
01:44:27,214 --> 01:44:35,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I sent an email to Sergeant Hartnett with regards to, I'm not sure if we have that as a result, but that we step up enforcement.

1133
01:44:35,779 --> 01:44:41,982
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the two or three emails, complaints we've got with regards to people just wanting more enforcement.

1134
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:45,024
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully Murray Hill Road can get a little bit more enforcement.

1135
01:44:45,464 --> 01:44:45,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1136
01:44:46,424 --> 01:44:52,506
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Longo Kern, Scappelli, Falco, and Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1137
01:44:52,566 --> 01:44:53,266
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

1138
01:44:54,066 --> 01:44:55,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

1139
01:44:55,167 --> 01:45:02,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Offered by Councilor Knight, being resolved that the Memphis City Council wish Lorraine Miles a happy 75th birthday.

1140
01:45:02,609 --> 01:45:03,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

1141
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:10,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1142
01:45:10,993 --> 01:45:15,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Lorraine Miles had a very momentous 75th birthday just this past week.

1143
01:45:15,615 --> 01:45:17,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And if anybody's involved in the St.

1144
01:45:17,496 --> 01:45:24,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Joseph's community or has grown up in the Lawrence Estates area by Lawrence Memorial Hospital, they have known Mrs. Miles one way or another.

1145
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:26,521
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a great woman, a great person.

1146
01:45:26,561 --> 01:45:28,762
[SPEAKER_09]: She's lived up on Summit Road for a very long time.

1147
01:45:28,802 --> 01:45:29,462
[SPEAKER_09]: And prior to that,

1148
01:45:31,063 --> 01:45:35,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Changing her name to Miles, she was a PECOS, and we all know a number of PECOSes here in the community as well, Mr. President.

1149
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:38,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Lorraine's a great person, a great friend.

1150
01:45:38,307 --> 01:45:44,371
[SPEAKER_09]: She's someone that I was very happy to reconnect with on the campaign trail several years ago after knowing her as a child.

1151
01:45:44,971 --> 01:45:49,293
[SPEAKER_09]: And on a lighter note, Mr. President, she's also the mother of school committee person Kathy Kretz.

1152
01:45:49,894 --> 01:45:58,118
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in wishing Lorraine a very happy 75th birthday and wish her another happy and healthy 75 more.

1153
01:45:59,579 --> 01:46:00,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Consulate.

1154
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:03,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, happy birthday to her.

1155
01:46:03,862 --> 01:46:06,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, Consulate General, I didn't see the paper in the back you had here.

1156
01:46:08,246 --> 01:46:11,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, offered by Consulate General, we have resolved that...

1157
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:18,021
[SPEAKER_12]: One of every three or four traffic commission meetings be held at a time that is convenient for some of our residents.

1158
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:19,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Longo Kern.

1159
01:46:20,003 --> 01:46:22,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1160
01:46:22,505 --> 01:46:30,652
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that is always a complaint of residents who have a traffic commission issue and they work full time and can't make it to a two o'clock meeting.

1161
01:46:31,132 --> 01:46:38,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe this generated from today with regards to complaints about the speeding and traffic on Ashland Road.

1162
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:48,685
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would just ask that one of every three or four meetings, if we can again ask the Traffic Commission, if they can move that one of every three or four meetings to 6 p.m.

1163
01:46:48,725 --> 01:46:51,687
[SPEAKER_04]: in the evening, I think that would be very beneficial.

1164
01:46:51,767 --> 01:47:04,214
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of things that have to be done with the Traffic Commission require petitions and community input, and it's really hard to ask for community input and for people to give their concerns and suggestions when your meetings are at 2 p.m.

1165
01:47:04,734 --> 01:47:06,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that's when a number of the

1166
01:47:08,036 --> 01:47:31,145
[SPEAKER_04]: um members are actually working but to ask for one meeting out of every three or four to be even if it's at five thirty five thirty six six thirty in the evening to allow our residents to get down there um i know council curvil you there frequently and i've attended traffic commission meetings but we have to put in our book and make sure we don't schedule anything else and we're lucky we

1167
01:47:31,545 --> 01:47:37,487
[SPEAKER_04]: We work locally, but residents work all over the place, and they have a right to be heard.

1168
01:47:37,587 --> 01:47:50,210
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's an issue with speeding or signage or any suggestion or recommendation or request that they have, they should be able to be heard, and sometimes it's impossible due to work schedules.

1169
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:57,733
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would really make this suggestion, and hopefully the administration can get behind this and request that our traffic commission meet

1170
01:48:00,077 --> 01:48:01,639
[SPEAKER_04]: couple times a year in the evening.

1171
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:02,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1172
01:48:02,821 --> 01:48:03,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1173
01:48:03,922 --> 01:48:05,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1174
01:48:06,486 --> 01:48:17,841
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2016, I believe this council supported a resolution requesting that the administration move all meetings to a time that would be feasible for an individual that works a normal work week to be able to attend after hours.

1175
01:48:18,401 --> 01:48:28,748
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that the traffic commission is one of the last commissions or boards in the community that's yet to adjust their schedule to allow for that.

1176
01:48:29,709 --> 01:48:33,792
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. President, this is a reiteration of a previous issue.

1177
01:48:33,872 --> 01:48:38,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we've had a number of boards and commissions that have been willing to comply with this request, and why not the traffic commission?

1178
01:48:38,795 --> 01:48:42,498
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I wholeheartedly support the resolve and move for approval.

1179
01:48:43,163 --> 01:48:43,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

1180
01:48:44,263 --> 01:48:45,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1181
01:48:45,044 --> 01:48:47,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say that I support this resolution.

1182
01:48:47,985 --> 01:48:52,106
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about making government more accessible and easily accessible.

1183
01:48:52,786 --> 01:48:55,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people work at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

1184
01:48:56,007 --> 01:48:57,688
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not close to home.

1185
01:48:58,028 --> 01:48:59,288
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just makes sense.

1186
01:48:59,388 --> 01:49:03,310
[SPEAKER_06]: We should be having meetings, or at least a percentage of the meetings.

1187
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:05,150
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's quarterly, I think that's a great idea.

1188
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:09,752
[SPEAKER_06]: We should have them in the evening so people can come to those meetings and be part of city government.

1189
01:49:10,472 --> 01:49:12,353
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to go on record as supporting this.

1190
01:49:12,373 --> 01:49:12,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1191
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:16,596
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion of Councillor Lungo-Kearns, seconded by Councillor Knight.

1192
01:49:16,656 --> 01:49:17,276
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favour?

1193
01:49:17,757 --> 01:49:17,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

1194
01:49:17,877 --> 01:49:18,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

1195
01:49:18,657 --> 01:49:33,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Offered by Councillor Lungo-Kearns, be it resolved that speeding be enforced on Ashland Street, be it further resolved that the speed warning sign be placed on Ashland Street in the interest of public safety.

1196
01:49:33,349 --> 01:49:34,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Councillor Lungo-Kearns.

1197
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:35,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1198
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:38,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, a complaint with regards to Ashland.

1199
01:49:39,011 --> 01:49:40,792
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could get a speed monitor sign.

1200
01:49:40,852 --> 01:49:41,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have two now.

1201
01:49:41,992 --> 01:49:48,034
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could request that Sergeant Hartnett place one for a week or two on Ashland, try to calm that.

1202
01:49:48,814 --> 01:49:52,675
[SPEAKER_04]: The traffic is one thing I did request today.

1203
01:49:52,695 --> 01:49:59,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was, we had discussed it a few weeks ago with regards to trying to deter ways from

1204
01:50:00,726 --> 01:50:02,427
[SPEAKER_04]: directing people down certain roads.

1205
01:50:02,627 --> 01:50:06,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Ashland and Murray Hill Road, I don't believe you can because there's no restrictions on those roads.

1206
01:50:07,229 --> 01:50:10,671
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did, I did ask, um, Southern Heart Net to do that.

1207
01:50:10,751 --> 01:50:15,993
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we could get some enforcement just to calm the speeding, um, that's obviously first step.

1208
01:50:16,114 --> 01:50:21,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And second step would be obviously to try to deter the traffic, which we need to do through the traffic commission.

1209
01:50:21,296 --> 01:50:25,878
[SPEAKER_04]: But enforcement is something that people are really asking for.

1210
01:50:25,918 --> 01:50:27,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully that can take place.

1211
01:50:27,739 --> 01:50:28,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1212
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:29,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

1213
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:40,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I'd just like to amend the paper to request that a traffic count be conducted on the street so we can see how many vehicles are actually traveling down there during the rush hour periods to see if we can come up with a data-driven solution.

1214
01:50:40,348 --> 01:50:41,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1215
01:50:41,989 --> 01:50:47,413
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councillor Lingo-Kernan as amended by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Falco, all those in favour?

1216
01:50:48,153 --> 01:50:50,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Mr. President, Christopher Morris was a...

1217
01:51:06,402 --> 01:51:16,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Long time West Medford resident, but many of us here in the community wouldn't know that because he spent the majority of his time at La Conte and Flynn skating rinks.

1218
01:51:16,325 --> 01:51:25,067
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a hockey nut, always down there giving his time to the kids, Mr. President, and he unexpectedly passed away this past week, and he was just a great gentleman.

1219
01:51:25,087 --> 01:51:32,069
[SPEAKER_09]: He was someone that I always enjoyed seeing, I always enjoyed having conversation with, and he's going to be sadly missed.

1220
01:51:32,109 --> 01:51:35,330
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my fondest memories of Chris is when the Bruins won the Stanley Cup.

1221
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:50,275
[SPEAKER_09]: And Chris had seats right there up against the glass in the corner, and when they put out the Bruins Stanley Cup video, there's Chris captured in the video after a goal scored, you know, screaming, spit flying, banging on his chest like a hockey nut.

1222
01:51:50,335 --> 01:51:58,458
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. President, just some great memories of a good friend, and I was going to be sadly missed, and I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in extending our deepest condolences to the family.

1223
01:52:00,593 --> 01:52:03,536
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can, I'd like to bring this up.

1224
01:52:04,356 --> 01:52:05,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I've known Chris for a long time.

1225
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:20,511
[SPEAKER_10]: What I will tell you is that when you see the impact he's made with kids, and you can see with my son John's friends, that's what they're talking about, what kind of a positive impact he made on their lives.

1226
01:52:21,091 --> 01:52:23,914
[SPEAKER_10]: As a youth hockey coach at Mefford Rec Hockey.

1227
01:52:24,114 --> 01:52:27,157
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it's not just one game.

1228
01:52:27,197 --> 01:52:33,704
[SPEAKER_10]: You would see Chris and Billy Ivey, another Mefford resident, pounding the glass and were very visible at all the Bruins games.

1229
01:52:33,764 --> 01:52:38,568
[SPEAKER_10]: A great loss and a great person, so he'll be missed.

1230
01:52:39,609 --> 01:52:44,975
[SPEAKER_12]: On my own behalf, I've known Chris since he was a child, seeing him at the rink all the time with my kids.

1231
01:52:45,715 --> 01:52:51,400
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this whole family, and his dad just passed away recently, so again, condolences to the family.

1232
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,962
[SPEAKER_12]: And before we do that, we have one more here.

1233
01:52:55,143 --> 01:53:07,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Offered by Councilor DelaRusso, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council offer its sincere condolences to the family of Joseph Tedda, a long-time Method resident and member of the Auxiliary Police Force.

1234
01:53:11,774 --> 01:53:23,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, we can be grateful to Joe for his commitment in this community, his activity in the Auxiliary Police Department.

1235
01:53:23,983 --> 01:53:34,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly many of his colleagues turned out under the direction of Commandant Greenwood of Medford Auxiliary Police, and we can be grateful for Joseph

1236
01:53:35,712 --> 01:53:47,518
[SPEAKER_13]: so many ways in his involvement in the police motorcycle group that honored veterans and so many civic engagements.

1237
01:53:48,078 --> 01:53:53,741
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're grateful to him for his service to our country and to this city.

1238
01:53:56,472 --> 01:54:08,303
[SPEAKER_12]: And one more, offered by Councilor DelaRusso, be it resolved that the City Council send its offers and say condolences to the family of Margaret Donovan, long time ever resident and active member of St.

1239
01:54:08,343 --> 01:54:11,426
[SPEAKER_12]: George Parish and other civic organizations.

1240
01:54:11,486 --> 01:54:12,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor DelaRusso.

1241
01:54:12,707 --> 01:54:15,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, a wonderful woman, a lovely person.

1242
01:54:17,858 --> 01:54:18,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Mischievous and fun.

1243
01:54:19,819 --> 01:54:20,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Very active here.

1244
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:21,980
[SPEAKER_13]: I see her every year.

1245
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:29,865
[SPEAKER_13]: She'd be here to help with the decoration for Christmas and the trees here with the Jingle Bell Festival.

1246
01:54:30,325 --> 01:54:31,866
[SPEAKER_13]: And she was certainly a staple at St.

1247
01:54:31,886 --> 01:54:35,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Joseph's Parish throughout the years, raising her large family.

1248
01:54:36,289 --> 01:54:37,569
[SPEAKER_13]: She was committed to this community.

1249
01:54:38,630 --> 01:54:40,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Wonderful, lovely, thoughtful woman.

1250
01:54:40,691 --> 01:54:40,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Very good.

1251
01:54:40,951 --> 01:54:42,092
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Margaret personally.

1252
01:54:42,152 --> 01:54:43,733
[SPEAKER_12]: She'd always tell my wife she was going to steal me.

1253
01:54:45,258 --> 01:54:45,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Records.

1254
01:55:08,690 --> 01:55:09,451
[SPEAKER_12]: The past two.

1255
01:55:10,471 --> 01:55:11,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Counselor Falco.

1256
01:55:12,052 --> 01:55:12,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Counselor Falco.

1257
01:55:13,233 --> 01:55:14,394
[SPEAKER_12]: How have you filed those records?

1258
01:55:14,775 --> 01:55:15,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1259
01:55:15,795 --> 01:55:17,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I reviewed the records.

1260
01:55:17,116 --> 01:55:19,038
[SPEAKER_06]: They appear to be in order, and I move approval.

1261
01:55:20,239 --> 01:55:22,380
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Counselor Falco that we approve the records.

1262
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:23,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by Counselor Scott Pelley.

1263
01:55:24,202 --> 01:55:25,362
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

1264
01:55:25,462 --> 01:55:25,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

1265
01:55:25,923 --> 01:55:27,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion by Counselor Knight to adjourn.

1266
01:55:27,804 --> 01:55:29,025

01:55:29,105 --> 01:55:29,726

1268
01:55:29,746 --> 01:55:30,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

1269
01:55:31,247 --> 01:55:31,967
[SPEAKER_12]: You are great.

1270
01:55:31,987 --> 01:55:32,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Meeting adjourned.

1271
01:55:32,748 --> 01:55:33,108
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried.
