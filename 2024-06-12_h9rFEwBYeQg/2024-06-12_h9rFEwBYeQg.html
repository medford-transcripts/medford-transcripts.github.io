 I was informed of this wonderful news that we have two amazing Method residents that are sharing their 70th wedding anniversary, and I wanted just to express our deepest happiness for them.
 We know that they have three very proud children, Josie, Janet, and Paul.
 They wanted to make sure that their parents were recognized and just an amazing accomplishment.

 So I just wanted to share that.
 Thank you, Mr. President.

 24409 offered by Council President Behrs.
 Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate the Medford High School Class of 2024 on their graduation and send them our best wishes as they begin their next adventure.
 We just had graduation last week for the Medford High School class of 2024, and I'm going to recognize Councillor Singh.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=183.953s">[Tseng]</a>:  Thank you, Councilor Behrs, President Behrs, for putting this on the agenda.
 If you look at the year of graduation, 2024, if you do the math and subtract four, you'll realize that these folks entered high school during the pandemic, during the early days of the pandemic.
 I think it's a testament to their hard work and to the hard work of their teachers as well, that they've made it through and are going really spectacular places.
 If you look at the futures of our students, a lot of them are taking on great technical work.
 They're great students who are going to top universities in this country.
 I think it really highlights and showcases what Medford can be when we pull together.
 despite the difficult circumstances, despite unideal circumstances, we can still really make an impact on this world.
 So I'm really proud of these students.
 I know Counselor Behrs and I both had the opportunity to read a bunch of scholarship essays for a scholarship, and it was so hard, harder than, you know, than ever to choose scholarship winners because
 the work that these students are doing in class and outside of class, their leadership in extracurricular activities, community service, giving back to Medford is really just remarkable.
 So thank you for putting this on.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=262.617s">[Bears]</a>:  Thank you, Councilor Sang.
 Any further discussion?
 I wanna send my congratulations as well.
 Very impressive group of students, regardless of what they may be doing after.
 I just hope that they will contribute some of their great success to our community.

 We had Medford Porch Fest recently.
 It was an incredible success.
 We saw, I think, over a hundred locations hosting music.
 I managed to get to three of them, and it was just a really wonderful day for our city to see so many people coming together and out in the streets and just making a great show of Medford's arts, culture, and community.
 Any further discussion?

 You know, this is the type of thing that Medford residents have been wanting to see more of for a very long time, and it's great to see this event growing and flourishing more and more every year.
 So thank you and my congratulations to the organizers and to all of the musical acts.

 You are hereby notified that by order of the Medford City Council, a public hearing will be held in the Howard F. Alderman Memorial Chambers and by Zoom at 7 p.m.
 on Tuesday, June 11th, 2024, on a petition filed by the Massachusetts Electric Company, DBA, National Grid, and Verizon New England, Incorporated, to add one additional joint owned pole located at 171 Park Street, Medford, MA 02155, and permission to locate the wires
 including the necessary sustaining and protecting fixtures along and across Park Street.
 National Grid is petitioning to install a new 40-foot Class 3 wood pole at 171 Park Street in order to install a new 50 kilovolt amp transformer to offload existing overloaded transformers on Park Street.

 The petition has been filed in accordance with the plan marked National Grid Plan Number WR30955.

 Wherefore, I praise that after due notice and hearing as provided by law, it be granted a location for and permission to erect and maintain poles and wires together with such sustaining and protecting fixtures as it may find necessary.
 Said poles to be erected substantially in accordance with the plan filed here with Mark Park Street, Medford, Massachusetts.
 Also for permission to lay and maintain underground laterals, cables, and wires in the above or intersecting public ways for the purpose of making connections with such poles and buildings.
 as each of said petitioners may desire for distributing purposes.
 Approved by the superintendent of wires approved chief engineer with the following conditions.
 The grant of location is limited to one additional joint owned utility pole located within the sidewalk between 179 and 171 park street labeled P three nine zero nine one dash one two.
 Before starting work, the contractor shall notify dig safe and obtain all applicable right of way permits from the engineering division.
 The project must obtain a public right of way occupancy PRO permit pursuant to section 74
 dash one for one of the city ordinances prior to commencing work.
 Three, no other utility structures, conduits, duct banks, pipes, or any other appurtenances are adversely impacted.
 National Grid shall ensure that all sewer, water, and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation.
 Four, placement of the joint owned utility pole must provide at least 36 inch clearance of accessible travel path around the structure in accordance with ADA regulations and city standards.

 Any concrete sidewalk damage during this work must be replaced in kind and cleanly cut at the control joints.

 Thank you for being here.

 And if you could just describe the project and give us any information, and then we can open the public hearing.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=714.446s">[Hansel]</a>:  Cam Hansel from National Grid.
 So basically the project is to install a new pole because the transformer that feeds that area is already overloaded.
 And one of the residents is doing a major upgrade to their service.
 So that wouldn't be sustainable, which is why the new pole and transformer are needed.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=737.218s">[Bears]</a>:  Okay.
 Do we have the city engineer available to discuss the conditions?
 We do have the recommendation of the city engineer with the conditions, but I did want to give him a check in a second.
 Do we have any questions from councilors for the petitioner before we open the public hearing?
 Vice President Collins.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=755.904s">[Collins]</a>:  Thank you, President Burris.
 Thank you for being here.
 Just two quick questions.
 When is the work plan to be done?
 And I noted the recommendations around sidewalk restoration.
 I'm just curious how much of the sidewalk is going to be restored?
 Is it just the area immediately around the pole or is it more of the block?
 If you happen to know.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=776.932s">[Hansel]</a>:  I know the area around the pole will be restored.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=781.755s">[Collins]</a>:  What other areas were you... Or just how far up and down the sidewalk will the restoration be extending, or is it just gonna be the area immediately around the pole?
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=792.183s">[Hansel]</a>:  Yeah, the whole area around the pole will be restored.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=794.424s">[Collins]</a>:  Okay.
 Thank you.
 And when is the work planned for?
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=802.025s">[Hansel]</a>:  don't have that information.
 That's up to the availability of the line crews.
 So I can give you that.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=809.128s">[Bears]</a>:  Okay.
 Any further questions for the petitioner?
 Seeing that, I just wanted to note for the scheduling purposes, the condition of coordinating with the police department traffic sergeants.
 And I did have one question on the sidewalk restoration of the temporary patch located at the utility risers on P3092.
 Could you go into that anymore?
 It is a required condition of the project.
 Oh, was that another patch that was right next to the- I think it would be nearby, but it seems like it has the temporary is still there and it needs to be permanently filled.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=847.084s">[Hansel]</a>:  Yeah, that will be filled in as well or restored as well.
 Okay.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=851.468s">[Bears]</a>:  Thank you.
 At this time, I'm going to declare a public hearing open for anyone in favor, in opposition, or who otherwise has questions about this project.
 Public hearing is open.
 Are you in favor of the project?
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=865.03s">[Hansel]</a>:  Yes.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=865.271s">[Bears]</a>:  Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor, in opposition, or who otherwise has questions about this project?
 Seeing none in the room, I'm going to check Zoom.
 I have one question here.
 I'm going to recognize Klein 170-172.
 Please state your name and address for the record after I request to unmute you.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=901.447s">[Klein]</a>:  Hi, my name is Ralph Klein.
 I reside at 170-172 Park Street, Medford, Mass.
 My questions are, there was a utility pole located on the opposite side of the street, directly where they're going to put the pole.
 So it's on the even side of Park Street.
 There's a pole existing now that services more than Park Street.
 It runs up a right of way.
 So when you put right of way in there, I'm questioning is whether they're going to run wires up to service Salem Street as well.
 They said it's going to service Park Street, but I want that clarified.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=942.022s">[Bears]</a>:  Do you have any response to the question about whether this is going to serve as a Park Street or other streets?
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=949.669s">[Hansel]</a>:  No, just be Park Street.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=953.192s">[Klein]</a>:  At this time, it services houses on Salem Street.
 I don't think it's for National Grid.
 It's for cable services at this time.
 But if they upgrade the transformers, they may decide to run more wires about
 of the runaway?
 Across our property, right of way property for 174, 170, 172 and 178 Park Street.
 I had an issue where I had 34 wires running up the driveway.
 24 of them were dead.
 I don't want this to repeat itself because the wires are low hanging.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=992.11s">[Bears]</a>:  Is there any intent to run wires across the street to the other side of the street to service properties on Salem Street?
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=999.748s">[Hansel]</a>:  No, the pole will just be in the existing electric line where the existing poles already are.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1006.93s">[Bears]</a>:  Okay.
 Mr. Klein, I think that's a different pole and a different company.
 It sounds like as well.
 It sounds like that.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1013.691s">[Klein]</a>:  No, it's, it's all national grid.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1017.372s">[Bears]</a>:  It's all national grid.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1018.212s">[Klein]</a>:  You're a national grid.
 Why did it run off that property off that pole?
 It's the front of my home.
 I think I know what I see.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1027.214s">[Bears]</a>:  Okay.
 Let's just interpreting what you said.
 I have the petitioner here saying they do not intend to run wires across the street onto your property.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1038.792s">[Klein]</a>:  Okay, well, can we have that in the contract so it doesn't happen?
 Because if they're sharing this with Comcast and other people, they could decide to run the wires.
 And that's not acceptable.
 They don't even have permission for the existing wires.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1060.768s">[Bears]</a>:  I'm going to ask the administration, the city administration, the chief of staff, do you know if the chief engineer, the city engineer is available at some point to answer this question?
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1083.005s">[Nazarian]</a>:  I'm not certain, but I can certainly contact our city engineer.
 I know that our DPW commissioner is on the line, but I don't know if he's prepared to answer the question.
 But I'm happy to contact our city engineer and see if he's available to jump on this.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1098.916s">[Bears]</a>:  Okay.
 I didn't see Tim, but I see him now.
 Commissioner McGibbon, could you raise your hand if you can comment on this or if you think there is a condition that we can put in on this?
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1129.446s">[Nazarian (echo)]</a>:  I can certainly contact our city engineer.
 I know that our TPW commissioner is on the line, but I don't know if he's prepared to answer the question.
 I'm happy to contact our city engineer and see if he's available to jump on this one.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1144.791s">[Bears]</a>:  I didn't see Tim.
 I'm gonna unmute you when the audio is off, Tim.
 Thank you.
 You can give me a thumbs up.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1165.556s">[McGivern]</a>:  Hello, you got me?
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1167.877s">[Bears]</a>:  Yeah, we hear you.
 Thanks, Tim.
 Recognize Commissioner McIver and DPW.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1172.62s">[McGivern]</a>:  Thank you.
 Could I just get a, I caught most of it, but is the question,
 Can we disallow a pull on the service from the utility poles to a property?
 Can we rephrase the question for me?
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1184.803s">[Bears]</a>:  Yes.
 There is a petition.
 Mr. Klein, if you want to rephrase the question.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1191.368s">[Klein]</a>:  What I'm saying is there is a pole existing on the even side of Park Street opposite where you're going to put this new pole for a transform.
 Off the said pole on the even side of Park Street, there are wires that run the home
 174 Park Street, it's up the right of way.
 It also services houses on Salem Street for cable, phone, and other things.
 There were 34 wires that ran up my driveway, low-hanging wires, because the companies won't put anything in.
 I want to make sure the National Grid is not planning, and they aren't going to put any more wires going in, forcing other customers.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1235.024s">[McGivern]</a>:  Okay, I think I understand.
 National Grid wouldn't be able to, they're not asking for any service connections, so I'm presuming the wires that run across your property are service connections.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1249.753s">[Klein]</a>:  Is that correct?
 There is one that services the home behind me.
 At 174.
 At 174, which is up the driveway.
 It's 100 feet approximately from Park Street.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1263.208s">[McGivern]</a>:  Okay, I can tell you the nature of this project has to do with capacity and adding capacity to that particular run.
 It's not a service project, so National Grid can confirm this, but I do not believe they are installing any services as part of this project.
 This project is a utility pole between two existing utility poles on that same run.
 So unless you are, unless properties that
 They wouldn't be able to go over your property either without your permission with a service line.
 So they wouldn't be allowed to do that unless you provided the permission.
 So that would be a different process, a different project.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1305.073s">[Klein]</a>:  Okay, so at this time, they're not allowed to run any more wires up over this right of way.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1310.197s">[McGivern]</a>:  This approval does not include that.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1311.578s">[Klein]</a>:  Okay.
 So we'll have to be approved if they do it.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1318.712s">[McGivern]</a>:  Well, if they have a service customer who requests service, whether it's one of their leases like Comcast or something like that, Verizon, or if it's them, they have to follow property rules.
 So they wouldn't be able to violate, trespass, encroach, or anything like that.
 They would have to run legitimate services at the right height, over the right property, well within their rights.
 They're not allowed to do it outside their rights.
 Hopefully that helps.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1347.189s">[Klein]</a>:  If there is a time, I'd like to contact you, come out and set up a meeting with you so you can see what I'm speaking about, just so you could understand and see how.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1356.536s">[McGivern]</a>:  Yep, I'll probably run you through the engineering office.
 Owen couldn't attend tonight, but Owen Wattel is a city engineer.
 So that's gonna be your best bet.
 And we might be able to advise on the land management piece of it and rights of utilities, et cetera.
 So we can help you out there, understand that piece.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1374.97s">[Bears]</a>:  Okay, thank you very much.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1376.53s">[McGivern]</a>:  You're welcome.
<br><br>

 24367 public hearing proposed amendments the Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94 public hearing notices Medford City Council June 11 2024.
 The
 Medford City Council, a subsequent public hearing.
 The Medford City Council shall conduct a public hearing on June 11, 2024 at 7 p.m.
 in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall.
 85 George P. Hassett Drive and via Zoom, a link to the public hearing will be presented no later than June 7th, 2024 on the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford zoning ordinance.
 One, amending the format of the table of use and parking regulations to replace the parking and loading code columns with specific parking and loading requirements.
 Two, amending section 94-12 definitions to add new defined terms and revise existing definitions.
 3.
 Adopt a new GIS-based digital zoning map.
 Adoption of the new map format is not intended to result in any material changes to zoning of any parcels within the City, but is intended to confirm the best information available to the City regarding the existing zoning designation for all properties in the City.
 Amending sections 94-1.4
 94-6.4.3 subsection 2, 94-11.7.2 subsection 4 and 94-12 to exempt municipal uses from certain use parking and directional dimensional requirements.
 The full materials for the amendment can be viewed in the office of the city clerk, city hall room 103, or on the city's website at www.medfordma.org, slash department, slash planning, dash development, dash sustainability, by clicking on current CD board filings.

 would recognize vice president Collins, the chair of the planning and permitting committee.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1558.373s">[Collins]</a>:  Thank you, President Behrs.
 This has come before City Council at a regular meeting once before when we procedurally had to refer it to the Community Development Board before it can come back to us for a formal vote.
 This is the first package of zoning change proposals to come out of the Planning and Permitting Committee.
 That committee has been working all year so far with the City Council's new zoning consultant on a host of zoning-related goals.
 And this is that first set.
 These are namely
 What I would characterize as formatting, streamlining, and procedural changes.
 We'll get to our discussions of more of those bigger themes and bigger changes later in the year.
 These are simpler.
 The first is to, as was stated, just to quickly restate that we all know what we're talking about, changing the format of the table of uses and parking regulations so that that table is more readable.
 The intent of this is to put the parking and loading requirements into a format that is more
 intuitive, easier to understand switching away from a code based model.
 And so that it's all on the same page.
 So people who would like to do business in the city of Medford don't have to flip through our rather long code of ordinances to find what they're looking for.
 The second is many definitions were amended or added into the definitional tables that these could be made useful later in the zoning process or to just update and modernize the definitions that we're currently using.
 All of these changes were rigorously considered with city staff as well as zoning consultants over the course of several meetings in April and May.
 We are also taking a vote to adopt the GIS digital version of our zoning map.
 There are no substantive changes being proposed to the zoning map.
 This is just to make it so the official on-the-book zoning map for the city of Medford is the one that is digital, is the one that has GIS letters, and is not the one that is quite literally paper and colored pencil.
 A good step for year 2024.
 Finally, the last proposal in this package is to exempt certain municipal uses from the table of use in parking regulations and the table of dimensional requirements.
 This is to streamline the process for the building of certain city infrastructure so that those buildings, for example, hypothetically, a new fire infrastructure, wouldn't have to go through the cumbersome zoning ordinance, zoning, sorry, zoning variance regulations that it would otherwise potentially be subjected to.
 I would motion to take the first vote to be ordained after a comment from my colleagues.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1705.879s">[Bears]</a>:  I think we do have to open a public hearing.
 First, I will recognize the Director of Planning and Development Sustainability, Alicia Hunt.

 And I will recognize Director Hunt.
