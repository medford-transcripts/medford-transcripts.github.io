172
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:09,102

177
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:46,641
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you for being here.

178
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:48,102
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

179
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:53,145
[SPEAKER_39]: And if you could just describe the project and give us any information, and then we can open the public hearing.

180
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:56,367
[SPEAKER_49]: Cam Hansel from National Grid.

181
00:11:57,313 --> 00:12:06,716
[SPEAKER_49]: So basically the project is to install a new pole because the transformer that feeds that area is already overloaded.

182
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:12,477
[SPEAKER_49]: And one of the residents is doing a major upgrade to their service.

183
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:17,198
[SPEAKER_49]: So that wouldn't be sustainable, which is why the new pole and transformer are needed.

184
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:18,599
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

185
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,280
[SPEAKER_39]: Do we have the city engineer available to discuss the conditions?

186
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,881
[SPEAKER_39]: We do have the recommendation of the city engineer with the conditions, but I did want to give him a check in a second.

187
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:34,083
[SPEAKER_39]: Do we have any questions from councilors for the petitioner before we open the public hearing?

188
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:35,044
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins.

189
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:36,665
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, President Burris.

190
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:37,465
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for being here.

191
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:39,266
[SPEAKER_26]: Just two quick questions.

192
00:12:39,786 --> 00:12:41,247
[SPEAKER_26]: When is the work plan to be done?

193
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:45,590
[SPEAKER_26]: And I noted the recommendations around sidewalk restoration.

194
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,832
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just curious how much of the sidewalk is going to be restored?

195
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:52,214
[SPEAKER_26]: Is it just the area immediately around the pole or is it more of the block?

196
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:56,236
[SPEAKER_26]: If you happen to know.

197
00:12:56,932 --> 00:13:00,515
[SPEAKER_49]: I know the area around the pole will be restored.

198
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:11,482
[SPEAKER_26]: What other areas were you... Or just how far up and down the sidewalk will the restoration be extending, or is it just gonna be the area immediately around the pole?

199
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:14,404
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah, the whole area around the pole will be restored.

200
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:14,925
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

201
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:16,366
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

202
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,607
[SPEAKER_26]: And when is the work planned for?

203
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,306
[SPEAKER_49]: don't have that information.

204
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:26,767
[SPEAKER_49]: That's up to the availability of the line crews.

205
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,108
[SPEAKER_49]: So I can give you that.

206
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:29,728
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

207
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,789
[SPEAKER_39]: Any further questions for the petitioner?

208
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:41,353
[SPEAKER_39]: Seeing that, I just wanted to note for the scheduling purposes, the condition of coordinating with the police department traffic sergeants.

209
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:47,595
[SPEAKER_39]: And I did have one question on the sidewalk restoration of the temporary patch located at the utility risers on P3092.

210
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:50,472
[SPEAKER_39]: Could you go into that anymore?

211
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:53,174
[SPEAKER_39]: It is a required condition of the project.

212
00:13:55,416 --> 00:14:06,024
[SPEAKER_39]: Oh, was that another patch that was right next to the- I think it would be nearby, but it seems like it has the temporary is still there and it needs to be permanently filled.

213
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:10,187
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah, that will be filled in as well or restored as well.

214
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:11,047
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay.

215
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:11,768
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

216
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:20,266
[SPEAKER_39]: At this time, I'm going to declare a public hearing open for anyone in favor, in opposition, or who otherwise has questions about this project.

217
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:21,667
[SPEAKER_39]: Public hearing is open.

218
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,969
[SPEAKER_39]: Are you in favor of the project?

219
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,251
[SPEAKER_49]: Yes.

220
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:31,057
[SPEAKER_39]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor, in opposition, or who otherwise has questions about this project?

221
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,123
[SPEAKER_39]: Seeing none in the room, I'm going to check Zoom.

222
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,981
[SPEAKER_39]: I have one question here.

223
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:52,163
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to recognize Klein 170-172.

224
00:14:52,803 --> 00:14:57,045
[SPEAKER_39]: Please state your name and address for the record after I request to unmute you.

225
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:02,767
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, my name is Ralph Klein.

226
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:04,768
[SPEAKER_42]: I reside at 170-172 Park Street, Medford, Mass.

227
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:16,441
[SPEAKER_42]: My questions are, there was a utility pole located on the opposite side of the street, directly where they're going to put the pole.

228
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:20,222
[SPEAKER_42]: So it's on the even side of Park Street.

229
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:24,883
[SPEAKER_42]: There's a pole existing now that services more than Park Street.

230
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:27,464
[SPEAKER_42]: It runs up a right of way.

231
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:33,345
[SPEAKER_42]: So when you put right of way in there, I'm questioning is whether they're going to run wires up to service Salem Street as well.

232
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:37,286
[SPEAKER_42]: They said it's going to service Park Street, but I want that clarified.

233
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:47,947
[SPEAKER_39]: Do you have any response to the question about whether this is going to serve as a Park Street or other streets?

234
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:51,050
[SPEAKER_49]: No, just be Park Street.

235
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:56,134
[SPEAKER_42]: At this time, it services houses on Salem Street.

236
00:15:56,254 --> 00:16:00,158
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't think it's for National Grid.

237
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:02,700
[SPEAKER_42]: It's for cable services at this time.

238
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:08,105
[SPEAKER_42]: But if they upgrade the transformers, they may decide to run more wires about

239
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:09,712
[SPEAKER_42]: of the runaway?

240
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:17,679
[SPEAKER_42]: Across our property, right of way property for 174, 170, 172 and 178 Park Street.

241
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,143
[SPEAKER_42]: I had an issue where I had 34 wires running up the driveway.

242
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:24,084
[SPEAKER_42]: 24 of them were dead.

243
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:29,228
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't want this to repeat itself because the wires are low hanging.

244
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,735
[SPEAKER_39]: Is there any intent to run wires across the street to the other side of the street to service properties on Salem Street?

245
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:46,910
[SPEAKER_49]: No, the pole will just be in the existing electric line where the existing poles already are.

246
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,210
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

247
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,011
[SPEAKER_39]: Mr. Klein, I think that's a different pole and a different company.

248
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:52,791
[SPEAKER_39]: It sounds like as well.

249
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:53,411
[SPEAKER_39]: It sounds like that.

250
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:55,952
[SPEAKER_42]: No, it's, it's all national grid.

251
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:58,192
[SPEAKER_39]: It's all national grid.

252
00:16:58,212 --> 00:16:58,972
[SPEAKER_42]: You're a national grid.

253
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:01,673
[SPEAKER_42]: Why did it run off that property off that pole?

254
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:03,833
[SPEAKER_42]: It's the front of my home.

255
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:05,033
[SPEAKER_42]: I think I know what I see.

256
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:07,414
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

257
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:10,590
[SPEAKER_39]: Let's just interpreting what you said.

258
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,552
[SPEAKER_39]: I have the petitioner here saying they do not intend to run wires across the street onto your property.

259
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:22,373
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, well, can we have that in the contract so it doesn't happen?

260
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:30,055
[SPEAKER_42]: Because if they're sharing this with Comcast and other people, they could decide to run the wires.

261
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:32,616
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's not acceptable.

262
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,577
[SPEAKER_42]: They don't even have permission for the existing wires.

263
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:49,647
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to ask the administration, the city administration, the chief of staff, do you know if the chief engineer, the city engineer is available at some point to answer this question?

264
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:06,628
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm not certain, but I can certainly contact our city engineer.

265
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:11,691
[SPEAKER_52]: I know that our DPW commissioner is on the line, but I don't know if he's prepared to answer the question.

266
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:18,836
[SPEAKER_52]: But I'm happy to contact our city engineer and see if he's available to jump on this.

267
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,116
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

268
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:21,758
[SPEAKER_39]: I didn't see Tim, but I see him now.

269
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:30,664
[SPEAKER_39]: Commissioner McGibbon, could you raise your hand if you can comment on this or if you think there is a condition that we can put in on this?

270
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:52,367
[SPEAKER_53]: I can certainly contact our city engineer.

271
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:57,408
[SPEAKER_53]: I know that our TPW commissioner is on the line, but I don't know if he's prepared to answer the question.

272
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:04,771
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm happy to contact our city engineer and see if he's available to jump on this one.

273
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,831
[SPEAKER_39]: I didn't see Tim.

274
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:11,708
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm gonna unmute you when the audio is off, Tim.

275
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:12,388
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

276
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,170
[SPEAKER_39]: You can give me a thumbs up.

277
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:21,794
All right.

278
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:26,136
[SPEAKER_36]: Hello, you got me?

279
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:28,478
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, we hear you.

280
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:29,158
[SPEAKER_39]: Thanks, Tim.

281
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:30,819
[SPEAKER_39]: Recognize Commissioner McIver and DPW.

282
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:32,960
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

283
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:36,663
[SPEAKER_36]: Could I just get a, I caught most of it, but is the question,

284
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:43,283
[SPEAKER_36]: Can we disallow a pull on the service from the utility poles to a property?

285
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:44,783
[SPEAKER_36]: Can we rephrase the question for me?

286
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:45,884
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

287
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:48,046
[SPEAKER_39]: There is a petition.

288
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:50,307
[SPEAKER_39]: Mr. Klein, if you want to rephrase the question.

289
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:59,313
[SPEAKER_42]: What I'm saying is there is a pole existing on the even side of Park Street opposite where you're going to put this new pole for a transform.

290
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:05,497
[SPEAKER_42]: Off the said pole on the even side of Park Street, there are wires that run the home

291
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:10,270
[SPEAKER_42]: 174 Park Street, it's up the right of way.

292
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:17,255
[SPEAKER_42]: It also services houses on Salem Street for cable, phone, and other things.

293
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:23,919
[SPEAKER_42]: There were 34 wires that ran up my driveway, low-hanging wires, because the companies won't put anything in.

294
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:30,463
[SPEAKER_42]: I want to make sure the National Grid is not planning, and they aren't going to put any more wires going in, forcing other customers.

295
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,565
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, I think I understand.

296
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:48,072
[SPEAKER_36]: National Grid wouldn't be able to, they're not asking for any service connections, so I'm presuming the wires that run across your property are service connections.

297
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:50,494
[SPEAKER_42]: Is that correct?

298
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:54,756
[SPEAKER_42]: There is one that services the home behind me.

299
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:56,477
[SPEAKER_42]: At 174.

300
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:58,879
[SPEAKER_42]: At 174, which is up the driveway.

301
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,481
[SPEAKER_42]: It's 100 feet approximately from Park Street.

302
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:12,195
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, I can tell you the nature of this project has to do with capacity and adding capacity to that particular run.

303
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:20,881
[SPEAKER_36]: It's not a service project, so National Grid can confirm this, but I do not believe they are installing any services as part of this project.

304
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:27,286
[SPEAKER_36]: This project is a utility pole between two existing utility poles on that same run.

305
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:32,490
[SPEAKER_36]: So unless you are, unless properties that

306
00:21:33,803 --> 00:21:36,685
[SPEAKER_36]: They wouldn't be able to go over your property either without your permission with a service line.

307
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:40,088
[SPEAKER_36]: So they wouldn't be allowed to do that unless you provided the permission.

308
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:43,311
[SPEAKER_36]: So that would be a different process, a different project.

309
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:49,576
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so at this time, they're not allowed to run any more wires up over this right of way.

310
00:21:50,197 --> 00:21:51,558
[SPEAKER_36]: This approval does not include that.

311
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:53,520
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

312
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:57,163
[SPEAKER_42]: So we'll have to be approved if they do it.

313
00:21:58,712 --> 00:22:11,176
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, if they have a service customer who requests service, whether it's one of their leases like Comcast or something like that, Verizon, or if it's them, they have to follow property rules.

314
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:15,918
[SPEAKER_36]: So they wouldn't be able to violate, trespass, encroach, or anything like that.

315
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:22,060
[SPEAKER_36]: They would have to run legitimate services at the right height, over the right property, well within their rights.

316
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,880
[SPEAKER_36]: They're not allowed to do it outside their rights.

317
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:25,961
[SPEAKER_36]: Hopefully that helps.

318
00:22:27,189 --> 00:22:35,696
[SPEAKER_42]: If there is a time, I'd like to contact you, come out and set up a meeting with you so you can see what I'm speaking about, just so you could understand and see how.

319
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:38,938
[SPEAKER_36]: Yep, I'll probably run you through the engineering office.

320
00:22:39,018 --> 00:22:41,680
[SPEAKER_36]: Owen couldn't attend tonight, but Owen Wattel is a city engineer.

321
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,023
[SPEAKER_36]: So that's gonna be your best bet.

322
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:51,848
[SPEAKER_36]: And we might be able to advise on the land management piece of it and rights of utilities, et cetera.

323
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:53,969
[SPEAKER_36]: So we can help you out there, understand that piece.

324
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,831
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay, thank you very much.

325
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:56,850
[SPEAKER_36]: You're welcome.

326
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,631
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.

327
00:22:58,851 --> 00:22:59,671
[SPEAKER_39]: And thank you, Mr. Klein.

328
00:23:00,372 --> 00:23:05,253
[SPEAKER_39]: Any further comments in the public hearing on this grant of location?

329
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,277
[SPEAKER_39]: Seeing none, I declare the public hearing closed.

330
00:23:13,437 --> 00:23:14,197
[SPEAKER_39]: Is there a motion?

331
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:17,878
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins.

332
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,081
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to approve pending the public comment period with the conditions recommended by the city engineer.

333
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:48,280
[SPEAKER_39]: On the motion of vice president Collins to approve pending the six day public comment period and adopting the conditions of the city engineer seconded by vice by councilor Kelly and Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

334
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:48,661
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

335
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:50,951
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

336
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:53,192
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

337
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:54,653
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

338
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:56,734
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

339
00:23:58,615 --> 00:23:58,835
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

340
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,136
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

341
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:00,556
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

342
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:01,897
[SPEAKER_39]: Seven affirmative negative.

343
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:04,479
[SPEAKER_39]: The motion passes and the grand application is approved.

344
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:08,561
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

345
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:15,405
[SPEAKER_39]: 24367 public hearing proposed amendments the Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94 public hearing notices Medford City Council June 11 2024.

346
00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:15,545
[SPEAKER_39]: The

347
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:21,092
[SPEAKER_39]: Medford City Council, a subsequent public hearing.

348
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:25,955
[SPEAKER_39]: The Medford City Council shall conduct a public hearing on June 11, 2024 at 7 p.m.

349
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:28,816
[SPEAKER_39]: in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall.

350
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:39,051
[SPEAKER_39]: 85 George P. Hassett Drive and via Zoom, a link to the public hearing will be presented no later than June 7th, 2024 on the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford zoning ordinance.

351
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:46,575
[SPEAKER_39]: One, amending the format of the table of use and parking regulations to replace the parking and loading code columns with specific parking and loading requirements.

352
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:53,139
[SPEAKER_39]: Two, amending section 94-12 definitions to add new defined terms and revise existing definitions.

353
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,061
[SPEAKER_39]: 3.

354
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,061
[SPEAKER_39]: Adopt a new GIS-based digital zoning map.

355
00:24:56,481 --> 00:25:08,309
[SPEAKER_39]: Adoption of the new map format is not intended to result in any material changes to zoning of any parcels within the City, but is intended to confirm the best information available to the City regarding the existing zoning designation for all properties in the City.

356
00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:09,550
[SPEAKER_39]: Amending sections 94-1.4

357
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:16,215
[SPEAKER_39]: 94-6.4.3 subsection 2, 94-11.7.2 subsection 4 and 94-12 to exempt municipal uses from certain use parking and directional dimensional requirements.

358
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:38,532
[SPEAKER_39]: The full materials for the amendment can be viewed in the office of the city clerk, city hall room 103, or on the city's website at www.medfordma.org, slash department, slash planning, dash development, dash sustainability, by clicking on current CD board filings.

359
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:52,163
[SPEAKER_39]: If you need reasonable accommodation to attend, participate in either meeting, please contact Francis Nwaje, telephone 781-393-2439, or email fnwaje at medford-ma.gov, per order, Adam Hurtubise, city clerk.

360
00:25:53,772 --> 00:25:56,660
[SPEAKER_39]: would recognize vice president Collins, the chair of the planning and permitting committee.

361
00:25:58,373 --> 00:25:59,173
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, President Bears.

362
00:26:00,473 --> 00:26:10,036
[SPEAKER_26]: This has come before City Council at a regular meeting once before when we procedurally had to refer it to the Community Development Board before it can come back to us for a formal vote.

363
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:16,977
[SPEAKER_26]: This is the first package of zoning change proposals to come out of the Planning and Permitting Committee.

364
00:26:17,457 --> 00:26:25,319
[SPEAKER_26]: That committee has been working all year so far with the City Council's new zoning consultant on a host of zoning-related goals.

365
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:26,720
[SPEAKER_26]: And this is that first set.

366
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,500
[SPEAKER_26]: These are namely

367
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,923
[SPEAKER_26]: What I would characterize as formatting, streamlining, and procedural changes.

368
00:26:32,983 --> 00:26:37,486
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll get to our discussions of more of those bigger themes and bigger changes later in the year.

369
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:39,208
[SPEAKER_26]: These are simpler.

370
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:50,876
[SPEAKER_26]: The first is to, as was stated, just to quickly restate that we all know what we're talking about, changing the format of the table of uses and parking regulations so that that table is more readable.

371
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:55,599
[SPEAKER_26]: The intent of this is to put the parking and loading requirements into a format that is more

372
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,280
[SPEAKER_26]: intuitive, easier to understand switching away from a code based model.

373
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,281
[SPEAKER_26]: And so that it's all on the same page.

374
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:08,344
[SPEAKER_26]: So people who would like to do business in the city of Medford don't have to flip through our rather long code of ordinances to find what they're looking for.

375
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:21,650
[SPEAKER_26]: The second is many definitions were amended or added into the definitional tables that these could be made useful later in the zoning process or to just update and modernize the definitions that we're currently using.

376
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:29,555
[SPEAKER_26]: All of these changes were rigorously considered with city staff as well as zoning consultants over the course of several meetings in April and May.

377
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:35,799
[SPEAKER_26]: We are also taking a vote to adopt the GIS digital version of our zoning map.

378
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:38,541
[SPEAKER_26]: There are no substantive changes being proposed to the zoning map.

379
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:49,088
[SPEAKER_26]: This is just to make it so the official on-the-book zoning map for the city of Medford is the one that is digital, is the one that has GIS letters, and is not the one that is quite literally paper and colored pencil.

380
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:50,589
[SPEAKER_26]: A good step for year 2024.

381
00:27:52,410 --> 00:28:02,153
[SPEAKER_26]: Finally, the last proposal in this package is to exempt certain municipal uses from the table of use in parking regulations and the table of dimensional requirements.

382
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:19,778
[SPEAKER_26]: This is to streamline the process for the building of certain city infrastructure so that those buildings, for example, hypothetically, a new fire infrastructure, wouldn't have to go through the cumbersome zoning ordinance, zoning, sorry, zoning variance regulations that it would otherwise potentially be subjected to.

383
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:25,859
[SPEAKER_26]: I would motion to take the first vote to be ordained after a comment from my colleagues.

384
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:28,740
[SPEAKER_39]: I think we do have to open a public hearing.

385
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,862
[SPEAKER_39]: First, I will recognize the Director of Planning and Development Sustainability, Alicia Hunt.

386
00:28:34,242 --> 00:28:39,323
[SPEAKER_39]: And I do want to also just note that the Community Development Board did have one recommendation.

387
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:48,886
[SPEAKER_39]: There was a motion to recommend that the approval of the zoning amendments with the edit to move the number four superscript for the footnotes from the leftmost column to the parking column.

388
00:28:48,986 --> 00:28:50,286
[SPEAKER_39]: And I will recognize Director Hunt.

389
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:57,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, thank you, councilors.

390
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:00,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I've enjoyed working on this with you.

391
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:06,236
[SPEAKER_03]: The CD board, as you noted, had one minor edit that was typographical.

392
00:29:06,636 --> 00:29:09,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Councilor Collins really summarized everything.

393
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have anything additional to add.

394
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:15,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I am in favor of this on behalf of the administration.

395
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:23,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there are questions, I am available as well as senior planner, Danielle Evans is available to answer any questions.

396
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,461
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Director Hunt and Planner Evans for being here.

397
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:35,105
[SPEAKER_39]: This time I'm going to open the public hearing to anyone in favor, opposed, or who has other questions about this item.

398
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,126
[SPEAKER_39]: Public hearing is open.

399
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:39,327
[SPEAKER_39]: Director Hunt, did I hear that you were in favor?

400
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:43,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

401
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:49,813
[SPEAKER_39]: Is there anyone else in favor, in opposition, or who would otherwise like to speak in the public hearing on these proposed amendments?

402
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:59,782
[SPEAKER_39]: Seeing none in person, I will review Zoom.

403
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:11,246
[SPEAKER_39]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

404
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:15,087
[SPEAKER_39]: There was a motion from Vice President Collins to approve.

405
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:18,128
[SPEAKER_39]: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

406
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:20,249
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins.

407
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:24,391
[SPEAKER_26]: Need I make a motion to adopt the recommendation from the CDB in my motion?

408
00:30:24,651 --> 00:30:25,731
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, that would be good.

409
00:30:26,611 --> 00:30:30,393
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to approve with the typographical suggestion from the CDB.

410

[SPEAKER_39]: including the payment of all costs related to designing the project, equipping and furnishing the project, site improvements, and all other costs incidental and related thereto, yes or no.

571
00:42:59,113 --> 00:43:13,423

574
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:58,549

575

[SPEAKER_39]: and for FY 2025 general operations of the Department of Public Works, 500,000, including but not limited to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, yes or no?

576
00:44:14,164 --> 00:44:35,864
[SPEAKER_39]: The final paper is 24-415, proposition two and a half override order and ballot question to invest in future of Medford public schools, ordered that the city pursuant to general law chapter 5921C, subsection G, shall seek voter approval at the biennial state election to be held on November 5th, 2024, to assess taxes in excess of the amount allowed pursuant

579
00:44:54,778 --> 00:45:06,492
[SPEAKER_39]: Shall the City of Medford be allowed to assess an additional $4 million in real estate and personal property taxes for fiscal year 2025 general operations of the Medford Public Schools to create a high school schedule that increases access to arts

580
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:15,203
[SPEAKER_39]: and vocational programming, expands classroom instructional opportunities, and for classroom teacher and paraprofessional compensation for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.

581
00:45:16,024 --> 00:45:17,485
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes or no?

582
00:45:18,306 --> 00:45:21,030
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you for bearing with me as I read all of those papers.

583
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,893
[SPEAKER_39]: I am now going to recognize the Mayor of the City of Medford, Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

584
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:24,314
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

585
00:45:33,422 --> 00:45:33,962
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening.

586
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:39,747
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Bears and Councilors for allowing me some time to speak to you about the fiscal year 25 budget.

587
00:45:40,568 --> 00:45:59,985
[SPEAKER_23]: Before I begin, I must take this opportunity to thank everyone who contributed to the completing this budget and delivering it to your honorable body by the newly established deadline per the budget ordinance, compiling this comprehensive breakdown of the city's financial outlook took countless hours of preparation, debate, and insight from our department heads and our budget team.

588
00:46:00,902 --> 00:46:10,014
[SPEAKER_23]: led by our Finance Director, Bob Dickinson, Assistant Finance Director and Budget Director, Courtney Caraviello, and my team in the Mayor's Office, led by Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian.

589
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:14,800
[SPEAKER_23]: I also need to credit both Courtney and our Communications Team, Director Steve Smerdy,

590
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:24,599
[SPEAKER_23]: and Emma Tombley, our communications specialist for putting in so many hours of work on the nitty gritty aspects of the budget book that tend to get overlooked.

591
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:32,986
[SPEAKER_23]: This work is invaluable and will hopefully lead us to a second Distinguished Budget Award from the Government Finance Officers Association.

592
00:46:34,915 --> 00:46:39,358
[SPEAKER_23]: Last year, I stood before you and laid out the challenges that lay ahead for fiscal year 25.

593
00:46:40,018 --> 00:47:01,793
[SPEAKER_23]: Our looming fiscal cliff due to the expiration of ARPA and ESSER funding, the continued rise in consumer prices, as well as the decades of neglect of critical infrastructure upkeep as it relates to our roads, sidewalks, water and sewer infrastructure system that are catching up to us now, including our buildings.

594
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:05,251
[SPEAKER_23]: Most of these are not new or surprising obstacles.

595
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:11,175
[SPEAKER_23]: They have always been at the forefront of financial planning, guiding our strategy and shaping the decisions we make.

596
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:21,401
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, as we approach the end date, it's important to understand that measures we must take to ensure that our city and school services, programs and projects are properly funded and staffed.

597
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:28,077
[SPEAKER_23]: As I wrote in my budget message last week, the school's budget was by far the toughest one to develop.

598
00:47:28,677 --> 00:47:35,040
[SPEAKER_23]: Due to the timeline of the budget ordinance, we needed to supply the school department with an estimated operating budget figure in March.

599
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:45,445
[SPEAKER_23]: At that time, we did not have concrete figures for the city's previous year's actuals or next year's projections, thus making the school's number more of a guide than a strict dollar amount.

600
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:49,707
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's no secret that the schools used the remaining ESSER funds last year

601
00:47:51,305 --> 00:47:58,867
[SPEAKER_23]: and are operating at a deficit, committing one-time funding sources to plug this gap continually is not a long-term solution.

602
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:05,690
[SPEAKER_23]: The school budget was facing a cliff, and cuts had to be made to right-size our spending and balance the fiscal year 25 budget.

603
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:23,676
[SPEAKER_23]: Our city team then thoroughly reviewed each line item on the city side, dove deeply into expenditures, compared numbers with previous year's actuals, and worked to bring those figures down to a more reasonable and sustainable level in order to provide as much funding to the schools as possible.

604
00:48:24,756 --> 00:48:34,180
[SPEAKER_23]: Additionally, we reviewed our new growth numbers, workers' compensation numbers, assessed IT vendor contracts, and really dove headfirst into the fine details of the city budget.

605
00:48:35,384 --> 00:48:50,968
[SPEAKER_23]: The hard work over the last two months adjusting the city budget revenue projections and other city line items allowed us to increase the school budget from our fiscal year 24 numbers of 71,200,000 to 76 million for fiscal year 25.

606
00:48:51,668 --> 00:48:55,249
[SPEAKER_23]: That's nearly a 7% increase of general fund allocated monies.

607
00:48:56,709 --> 00:49:02,131
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm immensely proud that we're able to come to this number and supply the schools with a significant increase from last year.

608
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:08,387
[SPEAKER_23]: but it's still not enough to avoid cuts and creates additional obstacles to learning.

609
00:49:09,848 --> 00:49:21,913
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's important to understand just how we've gotten to this point at both the school district and city hall, with each budget season being such a challenging and in many ways, a discouraging process for all involved.

610
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:28,136
[SPEAKER_23]: Each year, the budget I propose and the budget that this honorable body votes on is balanced.

611
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:40,147
[SPEAKER_23]: And while that allows us to pay for all our obligations, it creates a situation where most of our costs, which generally significantly increase year over year, exceed the amount we're able to raise in taxes.

612
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:50,352
[SPEAKER_23]: Per Massachusetts general law, Medford and all other municipalities in the Commonwealth cannot increase our tax levy, which is one of the major components of the city's revenue sources.

613
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:55,074
[SPEAKER_23]: We raise from real and property taxes by more than 2.5%.

614
00:49:56,909 --> 00:49:59,711
[SPEAKER_23]: meeting the operating budget can't keep up the cost of living.

615
00:50:00,991 --> 00:50:09,877
[SPEAKER_23]: This in some cases creates the need for scaled back programming, staff reductions and other resource losses to properly balance the budget.

616
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:15,842
[SPEAKER_23]: I know there has been some discussion on rating our reserve funds to plug our structural deficit gap.

617
00:50:16,502 --> 00:50:18,583
[SPEAKER_23]: That is not sound financial practice.

618
00:50:19,003 --> 00:50:23,224
[SPEAKER_23]: Dipping into our savings to fund something for one year is just simply a bad idea.

619
00:50:23,964 --> 00:50:30,526
[SPEAKER_23]: It's why our team worked so hard to reduce our reliance on one-time funding to offset revenue loss in my previous four budgets.

620
00:50:31,752 --> 00:50:43,683
[SPEAKER_23]: The funding we received from the federal government with the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, also known as ARPA, allowed us to inject capital to plug various gaps during the early years of the pandemic when revenues were down.

621
00:50:44,764 --> 00:50:51,851
[SPEAKER_23]: By making strategic one-time investments, we were able to save on annual operating budget space, which created more flexibility when crafting the budget.

622
00:50:52,952 --> 00:50:57,195
[SPEAKER_23]: The pandemic also caused us to reevaluate much of our thinking on the use of one-time funding.

623
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:07,506
[SPEAKER_23]: It also changed the way the public interacts with government, so much so that we now must allocate funding to new items that have become essential as post-pandemic life continues.

624
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:12,509
[SPEAKER_23]: For example, prior to 2020, City Hall did not regularly host meetings.

625
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:21,274
[SPEAKER_23]: Now that is common and expected practice, which requires more resources, technology, infrastructure, and staff training, which all carry an expense.

626
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:26,817
[SPEAKER_23]: That brings us to an override measure, which I'm proposing to appear on the ballot in November.

627
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:35,982
[SPEAKER_23]: This has been a topic of debate in the council chambers, my email box, in homes, coffee shops, ball fields, and around our squares for several years.

628
00:51:37,203 --> 00:51:40,486
[SPEAKER_23]: I think two things are simultaneously true as it relates to an override.

629
00:51:41,387 --> 00:51:50,557
[SPEAKER_23]: It would undoubtedly help us maintain and hopefully enhance our services, and it would create hardships for many people in our city struggling to stay afloat financially.

630
00:51:52,594 --> 00:52:02,401
[SPEAKER_23]: Our financial task force established earlier this year has been meeting regularly to work through, negotiate, and discuss the best path forward for the city, schools, and community.

631
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:20,414
[SPEAKER_23]: Considering the financial pressures many of our residents are facing, as well as the need to increase our revenues to account for costs outpacing our 2.5% levy threshold, we have concluded that in November, the voters should decide on if they want to adequately fund our programs, positions, and projects.

632
00:52:21,846 --> 00:52:26,568
[SPEAKER_23]: one on a debt exclusion for a new fire headquarters, and two Proposition 2 1⁄2 overrides.

633
00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:44,737
[SPEAKER_23]: The first override question would ask voters to approve raising $3.5 million to stabilize Medford Public Schools funding, including but not limited to funding costs such as teachers, literacy coaches, behavioral specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facilities maintenance.

634
00:52:46,055 --> 00:52:51,877
[SPEAKER_23]: And for our Department of Public Works, 500,000 for additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repairs.

635
00:52:53,617 --> 00:53:09,442
[SPEAKER_23]: The second override question would ask voters to approve raising 4 million to invest in Medford Public Schools to create a high school schedule that increases access to arts and vocational programming, expands classroom instructional opportunities, and for classroom teacher and paraprofessional compensation.

636
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:21,471
[SPEAKER_23]: The debt exclusion question would ask voters to approve funding of a bond of up to 30 million to be issued for the design and construction of a new Medford Fire Department headquarters at 120 Main Street.

637
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:31,676
[SPEAKER_23]: The expected cost of these three combined questions would increase property taxes for the average single family home, which is assessed at about $770,000 by approximately $446 per year.

638
00:53:31,716 --> 00:53:34,277
[SPEAKER_23]: That would be about $37 per month.

639
00:53:39,991 --> 00:54:03,865
[SPEAKER_23]: But since our schools need to be right-sized now, I've asked your body to approve an amendment to the budget to increase the school's budget allocation from 76 million to 77.75 million through the use of 1.75 million in one-time funding advance, 500,000 of which will fund the purchase of Chromebooks and laptops and begins an annual refresh cycle to maintain our district-wide technology.

640
00:54:05,629 --> 00:54:13,515
[SPEAKER_23]: Now this is one-time funding, so if the first override question does not pass, then we will be right back here in the same position next year with cuts on the table.

641
00:54:15,097 --> 00:54:19,540
[SPEAKER_23]: But passing these overrides is by no means an easy decision, and I recognize that.

642
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:33,872
[SPEAKER_23]: In fact, coming to these numbers was a painstaking process, and I'm still wary of the financial burden increased taxes may have in our community, especially in those struggling to get by, and that weighs heavily on me.

643
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:46,977
[SPEAKER_23]: Ultimately, I believe the question of pass would fulfill our greatest needs, mainly in our schools and for our children, but also help make progress on the number one complaint we get, which is the conditions of our roads and sidewalks.

644
00:54:48,378 --> 00:54:53,219
[SPEAKER_23]: I know this is the right decision because the alternative will mean more cuts and more challenges for our residents.

645
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:56,861
[SPEAKER_23]: And in my opinion, we cannot afford to continue on that path.

646
00:54:57,741 --> 00:55:00,402
[SPEAKER_23]: Our residents deserve the right to take a vote on this.

647
00:55:02,213 --> 00:55:04,634
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a big decision that requires considerable thought.

648
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:12,039
[SPEAKER_23]: I truly believe, however, that approving these ballot questions is the right thing, and I hope the majority of the community agrees.

649
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:18,243
[SPEAKER_23]: There are, of course, other aspects to this budget than just the Proposition 2 1⁄2 override questions.

650
00:55:19,366 --> 00:55:20,946
[SPEAKER_23]: many of which are quite encouraging.

651
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:35,150
[SPEAKER_23]: We are making significant investment in several core city systems, maintaining as much service as possible and providing a sustainable roadmap for future big ticket expenditures, like a new fire headquarters and a new Medford High School.

652
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:40,972
[SPEAKER_23]: We're making another significant investment in our library, increasing its budget by nearly 12%.

653
00:55:42,574 --> 00:55:50,480
[SPEAKER_23]: This coupled with last year's increase of about 18% has resulted in a more than doubling effect on the city's library budget in the last decade.

654
00:55:51,621 --> 00:55:57,406
[SPEAKER_23]: This has allowed everyone in our community to get better access to the resources and programs that our fabulous library offers.

655
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:09,456
[SPEAKER_23]: We're increasing the budget for our department of public works to keep up with increased costs in services, as well as give us some flexibility as we continue to address the backlog of stumps, tree pruning, repairs,

656
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:18,261
[SPEAKER_23]: et cetera, to update our aging water infrastructure and improve accessibility and pedestrian mobility in our squares and green spaces and throughout our entire community.

657
00:56:20,142 --> 00:56:26,485
[SPEAKER_23]: The city continues to work towards goals laid out in our Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which was finalized in fiscal year 23.

658
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:34,441
[SPEAKER_23]: My administration is committed to removing barriers that would preclude residents from sustainable practices, including financial barriers.

659
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:41,242
[SPEAKER_23]: The city has partnered with Garbage to Garden to launch a free municipal curbside composting program for eligible residents.

660
00:56:42,163 --> 00:56:54,685
[SPEAKER_23]: This program launches in fiscal year 25, which is July 1st, 2024, and aims to be widely accessible and convenient, making it easy for residents to participate in creating a greener, more sustainable future.

661
00:56:55,882 --> 00:57:15,172
[SPEAKER_23]: The city has also received 300,000 in grant funding to expand public outreach and strengthen support specifically for underrepresented and underserved communities interested in decarbonizing their homes and vehicles through energy efficiency, solar, and electricification of heating, water heating appliances, and electric vehicles.

662
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:23,216
[SPEAKER_23]: This program, Electrify Medford, will seek to educate residents on available resources and help them make these changes in their own homes.

663
00:57:24,662 --> 00:57:35,491
[SPEAKER_23]: As part of our commitment to residents, we are always looking for ways to expand diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the city and create an environment of belonging for our entire community.

664
00:57:36,332 --> 00:57:43,598
[SPEAKER_23]: Our DEI director has been working with our human resource director to update best practices for recruiting, interviewing, and hiring.

665
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:50,152
[SPEAKER_23]: Due to this work, the city has been able to recruit, hire, and retain diverse candidates for a variety of city positions.

666
00:57:51,113 --> 00:58:02,046
[SPEAKER_23]: This team also hosts trainings and other professional development opportunities to ensure employees have all the tools they need to uphold our values and mission, something that will be enhanced and continued through fiscal year 25.

667
00:58:04,104 --> 00:58:11,628
[SPEAKER_23]: We have secured $850,000 to help transform the Dorothy T. Hegner Center into a municipal vulnerability preparedness site.

668
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:21,674
[SPEAKER_23]: The Hegner Center will be renovated into a community space that will be used to coordinate emergency responses and will serve as a resiliency hub for residents during climate emergencies.

669
00:58:22,554 --> 00:58:30,639
[SPEAKER_23]: The site will also host an afterschool program through the city's rec department and other community oriented events when not being used for emergencies.

670
00:58:31,604 --> 00:58:44,067
[SPEAKER_23]: Last year, our engineering team got to work on repairing approximately 90 roads that have been identified as prime candidates for crack sailing in the pavement report from 2021 and the updated report from 2024.

671
00:58:45,387 --> 00:58:51,409
[SPEAKER_23]: The city will deploy over 180,000 in ARPA funding to crack sail the additional streets on the list for the next several years.

672
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:58,731
[SPEAKER_23]: Crack sailing is a preventative measure that prolongs the life of roads and avoids having to make major structural repairs in the near future.

673
00:58:59,844 --> 00:59:08,533
[SPEAKER_23]: The engineering division has also identified six roads that are among the most in need and are working through planning process with our administration with the hope of repaving the season.

674
00:59:09,514 --> 00:59:15,460
[SPEAKER_23]: Our infrastructure needs reach beyond our streets, thoroughways and pedestrian paths.

675
00:59:16,365 --> 00:59:22,047
[SPEAKER_23]: A major component of the work being done by our DPW team is the ongoing water meter system replacement project.

676
00:59:22,787 --> 00:59:30,250
[SPEAKER_23]: Initiated in fiscal year 24, the team in the water and sewer division is continuing to install new state-of-the-art systems in homes across the city.

677
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:37,713
[SPEAKER_23]: These meters are a crucial step in addressing the aging water infrastructure, delivering accurate readings for customers.

678
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:42,654
[SPEAKER_23]: It's also evident that our water and sewer infrastructure is aging.

679
00:59:43,035 --> 00:59:44,075
[SPEAKER_23]: The system dates back

680
00:59:44,457 --> 00:59:54,764
[SPEAKER_23]: decades and after years of neglect to properly repair or place pipes, we are now in the process of devising a comprehensive strategy that will begin to assess the future needs of our system.

681
00:59:55,485 --> 00:59:59,047
[SPEAKER_23]: This will take years and will be very expensive, but it must be done.

682
01:00:00,268 --> 01:00:08,134
[SPEAKER_23]: In addition to improving our public infrastructure, we're also been working to enhance and upgrade many of our public spaces for the community to utilize and enjoy.

683
01:00:08,993 --> 01:00:12,838
[SPEAKER_23]: Current projects that are nearing completion include Gillis Park and Carr Park.

684
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:20,727
[SPEAKER_23]: Gillis is a 1.4 million renovation project that will upgrade accessibility features, improve the baseball field and add new park amenities.

685
01:00:21,448 --> 01:00:25,033
[SPEAKER_23]: Carr Park phase two is additionally expected to kick off soon.

686
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:36,757
[SPEAKER_23]: The City of Medford Public Schools have also begun construction on a new universally accessible schoolyard at the McGlynn School, which is expected to be completed by the next school year.

687
01:00:37,517 --> 01:00:46,781
[SPEAKER_23]: The playground will go beyond federal Americans with Disabilities Accessibility Standards upon completion, making this space one for all to enjoy.

688
01:00:46,801 --> 01:00:52,644
[SPEAKER_23]: As I toured the project a couple of weeks ago, I was in awe of how wonderful the space will be for everyone in our city.

689
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:59,403
[SPEAKER_23]: It's no secret that one of the key measures of our financial health is the revenue we generate from commercial development.

690
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:14,235
[SPEAKER_23]: While it's important that we expand our tax base in this sector, we must also consider the enormous barriers, both structurally and financially, for families, workers, and individuals attempting to find meaningful and sustainable housing in our city.

691
01:01:15,114 --> 01:01:19,698
[SPEAKER_23]: We are bringing over 500 new residential units to the community through eight new developments.

692
01:01:20,698 --> 01:01:34,830
[SPEAKER_23]: To further support the housing crisis that is affecting nearly every municipality, we have allocated nearly 400,000 in funds from ARPA to offset permitting costs of renovations and upgrades to current and new affordable housing units at the housing authority as well.

693
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:55,149
[SPEAKER_23]: Through successful negotiations, we've gained leverage with our 40B developers to bring more community benefits to the planning process, like better pedestrian accessibility, reduction of potential traffic congestion, more open space, more access to public transportation, and more affordable housing units were the priority for Medford residents.

694
01:01:56,311 --> 01:02:11,476
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of this hard work on the housing development side is thanks to the work of this Medford City Council and your push for zoning rethought codification, as well as establishing affordable housing trust, which will use various funding streams to help facilitate more affordable units coming to market.

695
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:19,119
[SPEAKER_23]: Your honorable body in collaboration with our planning development and sustainability office are now working on the next phase of the zoning process.

696
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:19,919
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

697
01:02:21,462 --> 01:02:26,426
[SPEAKER_23]: Before I conclude, I want to highlight a few other projects and programs that our staff has worked so hard to bring to life.

698
01:02:27,647 --> 01:02:38,216
[SPEAKER_23]: We secured a Massachusetts School Building Association loan to build a new state-of-the-art high school for our students and began the planning process, which will continue in fiscal year 25.

699
01:02:39,137 --> 01:02:45,302
[SPEAKER_23]: S&P Global affirmed the city's double A plus credit rating, the second highest possible rating for a municipality.

700
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:52,088
[SPEAKER_23]: We continue to onboard several senior tax workers to assist with tasks across our departments.

701
01:02:52,908 --> 01:02:59,093
[SPEAKER_23]: The city reached its goal of planting 200 trees in 2023, which built upon the 2022 goal of 180 trees.

702
01:03:00,575 --> 01:03:02,937
[SPEAKER_23]: We continue to install art murals.

703
01:03:03,097 --> 01:03:06,960
[SPEAKER_23]: Our most recent was by artist Jamie Chan at Wright's Pond.

704
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,145
[SPEAKER_23]: We unveiled the new art exhibit space and new home of arts collaborative Medford on Mystic Ave.

705
01:03:13,746 --> 01:03:20,151
[SPEAKER_23]: We installed five new electric vehicle charging stations and four new bike stations at high priority locations around the city.

706
01:03:21,011 --> 01:03:34,441
[SPEAKER_23]: In the fall, we broke ground on Clippership Connector, a path located along the Mystic River that will connect more than 10 miles of continuous greenway and aims to provide a safer route between Medford Square, the Andrews, McGlynn, and Riverbend Park.

707
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:40,865
[SPEAKER_23]: Our tree warden secured $100,000 grant to help strengthen the resiliency of our urban forest network.

708
01:03:41,466 --> 01:03:43,427
[SPEAKER_23]: We are continuing to partner and support amazing

709
01:03:43,749 --> 01:03:49,552
[SPEAKER_23]: community events like the Farmer's Market, Run Medford, Oktoberfest, Circle the Square, PorchFest, and so much more.

710
01:03:50,532 --> 01:04:00,157
[SPEAKER_23]: We continue to expand city communications offerings across our four environmental justice languages, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Brazilian Portuguese, and Arabic.

711
01:04:00,977 --> 01:04:12,383
[SPEAKER_23]: In addition to the new city website having the capability to translate, the communications department is working with the Office of Prevention and Outreach to build a user base in the reverse 911 system to translate messages.

712
01:04:13,143 --> 01:04:18,325
[SPEAKER_23]: The city's digital permitting system is additionally now capable of translations into two languages.

713
01:04:19,245 --> 01:04:25,028
[SPEAKER_23]: We replaced parking meters throughout the city with new parking kiosks, offering more ways to pay and increase accessibility.

714
01:04:26,008 --> 01:04:31,590
[SPEAKER_23]: By establishing a new zoning district in partnership with the city council, we continue to prioritize mixed use development.

715
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:42,435
[SPEAKER_23]: As I'm sure you know, this is just a brief overview of all the work that everyone has done over the last year and the investments we've made that will help build on the vision we share for our city's future.

716
01:04:43,203 --> 01:04:50,106
[SPEAKER_23]: We have worked in tandem on a variety of critical issues, be it zoning reform, the housing production plan, or the capital improvement plan.

717
01:04:50,866 --> 01:04:53,948
[SPEAKER_23]: I wanna thank the city council for being a thoughtful partner in government.

718
01:04:54,788 --> 01:05:02,312
[SPEAKER_23]: You all have worked extremely hard over the last year to move forward many key priorities and improve efficiency on a number of fronts.

719
01:05:03,492 --> 01:05:06,874
[SPEAKER_23]: Before you debate the budget, please know I'm here to answer any questions you may have.

720
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:07,394
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

721
01:05:08,439 --> 01:05:09,100
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

722
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,041
[SPEAKER_39]: We're going to go to questions from councilors.

723
01:05:11,642 --> 01:05:26,036
[SPEAKER_39]: I am just going to say before that, I just wanted to return the thanks to you for your collaboration, establishing the budget ordinance, getting started on this process so early, having had all of our meetings happen before this meeting and not after this meeting.

724
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:28,618
[SPEAKER_39]: I think we've really opened a new era in

725
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:36,101
[SPEAKER_39]: an open process where we can have those questions and have the council be a part, a collaborative part of the budget process.

726
01:05:36,741 --> 01:05:37,782
[SPEAKER_39]: So I just want to thank you for that.

727
01:05:37,862 --> 01:05:42,223
[SPEAKER_39]: It's been a great few months, some long meetings, but a great few months.

728
01:05:42,703 --> 01:05:47,325
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to recognize Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, Vice President Collins.

729
01:05:48,305 --> 01:05:49,066
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, President Bears.

730
01:05:50,586 --> 01:05:51,066
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mayor.

731
01:05:51,086 --> 01:05:52,307
[SPEAKER_26]: Nice to see you.

732
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:53,147
[SPEAKER_23]: Nice to see you too.

733
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,581
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to thank you for the comprehensive proposal.

734
01:05:56,601 --> 01:06:01,725
[SPEAKER_26]: I also want to thank you for presenting each of these pieces in context of one another.

735
01:06:03,106 --> 01:06:09,590
[SPEAKER_26]: For me, that is the theme and the precondition for this budget season is all of these pieces have to work together.

736
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:12,872
[SPEAKER_26]: This is my third budget season that I've had as a councilor.

737
01:06:16,696 --> 01:06:20,660
[SPEAKER_26]: This is the least chaotic one so far.

738
01:06:22,381 --> 01:06:23,282
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me put that another way.

739
01:06:24,103 --> 01:06:26,545
[SPEAKER_26]: We're facing some really big difficulties here.

740
01:06:27,126 --> 01:06:30,649
[SPEAKER_26]: The budget process has always been difficult.

741
01:06:30,749 --> 01:06:32,111
[SPEAKER_26]: It's been difficult while I've been on the council.

742
01:06:32,131 --> 01:06:33,152
[SPEAKER_26]: I know it's been difficult before.

743
01:06:33,612 --> 01:06:35,194
[SPEAKER_26]: We're coming off of a really difficult period.

744
01:06:35,334 --> 01:06:37,115
[SPEAKER_26]: I've always made it clear what my red lines are.

745
01:06:37,856 --> 01:06:41,700
[SPEAKER_26]: This collaborative process has allowed us to reach a budget plan that I am

746
01:06:43,772 --> 01:06:46,334
[SPEAKER_26]: comfortable and happy to put forward tonight.

747
01:06:49,116 --> 01:06:52,218
[SPEAKER_26]: We have known for a while that Medford has a funding problem.

748
01:06:53,839 --> 01:07:07,689
[SPEAKER_26]: This has been the topic of so many conversations between me and my colleagues in these chambers, outside of these chambers, the school funding problem and infrastructure funding problem, the capacity building problem, the problem of weaning off of one-time funds.

749
01:07:07,729 --> 01:07:09,991
[SPEAKER_26]: These are not problems that are unique to Medford.

750
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:11,632
[SPEAKER_26]: They're problems that we have to work through.

751
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:18,880
[SPEAKER_26]: In the two and a half years that I have been on the council, we have discussed, I think, every mechanism that could contribute towards the solution.

752
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:27,664
[SPEAKER_26]: As a council, we've made zoning changes that could promote new growth, and we're working on more in our continuing zoning work that we'll put to votes later in the term.

753
01:07:28,484 --> 01:07:30,045
[SPEAKER_26]: We've discussed the city's ARPA strategy.

754
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:38,148
[SPEAKER_26]: President Bears and I even proposed an override back in 2022, though it did not move forward, and that was robustly discussed in the previous term.

755
01:07:39,509 --> 01:07:44,953
[SPEAKER_26]: This year, everybody is well aware that countdown clock on our strategy for the future is hitting zero.

756
01:07:45,693 --> 01:07:47,014
[SPEAKER_26]: ARPA and ESSER are going offline.

757
01:07:47,034 --> 01:07:56,581
[SPEAKER_26]: So since last fall, the financial task force, which was convened last year as a condition of the FY24 budget, has been meeting to talk about what's next.

758
01:07:57,301 --> 01:08:04,086
[SPEAKER_26]: I've been really proud to be a part of that process, which I joined when I joined city council leadership at the beginning of this term.

759
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:06,748
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that that has been part of that

760
01:08:08,373 --> 01:08:20,897
[SPEAKER_26]: that really important critical pivot towards greater collaboration, which has also been affirmed by you and your staff's participation in the budget ordinance process, as well as this collaboration on meeting the needs of this budget season.

761
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:26,319
[SPEAKER_26]: This is the culmination of many meetings over many months discussing precisely what

762
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:28,280
[SPEAKER_26]: our needs are and how to meet them.

763
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:37,690
[SPEAKER_26]: We have rigorously considered the needs facing Medford public schools and city infrastructure.

764
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:47,741
[SPEAKER_26]: Among these branches of government, we certainly don't always agree, but the bottom line is that there's a set of facts and a set of goals that we are completely aligned on.

765
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:53,582
[SPEAKER_26]: then I also believe that the community fundamentally is aligned on.

766
01:08:54,143 --> 01:09:00,929
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to maintain at least level service at MPS, we need to staff it properly, and we need to enable public education to start getting better.

767
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,491
[SPEAKER_26]: We need our roads and sidewalks to start getting better.

768
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:04,993
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to be in a position

769
01:09:05,453 --> 01:09:10,277
[SPEAKER_26]: to pay our city and school staff competitively, and unless we take action, those things will not happen.

770
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:14,301
[SPEAKER_26]: Our schools will not be what we want them to be, what we need them to be.

771
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:20,526
[SPEAKER_26]: We will lose students to private schools, and those who cannot afford that type of expense will suffer the most.

772
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:22,548
[SPEAKER_26]: Our infrastructure will depreciate.

773
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:31,276
[SPEAKER_26]: Those costs will get passed along to individuals at even higher rates, and we will lose good city workers to other municipalities or the private sectors.

774
01:09:32,551 --> 01:09:43,635
[SPEAKER_26]: There's always been a lot to discuss in how we solve these problems, but I truly believe that, for the most part, we are aligned on these facts and these goals, because we all know that those outcomes are unacceptable.

775
01:09:46,936 --> 01:10:00,661
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think a hallmark of this proposal on how to pivot towards the future hinges on a combined approach of coming out of the reason that we're

776
01:10:02,557 --> 01:10:03,618
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry, can you tell I'm nervous?

777
01:10:03,638 --> 01:10:05,799
[SPEAKER_26]: This is only the biggest vote that we take all year.

778
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:06,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Pardon me.

779
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,800
[SPEAKER_26]: Just breaking the fourth wall here for a sec.

780
01:10:09,781 --> 01:10:10,221
[SPEAKER_23]: Deep breaths.

781
01:10:14,383 --> 01:10:19,265
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, we only had ARPA and ESSER to wean off of in the first place because we're coming off of such a hard time.

782
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:31,091
[SPEAKER_26]: And now we're adapting to that new normal, figuring out what it will require of us, and taking the affirmative steps to gain the revenue that we need to keep Medford a place that supports the people that live here.

783
01:10:37,662 --> 01:10:39,724
[SPEAKER_26]: So for me, this budget is conditioned on its context.

784
01:10:40,384 --> 01:10:54,236
[SPEAKER_26]: We are considering it in the context of two override proposals, one from President Bears and I, one from you, Mayor, totaling $7.5 million, which if they pass, will start stabilizing our school and city operating budgets in quarter three of this fiscal year.

785
01:10:54,256 --> 01:11:02,523
[SPEAKER_26]: We're considering that in the context of a $1.75 million appropriation to stabilize the school department in quarters one and two of this year.

786
01:11:03,064 --> 01:11:03,904
[SPEAKER_26]: And to me, that's critical.

787
01:11:04,705 --> 01:11:07,747
[SPEAKER_26]: That is what my sense of confidence in this plan is hinged on.

788
01:11:08,628 --> 01:11:19,576
[SPEAKER_26]: That gives us the breathing room to get to the override vote, which we put to residents in November without devastating effects happening to the school's department in the meantime.

789
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:25,740
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the overrides should they pass will allow us to start investing in things getting better and bringing up that baseline year over year.

790
01:11:27,702 --> 01:11:31,845
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that a lot of people are frustrated that we have to be here at all contemplating overrides.

791
01:11:33,174 --> 01:11:34,296
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that totally makes sense.

792
01:11:35,218 --> 01:11:35,659
[SPEAKER_26]: I really do.

793
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:43,054
[SPEAKER_26]: I also wish that we were, I wish that this was something that no municipality had to contemplate.

794
01:11:44,549 --> 01:11:53,554
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think it's important context to note that since 1990, 300 of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts have advanced at least one override.

795
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:56,355
[SPEAKER_26]: And many of them have done them lots of times.

796
01:11:56,395 --> 01:12:01,117
[SPEAKER_26]: There have been over 4,500 individual overrides on ballots in municipalities since 1990.

797
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:04,539
[SPEAKER_26]: For debt exclusions, that number is even higher.

798
01:12:05,299 --> 01:12:09,121
[SPEAKER_26]: There's been 313 cities and towns that have advanced debt exclusions since 1989.

799
01:12:11,982 --> 01:12:14,603
[SPEAKER_26]: totaling over 4,000 individual debt exclusions.

800
01:12:15,784 --> 01:12:18,725
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just put that out there to say, it is really serious to do this.

801
01:12:19,305 --> 01:12:20,346
[SPEAKER_26]: It is really serious.

802
01:12:21,426 --> 01:12:28,068
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's why I'm glad that this is a mechanism that goes on the ballot so that residents of Medford will choose by popular vote.

803
01:12:28,949 --> 01:12:31,850
[SPEAKER_26]: It is serious, but it is not an aberration to do this.

804
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:39,233
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that the fact that Medford is one of those few municipalities that has never done this is part of the reason that

805
01:12:40,613 --> 01:12:44,195
[SPEAKER_26]: Our budget seasons have been so hard lately.

806
01:12:45,196 --> 01:12:49,939
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm proud that we're advancing proposals to start pivoting towards a more sustainable future.

807
01:12:49,959 --> 01:13:09,010
[SPEAKER_26]: So I will close by saying I am happy that this year we get to vote on not just a budget, but a plan to advance Medford out of underfunding and into a future where we can reliably provide better services for all students and all residents in our community.

808
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:09,370
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

809
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,901
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

810
01:13:11,941 --> 01:13:12,842
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Lazzaro.

811
01:13:14,062 --> 01:13:14,643
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

812
01:13:15,243 --> 01:13:16,184
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

813
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:17,164
[SPEAKER_25]: It's so nice to see you.

814
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:20,207
[SPEAKER_25]: I really appreciate what you presented.

815
01:13:20,267 --> 01:13:23,429
[SPEAKER_25]: I appreciate everything Vice President Collins said as well.

816
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:33,836
[SPEAKER_25]: This is my first budget experience, and it's very reminiscent of what I experienced in the school department when we went through

817
01:13:34,537 --> 01:13:42,165
[SPEAKER_25]: department by department and discussed in meetings what each department's proposal was and how it would all fit into the bigger picture.

818
01:13:43,327 --> 01:13:47,151
[SPEAKER_25]: The school department has to present a balanced budget every year.

819
01:13:47,451 --> 01:13:51,956
[SPEAKER_25]: And when I worked for the schools, that was what was the expected

820
01:13:52,937 --> 01:14:00,161
[SPEAKER_25]: experience and I found this this year's budget meetings to be incredibly transparent and incredibly useful.

821
01:14:01,102 --> 01:14:06,404
[SPEAKER_25]: Just for the public, if you're curious, you can see you can read the notes on all of our budget meetings.

822
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:18,891
[SPEAKER_25]: Everything is available and should illuminate a lot about what we discussed and most of the departments are being level funded.

823
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:20,372
[SPEAKER_25]: This is just maintaining

824
01:14:21,013 --> 01:14:23,315
[SPEAKER_25]: service in a lot of cases or improving service.

825
01:14:23,355 --> 01:14:26,758
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's, it's, it's, to me, this is a very hopeful budget.

826
01:14:27,438 --> 01:14:31,582
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, I think it speaks a lot to what our values are as a community.

827
01:14:31,942 --> 01:14:47,615
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, I, I really think that, uh, this budget says that we care about the infrastructure of our city and about investing in our city and about, um, making sure that our city employees have, uh, their positions and their, uh, environments.

828
01:14:48,796 --> 01:14:53,598
[SPEAKER_25]: funded from a source that's more permanent and that we believe in them and we care about them.

829
01:14:54,238 --> 01:15:05,361
[SPEAKER_25]: And it also means most significantly because it's the biggest part of the budget that we want to fund our public schools, the teachers and the students that are part of our Medford public schools.

830
01:15:05,962 --> 01:15:16,785
[SPEAKER_25]: It is the biggest part of the budget and it is incredibly significant that we step up as a community and we dedicate ourselves to making sure that that's our priority and

831
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:23,101
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that Mayor, you hit it right on the head when you said residents deserve the right to take a vote on this.

832
01:15:23,302 --> 01:15:26,944
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not forcing anybody to do anything.

833
01:15:27,504 --> 01:15:29,245
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a democratic process.

834
01:15:29,285 --> 01:15:33,828
[SPEAKER_25]: You can say yes or no to each of these questions on the ballot in November.

835
01:15:34,128 --> 01:15:37,990
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's a beautiful thing to be able to do that.

836
01:15:38,871 --> 01:15:43,394
[SPEAKER_25]: The fact that it hasn't, we haven't had the opportunity to say yes or no in the past is,

837
01:15:45,962 --> 01:15:47,864
[SPEAKER_25]: a challenge that we've faced this whole time.

838
01:15:47,964 --> 01:15:55,911
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think this is exciting and hopeful and sets the stage for a great future for Medford.

839
01:15:55,952 --> 01:16:02,578
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm very excited and I really appreciate everything that you've done for us and all of the work that was done by the financial task force.

840
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,360
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm very excited to see where we go from here.

841
01:16:05,601 --> 01:16:05,841
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

842
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:06,121
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

843
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:06,702
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor.

844
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:08,163
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

845
01:16:08,223 --> 01:16:09,004
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scarpelli.

846
01:16:13,993 --> 01:16:14,833
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you councilor Bears.

847
01:16:14,853 --> 01:16:27,679
[SPEAKER_46]: I think that I will share the probably the only comment that I agree with the mayor is that an override should go to the community, but if it's done right.

848
01:16:29,428 --> 01:16:40,054
[SPEAKER_46]: Last meeting, I posed a question about using free cash and showing the process so everybody could see what it does.

849
01:16:40,635 --> 01:16:54,564
[SPEAKER_46]: And just for the fact that the possibility, now maybe the mayor can answer this, in November, Madam Mayor, if the override happens to fail, what happens to our school department?

850
01:16:58,188 --> 01:17:01,170
[SPEAKER_23]: Well first, I wish I was at the Red Sox game.

851
01:17:04,011 --> 01:17:04,711
[SPEAKER_23]: Through the chair.

852
01:17:07,173 --> 01:17:07,373
[SPEAKER_23]: Yep.

853
01:17:09,114 --> 01:17:09,414
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

854
01:17:10,214 --> 01:17:11,955
[SPEAKER_46]: You usually are, but.

855
01:17:12,816 --> 01:17:18,198
[SPEAKER_23]: If the override, if the first override question, I mentioned it in my presentation.

856
01:17:18,999 --> 01:17:25,422
[SPEAKER_23]: If the first override question fails, we will be right back in the same position in

857
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:31,874
[SPEAKER_23]: March, April, May, June next year facing.

858
01:17:31,894 --> 01:17:35,057
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

859
01:17:37,499 --> 01:17:38,400
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, thank you.

860
01:17:39,184 --> 01:17:40,885
[SPEAKER_46]: So we would take that gamble.

861
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:42,046
[SPEAKER_46]: So that's what we did.

862
01:17:43,206 --> 01:17:55,093
[SPEAKER_46]: I'll revert back to June 20th of last year during the budget meeting, when I'm sure you remember the meeting that you had with both Councilor Bears and President Morell.

863
01:17:55,713 --> 01:18:04,118
[SPEAKER_46]: And as Councilor Bears stated before, it's in the minutes, it's in the video that Councilor Bears met with

864
01:18:04,918 --> 01:18:05,719
[SPEAKER_46]: behind closed doors.

865
01:18:06,259 --> 01:18:11,164
[SPEAKER_46]: And you came to an agreement and he's going to vote for the budget.

866
01:18:11,204 --> 01:18:24,135
[SPEAKER_46]: And what we did was you sold your soul because what you did is I felt like Nostradamus because as I said that night, what you're doing is going to put our city and financial ruins.

867
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:25,696
[SPEAKER_46]: And here we are.

868
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:27,218
[SPEAKER_46]: And here we are.

869
01:18:27,278 --> 01:18:29,820
[SPEAKER_46]: So the fact that when we look at where we are today,

870
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:44,380
[SPEAKER_46]: and what we talked about back a year ago, we've had one year knowing that this was gonna happen and what was created to make this less harsh for our community.

871
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,180
[SPEAKER_46]: Let's think about it.

872
01:18:47,582 --> 01:18:56,088
[SPEAKER_46]: You started a financial task force of you, the chief of staff, Council President Bears, Councilor Collins,

873
01:18:58,452 --> 01:19:02,114
[SPEAKER_46]: I believe vice chair Graham and the chief of staff.

874
01:19:03,455 --> 01:19:07,616
[SPEAKER_46]: That is our financial team.

875
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:21,743
[SPEAKER_46]: When I talked to neighbor communities as they lunged into these proposition two and a half, I talked to Mayor Curtatone, who informed me back in 2009 when they faced the same situation.

876
01:19:22,882 --> 01:19:31,028
[SPEAKER_46]: And this is what neighbor communities do for, I believe the word's been thrown out there, transparent, which I think is an absolute farce being used that way.

877
01:19:32,288 --> 01:19:49,100
[SPEAKER_46]: What they did back in 2009 to that community, they set up a financial advisory committee provided with expert advice from both savings and revenue production measures designed to help the city maintain its financial strength and face this deepening economics recession.

878
01:19:49,867 --> 01:20:17,589
[SPEAKER_46]: They looked at a committee which had Samuel Tyler, president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau of Free Assistance, Jonathan Sloan, the president and co-CEO of Century Bank, Jeffrey Hartigan, senior vice president investments of UBS Financial Services, the Chamber of Commerce and leadership team from their financial team, and

879
01:20:18,857 --> 01:20:24,319
[SPEAKER_46]: Daniel Richards, Professor Daniel Richards at Tufts University and in the economics department.

880
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:29,582
[SPEAKER_46]: That's what I've been saying, that we might need an override.

881
01:20:30,422 --> 01:20:31,102
[SPEAKER_46]: We might need it.

882
01:20:32,043 --> 01:20:33,523
[SPEAKER_46]: But why divide the community?

883
01:20:33,623 --> 01:20:38,366
[SPEAKER_46]: Why gamble our future, our kids' future, by not doing it properly?

884
01:20:38,406 --> 01:20:38,986
[SPEAKER_46]: And what do we do?

885
01:20:40,014 --> 01:20:41,255
[SPEAKER_46]: We met behind closed doors.

886
01:20:41,676 --> 01:20:45,619
[SPEAKER_46]: You sat in the meeting since I believe Councilor Bears said September.

887
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,503
[SPEAKER_46]: You've had meetings that we've had no updates, no minutes, no notes, nothing.

888
01:20:50,244 --> 01:20:57,971
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Bears stated that when we get closer, he will give us all the information possible.

889
01:20:59,065 --> 01:21:14,514
[SPEAKER_46]: And what we've got, we got a message from yourself that we are now going to just jump into an override, jump into debt exclusions, and jump into very, very scary times for a lot of very vulnerable residents in our community.

890
01:21:15,255 --> 01:21:21,158
[SPEAKER_46]: Of course, when I asked for debt exclusion, I worked with the best financial mind in Aleesha Nunley.

891
01:21:21,178 --> 01:21:21,679
[SPEAKER_46]: You remember her.

892
01:21:22,679 --> 01:21:28,123
[SPEAKER_46]: Aleesha Nunley, who was an award-winning budget creator,

893
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:39,442
[SPEAKER_46]: she was, and when she broke it down for us, we eliminated senior citizens, and we eliminated veterans to see what that exclusion looked like for new fire stations.

894
01:21:41,103 --> 01:21:47,128
[SPEAKER_46]: And the numbers were drastically different, but we were making sure we were taking care of the most vulnerable members of our community.

895
01:21:48,649 --> 01:21:53,832
[SPEAKER_46]: What I asked for the other day was, when I was unceremoniously ruled 21,

896
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:59,082
[SPEAKER_46]: and made quiet again, because what I was saying made sense.

897
01:22:00,303 --> 01:22:10,350
[SPEAKER_46]: Taking that money, five to $7 million out of free cash, and balancing the budget, and then working together by being more transparent and open in the process of an override.

898
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:20,976
[SPEAKER_46]: You mentioned that the process, that looking at the process, it's only $440 a year.

899
01:22:24,531 --> 01:22:25,232
[SPEAKER_46]: Now, that's minimal.

900
01:22:25,272 --> 01:22:26,252
[SPEAKER_46]: Sure, that sounds great.

901
01:22:28,094 --> 01:22:41,885
[SPEAKER_46]: But what's scaring our residents, maybe you're not listening to them or even hearing them, especially our most vulnerable, when you're looking at a transfer tax that was mentioned, rent control that was mentioned, a registry fee that was mentioned.

902
01:22:42,986 --> 01:22:47,910
[SPEAKER_46]: We talked about a debt exclusion for a fire station.

903
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:51,332
[SPEAKER_46]: That's probably $250 million debt exclusion for a new high school.

904
01:22:52,273 --> 01:22:53,174
[SPEAKER_46]: Who does that fall on?

905
01:22:55,813 --> 01:23:03,279
[SPEAKER_46]: Our homeowners, and a lot of these homeowners that some of my colleagues think that are rich because they own a home of a million dollars.

906
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:17,689
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, I'll give you an example of a person I talked to today, and when she said, George, I'm gonna be honest, this scares me, because her and her husband bought their home in Medford 60 years ago for minimal money.

907
01:23:18,049 --> 01:23:19,630
[SPEAKER_46]: Now their home's worth a million dollars.

908
01:23:21,633 --> 01:23:33,537
[SPEAKER_46]: And that million dollars now, because of the tax rate, now these little add-ons, as you called it, they're just small, as they keep adding on, these most vulnerable members of our community are petrified.

909
01:23:34,858 --> 01:23:36,938
[SPEAKER_46]: They fear where we're going with this community.

910
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:41,760
[SPEAKER_46]: What I would have asked you, Madam Mayor, is looking at the process.

911
01:23:43,567 --> 01:23:45,748
[SPEAKER_46]: and where we've been in the last five years.

912
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:47,729
[SPEAKER_46]: What have we done to create new growth?

913
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:55,454
[SPEAKER_46]: What have we truly done to create revenue to support our streets, our sidewalks, our schools, our fire, our police?

914
01:23:56,547 --> 01:23:57,167
[SPEAKER_46]: What have we done?

915
01:23:57,947 --> 01:24:02,408
[SPEAKER_46]: You've had 340B projects that you turned your nose to that they've all walked away.

916
01:24:02,868 --> 01:24:10,490
[SPEAKER_46]: Millions of dollars, millions of dollars in revenue through tax and through permits and fees.

917
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,730
[SPEAKER_46]: Millions.

918
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,671
[SPEAKER_46]: Just that alone in three projects that we know of.

919
01:24:16,091 --> 01:24:22,453
[SPEAKER_46]: So when we look at this process, this is a total farce when you look at what we're doing.

920
01:24:22,873 --> 01:24:24,593
[SPEAKER_46]: We look at the different processes

921
01:24:25,678 --> 01:24:29,541
[SPEAKER_46]: And like I mentioned, here we are.

922
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,123
[SPEAKER_46]: This was mentioned on Friday.

923
01:24:33,204 --> 01:24:40,610
[SPEAKER_46]: This is probably the biggest, biggest motion, resolution to come in front of this council ever.

924
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,312
[SPEAKER_46]: Ever.

925
01:24:44,774 --> 01:24:45,895
[SPEAKER_46]: And we have no meetings.

926
01:24:45,935 --> 01:24:48,737
[SPEAKER_46]: We haven't talked about this as a council, community, and not once.

927
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,402
[SPEAKER_46]: But we've had five meetings on a newsletter.

928
01:24:56,650 --> 01:25:07,375
[SPEAKER_46]: But when you're talking about affecting thousands of people, thousands of homeowners, we haven't had any discussions, except for you and your financial task force.

929
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:10,016
[SPEAKER_46]: That doesn't seem like a financial task force at all.

930
01:25:10,476 --> 01:25:12,037
[SPEAKER_46]: Because what it reads is what it reads.

931
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,139
[SPEAKER_46]: Because if it walks like a duck, it smells like a duck, it's a duck.

932
01:25:15,939 --> 01:25:20,941
[SPEAKER_46]: You guys went in the back room, and you found the easiest way so you could be let off the hook.

933
01:25:21,662 --> 01:25:24,563
[SPEAKER_46]: And that is by debt exclusion to override.

934
01:25:25,263 --> 01:25:26,084
[SPEAKER_46]: And that's a shame.

935
01:25:27,145 --> 01:25:27,866
[SPEAKER_46]: That is a shame.

936
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:33,851
[SPEAKER_46]: I showed you what other communities do, what they've done in the past, and how it works.

937
01:25:35,132 --> 01:25:43,759
[SPEAKER_46]: We talked to the superintendent who came up and talked to us about making it whole, and her saying that, no, it's not going to make it whole for what we talked about.

938
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:49,964
[SPEAKER_46]: Because I believe Vice Chair Graham mentioned to one of the city council, I believe Intoppa,

939
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:55,803
[SPEAKER_46]: When he asked the question, if we get to 79 million, will everything be put whole?

940
01:25:55,924 --> 01:25:57,004
[SPEAKER_46]: She said, absolutely.

941
01:25:57,664 --> 01:26:00,086
[SPEAKER_46]: The superintendent sat in front of us and said, absolutely not.

942
01:26:01,306 --> 01:26:08,110
[SPEAKER_46]: She's gonna take more money, just like you will, and put it into a black hole that we don't know where it's going.

943
01:26:09,571 --> 01:26:12,032
[SPEAKER_46]: And the proof is in the pudding.

944
01:26:12,052 --> 01:26:14,093
[SPEAKER_46]: Our numbers aren't very good, Madam Mayor.

945
01:26:15,093 --> 01:26:17,855
[SPEAKER_46]: If we look at our education numbers, we don't look good.

946
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:20,075
[SPEAKER_46]: We're not doing well.

947
01:26:20,835 --> 01:26:26,417
[SPEAKER_46]: And we provided more funding to the school department above all other departments.

948
01:26:27,157 --> 01:26:29,718
[SPEAKER_46]: That's not to say we don't need more, absolutely.

949
01:26:30,538 --> 01:26:32,038
[SPEAKER_46]: But it's how it's managed right now.

950
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:33,378
[SPEAKER_46]: That's a weak question.

951
01:26:35,299 --> 01:26:39,080
[SPEAKER_46]: So I appreciate the dog and pony show.

952
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:41,180
[SPEAKER_46]: I appreciate everybody patting each other on the back.

953
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,321
[SPEAKER_46]: But this was a complete joke.

954
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:48,102
[SPEAKER_46]: Lack of transparency, lack of communication with all members of this community.

955
01:26:49,093 --> 01:26:55,536
[SPEAKER_46]: And again, I'll say it again, I don't disagree that we might need an override.

956
01:26:55,576 --> 01:26:56,776
[SPEAKER_46]: I say that from the get-go.

957
01:26:57,837 --> 01:27:00,898
[SPEAKER_46]: But what we haven't done is we haven't done this together.

958
01:27:02,386 --> 01:27:08,531
[SPEAKER_46]: What you've done tonight, if you caused enough divide in our community, Madam Mayor, we are now divided.

959
01:27:08,651 --> 01:27:16,478
[SPEAKER_46]: And I will tell you, I've had hundreds of people call me on both ends, 100 people saying, George, we need an override, and having great discussions.

960
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:23,304
[SPEAKER_46]: But I've also had hundreds of phone calls from people that are saying, no, this isn't good, and we're gonna fight on this.

961
01:27:24,365 --> 01:27:27,388
[SPEAKER_46]: So instead of sitting there together as a group,

962
01:27:28,325 --> 01:27:34,207
[SPEAKER_46]: and putting it together and figure out the best course transparently, what we can do for our community, we didn't do that.

963
01:27:35,367 --> 01:27:40,129
[SPEAKER_46]: On June 20th, you sold your soul.

964
01:27:41,329 --> 01:27:44,530
[SPEAKER_46]: This task force was put together.

965
01:27:46,044 --> 01:27:48,745
[SPEAKER_46]: You sat here doing nothing, because you knew this was going to be nothing.

966
01:27:48,965 --> 01:27:52,607
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm glad you could smile, miss, because you're really affecting hundreds of people's lives here.

967
01:27:53,408 --> 01:28:02,212
[SPEAKER_46]: And then you come out and come out out of all this work, not knowing what you did, for overrides, debt exclusions.

968
01:28:03,793 --> 01:28:08,155
[SPEAKER_46]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I will invoke Rule 21, which states

969
01:28:15,543 --> 01:28:19,104
[SPEAKER_46]: dispositions of all items appearing on the city council agenda.

970
01:28:19,684 --> 01:28:32,288
[SPEAKER_46]: All items of business appearing upon council agenda shall be taken up in the order their parents and fully openly debates the disposal of by vote of council previous to the consideration of any other item of business.

971
01:28:32,948 --> 01:28:37,029
[SPEAKER_46]: No item of business shall be referred to committee except for the following reasons.

972
01:28:37,742 --> 01:29:03,571
[SPEAKER_46]: for the study and the report of subsequent meeting, for the purpose of drafting an ordinance, and the event that open discussions may prove damaging to the character and reputation of a person or persons, all matters referred to the committee shall reappear on the council agenda for the meeting for four weeks following the referral, unless sooner presented by the committee chair or a majority not exceeding two weeks is voted by the council upon request of the committee chair.

973
01:29:04,511 --> 01:29:06,312
[SPEAKER_46]: majority committee memberships.

974
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:17,097
[SPEAKER_46]: Any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any member.

975
01:29:17,657 --> 01:29:29,583
[SPEAKER_46]: Now you might've suspended the rules, but I want the community to realize you stifled me last time disrespectfully shutting down rule 21 because I made sense.

976
01:29:30,629 --> 01:29:34,691
[SPEAKER_46]: and it was a viable way for us to slow things down and do it the right way.

977
01:29:35,632 --> 01:29:39,314
[SPEAKER_46]: And then tonight, you suspend the motion for this process.

978
01:29:39,694 --> 01:29:42,415
[SPEAKER_46]: Well I invoke rule 21 this evening.

979
01:29:43,656 --> 01:29:54,002
[SPEAKER_46]: And if I have to, I would look into contacting our attorney and looking for an injunction to see where this goes, because I think this is a fraudulent process by the president.

980
01:29:54,082 --> 01:29:54,402
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

981
01:30:02,793 --> 01:30:04,153
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

982
01:30:04,413 --> 01:30:10,335
[SPEAKER_39]: As noted by Councilor Scarpelli, there was a motion to suspend the rules to take these papers and to suspend rule 21.

983
01:30:10,895 --> 01:30:12,375
[SPEAKER_39]: Madam mayor, your response.

984
01:30:13,455 --> 01:30:13,795
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

985
01:30:14,395 --> 01:30:18,676
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, just a few points from Councilor Scarpelli.

986
01:30:18,756 --> 01:30:30,699
[SPEAKER_23]: First off is I just want to point out that we do probably twice a year, press releases on development strategy and what our team and PDS has been doing throughout the community.

987
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:31,759
[SPEAKER_23]: The last one was,

988
01:30:33,322 --> 01:30:38,844
[SPEAKER_23]: late fall, it's on our city website and it outlines all the work that we've done.

989
01:30:38,904 --> 01:30:40,285
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just wanna point that out.

990
01:30:40,885 --> 01:30:47,668
[SPEAKER_23]: We have six housing developments, including 240Bs that are moving forward.

991
01:30:48,328 --> 01:30:55,651
[SPEAKER_23]: We have five life science developments that are moving forward, Riverside Ave, Boston Ave, Sycamore, et cetera.

992
01:30:56,636 --> 01:31:00,939
[SPEAKER_23]: We also have the Great American Beer Hall, commercial, retail, mixed-use developments.

993
01:31:00,979 --> 01:31:04,682
[SPEAKER_23]: There's another whole list that has been moved forward.

994
01:31:04,742 --> 01:31:09,665
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think it's a shame to say that we've done nothing in the last few years.

995
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:13,508
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's always open to the public, and we do send that to every councilor.

996
01:31:13,528 --> 01:31:14,989
[SPEAKER_23]: I just don't know if everybody reads it.

997
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:18,071
[SPEAKER_23]: Second, I had our

998
01:31:18,652 --> 01:31:26,136
[SPEAKER_23]: planning department outline, because it's said quite often that we've lost opportunities on these 40 Bs.

999
01:31:27,096 --> 01:31:31,699
[SPEAKER_23]: First, there's one that keeps submitting and withdrawing, so that is what it is.

1000
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:37,842
[SPEAKER_23]: We did do our GLAM analysis and we did in-state Safe Harbor

1001
01:31:39,548 --> 01:31:40,749
[SPEAKER_23]: there was two developments.

1002
01:31:40,849 --> 01:31:41,990
[SPEAKER_23]: One was Mystic Valley Parkway.

1003
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:43,971
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the one that's moving forward.

1004
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:50,756
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there's a Fellsway that's in the middle of, between the Fellsway commercial and then a fully residential neighborhood.

1005
01:31:51,176 --> 01:32:00,343
[SPEAKER_23]: So by instituting Safe Harbor, we've been able to get these developers to come to the table and negotiate with us.

1006
01:32:00,836 --> 01:32:06,524
[SPEAKER_23]: If we didn't install our safe harbor status, we would have had no seat at the table.

1007
01:32:06,584 --> 01:32:09,828
[SPEAKER_23]: We would have been able to get no community benefits.

1008
01:32:09,848 --> 01:32:15,175
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you wouldn't indulge me, I'll just maybe I have multiple pages on the first two and I can just.

1009
01:32:16,316 --> 01:32:18,818
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll actually read the first one that's moving forward.

1010
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:20,639
[SPEAKER_23]: It's 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1011
01:32:20,659 --> 01:32:23,621
[SPEAKER_23]: We've reduced density from the original proposal.

1012
01:32:23,721 --> 01:32:27,343
[SPEAKER_23]: We split it into two buildings for more manageable scale.

1013
01:32:27,884 --> 01:32:40,892
[SPEAKER_23]: We asked them to put in a shared use path around the entire property, not accessible vehicles on two sides, improve amenity space for residents with intentional play areas, significantly improved architectural design,

1014
01:32:41,492 --> 01:32:45,216
[SPEAKER_23]: Up to 70% of the affordable units will have Medford priority.

1015
01:32:45,876 --> 01:32:51,501
[SPEAKER_23]: Significantly increased bike storage for residents including provisions for electric bike charging in parking areas.

1016
01:32:52,522 --> 01:33:03,352
[SPEAKER_23]: Pocket Park on the corner of Mystic Valley Parkway and Commercial Street with public amenities including a commitment for public art to be improved by the Medford Arts Council, Medford Historic Society and the Medford Department of

1017
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,412
[SPEAKER_23]: DEI.

1018
01:33:05,113 --> 01:33:11,715
[SPEAKER_23]: We building an all electric, the building will be all electric with the exception of emergency generator.

1019
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:29,262
[SPEAKER_23]: We've improved the layout for loading and passenger drop-off zones on site on the commercial outside to improve area vehicle flow, significant pedestrian improvements to the intersection of Commercial Ave and Mystic Valley Parkway, including ADA ramps, pedestrian countdown indicators, pedestrian push buttons, improved crosswalk pave markings,

1020
01:33:29,682 --> 01:33:40,247
[SPEAKER_23]: new streetlights on commercial street, improved curb cuts, sidewalks, and crosswalks on commercial street, a new blue bike station on site or in the vicinity, over 50,000 alone.

1021
01:33:40,367 --> 01:33:46,249
[SPEAKER_23]: Applicant will comply with the solar ordinance, 264,000 in linkage paid to our fire, police, and parks.

1022
01:33:46,609 --> 01:33:55,173
[SPEAKER_23]: That's just one 40B project, and we would have gotten none of this if we didn't instate our, it didn't calculate our glam analysis and didn't instate

1023
01:33:55,563 --> 01:33:56,144
[SPEAKER_23]: safe harbors.

1024
01:33:56,164 --> 01:34:06,497
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm so proud of the work that our planning development sustainability office has done on not only this, but also on the Fellsway and whatever the last developer chooses to do.

1025
01:34:06,517 --> 01:34:10,022
[SPEAKER_23]: And then I just want to speak to the task force.

1026
01:34:11,243 --> 01:34:19,646
[SPEAKER_23]: I wanna say that this is probably, in my 23 years, it's been the most collaborative that school committee, city council, and the mayor's office has been.

1027
01:34:20,106 --> 01:34:31,409
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think I said that to you after the election in November, that I just feel like these three bodies are gonna be able to work better and more collaboratively than they ever have, because you all do the work.

1028
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:35,491
[SPEAKER_23]: Whether people like it or not, whether they think you're moving too fast, you're doing the work.

1029
01:34:36,371 --> 01:34:37,072
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm proud of that.

1030
01:34:37,272 --> 01:34:38,733
[SPEAKER_23]: The school committee is doing the work.

1031
01:34:38,993 --> 01:34:47,479
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm a witness to it every night that I'm at the meetings and I know what some of the, some or all of the school committee members put together behind the scenes.

1032
01:34:48,019 --> 01:34:50,100
[SPEAKER_23]: And this has been transparent since day one.

1033
01:34:50,300 --> 01:35:02,509
[SPEAKER_23]: It was 2022 when Councilor Bears and Councilor Collins discussed it at the council meeting and wrote a public memo that you thought an override should be on the ballot.

1034
01:35:03,576 --> 01:35:08,840
[SPEAKER_23]: I wrote a public memo back that I agreed, 12 million, 3 million, but that's that.

1035
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:16,625
[SPEAKER_23]: And since then, we, yes, we talk on the phone, we talk behind closed doors, but it's all transparent.

1036
01:35:16,705 --> 01:35:28,934
[SPEAKER_23]: When we went through the budget last year, we did, we sat down, we discussed it, just, Councilor Tseng, you were also in the room, we discussed it, we said, what's the path forward, how are we gonna manage, how are we gonna build a better budget and a better budget process?

1037
01:35:29,354 --> 01:35:30,695
[SPEAKER_23]: And we did a press release, that was,

1038
01:35:32,403 --> 01:35:40,909
[SPEAKER_23]: Correct me if I'm wrong on specific dates, but in June of 2023, we put out a press release on exactly what we agreed on.

1039
01:35:41,169 --> 01:35:42,710
[SPEAKER_23]: Nothing more, nothing less.

1040
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,031
[SPEAKER_23]: Transparency, that's transparency.

1041
01:35:45,391 --> 01:35:46,852
[SPEAKER_23]: We started a meeting in the fall.

1042
01:35:46,872 --> 01:35:49,914
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe our first meeting might've been the end of September, beginning of October.

1043
01:35:50,435 --> 01:35:52,516
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, put out another press release.

1044
01:35:53,056 --> 01:35:57,019
[SPEAKER_23]: We then worked through the struggles that we are facing financially over the last several months.

1045
01:35:57,728 --> 01:36:10,724
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, the five of us were in that room for the task force meeting, but member Graham and myself were meeting with the CFO of the schools and our superintendent, quite regularly, as well as the school committee meeting on the floor to talk about the budget.

1046
01:36:11,890 --> 01:36:27,133
[SPEAKER_23]: myself and my chief of staff, as well as the councilors, I'm sure, we're talking to our CFO, who I also think has an amazing mind, regularly, my chief of staff every day, myself at least weekly, or sometimes multiple times a week.

1047
01:36:27,633 --> 01:36:39,556
[SPEAKER_23]: So yes, we had two CFOs working on this process, not in the room every step of the way when we met as a group of five, but we talked through what we thought was the best path forward and how we could

1048
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:44,062
[SPEAKER_23]: get this budget approved and still provide for our city and mainly our students.

1049
01:36:44,682 --> 01:36:46,042
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm proud of the work we've done.

1050
01:36:46,062 --> 01:36:50,804
[SPEAKER_23]: Gone are the days where we're negotiating jobs for friends.

1051
01:36:50,964 --> 01:36:52,065
[SPEAKER_23]: That doesn't happen anymore.

1052
01:36:52,445 --> 01:36:53,205
[SPEAKER_23]: We're negotiating.

1053
01:36:53,245 --> 01:36:57,187
[SPEAKER_23]: We truly care about this city and we care about the future of the city.

1054
01:36:57,267 --> 01:36:59,428
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's why you have the three ballot questions before you.

1055
01:36:59,855 --> 01:37:01,797
[SPEAKER_23]: People can vote yes, people can vote no.

1056
01:37:02,017 --> 01:37:02,998
[SPEAKER_23]: They're split into three.

1057
01:37:03,138 --> 01:37:07,082
[SPEAKER_23]: We could have done two, but I think three was the best way to do it.

1058
01:37:07,202 --> 01:37:09,765
[SPEAKER_23]: People have a choice, and they have a choice in November.

1059
01:37:10,225 --> 01:37:11,466
[SPEAKER_23]: It is months and months away.

1060
01:37:11,646 --> 01:37:13,829
[SPEAKER_23]: There's gonna be campaigns on both sides.

1061
01:37:14,189 --> 01:37:18,313
[SPEAKER_23]: There's gonna be things we're restricted from doing after potentially the vote tonight if it passes.

1062
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,141
[SPEAKER_23]: but it's up to the people now.

1063
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:23,922
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I mean, there's more I could go into.

1064
01:37:24,442 --> 01:37:25,823
[SPEAKER_23]: I am listening to residents.

1065
01:37:26,563 --> 01:37:28,104
[SPEAKER_23]: This money will not go into a black hole.

1066
01:37:28,124 --> 01:37:29,944
[SPEAKER_23]: It's gonna go towards literacy coaches.

1067
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:34,266
[SPEAKER_23]: It's gonna go towards a nurse so that he or she is not let go.

1068
01:37:34,286 --> 01:37:41,689
[SPEAKER_23]: It's gonna go to teachers because we wanna keep the levels as much as we can in our school system.

1069
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:45,531
[SPEAKER_23]: It's gonna be the best way forward for our students.

1070
01:37:46,851 --> 01:37:48,392
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to address the councilor, thank you.

1071
01:37:49,497 --> 01:37:50,138
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you mayor.

1072
01:38:02,529 --> 01:38:04,271
[SPEAKER_39: Councilor Tseng, then Councilor Callahan.

1073
01:38:05,896 --> 01:38:06,296
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1074
01:38:07,939 --> 01:38:15,147
[SPEAKER_37]: As everyone I think in this room knows, this has not been an easy budget season, not an easy budget year.

1075
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:17,891
[SPEAKER_37]: We knew about this for many, many years now.

1076
01:38:19,975 --> 01:38:22,756
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll be frank with you, this budget is imperfect.

1077
01:38:22,916 --> 01:38:38,279
[SPEAKER_37]: As I think, as you acknowledge in your statements, and before we got your final proposal, before we got the additional context, which Vice President Collins reminded us about, I was ready to vote no on it if I was uncomfortable with it.

1078
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:48,702
[SPEAKER_37]: The additional papers that you've sent that have been put on the agenda, I think provide the context that I need to feel more comfortable voting for this budget.

1079
01:38:50,245 --> 01:38:51,766
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not enough, like you said.

1080
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:53,887
[SPEAKER_37]: We need to do better by our schools.

1081
01:38:55,347 --> 01:39:01,210
[SPEAKER_37]: I ran on a platform that was mostly around increasing school funding.

1082
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:06,832
[SPEAKER_37]: It's one of the two core reasons why I got into local politics in the first place.

1083
01:39:07,652 --> 01:39:14,996
[SPEAKER_37]: As a student, I really benefited from a lot of the programs that we have been talking about for the last few months that have been at risk of being cut.

1084
01:39:16,132 --> 01:39:25,181
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm happy that the ARPA supplement in this budget helps us keep a lot of those programs, or at least gives us the option to keep a lot of those programs.

1085
01:39:25,721 --> 01:39:37,373
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think maybe even more importantly, the override questions chart a long-term stable path towards financial health for our school system.

1086
01:39:38,484 --> 01:39:40,485
[SPEAKER_37]: I think that's really important to mention.

1087
01:39:40,505 --> 01:39:45,566
[SPEAKER_37]: I think you and I, we've had a lot of conversations about using free cash, one-time funds.

1088
01:39:46,347 --> 01:39:47,887
[SPEAKER_37]: Sometimes we've agreed, sometimes we haven't.

1089
01:39:48,507 --> 01:39:59,191
[SPEAKER_37]: And to explain to the residents, a lot of our conversations go along the lines of, I'm trying to push you to spend more in free cash, and you're pushing back against it.

1090
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:02,072
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think you do actually have a reason.

1091
01:40:02,112 --> 01:40:04,033
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it's important to tell the public that.

1092
01:40:04,693 --> 01:40:09,257
[SPEAKER_37]: When we use free cash, that's a one-time fund for recurring positions.

1093
01:40:10,058 --> 01:40:16,684
[SPEAKER_37]: And we need to find a way to wean off of those one-time funds, particularly in order to keep our bond rating high.

1094
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:23,032
[SPEAKER_37]: We know that we are on a path to build a new high school.

1095
01:40:23,273 --> 01:40:30,359
[SPEAKER_37]: We have a lot of big projects coming up and we need better bond ratings to save money for our city in the long term for those projects.

1096
01:40:30,939 --> 01:40:41,889
[SPEAKER_37]: And so it's reasonable to me, and it's not fun, but it's reasonable to me to use the ARPA supplement that you proposed and to pair it with the override questions.

1097
01:40:42,609 --> 01:40:49,575
[SPEAKER_37]: I think oftentimes reasonable governance, rational governance, and responsible governance isn't fun.

1098
01:40:49,955 --> 01:40:50,696
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not sexy.

1099
01:40:51,216 --> 01:40:55,520
[SPEAKER_37]: It's oftentimes really, you know, forces us to make really difficult decisions.

1100
01:40:56,161 --> 01:41:01,745
[SPEAKER_37]: I think in those circumstances, it's really important to return the right of

1101
01:41:02,446 --> 01:41:03,687
[SPEAKER_37]: those decisions to the voters.

1102
01:41:04,207 --> 01:41:06,469
[SPEAKER_37]: I think that gets back to the override question.

1103
01:41:06,489 --> 01:41:13,575
[SPEAKER_37]: I think we have to remember that the question that we're facing as a council today is whether we present these questions to the voters in November.

1104
01:41:14,616 --> 01:41:16,857
[SPEAKER_37]: We're not voting on the increase, right?

1105
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:18,078
[SPEAKER_37]: We're sending it to the voters.

1106
01:41:18,679 --> 01:41:30,648
[SPEAKER_37]: And I've always told the residents whose doors I've knocked on, whose phones I've called, and I actually got this the first day it was canvassing about four years ago in Wellington.

1107
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:35,672
[SPEAKER_37]: What would you do about a prop two and a half override?

1108
01:41:36,113 --> 01:41:41,897
[SPEAKER_37]: And I said back then, agree or disagree with it, the most just decision is the democratic decision.

1109
01:41:42,258 --> 01:41:43,338
[SPEAKER_37]: It's to leave it to the voters.

1110
01:41:43,999 --> 01:41:45,860
[SPEAKER_37]: I have my feelings on it.

1111
01:41:46,421 --> 01:41:47,081
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm sure you do.

1112
01:41:48,483 --> 01:41:52,466
[SPEAKER_37]: But it's the responsibility of the electorate to make that decision ultimately.

1113
01:41:53,386 --> 01:41:55,708
[SPEAKER_37]: As you acknowledged, it's a difficult choice for a lot of folks to make.

1114
01:41:56,889 --> 01:41:59,411
[SPEAKER_37]: But I think governance is about making difficult choices.

1115
01:41:59,711 --> 01:42:00,972
[SPEAKER_37]: It's about making choices that

1116
01:42:01,673 --> 01:42:04,355
[SPEAKER_37]: cause debate and debate is a part of democracy.

1117
01:42:04,595 --> 01:42:08,998
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, we can't avoid it and we shouldn't avoid it because avoiding it is what got us here in the first place.

1118
01:42:10,579 --> 01:42:14,421
[SPEAKER_37]: The health of our city financially is not due to one budget.

1119
01:42:14,562 --> 01:42:17,183
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not due to any one budget or any one council, any one mayor.

1120
01:42:18,344 --> 01:42:22,107
[SPEAKER_37]: It's due to a general approach that we've taken as a city for decades.

1121
01:42:22,527 --> 01:42:25,849
[SPEAKER_37]: We found ourselves in a position that's difficult to, you know,

1122
01:42:29,161 --> 01:42:32,304
[SPEAKER_37]: focus on new growth and have that plug in all the holes that we need.

1123
01:42:32,685 --> 01:42:34,166
[SPEAKER_37]: And that is what our council is doing.

1124
01:42:34,467 --> 01:42:40,714
[SPEAKER_37]: Earlier tonight, we passed our first step in our zoning recodification phase.

1125
01:42:41,214 --> 01:42:51,005
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's focused, like you said, on the new growth, on bringing in a larger tax base for our city so that we won't have to be forced to make decisions like this.

1126
01:42:52,646 --> 01:42:59,753
[SPEAKER_37]: I've also always told residents that the override is the last option that we have to resort to.

1127
01:43:00,657 --> 01:43:06,503
[SPEAKER_37]: But the facts of the economic reality of the situation is that we've been cutting budgets to the bone and then some.

1128
01:43:07,023 --> 01:43:10,827
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think this year's budget conversations really exemplify that.

1129
01:43:10,987 --> 01:43:15,111
[SPEAKER_37]: Our skeleton budget's been cut so much that it can't really stand up on its own.

1130
01:43:15,651 --> 01:43:23,919
[SPEAKER_37]: I think that's why we need to make these difficult decisions and to pose these questions to the voters, to have them choose.

1131
01:43:26,565 --> 01:43:34,090
[SPEAKER_37]: I, you also mentioned, I think really importantly, this idea that our residents are demanding more, and I think they're right to demand more.

1132
01:43:34,711 --> 01:43:51,362
[SPEAKER_37]: Every conversation I have on the doors, you know, we're talking about problems our city is facing, and it's heartbreaking to go budget season after budget season, door after door, to tell them we don't have the money for that, we're working on a plan, but it'll take years for that new growth money to come in.

1133
01:43:52,162 --> 01:43:55,625
[SPEAKER_37]: And, you know, we have to be realistic about the timeline of new growth.

1134
01:43:57,034 --> 01:43:59,136
[SPEAKER_37]: It takes more than one day for a building to be built.

1135
01:44:00,077 --> 01:44:05,523
[SPEAKER_37]: And we need this money to plug the hole now.

1136
01:44:08,066 --> 01:44:11,870
[SPEAKER_37]: You've also mentioned a lot of the growth that is happening in Medford.

1137
01:44:14,246 --> 01:44:15,027
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll push back a little.

1138
01:44:15,107 --> 01:44:17,829
[SPEAKER_37]: I think we can be doing more as a city.

1139
01:44:18,450 --> 01:44:30,221
[SPEAKER_37]: But the fact of the matter, according to the Boston Foundation, we have, as a percentage of prior permits, Medford is by far the leader in the Boston area for permitting new housing.

1140
01:44:30,262 --> 01:44:32,283
[SPEAKER_37]: That is something to keep in mind.

1141
01:44:32,744 --> 01:44:33,605
[SPEAKER_37]: We are working on it.

1142
01:44:33,785 --> 01:44:36,488
[SPEAKER_37]: We're not where we need to be, but we are working on it.

1143
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:44,724
[SPEAKER_37]: I think, you know, ultimately every budget conversation revolves around the question of fiscal responsibility.

1144
01:44:46,846 --> 01:44:57,075
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not fiscally responsible when we're cutting budgets so much that we have city departments that aren't operating at the level that they need to be operating at.

1145
01:44:57,873 --> 01:45:13,347
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not fiscal responsibility when parents have to decide whether to send their kids to private school and to spend thousands on tuition because they can't get the specialists, the programs, the teachers that they need for their kids to succeed in our public school system.

1146
01:45:14,268 --> 01:45:22,235
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not fiscally responsible when our firefighters are operating out of really the dilapidated fire headquarters

1147
01:45:23,331 --> 01:45:24,412
[SPEAKER_37]: in Medford Square.

1148
01:45:24,432 --> 01:45:35,229
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not fiscally responsible when residents have to spend hundreds of dollars every year, year after year, because our potholes are so bad that they feel like a roller coaster.

1149
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:47,475
[SPEAKER_37]: And the whole budget process in the last few years, this year has been calmer because of the collaboration, but the whole budget process oftentimes feels like a rollercoaster ride.

1150
01:45:47,895 --> 01:45:52,077
[SPEAKER_37]: I think that these override questions do stabilize our city a bit.

1151
01:45:52,777 --> 01:45:59,819
[SPEAKER_37]: And they give us a chance, a fighting chance to not only succeed, but to thrive as a city.

1152
01:46:01,362 --> 01:46:09,167
[SPEAKER_37]: So to all the residents who are tuning in tonight, you may have the override questions, the choice is yours.

1153
01:46:10,188 --> 01:46:12,069
[SPEAKER_37]: But I ask you to consider one thing.

1154
01:46:12,329 --> 01:46:14,430
[SPEAKER_37]: I ask you to vote for someone you don't know.

1155
01:46:14,771 --> 01:46:17,212
[SPEAKER_37]: Vote for the kid who needs the literacy coaches.

1156
01:46:17,773 --> 01:46:20,254
[SPEAKER_37]: Vote for the drivers who need

1157
01:46:22,315 --> 01:46:22,875
[SPEAKER_37]: better roads.

1158
01:46:23,456 --> 01:46:33,723
[SPEAKER_37]: Vote for the parents that need to talk to guidance staff, the school nurses, the arts, the families that need the arts programs to have their kids thrive.

1159
01:46:34,464 --> 01:46:36,165
[SPEAKER_37]: Vote for a future where our city

1160
01:46:37,666 --> 01:46:42,591
[SPEAKER_37]: shares and saves costs where we share our burdens and save money in the long run.

1161
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:50,819
[SPEAKER_37]: And where our finances are more stable and where I can go to you, our residents and say, yes, we can work on that project.

1162
01:46:50,959 --> 01:46:52,460
[SPEAKER_37]: Let me get, let me get that done for you.

1163
01:46:52,981 --> 01:46:54,042
[SPEAKER_37]: So I yield my time.

1164
01:46:55,423 --> 01:46:56,444
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1165
01:47:03,435 --> 01:47:07,369
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Councilor Callahan, Councilor Leming, Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Collins.

1166
01:47:07,409 --> 01:47:08,092
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan.

1167
01:47:08,629 --> 01:47:09,510
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1168
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:19,439
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam Mayor, for being here, for all the work that you have done on the budget and providing us with the information early, and also on working on these proposals.

1169
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:24,884
[SPEAKER_18]: People who know me will know that I believe two things.

1170
01:47:25,344 --> 01:47:31,790
[SPEAKER_18]: One, I believe in democracy, and two, that I believe that this city has been underfunded for many, many years.

1171
01:47:32,671 --> 01:47:32,911
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

1172
01:47:36,585 --> 01:47:43,973
[SPEAKER_18]: to the first point, again, as Councilor Tseng mentioned, we are not voting to approve of these monies.

1173
01:47:44,594 --> 01:47:46,076
[SPEAKER_18]: We are voting to allow

1174
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:50,252
[SPEAKER_18]: the people of Medford to make this decision.

1175
01:47:50,592 --> 01:47:52,814
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that we need to do that.

1176
01:47:53,094 --> 01:48:10,085
[SPEAKER_18]: To me, that is the most important thing, is that we not, the only thing that we could do now, tonight, that would be the most undemocratic thing to do, would be for us to refuse to allow the voters to make this decision, right?

1177
01:48:10,145 --> 01:48:11,506
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be undemocratic.

1178
01:48:12,086 --> 01:48:13,167
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's my first point.

1179
01:48:19,835 --> 01:48:23,458
[SPEAKER_18]: My second point is about the chronic underfunding of the city.

1180
01:48:24,619 --> 01:48:40,292
[SPEAKER_18]: And while I certainly am all for new growth, I think it simply doesn't add up if you look at the reality of the funding of the city and at what we need in order to not be financially irresponsible.

1181
01:48:42,523 --> 01:48:49,125
[SPEAKER_18]: The problem is that costs rise faster than Prop 2.5 allows us to raise taxes.

1182
01:48:50,205 --> 01:48:53,306
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we simply look at the budget, we can see that in many ways.

1183
01:48:53,426 --> 01:48:56,767
[SPEAKER_18]: So the largest portion of the budget is our schools.

1184
01:48:57,267 --> 01:48:59,727
[SPEAKER_18]: The second largest portion of the budget is insurance.

1185
01:48:59,847 --> 01:49:01,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Insurance is going up.

1186
01:49:01,548 --> 01:49:03,428
[SPEAKER_18]: We do not have any control over that.

1187
01:49:03,468 --> 01:49:05,809
[SPEAKER_18]: It is going up higher than we are allowed to raise taxes.

1188
01:49:06,249 --> 01:49:08,471
[SPEAKER_18]: The third one is pensions.

1189
01:49:09,191 --> 01:49:10,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Pensions we also do not control.

1190
01:49:10,872 --> 01:49:12,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are the top three.

1191
01:49:12,554 --> 01:49:14,415
[SPEAKER_18]: After that come police and fire.

1192
01:49:15,516 --> 01:49:18,498
[SPEAKER_18]: And the fourth one after that is roads.

1193
01:49:19,278 --> 01:49:21,180
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to talk about roads.

1194
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:25,443
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want people to understand that these costs, many of them are going up.

1195
01:49:25,603 --> 01:49:28,685
[SPEAKER_18]: They are uncontrollable by the city.

1196
01:49:28,705 --> 01:49:32,408
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're going up faster than we are allowed to raise taxes.

1197
01:49:32,608 --> 01:49:34,930
[SPEAKER_18]: So this simply is something that, you know,

1198
01:49:36,331 --> 01:49:39,314
[SPEAKER_18]: It's math, you cannot make those numbers match.

1199
01:49:40,795 --> 01:49:47,962
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to talk about roads because we had a great meeting with the Commissioner, the DPW and one of the engineers.

1200
01:49:49,123 --> 01:49:50,585
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a roads assessment done.

1201
01:49:50,605 --> 01:49:53,427
[SPEAKER_18]: If people have not looked at that roads assessment done in 2021.

1202
01:49:55,129 --> 01:49:59,451
[SPEAKER_18]: It basically said that, so the grade roads, they call them 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1203
01:49:59,531 --> 01:50:04,834
[SPEAKER_18]: I like to call them A, B, C, D, and F, because everybody understands grades that we get in school.

1204
01:50:06,655 --> 01:50:15,060
[SPEAKER_18]: 49% of our roads in 2021 were rated D or F, the worst two possible qualities of roads.

1205
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:18,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, it costs 50 times as much.

1206
01:50:18,962 --> 01:50:36,357
[SPEAKER_18]: to bring a road from F to A as it costs to bring a road from B to A. So the problem is if you are simply not spending enough on your roads every single year that you're allowing roads to get to be D and F, that is unbelievably financially irresponsible.

1207
01:50:37,057 --> 01:50:43,202
[SPEAKER_18]: because the amount of money it takes to then repair those roads is like 30 to 50 times more.

1208
01:50:43,682 --> 01:50:50,687
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is years of underfunding our roads that has led us to this place and it is financially irresponsible.

1209
01:50:57,192 --> 01:51:04,218
[SPEAKER_18]: We came out of COVID and during COVID, students everywhere suffered.

1210
01:51:05,063 --> 01:51:06,844
[SPEAKER_18]: They suffered mental health issues.

1211
01:51:06,924 --> 01:51:08,585
[SPEAKER_18]: They suffered academic issues.

1212
01:51:08,905 --> 01:51:10,806
[SPEAKER_18]: They suffered from family issues.

1213
01:51:12,066 --> 01:51:16,348
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is a reality that our students, all of our students in our schools are facing.

1214
01:51:16,728 --> 01:51:17,989
[SPEAKER_18]: They need more supports.

1215
01:51:19,649 --> 01:51:21,810
[SPEAKER_18]: That is just a reality.

1216
01:51:23,231 --> 01:51:33,916
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other thing about schools is that we have school buildings that have not been properly maintained, that the money to properly maintain them has not been spent in the past.

1217
01:51:34,796 --> 01:51:36,097
[SPEAKER_18]: That means that we are in debt.

1218
01:51:36,217 --> 01:51:55,265
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are in road debt, we are in school debt, we are in school support debt, we are in trees debt, and I'm glad we planted 200 trees, but it is my understanding, and this is colloquially that I have heard through the grapevine, we do not have actual study yet, it's not completed, but my understanding is we lose more than twice as many trees every year as we plant.

1219
01:51:55,885 --> 01:51:57,105
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are in tree debt.

1220
01:51:58,186 --> 01:52:06,508
[SPEAKER_18]: We are in debt in terms of the salaries because we do not, our salaries are not commensurate with other cities, surrounding cities.

1221
01:52:06,848 --> 01:52:12,909
[SPEAKER_18]: And what that means is that it is incredibly difficult now for us to fill positions.

1222
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:15,210
[SPEAKER_18]: We have turnover.

1223
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:19,331
[SPEAKER_18]: This is financially irresponsible.

1224
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:31,658
[SPEAKER_18]: So the problem is not, like the problem that we have, new growth, there is no city in the world that could create the new growth needed to fill these gaps.

1225
01:52:32,118 --> 01:52:33,399
[SPEAKER_18]: These gaps are real.

1226
01:52:35,821 --> 01:52:38,282
[SPEAKER_18]: They are due to many things that we cannot control.

1227
01:52:39,143 --> 01:52:49,530
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe that the proper thing to do is to allow our community to make the decision through democracy.

1228
01:52:51,732 --> 01:52:58,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1229
01:52:58,937 --> 01:52:59,618
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1230
01:52:59,678 --> 01:53:00,478
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Leming.

1231
01:53:01,919 --> 01:53:03,060
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, council president.

1232
01:53:04,561 --> 01:53:10,545
[SPEAKER_44]: It is so much easier to criticize action than it is inaction.

1233
01:53:11,546 --> 01:53:17,890
[SPEAKER_44]: And unfortunately for decades, this city

1234
01:53:19,005 --> 01:53:29,609
[SPEAKER_44]: has really not done a whole lot to address the structural underfunding that has led up to this fiscal cliff.

1235
01:53:30,549 --> 01:53:37,552
[SPEAKER_44]: I want to be extremely clear that if this override doesn't pass, as the mayor said, we will be here next year.

1236
01:53:38,953 --> 01:53:42,477
[SPEAKER_44]: We will have to lay a lot of people off.

1237
01:53:43,138 --> 01:53:46,081
[SPEAKER_44]: The roads will continue to be in the state they're in.

1238
01:53:46,101 --> 01:53:48,865
[SPEAKER_44]: And as my colleague said, they will continue to get worse.

1239
01:53:50,647 --> 01:53:53,270
[SPEAKER_44]: The fire department will not get its headquarters.

1240
01:53:53,851 --> 01:53:55,513
[SPEAKER_44]: We need this.

1241
01:53:57,222 --> 01:54:08,637
[SPEAKER_44]: as Council Vice President Collins said, this is the most important vote that is coming before this Council tonight, that has come before this Council so far this term.

1242
01:54:08,677 --> 01:54:11,561
[SPEAKER_44]: Now, I don't know what it means to

1243
01:54:13,464 --> 01:54:14,585
[SPEAKER_44]: do an override right.

1244
01:54:14,605 --> 01:54:17,628
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm sure that they've had, that they've done it differently in other cities.

1245
01:54:18,048 --> 01:54:25,275
[SPEAKER_44]: And I know that my colleagues on council, my colleagues on school committee and the mayor may have slightly different views on this.

1246
01:54:25,535 --> 01:54:28,958
[SPEAKER_44]: They announced the financial task force months ago via press release.

1247
01:54:29,358 --> 01:54:36,585
[SPEAKER_44]: It was never a secret committee and they had to work out a compromise to bring what we're seeing today.

1248
01:54:37,671 --> 01:54:37,891
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay?

1249
01:54:38,631 --> 01:54:50,334
[SPEAKER_44]: And I'm not going to sit here and criticize people who are trying to address the issues that people have been talking about in this city for decades.

1250
01:54:51,294 --> 01:54:57,696
[SPEAKER_44]: And I'm sure that a lot of people will come around and say, you know, we need more development.

1251
01:54:57,776 --> 01:55:04,477
[SPEAKER_44]: We need to work, do more with less, whatever that means.

1252
01:55:05,158 --> 01:55:05,858
[SPEAKER_44]: We need to

1253
01:55:06,997 --> 01:55:10,678
[SPEAKER_44]: I mean, we're already down to the bone, okay?

1254
01:55:10,698 --> 01:55:14,280
[SPEAKER_44]: I've been to the school committee budget meetings.

1255
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:18,721
[SPEAKER_44]: They've already stripped the school budget down as far as it can possibly go.

1256
01:55:19,401 --> 01:55:22,983
[SPEAKER_44]: If this doesn't pass, we don't know what we'll do next year, okay?

1257
01:55:23,663 --> 01:55:32,206
[SPEAKER_44]: So I just wanna make the point that this is, I think, any kind of action, any kind of action

1258
01:55:33,348 --> 01:55:38,371
[SPEAKER_44]: any kind of choice that the voters have, that we can give the voters is praiseworthy.

1259
01:55:39,192 --> 01:55:42,514
[SPEAKER_44]: I commend my colleagues for doing this.

1260
01:55:42,634 --> 01:55:44,575
[SPEAKER_44]: This is going to be historic in this city.

1261
01:55:45,516 --> 01:55:47,277
[SPEAKER_44]: This is what we need right now.

1262
01:55:49,739 --> 01:55:54,882
[SPEAKER_44]: And big picture, I just want to really drive that point home.

1263
01:55:54,902 --> 01:55:58,705
[SPEAKER_44]: You know, unity is not doing what

1264
01:56:01,021 --> 01:56:03,504
[SPEAKER_44]: the loudest people in the room say we should do.

1265
01:56:04,366 --> 01:56:14,379
[SPEAKER_44]: Unity is fixing the problems that the vast majority of the city have told us about, even if our solutions aren't perfect.

1266
01:56:16,226 --> 01:56:17,007
[SPEAKER_44]: So thank you very much.

1267
01:56:17,207 --> 01:56:27,374
[SPEAKER_44]: I heard a, I heard a groan in the audience when council, when the council president listed the large amount of speakers that, uh, that still had to go.

1268
01:56:27,474 --> 01:56:30,356
[SPEAKER_44]: And so I think everybody wants to get to public comment period.

1269
01:56:30,396 --> 01:56:34,719
[SPEAKER_44]: So I'm going to leave it at that and thank all those who've spoken so far.

1270
01:56:34,759 --> 01:56:36,520
[SPEAKER_44]: And I look forward to hearing what folks have to say.

1271
01:56:37,801 --> 01:56:38,281
[SPEAKER_39]: Almost done.

1272
01:56:38,301 --> 01:56:38,842
[SPEAKER_39]: Almost done.

1273
01:56:39,802 --> 01:56:41,544
[SPEAKER_39]: We have two more hands raised.

1274
01:56:41,604 --> 01:56:44,926
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to councilor Scarpelli and then vice president Collins. Councilor Scarpelli.

1275
01:56:45,558 --> 01:56:46,959
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1276
01:56:48,339 --> 01:56:52,321
[SPEAKER_46]: So I appreciate the dialogue back and forth.

1277
01:56:53,021 --> 01:56:54,722
[SPEAKER_46]: Just a quick note to the mayor.

1278
01:56:55,643 --> 01:57:00,125
[SPEAKER_46]: The presentation you just gave was the same presentation we heard at the debate.

1279
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:05,567
[SPEAKER_46]: Again, no shovel in the ground, no money in our accounts.

1280
01:57:06,568 --> 01:57:08,569
[SPEAKER_46]: We've done nothing at Mystic Ave.

1281
01:57:08,749 --> 01:57:10,950
[SPEAKER_46]: We've done nothing in Medford Square.

1282
01:57:12,014 --> 01:57:18,920
[SPEAKER_46]: And councilor Tseng, immediate funding is available when you start these projects and permits and fees.

1283
01:57:19,441 --> 01:57:28,889
[SPEAKER_46]: But my biggest issue I'm having here is not the fact that, because people are gonna leave tonight saying councilor Scarpelli is against an override.

1284
01:57:28,909 --> 01:57:31,512
[SPEAKER_46]: No, that's not what I, I've said this a thousand times.

1285
01:57:32,352 --> 01:57:37,217
[SPEAKER_46]: And councilor Callahan said, democracy is so important, getting the vote out.

1286
01:57:37,697 --> 01:57:38,398
[SPEAKER_46]: And I agree with you.

1287
01:57:40,475 --> 01:57:41,996
[SPEAKER_46]: But why behind closed doors?

1288
01:57:42,196 --> 01:57:44,737
[SPEAKER_46]: Why weren't we involved?

1289
01:57:45,017 --> 01:57:52,320
[SPEAKER_46]: Why would you announce it on a Friday and then bring it to the floor on a Tuesday and then vote?

1290
01:57:53,441 --> 01:57:56,822
[SPEAKER_46]: Especially when there are viable options that we know of.

1291
01:57:57,863 --> 01:57:58,923
[SPEAKER_46]: Free cash is there.

1292
01:58:00,104 --> 01:58:09,228
[SPEAKER_46]: You can use the five to seven to do everything you said to pull in the hot strings of all the parents and kids and teachers who, by the way, are my friends, my relatives, my family.

1293
01:58:10,373 --> 01:58:13,235
[SPEAKER_46]: So I understand completely, but there's an option there.

1294
01:58:13,915 --> 01:58:27,863
[SPEAKER_46]: And then maybe step back and say, well, instead of dividing this, instead of making this a contentious situation, let's sit together and say, well, did we look at the process of eliminating seniors to this process and how much would it cost us?

1295
01:58:28,723 --> 01:58:32,445
[SPEAKER_46]: Did we look at eliminating veterans from the process and see how much would it cost?

1296
01:58:32,905 --> 01:58:33,906
[SPEAKER_46]: That's democracy.

1297
01:58:35,014 --> 01:58:41,778
[SPEAKER_46]: Democracy isn't saying that six people in one room say it's all right and that's the way we should do it.

1298
01:58:42,019 --> 01:58:43,499
[SPEAKER_46]: So that's democracy, no that isn't.

1299
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:48,943
[SPEAKER_46]: Democracy is being open and honest and being truly transparent.

1300
01:58:50,524 --> 01:59:01,171
[SPEAKER_46]: We talked about looking at where the funding was and where the funding's gonna go because when I say the black hole, I say we were given millions and millions of dollars from ARPA.

1301
01:59:03,257 --> 01:59:04,037
[SPEAKER_46]: And what do we do with it?

1302
01:59:04,097 --> 01:59:05,097
[SPEAKER_46]: Nothing to show for it.

1303
01:59:05,538 --> 01:59:08,098
[SPEAKER_46]: Infrastructure needs, it was the airport, nothing.

1304
01:59:08,518 --> 01:59:14,940
[SPEAKER_46]: You could get angry all you want, Madam Mayor, and turn your head, but you made some pretty snide comments tonight, and it's pretty embarrassing.

1305
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:17,701
[SPEAKER_46]: But I will tell you, I will tell you.

1306
01:59:18,501 --> 01:59:22,722
[SPEAKER_46]: You put on this paper, excuse me, Mr. President.

1307
01:59:23,582 --> 01:59:29,484
[SPEAKER_46]: We've talked about, Madam, I believe you said it was that we needed to,

1308
01:59:31,226 --> 01:59:41,915
[SPEAKER_46]: the people that were getting jobs illegally or questionable, and you were cleaning up City Hall, you've used that comment a lot.

1309
01:59:43,316 --> 01:59:48,901
[SPEAKER_46]: But I tell you what, I'd like to sit down at these meetings and say, well, look what they've done in other communities.

1310
01:59:48,961 --> 01:59:49,801
[SPEAKER_46]: Where did the funding go?

1311
01:59:49,842 --> 01:59:50,622
[SPEAKER_46]: Why are we here?

1312
01:59:50,942 --> 01:59:52,364
[SPEAKER_46]: And how do we fix it moving forward?

1313
01:59:53,206 --> 01:59:55,027
[SPEAKER_46]: What have we used in consultants, Madam Mayor?

1314
01:59:55,588 --> 01:59:58,009
[SPEAKER_46]: What have we used for investigators, Madam Mayor?

1315
01:59:58,709 --> 02:00:02,872
[SPEAKER_46]: What have we spent on for legal fees in the hundreds of thousands?

1316
02:00:04,033 --> 02:00:05,314
[SPEAKER_46]: What have we used in settlements?

1317
02:00:07,295 --> 02:00:13,098
[SPEAKER_46]: There are millions of dollars that we wasted because you put a cape on and thought that was your job, and that wasn't.

1318
02:00:14,259 --> 02:00:17,101
[SPEAKER_46]: And the courts, obviously now we're hearing it and we're seeing it.

1319
02:00:18,652 --> 02:00:36,067
[SPEAKER_46]: So I will be honest with you, again, it would have been nice to have some time to sit with the community and figure out, or at least all the council, because it seems like six people know what they're doing in the council, but there's one person sitting back saying, well, I had questions.

1320
02:00:36,807 --> 02:00:37,668
[SPEAKER_46]: I had things to offer.

1321
02:00:38,689 --> 02:00:42,112
[SPEAKER_46]: And when I came out and started sharing that on the council floor,

1322
02:00:44,184 --> 02:00:57,071
[SPEAKER_46]: I was pushed by asking me to put the amendment first, then I was asked to verify comments, and then when it started getting heavy and it started making sense, we sectioned 21-me.

1323
02:00:58,271 --> 02:01:02,814
[SPEAKER_46]: And now we get to tonight where I think we do need breathing room.

1324
02:01:02,854 --> 02:01:13,139
[SPEAKER_46]: We need another week to look at this, to look at this and ask some questions and make sure people, through the democracy, the process of democracy, that people ask these questions.

1325
02:01:14,241 --> 02:01:18,944
[SPEAKER_46]: And you can pat yourselves on the back all you want of this task force, and you came to this agreement.

1326
02:01:19,844 --> 02:01:32,551
[SPEAKER_46]: But to present all the information from this hardworking task force that was presented to the public on a Thursday or Friday, and then brought out for a vote tonight, is a disgrace.

1327
02:01:32,711 --> 02:01:35,172
[SPEAKER_46]: It's really, this isn't the way democracy works.

1328
02:01:36,373 --> 02:01:39,795
[SPEAKER_46]: And I know if you, deep down inside, I think all of you know it.

1329
02:01:41,356 --> 02:01:42,756
[SPEAKER_46]: So, Mr. President,

1330
02:01:45,225 --> 02:01:49,268
[SPEAKER_46]: I know that a lot of people do want to speak, and again, I'm just going to leave off with this.

1331
02:01:50,850 --> 02:01:58,215
[SPEAKER_46]: We had a mechanism in place that could have taken care of our children, our teachers, our parents, all these coaches and teachers that you're looking for.

1332
02:01:59,175 --> 02:02:08,244
[SPEAKER_46]: through free cash, which we had millions because of the process that was mismanagement of finances in our community for the last five years.

1333
02:02:08,845 --> 02:02:13,890
[SPEAKER_46]: And an abundance of that much money is just bringing it back to who deserves it, and that's the taxpayers.

1334
02:02:13,930 --> 02:02:18,535
[SPEAKER_46]: Remember, that's the taxpayers' money that weren't spent correctly.

1335
02:02:18,715 --> 02:02:21,398
[SPEAKER_46]: So now we have an option now to do that.

1336
02:02:22,927 --> 02:02:35,473
[SPEAKER_46]: And instead of doing that, we're gonna rush through a vote tonight, which it's sad to say I will vote no, not for the fact that Councilor Scarpelli doesn't think that we possibly could use an override, but we didn't do it the correct way.

1337
02:02:37,054 --> 02:02:38,435
[SPEAKER_46]: We did it behind closed doors.

1338
02:02:39,935 --> 02:02:45,038
[SPEAKER_46]: Whether you wanna say it was a great process, whether you wanna say it was transparent, it wasn't.

1339
02:02:46,579 --> 02:02:47,659
[SPEAKER_46]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1340
02:02:56,874 --> 02:02:58,996
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll comment.

1341
02:02:59,316 --> 02:03:02,198
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll only comment on a few things.

1342
02:03:02,358 --> 02:03:10,625
[SPEAKER_23]: I just take sincere offense to say that, for one, to say that things have been mismanaged financially for five years.

1343
02:03:10,725 --> 02:03:14,348
[SPEAKER_23]: We've had two CFOs in the last five years and they've both done a great job.

1344
02:03:14,428 --> 02:03:17,030
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to comment on that.

1345
02:03:17,825 --> 02:03:38,139
[SPEAKER_23]: Second, and I know it's been said by my chief of staff a number of times, I have to address the legal costs of the city of Medford, because there is a number of us that sat and we reviewed budgets in 16 different communities, and we were the first or second lowest in legal, paying legal costs, and that includes- If I may.

1346
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:41,901
[SPEAKER_46]: We still have no city solicitor, Madam Mayor.

1347
02:03:41,921 --> 02:03:43,102
[SPEAKER_23]: Excuse me, I have the floor.

1348
02:03:44,514 --> 02:03:53,479
[SPEAKER_23]: That that includes outside legal counsel as well as Coleman and Page who we use as the 40 municipal attorneys that specialize in different things.

1349
02:03:54,918 --> 02:04:01,540
[SPEAKER_23]: In comparison, I'll give you one city, Malden, very similar to us, spends about a million point two in legal costs.

1350
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:03,341
[SPEAKER_23]: Medford spends a bit over 400,000.

1351
02:04:04,381 --> 02:04:04,761
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it was 450,000.

1352
02:04:04,821 --> 02:04:07,442
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to put that into perspective.

1353
02:04:08,182 --> 02:04:11,323
[SPEAKER_23]: And then the councilor also mentions cleaning things up.

1354
02:04:11,443 --> 02:04:18,105
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe he's offended by what I've done the last four years, but I've brought accountability to this community and I am so proud of it.

1355
02:04:20,896 --> 02:04:23,257
[SPEAKER_46]: Whatever puts you to sleep, Madam Mayor, every night, that's a shame.

1356
02:04:23,277 --> 02:04:25,318
[SPEAKER_46]: Because I sat next to you for four years.

1357
02:04:26,018 --> 02:04:26,979
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1358
02:04:27,019 --> 02:04:27,579
[SPEAKER_46]: Who you are.

1359
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:29,240
[SPEAKER_46]: I respect you, then.

1360
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:30,380
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1361
02:04:31,641 --> 02:04:33,382
[SPEAKER_46]: Sorry, Mr. President.

1362
02:04:33,422 --> 02:04:35,002
[SPEAKER_39]: Just recognizing you, if you'd like to speak.

1363
02:04:35,903 --> 02:04:36,523
[SPEAKER_39]: I apologize.

1364
02:04:36,583 --> 02:04:39,224
[SPEAKER_46]: No, I just want to remember.

1365
02:04:39,244 --> 02:04:43,826
[SPEAKER_46]: I want the mayor to remember that I remember that person that sat next to me.

1366
02:04:44,247 --> 02:04:46,328
[SPEAKER_46]: And she wouldn't deal with what's going on right now.

1367
02:04:46,648 --> 02:04:47,408
[SPEAKER_46]: So shame on you.

1368
02:04:48,589 --> 02:04:49,209
[SPEAKER_46]: Whatever puts you to sleep.

1369
02:04:50,424 --> 02:04:51,825
[SPEAKER_39]: Please share your comments to the chair.

1370
02:04:52,546 --> 02:04:54,167
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm gonna go to Vice President.

1371
02:04:56,309 --> 02:04:57,510
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, President Bears.

1372
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:58,490
[SPEAKER_26]: I went pretty long earlier.

1373
02:04:58,530 --> 02:05:00,292
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll try to keep this short, bring my average down.

1374
02:05:03,194 --> 02:05:06,617
[SPEAKER_26]: First thing, about the financial task force.

1375
02:05:06,657 --> 02:05:16,725
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that there's some people who don't need to hear this, but when we talk about the press release that was released on Friday, that we all collaborated on, city council leadership, mayor and the mayor staff, school committee leadership,

1376
02:05:18,243 --> 02:05:31,254
[SPEAKER_26]: What that press release contained was the budget that was already made public, line by line, department by department, that the city council had already reviewed in budget hearings that the entire community was privy to if they cared to read those agendas or attend the meetings.

1377
02:05:32,731 --> 02:05:47,761
[SPEAKER_26]: those same numbers, very minor, essentially all the numbers that we already had plus one and three quarters million dollars from ARPA to the schools proposed and the two overrides and debt exclusion that everybody gets to vote on.

1378
02:05:48,241 --> 02:05:52,664
[SPEAKER_26]: So just to clarify what was presented on Friday

1379
02:05:53,638 --> 02:06:07,544
[SPEAKER_26]: and how transparent or untransparent it was, was all the numbers that the city council and the school and the public already had, plus an appropriation of one-time funds, which many people, including myself, were hoping to see and working to secure.

1380
02:06:07,564 --> 02:06:10,045
[SPEAKER_26]: And then three things that we get to put to the voters.

1381
02:06:10,325 --> 02:06:14,867
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just want to set the record straight on that, because I think there's a lot of editorializing going on.

1382
02:06:16,768 --> 02:06:24,154
[SPEAKER_26]: Second, we have discussed free cash a lot on this council, last term, this term.

1383
02:06:25,415 --> 02:06:28,958
[SPEAKER_26]: I have had, you know, it's no secret that we disagree on a lot of things.

1384
02:06:29,218 --> 02:06:30,079
[SPEAKER_26]: We agree on a lot of things.

1385
02:06:30,139 --> 02:06:34,362
[SPEAKER_26]: I've had some pretty sincere concerns about our free cash strategy in the past.

1386
02:06:35,383 --> 02:06:41,848
[SPEAKER_26]: I have my own wishlist for how I'd like to see some of that money appropriated, which I know is different than the strategy that the mayor has.

1387
02:06:41,868 --> 02:06:42,789
[SPEAKER_26]: To me,

1388
02:06:44,910 --> 02:06:46,193
[SPEAKER_26]: That is irrelevant here.

1389
02:06:46,373 --> 02:06:53,966
[SPEAKER_26]: I do not see the end game in appropriating large sums of our free cash reserves towards operating costs.

1390
02:06:54,507 --> 02:06:55,569
[SPEAKER_26]: What is the end game of that?

1391
02:06:55,749 --> 02:06:56,670
[SPEAKER_26]: We end up back here.

1392
02:06:58,294 --> 02:07:07,337
[SPEAKER_26]: we can wish upon a star that we're going to see new growth accelerate at such an incredible rate that we are going to be able to fill that gap exactly in 12 months.

1393
02:07:08,377 --> 02:07:10,558
[SPEAKER_26]: But I don't think that we should be budgeting on wishful thinking.

1394
02:07:11,058 --> 02:07:17,240
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, I've had sincere concerns and grievances about how we're using free cash in the past.

1395
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:18,421
[SPEAKER_26]: I have my own preferences.

1396
02:07:19,781 --> 02:07:24,403
[SPEAKER_26]: It is not the path forward that I think the community wants and needs to

1397
02:07:26,730 --> 02:07:30,314
[SPEAKER_26]: allocate money towards the problem that we may never ever see again.

1398
02:07:30,595 --> 02:07:32,256
[SPEAKER_26]: It pushes the can down the road.

1399
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:38,504
[SPEAKER_26]: I also think that finding these proposals divisive is completely a choice.

1400
02:07:39,164 --> 02:07:42,068
[SPEAKER_26]: That's one of the wonderful things about this being a ballot question.

1401
02:07:43,169 --> 02:07:46,373
[SPEAKER_26]: I think, you know, we're a room full of people who have

1402
02:07:47,367 --> 02:07:51,148
[SPEAKER_26]: voted differently on things in the past, we will again in the future.

1403
02:07:51,768 --> 02:07:54,029
[SPEAKER_26]: And that doesn't have to make us any less of a community.

1404
02:07:54,089 --> 02:07:56,210
[SPEAKER_26]: We can talk about it and discuss it and debate about it.

1405
02:07:56,270 --> 02:07:59,371
[SPEAKER_26]: And some people will campaign one way and some people will campaign another way.

1406
02:07:59,991 --> 02:08:02,192
[SPEAKER_26]: And it does not have to divide us.

1407
02:08:02,892 --> 02:08:03,792
[SPEAKER_26]: That is a choice.

1408
02:08:09,954 --> 02:08:12,715
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think when people are telling you that you're being divided,

1409
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:17,421
[SPEAKER_26]: You should pay attention to what the motives behind that imperative might be.

1410
02:08:17,781 --> 02:08:19,182
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't have to be divided by this.

1411
02:08:19,562 --> 02:08:27,185
[SPEAKER_26]: This can actually bring us together in a city with a future that is going to be brighter and more supportive because of what we might do with these investments if we pass them.

1412
02:08:28,812 --> 02:08:30,793
[SPEAKER_26]: Not willing to pass a budget based on wishful thinking.

1413
02:08:31,473 --> 02:08:33,534
[SPEAKER_26]: We can wish that new growth was different in the past.

1414
02:08:34,154 --> 02:08:38,895
[SPEAKER_26]: We can wish for dramatic new growth over the next 12 months that'll solve all of our problems.

1415
02:08:38,955 --> 02:08:40,116
[SPEAKER_26]: That wouldn't be responsible.

1416
02:08:42,016 --> 02:08:49,999
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think that what we want as duly elected leaders of the community is for the ability to point the finger and blame somebody else for our problems.

1417
02:08:50,059 --> 02:08:51,540
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we're all here to solve problems.

1418
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:53,300
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1419
02:08:55,161 --> 02:08:55,461
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1420
02:08:57,304 --> 02:09:01,270
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm going to go to Councilor Leming and then I do have one question.

1421
02:09:02,773 --> 02:09:03,895
[SPEAKER_44]: No, this is just a quick one.

1422
02:09:03,935 --> 02:09:09,123
[SPEAKER_44]: So Councilor Scarpelli brought up twice or several times the fact that his

1423
02:09:09,929 --> 02:09:12,930
[SPEAKER_44]: previous paper was a rule 21.

1424
02:09:13,050 --> 02:09:15,211
[SPEAKER_44]: I just want to be clear about that.

1425
02:09:15,291 --> 02:09:22,153
[SPEAKER_44]: So first off, if anybody would like to look at the May 28th meeting, the city council meetings are now on YouTube.

1426
02:09:22,173 --> 02:09:25,674
[SPEAKER_44]: So you're free to look up how that particular debate went.

1427
02:09:26,054 --> 02:09:29,476
[SPEAKER_44]: But I rule 21'ed it because it was a

1428
02:09:30,916 --> 02:09:32,017
[SPEAKER_44]: vague resolution.

1429
02:09:32,037 --> 02:09:37,662
[SPEAKER_44]: It was just to generally discuss options for the school budget.

1430
02:09:38,142 --> 02:09:52,754
[SPEAKER_44]: Councilor Scarpelli had previously submitted a similar resolution several meetings before, and he was asked by the council president to make his resolutions more specific so that people would know what he specifically intended to bring to the table.

1431
02:09:52,934 --> 02:09:59,500
[SPEAKER_44]: The last one was a resolution to discuss subcommittee processes, and it ended up in

1432
02:10:00,425 --> 02:10:04,568
[SPEAKER_44]: Um, it ended up veering into a letter that my colleagues had signed.

1433
02:10:05,248 --> 02:10:08,590
[SPEAKER_44]: Um, so it just generally got off topic.

1434
02:10:08,650 --> 02:10:18,476
[SPEAKER_44]: So I just wanted to clarify that I wanted the resolutions of themselves to be specific so that we will know what is being talked about.

1435
02:10:18,536 --> 02:10:25,980
[SPEAKER_44]: We could have talked about that resolution today, but my colleague decided to withdraw it, um, at the beginning of the meeting.

1436
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:27,741
[SPEAKER_44]: So we never did.

1437
02:10:27,761 --> 02:10:28,862
[SPEAKER_44: That's all.

1438
02:10:30,253 --> 02:10:32,334
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. President, if I can point a personal privilege.

1439
02:10:33,075 --> 02:10:33,935
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1440
02:10:34,596 --> 02:10:35,656
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1441
02:10:35,856 --> 02:10:43,761
[SPEAKER_46]: And I'll say this to all due respect, whatever Mr. President makes my colleague feel good, but what he did was stifle the process.

1442
02:10:44,601 --> 02:10:45,442
[SPEAKER_46]: I was very clear.

1443
02:10:45,782 --> 02:10:48,424
[SPEAKER_46]: You asked questions as the chair of the council.

1444
02:10:49,064 --> 02:10:50,165
[SPEAKER_46]: I answered your questions.

1445
02:10:50,305 --> 02:10:51,566
[SPEAKER_46]: You did not rule it out of order.

1446
02:10:52,146 --> 02:10:53,447
[SPEAKER_46]: We move forward with the process.

1447
02:10:54,347 --> 02:10:58,370
[SPEAKER_46]: And when it started getting uncomfortable, my colleague ruled to shut me down.

1448
02:10:59,366 --> 02:11:00,187
[SPEAKER_46]: It's very simple.

1449
02:11:00,907 --> 02:11:08,113
[SPEAKER_46]: Why I shut it down tonight is because it just doesn't matter because the process is already through.

1450
02:11:10,054 --> 02:11:15,018
[SPEAKER_46]: What you're asking for, and what I was asking for, was never entertained.

1451
02:11:15,959 --> 02:11:18,921
[SPEAKER_46]: It couldn't have been entertained, Mr. Leming.

1452
02:11:20,523 --> 02:11:26,627
[SPEAKER_46]: Because if I said what I needed to say tonight, it would have needed time for the administration to look into that.

1453
02:11:26,707 --> 02:11:27,288
[SPEAKER_46]: For instance,

1454
02:11:28,706 --> 02:11:32,589
[SPEAKER_46]: looking at an override and taking senior citizens out of the process.

1455
02:11:33,590 --> 02:11:50,625
[SPEAKER_46]: And I know Councilor Collins has mentioned over and over again, that's transparent and there were notes and all due respect for the vice president, Mr. President, those not the questions that we had, or I had, or the people that I represent had out of those meetings.

1456
02:11:51,806 --> 02:11:54,649
[SPEAKER_46]: Because what we had was the options of doing A, B, or C.

1457
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:58,262
[SPEAKER_46]: But with those options comes processes.

1458
02:11:58,422 --> 02:12:01,704
[SPEAKER_46]: For instance, we need an override.

1459
02:12:02,564 --> 02:12:04,045
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, were there any other options?

1460
02:12:04,285 --> 02:12:07,127
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, if we did do an override, what would it look like?

1461
02:12:09,288 --> 02:12:14,531
[SPEAKER_46]: That's what my questions were going to be driven through.

1462
02:12:15,312 --> 02:12:15,832
[SPEAKER_46]: So thank you.

1463
02:12:20,236 --> 02:12:25,457
[SPEAKER_39]: One of the other benefits of streaming on YouTube is it's a lot easier to fast forward through the meeting.

1464
02:12:26,177 --> 02:12:28,518
[SPEAKER_39]: So if anyone wants to watch it later.

1465
02:12:30,538 --> 02:12:37,700
[SPEAKER_39]: My one question, and I hate to derail a wonderful dialogue and narrative, it's actually about the law department budget.

1466
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:43,381
[SPEAKER_39]: And I just wanted to say, A, that I'm thankful to see the increase in the salary for the city solicitor position.

1467
02:12:43,996 --> 02:12:47,677
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm hopeful that with that competitive number, we'll finally be able to bring someone on.

1468
02:12:47,697 --> 02:12:49,138
[SPEAKER_39]: I know that position has been vacant for a while.

1469
02:12:49,638 --> 02:12:55,039
[SPEAKER_39]: The only other thing, it's kind of a question, feel free to respond to my comment, and it'll be the only one I make from the chair on this paper.

1470
02:12:56,340 --> 02:13:01,681
[SPEAKER_39]: Two years ago, we did agree to include an assistant city solicitor position in the budget that has been removed for this budget.

1471
02:13:02,202 --> 02:13:09,704
[SPEAKER_39]: We had a discussion with the chief of staff about it, and I understand the position, the difficulties, that money being essentially right now used to help

1472
02:13:10,084 --> 02:13:12,385
[SPEAKER_39]: to address the fiscal crisis that we're in in our schools.

1473
02:13:12,445 --> 02:13:13,686
[SPEAKER_39]: So I understand that.

1474
02:13:13,726 --> 02:13:23,950
[SPEAKER_39]: But regardless of our philosophical, potential philosophical difference on that, I do want to say that that is important to me, that the council has voiced that to be an important position and I am hopeful.

1475
02:13:25,832 --> 02:13:34,635
[SPEAKER_39]: if this package does move forward, that we can have further discussions, hopefully with a city solicitor hired at this new rate about potentially restoring that position in the future.

1476
02:13:34,695 --> 02:13:41,318
[SPEAKER_39]: So I just wanted to put that on record as that is something that we have talked about two budgets ago and is important and this council has raised as an issue.

1477
02:13:42,358 --> 02:13:43,038
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, absolutely.

1478
02:13:43,259 --> 02:13:48,400
[SPEAKER_23]: Continue to have discussions with anybody that is willing to call me back and communicate with me.

1479
02:13:48,801 --> 02:13:49,141
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely.

1480
02:13:49,161 --> 02:13:49,621
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

1481
02:13:49,721 --> 02:13:49,981
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1482
02:13:50,321 --> 02:13:50,541
[SPEAKER_39]: All right.

1483
02:13:50,641 --> 02:13:52,042
[SPEAKER_39]: Any further questions from members of the council?

1484
02:13:53,581 --> 02:13:55,322
[SPEAKER_39]: Seeing none, we're going to go into public comment.

1485
02:13:55,362 --> 02:13:58,464
[SPEAKER_39]: People who would like to speak for public comment may line up at the podium here.

1486
02:13:59,064 --> 02:14:00,605
[SPEAKER_39]: They may raise their hand on Zoom.

1487
02:14:01,125 --> 02:14:02,566
[SPEAKER_40]: The mad rush begins.

1488
02:14:03,386 --> 02:14:08,189
[SPEAKER_40]: And we are going to be following the public comment rules laid out by the council.

1489
02:14:08,809 --> 02:14:12,131
[SPEAKER_39]: We will have three minutes for the first two hours of public comment.

1490
02:14:12,571 --> 02:14:15,633
[SPEAKER_39]: After two hours, we will go for one further minute.

1491
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:20,511
[SPEAKER_39]: Sure, if they need to get home, that's all right.

1492
02:14:20,551 --> 02:14:27,215
[SPEAKER_39]: If we have a student here, someone who needs to get home, it is a school night, so we'll make a school night exception.

1493
02:14:28,256 --> 02:14:35,119
[SPEAKER_40]: But it'll be three minutes for each speaker for the first two hours, followed by one more minute.

1494
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:38,181
[SPEAKER_39]: After two hours, we'll go to one minute.

1495
02:14:38,321 --> 02:14:40,421
[SPEAKER_39]: So please keep your comments as brief as you can.

1496
02:14:40,441 --> 02:14:47,024
[SPEAKER_39]: I will put a timer up on the board, but first we'll recognize our young person here.

1497
02:14:47,384 --> 02:14:49,104
[SPEAKER_39]: Welcome, thank you for being before us.

1498
02:14:49,445 --> 02:14:52,065
[SPEAKER_39]: If you could just say your name and then give your comment.

1499
02:14:52,105 --> 02:14:53,226
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much for being here.

1500
02:14:53,246 --> 02:14:56,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my name is Simon Parks.

1501
02:14:57,707 --> 02:14:59,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I am in third grade and I'm in Ms.

1502
02:14:59,688 --> 02:15:00,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Stowe's class.

1503
02:15:01,229 --> 02:15:04,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think cutting the teachers is a bad idea.

1504
02:15:06,035 --> 02:15:10,398
[SPEAKER_05]: because I think having more kids in my class would make it harder to learn.

1505
02:15:10,418 --> 02:15:15,442
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would miss all of my teachers who helped me learn throughout the years.

1506
02:15:16,022 --> 02:15:22,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So please think about keeping the teachers and giving the schools the money they need.

1507
02:15:23,667 --> 02:15:31,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for your plan to do the vote.

1508
02:15:32,274 --> 02:15:33,334
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you Simon.

1509
02:15:44,508 --> 02:15:48,409
[SPEAKER_40]: All right, we'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, please, and then I will alternate with Zoom.

1510
02:15:49,109 --> 02:15:50,230
[SPEAKER_43]: My name is Chris Briota.

1511
02:15:50,750 --> 02:16:00,712
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm at 20 Mystic River Road, where I'm a homeowner, and I look forward to the chance to vote on this override because I want my taxes to go up.

1512
02:16:01,513 --> 02:16:10,155
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm unclear what level of democracy Councilor Scarpelli is looking for beyond a vote amongst the voters in this city.

1513
02:16:11,256 --> 02:16:21,744
[SPEAKER_43]: Across the United States at the federal level and in states and towns and cities, we've been suffering under 44 years of austerity budgets fostered by short-sighted thinking meant to starve government.

1514
02:16:21,764 --> 02:16:32,574
[SPEAKER_43]: It started under Reagan Republicans, was continued under Clinton Democrats, and only now are people beginning to wake up from this long, silly dream of paying for nothing and expecting everything.

1515
02:16:33,154 --> 02:16:43,384
[SPEAKER_43]: It's time for Medford to join the people who are waking up and stop entertaining people with fantasies of efficiency that they're sure are still out there somewhere to be found.

1516
02:16:43,925 --> 02:16:54,916
[SPEAKER_43]: According to the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, in 2024, of the 352 cities and towns in Massachusetts, only 41 pay a lower residential tax rate than Medford.

1517
02:16:55,436 --> 02:17:01,259
[SPEAKER_43]: Some of these are poor communities like Florida, Massachusetts, and Toland, where real estate is not a wildly valuable asset.

1518
02:17:01,539 --> 02:17:02,860
[SPEAKER_43]: Medford is not one of these.

1519
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:07,602
[SPEAKER_43]: Others are places like Cambridge, which can get by on vibrant commercial tax rates.

1520
02:17:08,402 --> 02:17:09,643
[SPEAKER_43]: Medford is not Cambridge.

1521
02:17:10,143 --> 02:17:20,948
[SPEAKER_43]: The rest are all wealthy communities and resort towns like Truro and Oak Bluffs and Edgar Town that can pay for private school and private trash pickup and private work on the roads, supplemented by tourist dollars.

1522
02:17:21,509 --> 02:17:23,650
[SPEAKER_43]: Medford is not Martha's Vineyard either.

1523
02:17:24,230 --> 02:17:29,154
[SPEAKER_43]: Medford is a vibrant middle class city that has for too long avoided investing in itself.

1524
02:17:29,594 --> 02:17:41,644
[SPEAKER_43]: With the decrepit fire station endangering the safety of our rescue squads, with the state of our school buildings and school budgets, we're seeing the results of these 44 years of disinvestment and anti-tax mania.

1525
02:17:41,664 --> 02:17:44,527
[SPEAKER_43]: It's time to wake up and start building our community again.

1526
02:17:44,727 --> 02:17:45,107
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

1527
02:17:45,547 --> 02:17:45,908
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1528
02:17:49,548 --> 02:17:51,850
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Zoom and then I'll come back to the podium.

1529
02:17:52,510 --> 02:17:54,552
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to recognize Chris Bennett on Zoom.

1530
02:17:54,632 --> 02:17:55,913
[SPEAKER_39]: Chris, you have three minutes.

1531
02:17:55,973 --> 02:17:57,494
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

1532
02:17:57,754 --> 02:17:59,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Christine Bennett, 19 Martin Street.

1533
02:18:00,727 --> 02:18:06,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone's talking about the fact that they all knew that this was going to come about, that money was tight.

1534
02:18:07,313 --> 02:18:21,626
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was thinking to myself, when I budget my own home, my finances, I carefully review my expenditures, and I see so many expenditures that are being misused, it concerns me a great deal.

1535
02:18:22,634 --> 02:18:26,956
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the major factors is the school committee and city council had increase in wages.

1536
02:18:27,776 --> 02:18:35,699
[SPEAKER_15]: They were considered public service positions years ago, and a stipend was given for that kind of cost.

1537
02:18:35,719 --> 02:18:40,901
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we knew that money was gonna be cut, why are we giving people raises at that point?

1538
02:18:41,721 --> 02:18:46,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Secondly, a lot of regular homes are not, the people that are working don't get

1539
02:18:48,004 --> 02:18:53,726
[SPEAKER_15]: a high percentage of money in, they might get a 2% raise.

1540
02:18:54,266 --> 02:18:57,087
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not getting big raises like they used to years ago.

1541
02:18:58,108 --> 02:19:07,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Then the second thing was, when we were talking about this financial grouping, I wanted to know why there weren't any really financial people involved in that setting.

1542
02:19:08,371 --> 02:19:15,034
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, could you have gotten anybody as a speaker to sit down and talk to you about the financial planning that was going on

1543
02:19:15,954 --> 02:19:20,275
[SPEAKER_15]: And my final question is, how many homeowners are in this city?

1544
02:19:20,415 --> 02:19:22,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it seems like we're trying to get blood from a stone.

1545
02:19:24,357 --> 02:19:26,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything else is going up for people in this city.

1546
02:19:26,657 --> 02:19:32,819
[SPEAKER_15]: I have people that are living in my home that were not living in my home because they can't afford the rents.

1547
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:38,681
[SPEAKER_15]: So tell me, how many homeowners are in the city right now that we're trying to get this money from?

1548
02:19:39,482 --> 02:19:40,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there an answer to that question?

1549
02:19:44,741 --> 02:19:45,202
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1550
02:19:45,742 --> 02:19:46,583
[SPEAKER_39]: I'll just say two things.

1551
02:19:46,944 --> 02:19:55,195
[SPEAKER_39]: There's, I believe about 12,000 properties, residential properties in the city that are owner occupied.

1552
02:19:55,856 --> 02:19:58,699
[SPEAKER_39]: And the city council has not received a pay increase since 2016.

1553
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:00,502
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

1554
02:20:00,919 --> 02:20:03,041
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm Ada Gunning, 40 Magoon Ave.

1555
02:20:03,341 --> 02:20:12,468
[SPEAKER_34]: I just wanted to express my gratitude to the City Council, Mayor Lugo-Cohen, the school committee for your leadership on this.

1556
02:20:12,988 --> 02:20:18,212
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't think it's necessarily popular to ask a city to tax itself at a higher rate.

1557
02:20:18,893 --> 02:20:25,038
[SPEAKER_34]: To me, it shows real leadership that you're stepping up and asking the people of Medford to vote on this.

1558
02:20:26,219 --> 02:20:30,542
[SPEAKER_34]: To me, it's very intuitive that when a real estate tax stays flat and

1559
02:20:31,582 --> 02:20:37,405
[SPEAKER_34]: Inflation is at a higher rate that the revenue of our city will go down in real money every year.

1560
02:20:37,766 --> 02:20:41,727
[SPEAKER_34]: That's less money going to Medford less money going to families and to our schools.

1561
02:20:42,488 --> 02:20:52,193
[SPEAKER_34]: You know we've been talking about our most vulnerable residents in Medford and I think they're a very important population, but another very vulnerable population is the children who don't get to vote.

1562
02:20:52,833 --> 02:21:01,759
[SPEAKER_34]: who don't come to these city council meetings, who don't qualify for income based homeowner exemptions to these tax increases.

1563
02:21:02,460 --> 02:21:12,407
[SPEAKER_34]: And those kids such as my child who's starting kindergarten in the fall, they don't get to vote on whether they get another school nurse, a guidance counselor, sufficient resources in their classroom, top notch teachers.

1564
02:21:12,987 --> 02:21:16,429
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you for standing up for those vulnerable members of our community as well.

1565
02:21:17,370 --> 02:21:25,957
[SPEAKER_34]: And lastly, I just want to say there's very loud voices on both sides of this issue, and I respect that we're all coming to the table with different priorities.

1566
02:21:26,437 --> 02:21:41,168
[SPEAKER_34]: Speaking directly to the people of Medford that are still learning about this issue, thank you for considering increasing your taxes by $40 a month, the cost of a takeout meal, so that kids like my kid can have art class, avoid overcrowded classrooms, access basic necessary services.

1567
02:21:41,548 --> 02:21:42,349
[SPEAKER_34]: They are our future.

1568
02:21:42,489 --> 02:21:42,829
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1569
02:21:42,849 --> 02:21:43,690
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1570
02:21:46,192 --> 02:21:48,814
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Jess H on Zoom.

1571
02:21:48,994 --> 02:21:50,515
[SPEAKER_39]: Jess, name and address for the record.

1572
02:21:50,555 --> 02:21:51,496
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1573
02:21:53,537 --> 02:21:55,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Jessica Haley, Four Lock Road.

1574
02:21:56,759 --> 02:22:04,184
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to know, I was being told with this override that seniors were going to be excluded from it.

1575
02:22:05,005 --> 02:22:06,065
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that still occurring?

1576
02:22:06,105 --> 02:22:08,107
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm kind of back and forth with understanding that.

1577
02:22:10,899 --> 02:22:15,862
[SPEAKER_39]: The tax exemptions that the state allows the city to charge and the override are separate issues.

1578
02:22:16,362 --> 02:22:23,626
[SPEAKER_39]: The city does have the maximum tax exemption for seniors, veterans, and the blind that is allowed by state law.

1579
02:22:24,746 --> 02:22:31,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, I understand, but is the two and a half override also gonna be put towards seniors?

1580
02:22:32,710 --> 02:22:35,732
[SPEAKER_39]: It will apply the same way that the property tax applies to everybody.

1581
02:22:36,912 --> 02:22:39,794
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, because I thought that the seniors were going to be

1582
02:22:40,973 --> 02:22:41,933
[SPEAKER_19]: excluded from this?

1583
02:22:42,134 --> 02:22:46,135
[SPEAKER_19]: Wasn't that the that was stated?

1584
02:22:46,155 --> 02:22:48,836
[SPEAKER_39]: That's not legally allowed under state law.

1585
02:22:50,257 --> 02:22:52,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so what were the seniors going to be excluded from?

1586
02:22:53,138 --> 02:22:54,139
[SPEAKER_19]: This is what I'm not sure.

1587
02:22:54,159 --> 02:22:55,559
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't know.

1588
02:22:57,880 --> 02:22:59,301
[SPEAKER_19]: No one knows what I'm talking about here.

1589
02:22:59,321 --> 02:23:01,622
[SPEAKER_19]: Does any of the members know what I'm talking about?

1590
02:23:01,662 --> 02:23:01,922
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't.

1591
02:23:02,642 --> 02:23:08,985
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I could have sworn there was something about the seniors being excluded from something from

1592
02:23:09,798 --> 02:23:10,398
[SPEAKER_19]: increasing.

1593
02:23:10,818 --> 02:23:14,160
[SPEAKER_46]: If I can, Mr. President, uh, counselor Scarpelli.

1594
02:23:14,940 --> 02:23:24,264
[SPEAKER_46]: So when I asked for debt exclusion, the finance director at the time, Alicia Nunley did a study that excluded our seniors.

1595
02:23:24,944 --> 02:23:29,066
[SPEAKER_46]: And my comment tonight would have been through the process.

1596
02:23:29,766 --> 02:23:36,769
[SPEAKER_46]: It would have been interesting to see before we got to this point, if seniors could have been excluded.

1597
02:23:37,873 --> 02:23:42,775
[SPEAKER_46]: So, uh, but I, I believe there's council bears says it's, it's a mass law.

1598
02:23:42,795 --> 02:23:47,877
[SPEAKER_46]: I believe there is a process that you can work with the state to get that exempt by the way.

1599
02:23:47,917 --> 02:23:48,237
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1600
02:23:49,558 --> 02:23:51,999
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1601
02:23:52,759 --> 02:23:53,039
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1602
02:23:53,059 --> 02:23:53,880
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Scott Pelly.

1603
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:55,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, yeah.

1604
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:59,382
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, my parents bought a home here in the seventies for 48,000.

1605
02:24:00,002 --> 02:24:00,182
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1606
02:24:00,242 --> 02:24:01,763
[SPEAKER_19]: Their home has increased dramatically.

1607
02:24:02,483 --> 02:24:07,084
[SPEAKER_19]: due to people that can afford over a million dollar homes buying around here in West Medford.

1608
02:24:07,824 --> 02:24:10,625
[SPEAKER_19]: My parents' retirement is this home.

1609
02:24:11,185 --> 02:24:13,605
[SPEAKER_19]: They have a lot of money taken out against this home.

1610
02:24:14,405 --> 02:24:16,646
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not worth $800,000, $900,000.

1611
02:24:17,426 --> 02:24:21,607
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's my issue that I have.

1612
02:24:22,547 --> 02:24:29,068
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would like you guys to look into helping out the seniors any way you can.

1613
02:24:29,348 --> 02:24:29,749
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1614
02:24:30,769 --> 02:24:31,329
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Jess.

1615
02:24:34,895 --> 02:24:35,996
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

1616
02:24:36,356 --> 02:24:41,300
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, Donna Sherman 54 Dover Street just want to thank you all so much for your leadership and work on this.

1617
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:46,263
[SPEAKER_31]: And I, my husband and three year old and I moved to Medford about a year ago.

1618
02:24:47,004 --> 02:24:54,850
[SPEAKER_31]: So, and I work in the community development field and it is just a fact that our municipalities across the country have received less federal funding for decades.

1619
02:24:55,550 --> 02:24:59,471
[SPEAKER_31]: This is a structural issue of not being able to raise enough revenues to cover costs.

1620
02:24:59,551 --> 02:25:03,632
[SPEAKER_31]: And ARPA showed us how meaningful it is to have those extra federal funds.

1621
02:25:03,692 --> 02:25:10,014
[SPEAKER_31]: But without those federal funds in perpetuity, city leadership is gonna have to deal with these really difficult decisions.

1622
02:25:10,214 --> 02:25:11,715
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not gonna magically go away.

1623
02:25:12,635 --> 02:25:18,457
[SPEAKER_31]: We've loved getting to know the community that Medford has to offer and especially our community of young families.

1624
02:25:18,517 --> 02:25:22,058
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm here to support putting the overrides on the budget.

1625
02:25:22,738 --> 02:25:30,221
[SPEAKER_31]: so that we can really support our schools and our youth and our families and our infrastructure as well with the street budget override.

1626
02:25:30,321 --> 02:25:30,961
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you so much.

1627
02:25:31,161 --> 02:25:31,841
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you so much.

1628
02:25:33,402 --> 02:25:35,603
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Sharon Diesso on Zoom.

1629
02:25:36,383 --> 02:25:37,944
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please, Sharon.

1630
02:25:37,964 --> 02:25:38,884
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1631
02:25:46,227 --> 02:25:47,847
[SPEAKER_39]: Sharon, I'm going to unmute you now.

1632
02:25:47,907 --> 02:25:49,208
[SPEAKER_39]: You need to accept my request.

1633
02:25:53,103 --> 02:25:54,484
[SPEAKER_64]: Hello, can you hear me okay?

1634
02:25:55,725 --> 02:25:56,805
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record.

1635
02:25:56,825 --> 02:25:57,566
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1636
02:25:58,126 --> 02:25:58,807
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

1637
02:25:59,407 --> 02:26:00,488
[SPEAKER_64]: Good evening, everyone.

1638
02:26:00,568 --> 02:26:04,650
[SPEAKER_64]: Sharon DSO, Circuit Road in Mass Ave in Medford.

1639
02:26:04,710 --> 02:26:07,832
[SPEAKER_64]: I've been a long, long time resident of this city.

1640
02:26:08,293 --> 02:26:14,897
[SPEAKER_64]: Also, I have been a former school teacher, and I'm an adjunct professor now, not far from this area.

1641
02:26:15,977 --> 02:26:21,401
[SPEAKER_64]: I do want to tell you a few troubling thoughts that I have this evening.

1642
02:26:24,111 --> 02:26:38,634
[SPEAKER_64]: Um, first I could direct this really through the president, but I'm really, um, would, I know, um, councilor Schiappelli well for many years, so he could aptly answer some of these questions to educate everyone.

1643
02:26:40,494 --> 02:26:42,434
[SPEAKER_64]: First of all, how did we get to this point?

1644
02:26:43,154 --> 02:26:44,695
[SPEAKER_64]: Everyone said they knew it was coming.

1645
02:26:44,735 --> 02:26:46,675
[SPEAKER_64]: They knew it was coming, et cetera, et cetera.

1646
02:26:47,215 --> 02:26:51,336
[SPEAKER_64]: How did we get in a precarious situation like this in Medford?

1647
02:26:52,086 --> 02:26:58,891
[SPEAKER_64]: And I appreciate all the comments that people have made, especially people concerned about the education of their children.

1648
02:26:59,552 --> 02:27:08,879
[SPEAKER_64]: I really hope, and I don't mean this in a very surly way, that you are very active while the school committee was going forward and voting themselves a raise.

1649
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:17,286
[SPEAKER_64]: They should, if they're real concerned citizens of this community, should have been at those meetings begging them not to give themselves a raise.

1650
02:27:18,118 --> 02:27:22,160
[SPEAKER_64]: if they were that concerned in the school committee members should retract that race.

1651
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:23,440
[SPEAKER_64]: Sorry.

1652
02:27:24,581 --> 02:27:26,541
[SPEAKER_64]: Also, how we get into this point.

1653
02:27:27,222 --> 02:27:32,504
[SPEAKER_64]: I think Councilor Schappelli has mentioned in the past, I'm going to think quickly now, that there are lots

1654
02:27:33,337 --> 02:27:37,738
[SPEAKER_64]: that probably are valuable that can be auctioned off or sold in this community.

1655
02:27:38,238 --> 02:27:47,340
[SPEAKER_64]: There is, still withstanding the old police station, what's being done with that building that's worth millions and millions of dollars.

1656
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:50,341
[SPEAKER_64]: I just throw those questions out.

1657
02:27:50,701 --> 02:27:53,381
[SPEAKER_64]: I think this is a last, last resort.

1658
02:27:53,742 --> 02:27:55,482
[SPEAKER_64]: We should not be in Medford

1659
02:27:55,942 --> 02:28:00,545
[SPEAKER_64]: We are not second speaker after that fine young student.

1660
02:28:00,865 --> 02:28:03,387
[SPEAKER_64]: We are not a vitalizing town anymore.

1661
02:28:03,727 --> 02:28:04,868
[SPEAKER_64]: We are not vibrant.

1662
02:28:05,188 --> 02:28:07,389
[SPEAKER_64]: We're in a precarious situation.

1663
02:28:07,949 --> 02:28:22,878
[SPEAKER_64]: I advise strongly that people who are watching, listening, agree with this council tonight should extend this until more investigation is done into this matter and it should not be thrown out tonight.

1664
02:28:24,039 --> 02:28:27,122
[SPEAKER_64]: just like it were playing cards in a crapshoot.

1665
02:28:27,563 --> 02:28:27,923
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

1666
02:28:27,983 --> 02:28:34,029
[SPEAKER_64]: I'd like those questions answered, please, about the properties that can be sold before any of this is considered.

1667
02:28:34,369 --> 02:28:39,735
[SPEAKER_64]: I'm very duly disappointed in many of you on this council this evening.

1668
02:28:40,796 --> 02:28:44,499
[SPEAKER_64]: Not criticizing because you were elected by some people.

1669
02:28:46,582 --> 02:28:47,823
[SPEAKER_64]: We do not have

1670
02:28:48,633 --> 02:28:54,977
[SPEAKER_64]: really capable people on this council to go forth and make big financial decisions.

1671
02:28:55,778 --> 02:28:56,659
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you very much.

1672
02:28:57,479 --> 02:28:58,420
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Sharon.

1673
02:29:00,541 --> 02:29:02,843
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Councilor Callahan.

1674
02:29:02,863 --> 02:29:10,488
[SPEAKER_39]: I just also want to note the school committee did not vote themselves to raise this council considered an adjustment of their compensation after 24 years of no increase.

1675
02:29:10,968 --> 02:29:11,549
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Callahan.

1676
02:29:12,110 --> 02:29:12,370
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1677
02:29:12,430 --> 02:29:16,093
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to mention one thing for folks concerned about seniors.

1678
02:29:16,133 --> 02:29:20,215
[SPEAKER_18]: We also have in Medford, there is something that people can request.

1679
02:29:20,275 --> 02:29:23,578
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're a senior, you can request that you can be exempt.

1680
02:29:23,718 --> 02:29:30,702
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, from all of your, up to all of your taxes, and that can be until your property is sold.

1681
02:29:31,123 --> 02:29:35,105
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is something that seniors in Medford have the option of doing.

1682
02:29:35,185 --> 02:29:41,970
[SPEAKER_18]: So we hope that this Prop 2.5 override will not negatively impact folks in their day-to-day living expenses.

1683
02:29:42,708 --> 02:29:43,749
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Councilor Kanye.

1684
02:29:43,789 --> 02:29:53,974
[SPEAKER_39]: In addition to the exemptions, there's the deferral program, and there's also a senior tax work off program where some seniors come to City Hall and help out and have some of their taxes reduced.

1685
02:29:54,494 --> 02:29:56,235
[SPEAKER_39]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record.

1686
02:29:56,515 --> 02:29:57,536
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, I'm Michelle Barkson.

1687
02:29:57,556 --> 02:29:58,837
[SPEAKER_32]: I live at 23 Diane Road.

1688
02:29:59,977 --> 02:30:02,959
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just speaking out in strong support of these overrides.

1689
02:30:03,199 --> 02:30:07,241
[SPEAKER_32]: I have been a public school teacher for 17 years in neighboring districts.

1690
02:30:08,010 --> 02:30:10,811
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just wanted to speak for a moment from a teacher's perspective.

1691
02:30:10,911 --> 02:30:30,016
[SPEAKER_32]: I've worked in districts with very poor funding with funding budget issues and very well funded and the morale is very noticeable and budget issues in schools cause low morale and I'm really afraid that low morale is an issue in Medford public schools among among the teachers.

1692
02:30:31,002 --> 02:30:34,225
[SPEAKER_32]: due to these proposed cuts that are needed because we do not have funds available.

1693
02:30:35,086 --> 02:30:38,508
[SPEAKER_32]: When morale is low among teachers, it directly affects students.

1694
02:30:38,568 --> 02:30:42,892
[SPEAKER_32]: And again, I can speak to that as somebody who has worked in both types of districts.

1695
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:50,178
[SPEAKER_32]: We have to remember that teacher working conditions are student learning conditions, and we cannot separate those.

1696
02:30:51,339 --> 02:30:57,804
[SPEAKER_32]: We have to fund our schools so teachers can have good working conditions, which allow our students strong learning conditions.

1697
02:30:58,436 --> 02:31:08,218
[SPEAKER_32]: Expecting teachers to buy their own supplies, teach too many sections of a class and have too many students in a room and continue to keep a positive learning environment is unreasonable.

1698
02:31:08,698 --> 02:31:12,138
[SPEAKER_32]: We have to fund our schools fully so our children can thrive in Medford.

1699
02:31:12,638 --> 02:31:15,299
[SPEAKER_32]: And these overrides are a way to ensure that that happens.

1700
02:31:15,639 --> 02:31:27,841
[SPEAKER_32]: I implore people in Medford to consider our children, our vulnerable population of children, who as other have said, they cannot be here to vote and speak except for that one very brave young man,

1701
02:31:29,265 --> 02:31:31,887
[SPEAKER_32]: when making decisions for these overrides.

1702
02:31:32,047 --> 02:31:36,010
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you all for getting this out there and putting, and hopefully getting it on the ballot.

1703
02:31:36,070 --> 02:31:37,251
[SPEAKER_32]: I really appreciate your work.

1704
02:31:38,072 --> 02:31:42,696
[SPEAKER_32]: And I really hope the people of Medford consider our children when they go to vote.

1705
02:31:42,976 --> 02:31:43,276
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1706
02:31:43,797 --> 02:31:44,257
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1707
02:31:44,277 --> 02:31:49,161
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Jen on Zoom.

1708
02:31:49,201 --> 02:31:50,202
[SPEAKER_39]: Jen, I'm going to unmute you.

1709
02:31:50,242 --> 02:31:51,763
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

1710
02:31:51,803 --> 02:31:52,644
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1711
02:31:54,011 --> 02:31:55,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Jen Weinberg, 13 Cottage Street.

1712
02:31:56,913 --> 02:32:00,636
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an educator in the Braintree Public Schools and a Medford homeowner.

1713
02:32:01,457 --> 02:32:05,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Braintree right now has an $8 million gap in funding for the public school system.

1714
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:07,661
[SPEAKER_00]: $8 million.

1715
02:32:08,022 --> 02:32:09,243
[SPEAKER_00]: This didn't happen overnight.

1716
02:32:09,843 --> 02:32:15,547
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 positions were eliminated and almost 100 educators received pink slips within the last two months.

1717
02:32:16,448 --> 02:32:22,791
[SPEAKER_00]: This reduction in force will result in significant loss of programming and will have devastating effects on students.

1718
02:32:23,491 --> 02:32:26,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford should view Braintree as a cautionary tale.

1719
02:32:26,672 --> 02:32:34,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fund the public schools with an override now and a plan going forward before Braintree ends up in a more dire situation.

1720
02:32:34,995 --> 02:32:39,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Braintree's override vote is on Saturday and public education hangs in the balance.

1721
02:32:39,757 --> 02:32:40,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

1722
02:32:40,037 --> 02:32:41,858
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1723
02:32:44,292 --> 02:32:46,474
[SPEAKER_39]: Going to go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

1724
02:32:46,554 --> 02:32:47,134
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1725
02:32:47,154 --> 02:32:49,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Marie Izzo, Pilgrim Road, Medford Mass.

1726
02:32:50,237 --> 02:32:55,641
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank all of you for going through this process, and I've watched very carefully, and it's very painful.

1727
02:32:56,682 --> 02:33:00,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to keep it simple, i.e., let the people vote.

1728
02:33:01,206 --> 02:33:04,789
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here for our teachers, our students, our whole community.

1729
02:33:05,529 --> 02:33:08,212
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just really want to take this vote tonight.

1730
02:33:08,992 --> 02:33:13,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And for us to make the decision that we all need to make personally.

1731
02:33:13,174 --> 02:33:14,475
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a vulnerable senior.

1732
02:33:14,495 --> 02:33:20,558
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have my own sort of things to think about how that's going to work for me I'm sure I'll figure it out.

1733
02:33:21,679 --> 02:33:24,420
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know, we're all strapped financially right now.

1734
02:33:26,098 --> 02:33:30,240
[SPEAKER_12]: And Callahan said here, it's just inevitable, and it's everywhere.

1735
02:33:30,320 --> 02:33:33,822
[SPEAKER_12]: I see it in Melrose, I see it in Arlington, you know, vote yes, vote no, all this.

1736
02:33:34,382 --> 02:33:37,523
[SPEAKER_12]: But let's just vote as a community.

1737
02:33:37,664 --> 02:33:38,564
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I care about.

1738
02:33:38,784 --> 02:33:39,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1739
02:33:39,685 --> 02:33:40,145
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1740
02:33:40,165 --> 02:33:43,546
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

1741
02:33:44,127 --> 02:33:47,968
[SPEAKER_39]: Bob Jones, Menford Fire Union Local 1032.

1742
02:33:48,409 --> 02:33:49,709
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

1743
02:33:49,749 --> 02:33:50,630
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1744
02:33:52,631 --> 02:33:53,151
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, thank you.

1745
02:33:53,923 --> 02:33:55,024
[SPEAKER_38]: Bob Jones, 5 St.

1746
02:33:55,064 --> 02:33:58,706
[SPEAKER_38]: Mary Street, Method Mass, Local 1032 Treasurer.

1747
02:33:58,726 --> 02:34:03,669
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll try to be brief because I have many, many questions and many issues that I'd like to address.

1748
02:34:04,649 --> 02:34:14,495
[SPEAKER_38]: The first of them was, so anybody who was on the financial task force, could I request a copy of the minutes for that, those discussions of the meetings for the financial task force?

1749
02:34:15,515 --> 02:34:16,456
[SPEAKER_38]: Anyone who was on that committee?

1750
02:34:21,451 --> 02:34:23,592
[SPEAKER_39]: Mr. Jones, we don't have public minutes.

1751
02:34:23,612 --> 02:34:24,633
[SPEAKER_39]: They were not public meetings.

1752
02:34:25,753 --> 02:34:30,015
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, so it was, I've heard many times that it was a transparent process.

1753
02:34:30,776 --> 02:34:34,397
[SPEAKER_38]: I'd just like to know what was discussed and what the resolutions were.

1754
02:34:35,258 --> 02:34:38,640
[SPEAKER_38]: Anybody that took notes and how they came to their conclusions.

1755
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:49,545
[SPEAKER_39]: The press releases issued by the financial task force contain a summary of the decisions that we made and the discussions that we had in those meetings, and they are available to the public on the city website.

1756
02:34:50,563 --> 02:34:51,524
[SPEAKER_38]: City website, okay.

1757
02:34:51,544 --> 02:35:00,048
[SPEAKER_38]: All right, just a little more on the free cash uses.

1758
02:35:00,768 --> 02:35:06,071
[SPEAKER_38]: I know it's not good business to fund free cash on recurring expenses.

1759
02:35:06,131 --> 02:35:17,957
[SPEAKER_38]: However, if we were to look through the budget, I would think that there would be some expenditures that would qualify for free cash expenditures that could be used

1760
02:35:19,133 --> 02:35:23,816
[SPEAKER_38]: in that manner that would reduce the other budgetary items and take the strain off it.

1761
02:35:23,936 --> 02:35:26,018
[SPEAKER_38]: And therefore we wouldn't have the shortfall that we have.

1762
02:35:28,459 --> 02:35:41,708
[SPEAKER_38]: The other thing that I'd like to discuss is where the legal fees that we expend for the city, where was that budgetary item located?

1763
02:35:41,768 --> 02:35:43,189
[SPEAKER_38]: Is that in the legal department?

1764
02:35:44,110 --> 02:35:46,852
[SPEAKER_38]: Is that in professional salaries?

1765
02:35:47,392 --> 02:35:48,393
[SPEAKER_38]: Where could I see that?

1766
02:35:49,244 --> 02:35:50,304
[SPEAKER_38]: budgetary item, what?

1767
02:35:51,265 --> 02:35:52,685
[SPEAKER_39]: That is in the law department budget.

1768
02:35:53,405 --> 02:35:54,366
[SPEAKER_38]: Law department budget.

1769
02:35:54,586 --> 02:35:54,926
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

1770
02:35:55,186 --> 02:35:59,608
[SPEAKER_38]: So the law department budget would have all our legal fees, the estimate for what we're going to spend on those.

1771
02:36:00,608 --> 02:36:02,889
[SPEAKER_39]: It has the amount that he has budgeted for those.

1772
02:36:02,949 --> 02:36:03,149
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1773
02:36:03,929 --> 02:36:04,189
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

1774
02:36:05,230 --> 02:36:08,591
[SPEAKER_39]: You can look available for prior years as well.

1775
02:36:09,631 --> 02:36:09,871
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

1776
02:36:10,191 --> 02:36:11,152
[SPEAKER_38]: Is that on the website?

1777
02:36:11,192 --> 02:36:15,573
[SPEAKER_38]: Because I cannot find a complete budget on the city's website.

1778
02:36:15,633 --> 02:36:17,494
[SPEAKER_38]: I'd also like to request a

1779
02:36:17,978 --> 02:36:24,084
[SPEAKER_38]: soup to nuts, A to Z, complete budget for the city for this fiscal year.

1780
02:36:25,125 --> 02:36:26,126
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know where I could get that.

1781
02:36:26,226 --> 02:36:27,647
[SPEAKER_38]: I've looked on the website many times.

1782
02:36:27,667 --> 02:36:29,048
[SPEAKER_38]: It doesn't show a complete budget.

1783
02:36:30,330 --> 02:36:31,711
[SPEAKER_38]: Whose department is that?

1784
02:36:32,071 --> 02:36:32,792
[SPEAKER_38]: Is that Mr. Dickinson's?

1785
02:36:33,919 --> 02:36:42,625
[SPEAKER_39]: I'll give you 30 more seconds, but just to answer the question, if you go on the city website and you go under mayor's office, the menu, there's a city budget page, and the city budget is there.

1786
02:36:43,045 --> 02:36:49,629
[SPEAKER_39]: And one thing we did request this year was to have an additional year of the actuals included, and the administration said that they did include that.

1787
02:36:49,709 --> 02:36:52,191
[SPEAKER_39]: There's a budget book available on the city website.

1788
02:36:52,791 --> 02:36:54,593
[SPEAKER_39]: And I'll give you an extra 30 seconds to answer.

1789
02:36:54,693 --> 02:36:59,456
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, just as far as the fire station design, the new fire station,

1790
02:37:00,126 --> 02:37:01,067
[SPEAKER_38]: It is definitely needed.

1791
02:37:01,407 --> 02:37:04,029
[SPEAKER_38]: I appreciate the concern on the new fire station.

1792
02:37:05,770 --> 02:37:07,131
[SPEAKER_38]: I haven't seen a full design.

1793
02:37:07,151 --> 02:37:09,873
[SPEAKER_38]: I haven't seen a design at all of the fire station.

1794
02:37:09,973 --> 02:37:16,798
[SPEAKER_38]: I was just wondering who was designing the fire station and when was the fire station design sent to the city engineer?

1795
02:37:17,859 --> 02:37:22,563
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know anybody in the fire department that was consulted, was on a committee or anything like that.

1796
02:37:23,243 --> 02:37:24,144
[SPEAKER_38]: And I have not seen a plan.

1797
02:37:25,945 --> 02:37:30,626
[SPEAKER_39]: My understanding is that the owner's project manager for the fire station is finalizing the design.

1798
02:37:30,646 --> 02:37:39,868
[SPEAKER_39]: The debt exclusion vote authorizes the city to bond an amount up to the amount necessary, um, determined by the design.

1799
02:37:40,008 --> 02:37:42,848
[SPEAKER_39]: So, um, it is still being finalized.

1800
02:37:42,868 --> 02:37:47,409
[SPEAKER_39]: Uh, the financial task force estimated the highest amount of the bond would be about $30 million.

1801
02:37:47,569 --> 02:37:51,470
[SPEAKER_39]: Um, but I do know that there's still design considerations ongoing.

1802
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:56,817
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, just so you know, the union has sent multiple people to a fire station design conferences.

1803
02:37:56,837 --> 02:37:59,478
[SPEAKER_38]: It'd be nice if we were included in the process.

1804
02:38:00,458 --> 02:38:06,040
[SPEAKER_38]: And by the way, the combined station had a price tag of 31 million back in the day.

1805
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:10,201
[SPEAKER_38]: One last thing, and I'll try to be brief.

1806
02:38:10,381 --> 02:38:21,384
[SPEAKER_38]: On the free cash, on the prop two and a half override and the debt exclusion, are there gonna be estimates on how much, additionally, that will cost the taxpayer when we do come down to those decisions?

1807
02:38:21,834 --> 02:38:23,374
[SPEAKER_39]: Those were part of the press release.

1808
02:38:23,694 --> 02:38:29,956
[SPEAKER_39]: The total of all three is an estimate of $446 a year or about $42 per month.

1809
02:38:29,976 --> 02:38:34,417
[SPEAKER_38]: For a month for a taxpayer?

1810
02:38:34,437 --> 02:38:35,737
[SPEAKER_39]: For the average single family home.

1811
02:38:36,557 --> 02:38:38,737
[SPEAKER_39]: Single family home.

1812
02:38:38,757 --> 02:38:38,737
$69,000.

1813
02:38:38,857 --> 02:38:40,698
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, thank you.

1814
02:38:41,998 --> 02:38:42,398
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1815
02:38:42,958 --> 02:38:43,878
[SPEAKER_39]: We'll go to the podium.

1816
02:38:43,898 --> 02:38:45,199
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

1817
02:38:45,239 --> 02:38:46,139
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1818
02:38:46,730 --> 02:38:47,591
[SPEAKER_45]: Good.

1819
02:38:47,671 --> 02:38:53,197
[SPEAKER_45]: Anthony Gann, 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Leominster, Massachusetts, and I am the president of the Benford Teachers Association.

1820
02:38:55,322 --> 02:39:06,072
[SPEAKER_45]: While I appreciate we have to have a discussion about something coming up in November, all of my members at the moment have Friday circled on their calendars, because that becomes the deadline for pink slips to be issued.

1821
02:39:06,893 --> 02:39:18,464
[SPEAKER_45]: And with the allocation the mayor has given, we are still looking at about a $1.6 million gap between the school committee's asked budget and this allocation.

1822
02:39:21,129 --> 02:39:26,875
[SPEAKER_45]: So I first and foremost ask that this committee look for that 1.6 million.

1823
02:39:27,956 --> 02:39:41,750
[SPEAKER_45]: And I also ask that the budget be made available as soon as possible because our countdown for the days of school left basically comes down to, we have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then Tuesday.

1824
02:39:42,748 --> 02:39:49,790
[SPEAKER_45]: And then we're scattered, you know, we're back at home and a lot of people are asking me, do I have a job next year?

1825
02:39:50,130 --> 02:39:50,670
[SPEAKER_45]: What's going on?

1826
02:39:50,990 --> 02:39:54,971
[SPEAKER_45]: So I asked again, as I asked last time to have a budget made available to me.

1827
02:39:55,652 --> 02:40:04,994
[SPEAKER_45]: And again, I asked to focus on the present, which is again, that $1.6 million gap between level services and what is being presented tonight.

1828
02:40:05,955 --> 02:40:06,235
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

1829
02:40:07,455 --> 02:40:08,515
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Mr. Gannon.

1830
02:40:09,356 --> 02:40:10,696
[SPEAKER_39]: I can't speak for the school committee,

1831
02:40:11,605 --> 02:40:13,169
[SPEAKER_39]: I do see some school committee members here.

1832
02:40:13,991 --> 02:40:19,826
[SPEAKER_39]: I do know that the school committee has had to wait to schedule their budget meeting until we have an allocation before us and approved it.

1833
02:40:20,447 --> 02:40:27,651
[SPEAKER_39]: And my understanding of the 77.75 million, it's not the 79.4 requested by the school committee.

1834
02:40:29,132 --> 02:40:39,037
[SPEAKER_39]: But my understanding is that the intent is that if the overrides were to pass, then there could be supplemental appropriation recommended by the school committee to the council.

1835
02:40:40,198 --> 02:40:43,940
[SPEAKER_39]: And the override questions also would become active this fiscal year.

1836
02:40:44,480 --> 02:40:46,942
[SPEAKER_39]: So essentially,

1837
02:40:48,007 --> 02:40:52,570
[SPEAKER_39]: there's money for the first two quarters of the year and there potentially will be more money after that.

1838
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:53,711
[SPEAKER_39]: That's just my understanding.

1839
02:40:53,751 --> 02:41:01,677
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm again, not on the school committee, but just to allay some of those fears beyond that, I do not know when the school committee is going to schedule their meeting or release a budget.

1840
02:41:02,437 --> 02:41:05,339
[SPEAKER_39]: But I do know that they had to wait for us to approve an allocation.

1841
02:41:05,359 --> 02:41:05,660
[SPEAKER_45]: All right.

1842
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:07,101
[SPEAKER_45]: Cause I'll be honest.

1843
02:41:07,141 --> 02:41:08,181
[SPEAKER_45]: I mean, you can't really,

1844
02:41:09,582 --> 02:41:14,045
[SPEAKER_45]: because I was told of a cut today that we're losing a teacher at the high school.

1845
02:41:14,625 --> 02:41:17,006
[SPEAKER_45]: So that's going to start it, right?

1846
02:41:17,106 --> 02:41:21,568
[SPEAKER_45]: So again, I just, I need to have a budget in front of me as is the right of the union president.

1847
02:41:22,229 --> 02:41:27,892
[SPEAKER_45]: And I need to be able to get some clarity because until then my membership cannot start thinking about November.

1848
02:41:27,952 --> 02:41:28,992
[SPEAKER_45]: Can't start thinking about the summer.

1849
02:41:29,873 --> 02:41:30,653
[SPEAKER_45]: Has to think about Friday.

1850
02:41:31,333 --> 02:41:31,814
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you very much.

1851
02:41:31,994 --> 02:41:32,294
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1852
02:41:37,355 --> 02:41:41,077
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Ken on Zoom.

1853
02:41:41,117 --> 02:41:43,759
[SPEAKER_39]: Ken, I'm gonna unmute you, name and address for the record, please.

1854
02:41:43,779 --> 02:41:44,619
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1855
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:47,501
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, thank you.

1856
02:41:47,841 --> 02:41:50,283
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm Ken Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

1857
02:41:52,384 --> 02:41:54,025
[SPEAKER_28]: First of all, I wanted to be there actually tonight.

1858
02:41:54,125 --> 02:41:57,527
[SPEAKER_28]: So kudos to everyone who in the past has made the Zoom accessible.

1859
02:41:58,107 --> 02:42:02,730
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm getting over a sickness, don't wanna get anyone whatever the hell I've been dealing with.

1860
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:06,592
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you to past and present council for that.

1861
02:42:07,488 --> 02:42:15,711
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I am here to say I do support all of these prop 2.50 rides, both the two individual as well as the debt exclusion.

1862
02:42:16,672 --> 02:42:20,513
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I know it's been said over and over again, no one likes raising their own taxes.

1863
02:42:20,533 --> 02:42:23,214
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I'm a single homeowner.

1864
02:42:23,234 --> 02:42:24,815
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't have any kids.

1865
02:42:25,915 --> 02:42:27,856
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, honestly, I grew up in the middle of the woods.

1866
02:42:28,136 --> 02:42:31,397
[SPEAKER_28]: The roads here are still perfect by comparison.

1867
02:42:32,598 --> 02:42:35,739
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, but I still want to, you know,

1868
02:42:36,596 --> 02:42:39,659
[SPEAKER_28]: give back to the community that I have been a part of for almost 15 years.

1869
02:42:41,780 --> 02:42:49,226
[SPEAKER_28]: That said, I think to the union president's point that he had also mentioned, I think we do indeed have a lot of free cash that's available.

1870
02:42:50,087 --> 02:42:51,488
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think it's a permanent solution.

1871
02:42:51,728 --> 02:42:59,334
[SPEAKER_28]: I think even if we were to somehow release funds slightly, that does only get us through now.

1872
02:42:59,935 --> 02:43:02,296
[SPEAKER_28]: I think no matter what, we would still need those Prop 2.5 overrides

1873
02:43:04,178 --> 02:43:05,919
[SPEAKER_28]: to help us towards a sustainable path.

1874
02:43:05,979 --> 02:43:31,490
[SPEAKER_28]: And I know between the zoning ordinances that you all have been working on this year on top of everything else, I think that runway with the free money, as well as the Prop 2.5 override, plus all of the growth that is hopefully moving forward in this timeframe for new businesses, mixed developments, more residential, I think that would

1875
02:43:32,029 --> 02:43:44,272
[SPEAKER_28]: set Medford up on a really fantastic course for the next several years, where hopefully we would even be able to avoid any other future overrides, hopefully with enough build out.

1876
02:43:45,293 --> 02:43:46,173
[SPEAKER_28]: So that is it.

1877
02:43:46,333 --> 02:43:47,413
[SPEAKER_28]: Just keep up the great work.

1878
02:43:47,653 --> 02:43:48,353
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate it.

1879
02:43:50,434 --> 02:43:50,894
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1880
02:43:52,134 --> 02:43:52,714
[SPEAKER_39]: Go to the podium.

1881
02:43:52,734 --> 02:43:53,795
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

1882
02:43:53,815 --> 02:43:54,475
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1883
02:43:55,151 --> 02:43:56,673
[SPEAKER_20]: Jason Eastman, 204 Felzow.

1884
02:43:57,493 --> 02:44:03,399
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to say that Medford has among the lowest property taxes in the commonwealth.

1885
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:10,486
[SPEAKER_20]: After $37 a month extra, if all of these pass, it will still have among the lowest property taxes in the commonwealth.

1886
02:44:11,808 --> 02:44:15,331
[SPEAKER_20]: And the way that we afford that is by subsidizing

1887
02:44:16,813 --> 02:44:26,179
[SPEAKER_20]: making our teachers subsidize our property owners, making our firefighters subsidize our property owners, making our students subsidize our property owners.

1888
02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:43,511
[SPEAKER_20]: And so on behalf of my first grade daughter and on behalf of my three-year-old who will be coming up into public schools, I say thank you to the leadership of city council, thank you to the mayor, wherever she is, and thank you to all of the voters who will support these overrides.

1889
02:44:43,772 --> 02:44:43,972
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks.

1890
02:44:47,867 --> 02:44:49,488
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Munir on Zoom.

1891
02:44:49,548 --> 02:44:51,149
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

1892
02:44:51,169 --> 02:44:52,570
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1893
02:45:01,896 --> 02:45:02,416
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you.

1894
02:45:03,957 --> 02:45:08,060
[SPEAKER_63]: My name is Munir Germanus and I live at 3 Summit Road.

1895
02:45:09,421 --> 02:45:14,784
[SPEAKER_63]: I have lived in Medford and been a homeowner for about 40 years.

1896
02:45:17,210 --> 02:45:34,926
[SPEAKER_63]: I fully support the effort of this council and our mayor to face fiscal reality and making even the very difficult decisions and not simply make declarations that are not based on facts and reality.

1897
02:45:35,946 --> 02:45:41,691
[SPEAKER_63]: If you really are looking for additional support for our schools and infrastructures,

1898
02:45:42,605 --> 02:46:11,372
[SPEAKER_63]: from outside, then start talking to your representatives in Congress and ask them why they spend trillions of dollars to support our weapons manufacturers and a few foreign countries whom we consider our allies, instead of making something like ARPA a permanent feature to support our communities across the U.S.

1899
02:46:12,478 --> 02:46:20,982
[SPEAKER_63]: So I fully support the work of this council, and I am happy to pay more taxes to support and maintain our community.

1900
02:46:21,562 --> 02:46:22,903
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you for the opportunity.

1901
02:46:23,823 --> 02:46:24,344
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you.

1902
02:46:27,285 --> 02:46:30,987
[SPEAKER_39]: To the podium, School Committee Vice Chair Jenny Graham, name and address for the record, please.

1903
02:46:31,007 --> 02:46:31,507
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1904
02:46:32,153 --> 02:46:33,855
[SPEAKER_30]: Jenny Graham, 7 Ronalee Road.

1905
02:46:34,376 --> 02:46:42,066
[SPEAKER_30]: I am the vice chair of the school committee, and I just wanted to let you all know that every time we look at a budget we have a chance to look into the future.

1906
02:46:43,275 --> 02:46:53,140
[SPEAKER_30]: When we looked at the FY21 budget, we looked into a future where the Medford Public Schools was the only department in the entire city to say goodbye to humans who worked in our schools.

1907
02:46:54,061 --> 02:47:00,885
[SPEAKER_30]: And when we looked at the FY22 budget, we said, okay, things are better.

1908
02:47:02,065 --> 02:47:10,050
[SPEAKER_30]: But also we had an inordinate amount of need that we had never seen before due to the recovery of students from the pandemic.

1909
02:47:11,210 --> 02:47:20,672
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't remember FY23, so I think that means it was like a not noteworthy year, meaning we weren't at the brink of crisis, but also nothing was very good.

1910
02:47:21,612 --> 02:47:27,893
[SPEAKER_30]: When we looked at the FY24 budget, we looked forward and we said, this budget is incredibly fragile.

1911
02:47:28,653 --> 02:47:30,553
[SPEAKER_30]: Those are words that we used on the floor.

1912
02:47:32,014 --> 02:47:38,975
[SPEAKER_30]: We also said that we would be using and exhausting our remaining ESSER funds to do what the city budget could not do for us.

1913
02:47:39,895 --> 02:47:55,213
[SPEAKER_30]: So when I look forward to the FY 25 budget, the budget proposed by the mayor, which includes work done by myself and others on the task force, it restores most much of the ask that we put forward to you all a couple of weeks ago.

1914
02:47:55,833 --> 02:47:56,834
[SPEAKER_30]: It is not everything.

1915
02:47:57,679 --> 02:48:02,202
[SPEAKER_30]: That is sort of what compromise is all about, that everyone leaves just a little bit unhappy.

1916
02:48:03,743 --> 02:48:10,247
[SPEAKER_30]: And so we do have work to do on the school side once this number passes, whatever that number is, to reconcile.

1917
02:48:11,328 --> 02:48:14,450
[SPEAKER_30]: But when we looked forward, we saw a very bleak picture.

1918
02:48:14,931 --> 02:48:18,593
[SPEAKER_30]: We saw a destination of the leadership team of Medford Public Schools.

1919
02:48:19,033 --> 02:48:21,395
[SPEAKER_30]: We saw the elimination of six secretaries.

1920
02:48:21,655 --> 02:48:26,798
[SPEAKER_30]: We saw the elimination of many school teachers, four nurses, and more.

1921
02:48:27,879 --> 02:48:31,760
[SPEAKER_30]: We also were looking forward at an unknown number of $2.7 million.

1922
02:48:32,261 --> 02:48:40,563
[SPEAKER_30]: So to Anthony Guillen's point, the time is now to vote on this budget, because once you do, we have work to do.

1923
02:48:40,683 --> 02:48:44,364
[SPEAKER_30]: And there's a whole bunch of humans who are waiting anxiously for that work.

1924
02:48:45,745 --> 02:48:48,906
[SPEAKER_30]: The school department is aware that this number is out on the floor.

1925
02:48:49,794 --> 02:48:54,099
[SPEAKER_30]: and I would ask that you move on this tonight because it's very important.

1926
02:48:54,760 --> 02:49:02,749
[SPEAKER_30]: The other thing I'll say is when I look into the future, I'm excited to fund budgets that say yes to the fire station that our firefighters deserve.

1927
02:49:03,851 --> 02:49:09,056
[SPEAKER_30]: They have been waiting and they deserve to work in conditions that are

1928
02:49:09,637 --> 02:49:11,318
[SPEAKER_30]: not substandard.

1929
02:49:11,458 --> 02:49:21,982
[SPEAKER_30]: They deserve to work in a state-of-the-art facility just like our police do, just like our library does, just like I hope someday our students will and our teachers will.

1930
02:49:23,382 --> 02:49:39,288
[SPEAKER_30]: And I look forward to saying yes to an amount of money for Bedford Public Schools that allows us not just to pull back from the brink, but also to say what do we need for the future so that we can say yes to pay equity for our paraprofessionals,

1931
02:49:39,628 --> 02:49:44,273
[SPEAKER_30]: so that we can fix the high school schedule, that we can increase the access to the arts and so much more.

1932
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:48,262
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, yes, yes is my answer to those three questions.

1933
02:49:48,662 --> 02:49:51,824
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm happy to talk to anybody who wants to talk about those details.

1934
02:49:52,445 --> 02:49:56,607
[SPEAKER_30]: And the last thing I will say is thank you for being decisive tonight.

1935
02:49:57,287 --> 02:49:58,328
[SPEAKER_30]: It's very important.

1936
02:49:58,548 --> 02:50:04,412
[SPEAKER_30]: And most importantly, I look forward to talking to all the residents about what those possibilities mean for us in the future.

1937
02:50:05,432 --> 02:50:08,995
[SPEAKER_30]: The last thing I'll say is that- This is the second last thing you say, but I'll give you 15 more seconds.

1938
02:50:09,015 --> 02:50:10,575
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, I promise.

1939
02:50:10,676 --> 02:50:14,378
[SPEAKER_30]: The last thing I'll say is that the MSBA building committee is working very hard.

1940
02:50:15,098 --> 02:50:22,223
[SPEAKER_30]: I expect that you will see a request for free cash in your next meeting to fund the feasibility study, which is a critical step in the eligibility phase.

1941
02:50:23,043 --> 02:50:34,911
[SPEAKER_30]: And in addition, when we talk about free cash, the other thing that is very much on topic in the school committee meetings is the many millions of dollars, I think north of 20, that are required to rehab the HVAC systems in both the Andrews

1942
02:50:35,430 --> 02:50:36,271
[SPEAKER_30]: and the McGlynn Middle School.

1943
02:50:36,291 --> 02:50:40,694
[SPEAKER_30]: So all of that forthcoming to many people's questions about free cash.

1944
02:50:40,754 --> 02:50:45,638
[SPEAKER_30]: So those are one-time funds, one-time expenditures, and you can look forward to those at your doorstep soon.

1945
02:50:45,838 --> 02:50:46,179
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1946
02:50:46,279 --> 02:50:46,899
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1947
02:50:46,919 --> 02:50:54,145
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm gonna go to the podium, and then I'll come back to Zoom, and then the podium.

1948
02:50:54,185 --> 02:50:55,246
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

1949
02:50:55,286 --> 02:50:56,006
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1950
02:50:57,207 --> 02:50:58,889
[SPEAKER_21]: Nick Gioia, 40 Robinson Road.

1951
02:51:00,117 --> 02:51:08,722
[SPEAKER_21]: So there are a number of reasons why I'm opposed to all of these overrides, but there's one that I'd really like to bring to attention of the council tonight, just for the purposes of time.

1952
02:51:09,323 --> 02:51:12,345
[SPEAKER_21]: To me, it's just incredible how exceedingly vague they are.

1953
02:51:13,284 --> 02:51:22,412
[SPEAKER_21]: If you just read, for example, the one called To Invest in the Future of Medford Public Schools, we're talking about a humongous sum of money for general operations.

1954
02:51:22,692 --> 02:51:24,854
[SPEAKER_21]: What does that even mean, general operations?

1955
02:51:25,434 --> 02:51:27,216
[SPEAKER_21]: We have increased access to the arts.

1956
02:51:27,236 --> 02:51:28,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, what does that mean either?

1957
02:51:28,957 --> 02:51:33,761
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're asking the voters here to vote on something where they don't even entirely know what they're voting on.

1958
02:51:34,222 --> 02:51:35,423
[SPEAKER_21]: That's very concerning to me.

1959
02:51:36,277 --> 02:51:41,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, generally speaking, I think we have to acknowledge also that people really are suffering with taxation.

1960
02:51:41,981 --> 02:51:45,183
[SPEAKER_21]: The cost of living crisis in our country is incredible at the moment.

1961
02:51:45,203 --> 02:51:48,186
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot of economic data supporting that it's bad.

1962
02:51:49,186 --> 02:51:55,431
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're saying to ourselves, you know, increase taxes, but we're not really addressing the real impact on people who have to pay these taxes.

1963
02:51:55,931 --> 02:51:56,111
[SPEAKER_21]: right?

1964
02:51:56,391 --> 02:51:57,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone wants services.

1965
02:51:57,692 --> 02:52:00,555
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone wants to improve our schools, our roads.

1966
02:52:00,995 --> 02:52:02,156
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to acknowledge reality.

1967
02:52:02,216 --> 02:52:03,937
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't pay for things we can't afford.

1968
02:52:03,957 --> 02:52:12,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Another reason why people are leaving Medford, going other places, or not moving here in the first place is because it's too expensive to live here.

1969
02:52:12,644 --> 02:52:19,449
[SPEAKER_21]: And part of the reason, I'd say main reason it is, is because buying a home here requires you to pay enormous sums of money in property taxes.

1970
02:52:20,129 --> 02:52:31,554
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really an insufferable situation, and I really don't think these overrides are going to do anything to improve the economic diversity of our city, much less any of the other problems we've been talking about tonight.

1971
02:52:32,094 --> 02:52:34,676
[SPEAKER_21]: So for those reasons, I'm very opposed to these overrides.

1972
02:52:35,176 --> 02:52:39,278
[SPEAKER_21]: As much as I love the Medford public schools and I want to increase services, we have to be realistic here.

1973
02:52:39,538 --> 02:52:41,058
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to do what we're able to do.

1974
02:52:41,319 --> 02:52:44,720
[SPEAKER_21]: This is coming from a guy who went to Medford High, who was number one in his class.

1975
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:48,042
[SPEAKER_21]: I really do care about this city, but I have to acknowledge reality first.

1976
02:52:48,442 --> 02:52:48,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1977
02:52:52,039 --> 02:52:52,599
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1978
02:52:52,799 --> 02:52:54,580
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm gonna go to Zoom, Jean Zotter.

1979
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:56,280
[SPEAKER_39]: Jean, name and address for the record, please.

1980
02:52:56,320 --> 02:52:57,621
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

1981
02:52:59,441 --> 02:53:00,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everybody.

1982
02:53:00,742 --> 02:53:01,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jean Zotter.

1983
02:53:01,962 --> 02:53:06,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 36 Saunders Street, and I am a homeowner.

1984
02:53:06,124 --> 02:53:15,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanna be on the record to say that I support an override and investing those tax resources into our schools and roads.

1985
02:53:16,927 --> 02:53:23,051
[SPEAKER_02]: An override will support long-term costs that free cash cannot adequately address.

1986
02:53:24,151 --> 02:53:37,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And Medford is a city that has never put to the voters since Prop 2.5, the law passed, we've never put this to the voters to ask them to do an override.

1987
02:53:38,154 --> 02:53:45,416
[SPEAKER_02]: The legally allowed amount of 2.5% increase for our property tax does not keep up with inflation.

1988
02:53:45,976 --> 02:53:51,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have not been able to keep up our resources to meet the needs of the city.

1989
02:53:51,838 --> 02:54:03,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those reasons, and that the proposed tax override isn't that much, it's $37 a month or less, depending on your home, I support the tax override.

1990
02:54:04,281 --> 02:54:04,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1991
02:54:05,502 --> 02:54:06,162
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Jean.

1992
02:54:08,305 --> 02:54:09,785
[SPEAKER_40]: going to go to the podium.

1993
02:54:09,825 --> 02:54:10,986
[SPEAKER_40]: Name and address for the record, please.

1994
02:54:11,146 --> 02:54:13,406
[SPEAKER_09]: You have three minutes.

1995
02:54:13,806 --> 02:54:19,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I first have a few questions regarding the proposition to have override that you, Mr. President and Vice President Collins put forward.

1996
02:54:20,468 --> 02:54:28,130
[SPEAKER_09]: So at the previous city council meeting on May 28th, I mentioned eight different alternatives that the city government should consider instead of raising real estate taxes.

1997
02:54:28,930 --> 02:54:32,771
[SPEAKER_09]: The alternative that I want to reemphasize again today is economic growth.

1998
02:54:33,885 --> 02:54:42,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Why hasn't it been and why isn't the overarching goal of the city government to implement a multifaceted campaign to stimulate economic growth?

1999
02:54:44,299 --> 02:54:47,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Economic growth would expand the tax base and increase overall revenue.

2000
02:54:47,704 --> 02:54:50,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Just follow Cambridge and Somerville in this regard.

2001
02:54:51,397 --> 02:54:57,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Why does the proposed ballot question mention access to the arts, whereas there is no mention of STEM?

2002
02:54:58,181 --> 02:55:03,985
[SPEAKER_09]: For those that might not know, STEM is an abbreviation for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

2003
02:55:05,466 --> 02:55:09,589
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to equip our students with the skills that lead to well-paying jobs.

2004
02:55:10,089 --> 02:55:11,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are skills in STEM.

2005
02:55:13,111 --> 02:55:15,473
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you arrive at the $4 million number?

2006
02:55:16,293 --> 02:55:20,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Where can I find the detailed breakdown as to how the money will be used?

2007
02:55:21,260 --> 02:55:43,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lugo-Cohen wrote in her request to use ARPA to stabilize the school department budget for fiscal year 25, quote, further resources could be directed to the school department in FY25 and beyond if the city council votes to place an override question or questions on the November biennial state election ballot and voters approve such a measure, end quote.

2008
02:55:44,466 --> 02:55:54,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the quotation above mean that you're asking for more money without first having developed a detailed breakdown of how the money will be spent?

2009
02:55:54,909 --> 02:55:59,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the approach being followed, give me your money now and I'll figure out how to spend it later?

2010
02:56:00,691 --> 02:56:06,273
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so easy to find new things to spend money on when the money being spent in someone else's money.

2011
02:56:07,213 --> 02:56:12,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's always remember the government spends someone else's money on somebody else.

2012
02:56:13,436 --> 02:56:18,379
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no more inefficient way of spending money than the way the government does.

2013
02:56:19,423 --> 02:56:25,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I have a few comments regarding the provision to have debt exclusion for building the new fire headquarters.

2014
02:56:26,507 --> 02:56:32,710
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't understand why does issuing a municipal bond require the city government to raise taxes immediately.

2015
02:56:33,350 --> 02:56:35,131
[SPEAKER_09]: This shouldn't necessarily be the case.

2016
02:56:35,712 --> 02:56:39,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Issuing municipal bonds allows the city to borrow money from investors.

2017
02:56:40,114 --> 02:56:43,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Investors buy the bonds, providing the city with the needed funds upfront.

2018
02:56:44,016 --> 02:56:47,578
[SPEAKER_09]: The city then repays these investors over time with added interest.

2019
02:56:48,547 --> 02:56:55,275
[SPEAKER_09]: The city government can adopt several strategies to service government debt without necessarily having to raise taxes.

2020
02:56:55,895 --> 02:56:58,078
[SPEAKER_09]: One, economic growth, yet again.

2021
02:56:59,139 --> 02:57:07,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Implement a multifaceted campaign to stimulate economic growth, thereby expanding the tax base and increasing overall revenue without raising taxes.

2022
02:57:07,669 --> 02:57:08,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, prioritize spending.

2023
02:57:09,909 --> 02:57:11,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Three, efficiency gains.

2024
02:57:12,110 --> 02:57:13,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Four, lease revenues.

2025
02:57:14,092 --> 02:57:19,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Lease public assets or increase their efficiency to generate additional income streams for interest payments.

2026
02:57:20,376 --> 02:57:22,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Five, sell city assets.

2027
02:57:22,718 --> 02:57:23,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Evaluate, yes.

2028
02:57:24,058 --> 02:57:24,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2029
02:57:24,899 --> 02:57:32,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Evaluate and sell underutilized public assets such as land or buildings to help pay back the debt.

2030
02:57:32,504 --> 02:57:38,688
[SPEAKER_09]: So I also want to add, not related to this, that this new three million is really bad for people.

2031
02:57:40,570 --> 02:57:41,130
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2032
02:57:41,251 --> 02:57:42,212
[SPEAKER_40]: You're over your time.

2033
02:57:42,272 --> 02:57:42,832
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2034
02:57:44,074 --> 02:57:44,975
[SPEAKER_40]: Gaston, thank you.

2035
02:57:44,995 --> 02:57:45,856
[SPEAKER_40]: You're over your time.

2036
02:57:46,156 --> 02:57:47,037
[SPEAKER_40]: You're over your time.

2037
02:57:47,137 --> 02:57:47,698
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2038
02:57:47,858 --> 02:57:48,559
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, sir.

2039
02:57:49,019 --> 02:57:54,545
[SPEAKER_40]: Sir, I do not think you're benefiting your position by disrupting a public meeting and screaming at the public.

2040
02:57:55,386 --> 02:57:57,549
[SPEAKER_40]: I do not think you convince anyone with your outburst.

2041
02:57:58,149 --> 02:57:59,351
[SPEAKER_40]: Name and address for the record, please.

2042
02:57:59,371 --> 02:58:00,112
[SPEAKER_40]: You have three minutes.

2043
02:58:01,598 --> 02:58:02,219
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2044
02:58:02,659 --> 02:58:05,321
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi, my name is Sam Goldstein 29 Martin Street.

2045
02:58:07,083 --> 02:58:15,431
[SPEAKER_33]: I want to start by first thanking the mayor, the school committee and the city council for their hard work this budget season.

2046
02:58:17,233 --> 02:58:22,437
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, I think you've all, you know, been dealing with a tough hand.

2047
02:58:25,806 --> 02:58:29,548
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, I appreciate the fact that you've been working at it constructively.

2048
02:58:29,568 --> 02:58:48,999
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, I, for one, I'm glad that our elected city leaders are the ones who, you know, we're making the decisions about this and who were making up the body making these calls and not some appointed group of bankers or real estate.

2049
02:58:49,019 --> 02:58:50,560
[SPEAKER_39]: I just want to apologize to everyone.

2050
02:58:50,580 --> 02:58:53,842
[SPEAKER_39]: Sam, if we could, there's just some noise and the kind of a tantrum in the rotunda.

2051
02:58:54,242 --> 02:58:54,482
[SPEAKER_39]: Sure.

2052
02:58:54,843 --> 02:58:56,044
[SPEAKER_39]: I'll give you an extra 15 seconds.

2053
02:58:56,384 --> 02:58:56,564
[SPEAKER_39]: Sure.

2054
02:58:57,385 --> 02:59:04,510
[SPEAKER_33]: You want to take a moment or getting back to it.

2055
02:59:05,291 --> 02:59:11,175
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, I've been, you know, organizing in Medford for several years.

2056
02:59:12,216 --> 02:59:14,498
[SPEAKER_33]: And I've heard a lot, uh,

2057
02:59:15,822 --> 02:59:16,863
[SPEAKER_33]: actually, I haven't heard a lot.

2058
02:59:16,923 --> 02:59:36,553
[SPEAKER_33]: It's been pretty consistent from what people have said, you know, typically people's main concerns are the cost of housing, the cost of the state of the city's roads, and particularly concerns about having a high quality public education for the kids and for the other kids who are growing up in this community.

2059
02:59:37,574 --> 02:59:37,734
[SPEAKER_33]: And

2060
02:59:39,568 --> 02:59:47,537
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, I think we've all heard from a lot of folks tonight who said a lot on this but I just want to make the point that, you know, a child only grows up once.

2061
02:59:48,378 --> 02:59:55,466
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, there's been other hypothetical solutions that have been floated to this that, you know, take

2062
02:59:55,816 --> 02:59:58,357
[SPEAKER_33]: would potentially take years or kick the can down the road.

2063
02:59:59,158 --> 03:00:14,124
[SPEAKER_33]: And I just don't think it's good enough to, you know, wait to fix these problems because there are, you know, kids now who like need help, who we would be shortchanging by not, you know, addressing this.

2064
03:00:14,725 --> 03:00:17,706
[SPEAKER_33]: So, you know, thank you for the hard work on this.

2065
03:00:18,006 --> 03:00:21,188
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, I'm excited to vote for these in November.

2066
03:00:21,368 --> 03:00:21,588
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2067
03:00:22,295 --> 03:00:22,695
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2068
03:00:22,715 --> 03:00:24,297
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

2069
03:00:24,317 --> 03:00:26,638
[SPEAKER_39]: I have Barry Ingber on Zoom.

2070
03:00:26,799 --> 03:00:28,500
[SPEAKER_39]: Barry, name and address for the record, please.

2071
03:00:28,520 --> 03:00:29,200
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2072
03:00:29,541 --> 03:00:32,183
[SPEAKER_39]: And if you could just let me know, this means I don't have to read your comment.

2073
03:00:33,924 --> 03:00:34,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

2074
03:00:35,826 --> 03:00:37,207
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to read my comments.

2075
03:00:37,687 --> 03:00:39,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

2076
03:00:41,210 --> 03:00:49,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank you, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Mr. President, and members of the council for bringing forward these long overdue measures.

2077
03:00:51,047 --> 03:00:55,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone in Medford wants public schools and educational programs that serve our children well.

2078
03:00:56,552 --> 03:00:58,574
[SPEAKER_07]: We want safe and well-maintained streets.

2079
03:00:58,754 --> 03:01:00,756
[SPEAKER_07]: We want reliable fire protection.

2080
03:01:00,936 --> 03:01:13,227
[SPEAKER_07]: We want sound city planning, pleasant parks, more affordable housing, an up-to-date library that is open when people want to visit, city buildings that are healthy and in good repair.

2081
03:01:13,787 --> 03:01:17,971
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want fairly paid staff, including teachers, to provide all these services.

2082
03:01:18,775 --> 03:01:21,437
[SPEAKER_07]: We all want a Medford that we can be proud of.

2083
03:01:22,657 --> 03:01:28,801
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem, Mr. President, is that some people seem to think we can have all these things without paying for them.

2084
03:01:29,862 --> 03:01:44,931
[SPEAKER_07]: They pretend that year after year, decade after decade, revenue increases can fail to match inflation, but somehow the money can be made to appear by trimming imaginary waste, by managing the ever-shrinking pie better.

2085
03:01:46,598 --> 03:01:48,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, this is magical thinking.

2086
03:01:50,040 --> 03:01:59,805
[SPEAKER_07]: In the real world, what we have seen is our streets, our buildings, our programs, and our employees' salaries deteriorating and crumbling.

2087
03:02:01,186 --> 03:02:04,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Many people think of taxes as the government taking our money.

2088
03:02:05,508 --> 03:02:14,653
[SPEAKER_07]: But really, taxes are the way we pool our resources to build the physical and social structure that creates a community.

2089
03:02:15,814 --> 03:02:20,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to seeing the improvements and increase in my taxes will bring.

2090
03:02:20,745 --> 03:02:21,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2091
03:02:22,588 --> 03:02:22,949
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

2092
03:02:26,749 --> 03:02:27,990
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm going to go to the podium.

2093
03:02:28,010 --> 03:02:28,991
[SPEAKER_40]: Name and address the record, please.

2094
03:02:29,011 --> 03:02:29,631
[SPEAKER_40]: You have three minutes.

2095
03:02:29,791 --> 03:02:30,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thanks.

2096
03:02:30,572 --> 03:02:33,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Penelope Taylor, 29 Martin Street, number one in Medford.

2097
03:02:34,435 --> 03:02:37,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to be with you all here in this municipal setting.

2098
03:02:37,377 --> 03:02:43,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And after this, I'm going to go home and register for my compost program and listen to an audio book on lippy from the Medford Public Library.

2099
03:02:44,043 --> 03:02:46,485
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for these municipal services and more.

2100
03:02:47,645 --> 03:03:03,652
[SPEAKER_10]: I really wanted to say thank you to the mayor, the members of the council and school committee for working together to face the numbers, look at our values and work together to decide to make a decision for us to decide to invest in our city with the two and a half overrides and debt exclusion.

2101
03:03:04,332 --> 03:03:07,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I really liked what Councilor Callahan said about kind of our investment debt.

2102
03:03:07,353 --> 03:03:16,077
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not just the numbers, it's these years of not investing that have gotten us to a lower starting point than baseline that we have to make up, we have to think about and make up for.

2103
03:03:16,617 --> 03:03:18,358
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really appreciated that framing.

2104
03:03:19,338 --> 03:03:33,222
[SPEAKER_10]: I also appreciated Councilor Collins mentioning that we are of just a handful of a couple of dozen towns and cities in the Commonwealth that have not looked into putting this tool in the ballot and looking into this way of moving forward to invest in our city.

2105
03:03:33,302 --> 03:03:35,203
[SPEAKER_10]: So we got this tool.

2106
03:03:35,303 --> 03:03:37,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited at the possibility of using it.

2107
03:03:38,664 --> 03:03:43,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Comments from a couple of people before me has led me to make a few other just asides.

2108
03:03:44,386 --> 03:03:50,569
[SPEAKER_10]: The fellow couple ahead of me must not know Somerville that well, because it's only two minutes public comment period allowed in Somerville.

2109
03:03:51,489 --> 03:03:59,292
[SPEAKER_10]: But the point I was going to make was that I like this plan because it doesn't have us building our way out of the problem.

2110
03:03:59,312 --> 03:04:06,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the problem with relying too much on developers and investments as a city is that they're focusing on profits over our people.

2111
03:04:06,755 --> 03:04:11,097
[SPEAKER_10]: So I like this plan because it focuses on people of Medford and what we need to invest in in our community.

2112
03:04:13,178 --> 03:04:23,888
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, prior speaker also brought up the topic of disposition of public land, so I just want to go on the record to say I think public land should stay public, and if there is any disposition, should look into prioritizing it for affordable housing.

2113
03:04:23,988 --> 03:04:25,749
[SPEAKER_10]: So just thank you so much for your time.

2114
03:04:25,769 --> 03:04:26,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, everybody.

2115
03:04:29,813 --> 03:04:30,213
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2116
03:04:30,233 --> 03:04:33,176
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Derek Anderson on Zoom, then I'll come back to the podium.

2117
03:04:33,256 --> 03:04:35,037
[SPEAKER_39]: Derek, you have three minutes.

2118
03:04:35,237 --> 03:04:36,759
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2119
03:04:41,501 --> 03:04:44,482
[SPEAKER_48]: Yep, Derek Anderson here, 16 Myrtle Street, Medford.

2120
03:04:45,782 --> 03:04:48,783
[SPEAKER_48]: Apologize, it seems I can't turn my camera on.

2121
03:04:48,863 --> 03:04:51,583
[SPEAKER_48]: But yes, thank you for the time here.

2122
03:04:51,603 --> 03:05:00,885
[SPEAKER_48]: I want to express my strong support for the Prop 2.5 overrides, the dead override, the Prop 2.5, the dead override.

2123
03:05:01,486 --> 03:05:02,406
[SPEAKER_48]: It's long overdue.

2124
03:05:03,266 --> 03:05:10,448
[SPEAKER_48]: Just want to bring up a couple quick examples of how the public schools here have helped me and my kids in particular.

2125
03:05:10,708 --> 03:05:12,329
[SPEAKER_48]: I have a couple of kids in the school system.

2126
03:05:13,429 --> 03:05:21,131
[SPEAKER_48]: The teachers in the school system, I want to give a huge thank you for all that they've done for my family over the years.

2127
03:05:21,931 --> 03:05:26,433
[SPEAKER_48]: It's the teachers in the schools that are really raising the future of Medford.

2128
03:05:27,233 --> 03:05:30,717
[SPEAKER_48]: and what it is going to be to be in Medford for the long term.

2129
03:05:31,098 --> 03:05:34,401
[SPEAKER_48]: And our specialists in those schools are also huge.

2130
03:05:34,481 --> 03:05:36,524
[SPEAKER_48]: My kids have benefited immensely.

2131
03:05:36,984 --> 03:05:46,074
[SPEAKER_48]: When my kids express an interest in music, we have an all-strings program that they've been able to take advantage of, which allows them to see that you put in hard work,

2132
03:05:46,895 --> 03:05:54,059
[SPEAKER_48]: and you follow the instructions of a teacher and you go through a program and you start to see the benefits of seeing your skills grow.

2133
03:05:54,540 --> 03:05:59,523
[SPEAKER_48]: That builds their confidence that pays off also in school and will pay off in every other way in their life.

2134
03:06:00,203 --> 03:06:08,728
[SPEAKER_48]: When my kids struggle to pronounce their letters, we have speech therapists that help them with that so that they're more confident talking with their peers, talking in public.

2135
03:06:09,328 --> 03:06:11,690
[SPEAKER_48]: Those are again benefits that will help them throughout their lives.

2136
03:06:11,750 --> 03:06:14,311
[SPEAKER_48]: These are things that help Medford that go way beyond

2137
03:06:16,070 --> 03:06:18,854
[SPEAKER_48]: just STEM, and I say that as an engineer.

2138
03:06:19,856 --> 03:06:21,078
[SPEAKER_48]: We do a lot with STEM.

2139
03:06:21,478 --> 03:06:26,646
[SPEAKER_48]: We also need all those other programs to support this and provide a well-rounded education for our kids.

2140
03:06:27,614 --> 03:06:36,717
[SPEAKER_48]: At this point, we're at a place where we are losing even the most basic, we're facing losing even the most basic services in addition to all those other programs.

2141
03:06:37,017 --> 03:06:39,158
[SPEAKER_48]: So I am fully supportive of this.

2142
03:06:39,718 --> 03:06:43,400
[SPEAKER_48]: And I want to say thank you to everybody involved in getting this on the ballot.

2143
03:06:43,860 --> 03:06:44,820
[SPEAKER_48]: Let us vote for this.

2144
03:06:45,641 --> 03:06:46,221
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you very much.

2145
03:06:46,241 --> 03:06:53,864
[SPEAKER_39]: Go to the podium, name and address the record, please.

2146
03:06:53,884 --> 03:06:54,564
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2147
03:06:55,063 --> 03:06:56,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Beth Facitelli.

2148
03:06:56,804 --> 03:06:58,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 39 Carolina Street.

2149
03:06:59,505 --> 03:07:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in support of the proposal that the mayor put forth this evening.

2150
03:07:04,748 --> 03:07:14,973
[SPEAKER_04]: First, as a homeowner, my husband and I bought a single family home in Medford three years ago and really stretched ourselves to afford a home so that we could stay in Medford.

2151
03:07:15,593 --> 03:07:19,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are willing to stretch ourselves more to cover the $40 a month for the override.

2152
03:07:25,119 --> 03:07:30,844
[SPEAKER_04]: As a mother, I have two children, one of whom will enter kindergarten next year.

2153
03:07:31,544 --> 03:07:48,338
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one is in private school this year, because last year we felt he was in public school in second grade, and he had needs that we felt were not being resourced, and we were watching his mental health decline as a result.

2154
03:07:50,106 --> 03:08:01,171
[SPEAKER_04]: We barely could stretch ourselves for the private school education and I personally had a lot of shame in making a decision to send my child to a private school when I believe so strongly in public education.

2155
03:08:01,191 --> 03:08:10,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that this override will help to support and pay for some of the resources that my son needed and was not able to get.

2156
03:08:12,289 --> 03:08:28,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a cyclist cycle around the city I cycle around neighboring cities today I cycled down to UMass Boston and back, and for almost the entire way on main city streets, there were bike lanes, except in Medford.

2157
03:08:29,381 --> 03:08:36,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I live in East Medford and Riverside is a very dangerous road to cycle on.

2158
03:08:37,307 --> 03:08:50,617
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, my daughter goes to preschool over in West Medford and I have to say I drive through West Medford and I get angry because of West Medford's wide streets and pristine sidewalks and trees.

2159
03:08:51,718 --> 03:08:53,880
[SPEAKER_04]: But East Medford doesn't have those things.

2160
03:08:54,501 --> 03:09:11,577
[SPEAKER_04]: We need the money that this override is going to provide in order to make all parts of Medford, irrespective of the economic socioeconomic status of the people who live there as beautiful and livable as they are in West Medford.

2161
03:09:13,779 --> 03:09:24,727
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, my understanding of the process tonight is that the council is simply voting to put these overrides on the ballot.

2162
03:09:26,761 --> 03:09:33,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And that you're holding this vote tonight because administratively you need to do so as soon as possible to get this on the ballot.

2163
03:09:35,391 --> 03:09:37,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I am also a conflict resolution practitioner.

2164
03:09:37,774 --> 03:09:44,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of the criticisms that I was hearing tonight were based on disgruntled men with process.

2165
03:09:45,943 --> 03:10:05,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would say to those who have questions and who are not happy about the process so far, that there are four months to educate the public on what these overrides are going to do, and how the money will be used and I encourage the city council to please have public hearings, have those experts to come in and

2166
03:10:06,349 --> 03:10:08,531
[SPEAKER_04]: and answer people's questions.

2167
03:10:08,931 --> 03:10:16,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Be as transparent as possible so that, yes, we can come together as a community and vote for this proposal.

2168
03:10:17,018 --> 03:10:17,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2169
03:10:17,779 --> 03:10:18,119
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2170
03:10:18,159 --> 03:10:22,563
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm going to go to the podium.

2171
03:10:22,583 --> 03:10:23,583
[SPEAKER_40]: Name and address, please.

2172
03:10:24,324 --> 03:10:26,626
[SPEAKER_55]: Rebecca Davidson, 101 Yeoman's Ave.

2173
03:10:27,687 --> 03:10:31,970
[SPEAKER_55]: And I just want to thank you all for all of your efforts in this regard.

2174
03:10:32,010 --> 03:10:35,173
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm speaking to voice my full support of these resolutions that

2175
03:10:35,549 --> 03:10:37,189
[SPEAKER_55]: seek to increase our city's budget.

2176
03:10:37,950 --> 03:10:44,191
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm also a mom of one student in the Medford public school system and of a future student in the Medford public schools.

2177
03:10:44,832 --> 03:10:52,514
[SPEAKER_55]: Not that I think it should have any impact on the weight of my opinion as a resident, but because it's often mentioned, I was raised in Medford.

2178
03:10:52,634 --> 03:10:56,115
[SPEAKER_55]: My parents and family live in Medford and I own a home in Medford as well.

2179
03:10:56,615 --> 03:11:01,336
[SPEAKER_55]: My roots are here and my hope is to remain in this great community and the place that I call home.

2180
03:11:02,008 --> 03:11:09,833
[SPEAKER_55]: but for far too long, we have not had a budget that is able to sufficiently cover the expenses that we need to adequately maintain this great city.

2181
03:11:10,474 --> 03:11:12,375
[SPEAKER_55]: We see the impacts of this every day.

2182
03:11:12,575 --> 03:11:16,237
[SPEAKER_55]: The condition of the streets is enough to show the impacts of this shortfall.

2183
03:11:17,058 --> 03:11:24,323
[SPEAKER_55]: I was very alarmed to learn about the school budget shortfall and the impacts that it would have on a thriving and sustained Medford public school system.

2184
03:11:24,943 --> 03:11:30,767
[SPEAKER_55]: The school committee meeting that I went to led me to realize that we truly were and are in last resort circumstances.

2185
03:11:31,505 --> 03:11:40,128
[SPEAKER_55]: I understand that these measures will increase my taxes, but I believe that the approximately $40 a month is absolutely a worthwhile expenditure.

2186
03:11:40,908 --> 03:11:45,810
[SPEAKER_55]: As it's been mentioned, it will cost us so much more in the longterm if we do not do this.

2187
03:11:46,450 --> 03:11:52,672
[SPEAKER_55]: With additional investment, we can not only address deferred maintenance, but also be more prepared for the years to come.

2188
03:11:52,972 --> 03:12:00,315
[SPEAKER_55]: We can have more accessible roads, cleaner water, more beautiful open space, and a thriving school system that provides adequate pay

2189
03:12:00,711 --> 03:12:04,254
[SPEAKER_55]: for our hardworking teachers, paraprofessionals, nurses, and staff.

2190
03:12:04,855 --> 03:12:15,704
[SPEAKER_55]: And I'm thrilled to have an opportunity to vote on this and have a say in our future, because this isn't just for the future of my children, but for the children of this whole city and for our community as a whole.

2191
03:12:16,044 --> 03:12:16,445
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2192
03:12:17,306 --> 03:12:17,766
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2193
03:12:17,786 --> 03:12:26,474
[SPEAKER_39]: And I would ask if you're going to have private conversations in the chamber, please take private conversations out into the rotunda so we don't disrupt people and so we can hear everyone equally.

2194
03:12:26,534 --> 03:12:26,814
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2195
03:12:28,885 --> 03:12:29,706
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2196
03:12:29,726 --> 03:12:30,366
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2197
03:12:30,866 --> 03:12:31,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark Davidson.

2198
03:12:32,047 --> 03:12:36,350
[SPEAKER_13]: I live at 63 West street in the Hillside neighborhood.

2199
03:12:36,791 --> 03:12:41,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate all your efforts here, including the mayor's school committee.

2200
03:12:42,555 --> 03:12:52,442
[SPEAKER_13]: And I fully endorse this resolution before you and actively support and vote for the, the override in the, in November.

2201
03:12:53,030 --> 03:13:03,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I look at this as an investment in my kids' future, my grandkids, both of them in moving along in the public school system.

2202
03:13:03,979 --> 03:13:10,845
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this is an investment that I'm willing to make for our future and for all of our kids.

2203
03:13:11,466 --> 03:13:11,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2204
03:13:12,367 --> 03:13:12,807
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2205
03:13:15,229 --> 03:13:17,791
[SPEAKER_39]: Staying at the podium, we'll go to school committee member Aaron Olapade.

2206
03:13:17,831 --> 03:13:18,852
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2207
03:13:18,872 --> 03:13:19,553
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2208
03:13:20,015 --> 03:13:22,796
[SPEAKER_41]: Aaron Olapade, 105 Brooke Street, Medford.

2209
03:13:23,236 --> 03:13:24,296
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you all for having me.

2210
03:13:24,836 --> 03:13:27,737
[SPEAKER_41]: Council President and City Council, thank you and good evening.

2211
03:13:28,237 --> 03:13:36,379
[SPEAKER_41]: As we stand at the crossroads of tradition and progress, we as a community are called upon to make a decision that will shape the future of our city and the generations for which we hope to ensure that future.

2212
03:13:36,979 --> 03:13:42,761
[SPEAKER_41]: I speak to you today, not just as an elected official of the Medford School Committee, but more importantly, as a member of this great community we call home.

2213
03:13:43,561 --> 03:13:53,185
[SPEAKER_41]: We all understand that our city is more than just a collection of streets and buildings, is a living, breathing, vibrant community that is a testament to our shared values and the spirit that we as Medfordites embody.

2214
03:13:53,885 --> 03:13:57,387
[SPEAKER_41]: We are facing challenges today that are not new, nor are they easily fixable.

2215
03:13:57,907 --> 03:14:07,110
[SPEAKER_41]: Our schools are struggling to provide the quality education our students deserve, our road and building restoration efforts are hindered, and our essential services are limited in ways that create a sense of concern.

2216
03:14:08,011 --> 03:14:13,173
[SPEAKER_41]: These are not abstract issues, they are real, and they affect each of us in ways that may not be discernible on the surface.

2217
03:14:14,616 --> 03:14:21,861
[SPEAKER_41]: To address these challenges, we must bridge the social and ideological gap and make a collective investment in our future, investment being the operative word.

2218
03:14:22,481 --> 03:14:26,164
[SPEAKER_41]: This is why I'm speaking in favor of the 2.5 prop increase and its current wording.

2219
03:14:26,184 --> 03:14:35,991
[SPEAKER_41]: I understand that the word tax often carries a heavy burden for many, and it's natural to be concerned or fearful about the financial impact to oneself, one's family, and one's assets.

2220
03:14:36,451 --> 03:14:39,373
[SPEAKER_41]: But I ask us to all consider what this increase could mean for our community.

2221
03:14:40,322 --> 03:14:53,314
[SPEAKER_41]: It represents our commitment to ensuring that every child in our city has access to top-notch equitable education, our dedication to maintaining our municipal buildings and grounds, and providing aid to our civil service workers and the associate personnel with the resources they need to operate.

2222
03:14:54,155 --> 03:14:58,519
[SPEAKER_41]: A 2.5 increase in property taxes is not just a financial decision, it's a moral one.

2223
03:14:59,180 --> 03:15:01,322
[SPEAKER_41]: It's a testament to our willingness to support one another,

2224
03:15:01,721 --> 03:15:04,883
[SPEAKER_41]: to lift each other up in times of need and to invest in the common good.

2225
03:15:05,444 --> 03:15:12,348
[SPEAKER_41]: This increase will enable us to fund critical infrastructure projects, support local businesses, and create programs that uplift the most vulnerable among us.

2226
03:15:13,289 --> 03:15:16,671
[SPEAKER_41]: We must remember that a city is only as strong as the bonds that unite its people.

2227
03:15:17,172 --> 03:15:22,235
[SPEAKER_41]: By supporting this tax increase, we are saying that we believe in our city, its people, and ultimately its potential.

2228
03:15:22,875 --> 03:15:26,018
[SPEAKER_41]: We are affirming that we care deeply about our neighbors, our children, and our future.

2229
03:15:26,803 --> 03:15:28,383
[SPEAKER_41]: This is a pivotal moment for all of us.

2230
03:15:28,803 --> 03:15:34,564
[SPEAKER_41]: Let us choose to be a community that rises to the occasion, that understands the value of solidarity and shared responsibility.

2231
03:15:35,104 --> 03:15:40,185
[SPEAKER_41]: Let us be a community that does not shy away from challenges, but faces them head on with courage and compassion.

2232
03:15:40,845 --> 03:15:49,307
[SPEAKER_41]: Together, we can ensure that our city remains a place where our youth can be nurtured, our families supported, our kinships acknowledged, and the opportunities available are limitless.

2233
03:15:49,927 --> 03:15:56,328
[SPEAKER_41]: I ask you to join me in supporting this investment, not just as a financial necessity, but as a statement that our commitment to Medford is rekindled.

2234
03:15:56,650 --> 03:15:56,952
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

2235
03:15:58,258 --> 03:15:58,499
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2236
03:16:03,171 --> 03:16:04,152
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

2237
03:16:04,172 --> 03:16:04,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2238
03:16:04,892 --> 03:16:06,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Jean Nuzzo, Paris Street.

2239
03:16:07,794 --> 03:16:10,775
[SPEAKER_08]: A good portion of Medford isn't a middle-class city at all.

2240
03:16:10,835 --> 03:16:14,377
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a working-class city, and historically comprised of immigrants.

2241
03:16:15,318 --> 03:16:20,281
[SPEAKER_08]: More than 40% of our residents that live in Medford live below the poverty line.

2242
03:16:21,021 --> 03:16:22,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Many work two to three jobs.

2243
03:16:23,263 --> 03:16:28,866
[SPEAKER_08]: And most homeowners, they're just renting for the bank, and they only get 90 days before their eviction.

2244
03:16:29,998 --> 03:16:37,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally have worked in construction and development for over three decades and managed budgets in excess of $1 billion.

2245
03:16:37,990 --> 03:16:38,972
[SPEAKER_08]: That's billion with a B.

2246
03:16:40,137 --> 03:16:50,646
[SPEAKER_08]: New development isn't going to meaningfully contribute to our cash flow when this city doesn't properly and timely capture its LA-13 and LA-15 new growth.

2247
03:16:51,587 --> 03:17:02,356
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you who don't know, the mass LA-13 and 15 new growth forms allows us to capture new construction and major renovations outside of the 2.5 cap you're talking about tonight.

2248
03:17:03,277 --> 03:17:10,587
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important that newly renovated parcels are assessed at 15% of their market value, and 30% when the paperwork catches up.

2249
03:17:11,268 --> 03:17:18,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a significant quantity of product properties and a good deal of money that's left on the table that you're asking us to make up for.

2250
03:17:19,418 --> 03:17:20,158
[SPEAKER_08]: It's inequitable.

2251
03:17:20,819 --> 03:17:23,980
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't properly capture land values on condo conversions.

2252
03:17:24,421 --> 03:17:30,684
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't properly levy permitting fees based on current market values for construction projects.

2253
03:17:31,124 --> 03:17:34,506
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't properly stack our grants for maximum value and impact.

2254
03:17:35,006 --> 03:17:38,288
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just scraping the surface of our mismanagement.

2255
03:17:39,138 --> 03:17:39,779
[SPEAKER_08]: through the chair.

2256
03:17:40,339 --> 03:17:50,809
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you that think these examples aren't enough to consider and address first, and unequivocally believe that we still need these exclusions and overrides, I have good news for you.

2257
03:17:51,009 --> 03:17:55,213
[SPEAKER_08]: The 2.5 cap isn't a parcel level cap, it's a municipal level cap.

2258
03:17:55,614 --> 03:17:56,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So lead by example.

2259
03:17:57,015 --> 03:18:01,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Reach out to our assessor's office and ask them to have your home reassessed to market value.

2260
03:18:01,639 --> 03:18:03,501
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a near immediate impact.

2261
03:18:04,002 --> 03:18:04,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2262
03:18:06,155 --> 03:18:06,615
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2263
03:18:07,156 --> 03:18:08,536
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2264
03:18:08,576 --> 03:18:10,037
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2265
03:18:10,757 --> 03:18:13,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Harrison Green to Ronaleigh Road.

2266
03:18:14,439 --> 03:18:19,322
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to take the opportunity to congratulate the students of Medford who graduated this year.

2267
03:18:19,842 --> 03:18:28,287
[SPEAKER_14]: My hope for the class of 2024 is that they are not able to say they are lucky they graduated when they did.

2268
03:18:29,485 --> 03:18:34,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Their younger peers deserve the opportunities that those seniors had access to.

2269
03:18:34,950 --> 03:18:37,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Funding for schools should not be a political punching bag.

2270
03:18:37,813 --> 03:18:45,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Concerns and analysis of financial waste and missteps should occur, but our students deserve better than being put in the middle of it.

2271
03:18:46,340 --> 03:18:55,268
[SPEAKER_14]: And the suggestion of using free cash as a substitute for a long-term solution sounds exactly like the kind of idea that got the city in this situation.

2272
03:18:56,088 --> 03:18:56,809
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I support

2273
03:18:57,349 --> 03:19:01,372
[SPEAKER_14]: the mayor's proposal to put proposition two and a half overrides on the ballot in November.

2274
03:19:01,772 --> 03:19:04,855
[SPEAKER_14]: If voted in, it will solidify our city's immediate financial future.

2275
03:19:05,295 --> 03:19:05,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2276
03:19:06,876 --> 03:19:07,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2277
03:19:07,317 --> 03:19:10,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record please.

2278
03:19:10,879 --> 03:19:11,480
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2279
03:19:12,503 --> 03:19:16,285
[SPEAKER_35]: David McKenna to Vine Street, also coming from East Medford near the Roberts.

2280
03:19:16,365 --> 03:19:19,147
[SPEAKER_35]: So shout out to my fellow East Medford folks.

2281
03:19:22,408 --> 03:19:24,169
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm here to speak in support.

2282
03:19:24,329 --> 03:19:33,154
[SPEAKER_35]: And in fact, I will canvas in support this fall of these proposed tax increases to help educate my neighbors about what this means for them.

2283
03:19:33,734 --> 03:19:35,395
[SPEAKER_35]: So first I had to educate myself.

2284
03:19:35,455 --> 03:19:40,358
[SPEAKER_35]: So I put my home assessed value in the calculator and we've heard the number $40 a lot, $40 a month.

2285
03:19:42,219 --> 03:19:46,842
[SPEAKER_35]: but that's the average single family home and the average resident of Medford does not live in a single family home.

2286
03:19:47,483 --> 03:19:49,904
[SPEAKER_35]: My single family home, it'll be $32 a month.

2287
03:19:52,266 --> 03:20:02,212
[SPEAKER_35]: Triple-decker, I was looking up a couple of triple-deckers in South Medford that are owned by landlords who oppose this, and that would be $15 a month for those folks living in a triple-decker.

2288
03:20:02,252 --> 03:20:03,813
[SPEAKER_35]: So I do think that we can afford this.

2289
03:20:03,873 --> 03:20:10,578
[SPEAKER_35]: I know we're a working class city, but I think that $15 a month, if we pool our resources together, we can do,

2290
03:20:12,779 --> 03:20:13,860
[SPEAKER_35]: Great things for our schools.

2291
03:20:15,021 --> 03:20:27,490
[SPEAKER_35]: Those great things you know earlier it was called vague what are we going to do for our schools but I also attended the school committee budget hearing for several hours and learned the details of what we're going to do and I was horrified that we were going to cut for school nurses.

2292
03:20:27,930 --> 03:20:29,531
[SPEAKER_35]: My mom was a school nurse for 20 years.

2293
03:20:31,073 --> 03:20:34,275
[SPEAKER_35]: We were gonna increase class sizes in our elementary school.

2294
03:20:34,756 --> 03:20:38,238
[SPEAKER_35]: We were gonna cut routine maintenance to our school buildings.

2295
03:20:38,679 --> 03:20:45,665
[SPEAKER_35]: These are the kinds of things that we can invest in if we pool our resources, whether it's $10 a month, $15 a month, $32 a month.

2296
03:20:46,726 --> 03:20:49,848
[SPEAKER_35]: And for the folks in West Medford in the single family, maybe it'll be $40 a month.

2297
03:20:55,851 --> 03:21:06,523
[SPEAKER_35]: I also want to urge the council and the mayor to not listen to the concern trolling, where someone raises a concern on behalf of someone else they say well it's it'll be hard for someone else.

2298
03:21:06,983 --> 03:21:12,429
[SPEAKER_35]: You know the landlords raises on behalf of their tenants they say well it'll be hard and maybe I'll have to raise the rent and maybe it'll.

2299
03:21:13,089 --> 03:21:13,850
[SPEAKER_35]: hurt the tenants.

2300
03:21:14,950 --> 03:21:16,171
[SPEAKER_35]: Again, $15 a month.

2301
03:21:16,731 --> 03:21:22,115
[SPEAKER_35]: So don't listen to people raising these concerns on behalf of this mythical, you know, somebody else.

2302
03:21:23,195 --> 03:21:24,076
[SPEAKER_35]: We can afford this.

2303
03:21:24,676 --> 03:21:26,757
[SPEAKER_35]: We've known about this problem for the past two years.

2304
03:21:27,778 --> 03:21:31,060
[SPEAKER_35]: Every elected official in the city has known about this problem for the past two years.

2305
03:21:32,161 --> 03:21:36,163
[SPEAKER_35]: Some elected officials have chosen to put together a plan to address it.

2306
03:21:37,064 --> 03:21:38,124
[SPEAKER_35]: Some elected officials

2307
03:21:39,145 --> 03:21:47,691
[SPEAKER_35]: have done nothing for the past two years, and now they wanna raise these concerns about process or whatever, but haven't put forth a single alternative proposal.

2308
03:21:47,751 --> 03:21:48,932
[SPEAKER_35]: So this is what we've got.

2309
03:21:49,133 --> 03:21:50,053
[SPEAKER_35]: I fully support it.

2310
03:21:50,113 --> 03:21:51,134
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna canvas for it.

2311
03:21:51,154 --> 03:21:55,377
[SPEAKER_35]: I thank you all for your hard work, and shout out to East Medford.

2312
03:21:58,099 --> 03:21:58,680
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2313
03:21:58,700 --> 03:22:03,003
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2314
03:22:03,043 --> 03:22:07,086
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes, but I'm gonna give it to you starting now, because I'm still scared.

2315
03:22:07,628 --> 03:22:16,474
[SPEAKER_24]: Nicole Morell 21 Ronald Lee Road and I know it's been done, but I want to do it to former member of this August body.

2316
03:22:18,895 --> 03:22:19,816
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to thank everyone.

2317
03:22:19,836 --> 03:22:20,677
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to thank the mayor.

2318
03:22:20,697 --> 03:22:22,718
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to thank the city council for bringing this forward tonight.

2319
03:22:23,598 --> 03:22:27,420
[SPEAKER_24]: It's something people feel strongly about and they should on both sides.

2320
03:22:28,041 --> 03:22:37,006
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know on the council and school committee in past years where there's been issues that people feel really passionate about people have said, put this to a popular vote, put this to a popular vote.

2321
03:22:37,506 --> 03:22:39,187
[SPEAKER_24]: This has a mechanism to do that.

2322
03:22:39,547 --> 03:22:45,190
[SPEAKER_24]: This is putting this to the people and I thank you so much for bringing this forward to let the residents of Medford decide.

2323
03:22:45,750 --> 03:23:13,164
[SPEAKER_24]: if we want to keep doing our budgets year after year of tough decisions, of just getting by, of doing more with less, or if we want to do, I don't even want to say more with more, more with enough, more with a good start, where we can do a little bit more for our roads, be able to envision a future of Medford Public Schools and our community where budgets are not based in crisis and cuts, but envision and doing more for our students and for our community.

2324
03:23:13,384 --> 03:23:14,285
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you.

2325
03:23:16,377 --> 03:23:17,318
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Madam President.

2326
03:23:17,338 --> 03:23:21,844
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2327
03:23:21,865 --> 03:23:22,565
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2328
03:23:23,527 --> 03:23:25,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Lori Spinney-Flagg, Garfield Avenue.

2329
03:23:26,331 --> 03:23:28,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of issues that I'd like to discuss.

2330
03:23:29,074 --> 03:23:32,179
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I've heard tonight a lot of information.

2331
03:23:33,962 --> 03:23:48,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody answered the question of how many property owners, and I believe you said 12,000 out of 50,000 people over in Medford are going to take on this burden?

2332
03:23:51,370 --> 03:23:53,431
[SPEAKER_39]: That's just how many properties there are.

2333
03:23:54,151 --> 03:24:00,594
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the taxpayers who are going to be posed with this increase.

2334
03:24:01,158 --> 03:24:26,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to say that I'm against increasing the schools and whatnot, which for me to say that is a big deal, seeing that I have a disabled child, this child with disabilities, in which the Medford public school system sued me and my family and minute man a number of years ago, and it cost me his entire college fund.

2335
03:24:27,594 --> 03:24:30,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that's all I'll have to say about that.

2336
03:24:30,396 --> 03:24:33,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have two siblings who are teachers.

2337
03:24:33,818 --> 03:24:36,939
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not against teachers or the school system.

2338
03:24:37,480 --> 03:24:41,762
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have lived in this city for 61 years, born and raised here.

2339
03:24:42,502 --> 03:24:48,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched my mother seven years ago, live for 58 years off Riverside Avenue.

2340
03:24:49,386 --> 03:24:51,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And when my father died 20 years earlier,

2341
03:24:52,688 --> 03:24:56,429
[SPEAKER_01]: the money started to run out and run out and run out.

2342
03:24:56,909 --> 03:25:05,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she took sick and we found out that she couldn't afford the house anymore that she had lived in for 58 years here in Medford.

2343
03:25:06,353 --> 03:25:17,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've listened to all what you were saying, but what I don't hear is what businesses you're bringing in to up the revenue in Medford.

2344
03:25:17,977 --> 03:25:21,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole point of a lot of these people here tonight,

2345
03:25:22,125 --> 03:25:41,577
[SPEAKER_01]: is because we've all just learned that there is a proposal to put a walk-in methadone clinic at 360 Salem Street in a residential area two blocks from a grade school as we sit here and talk about building up the school systems.

2346
03:25:42,377 --> 03:25:46,920
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're gonna put a walk-in methadone clinic two blocks from a grade school?

2347
03:25:48,126 --> 03:26:00,231
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you firsthand that I know of at least a dozen children, even adults now, that have disabilities in that generalized area.

2348
03:26:01,171 --> 03:26:05,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen no buildup of Salem Street in my entire lifetime.

2349
03:26:06,413 --> 03:26:10,755
[SPEAKER_01]: The only person that ever tried to do that was Mr. Convery.

2350
03:26:14,126 --> 03:26:15,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what this city is doing.

2351
03:26:16,128 --> 03:26:17,890
[SPEAKER_01]: My taxes have tripled.

2352
03:26:18,310 --> 03:26:26,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I've owned my house for 27 years, and now I'm looking at more increased taxes for less services.

2353
03:26:28,098 --> 03:26:29,540
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't understand it.

2354
03:26:30,600 --> 03:26:46,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't approve of it, and I think that the city needs to do better about bringing in companies that will bring revenue into this city instead of giving all your permits to non-profits who pay no taxes in this city.

2355
03:26:46,966 --> 03:26:50,807
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a college that does nothing for the city of Medford.

2356
03:26:51,807 --> 03:26:53,108
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't pay taxes.

2357
03:26:53,488 --> 03:26:54,548
[SPEAKER_39]: We're over time, thank you.

2358
03:26:54,668 --> 03:26:58,970
[SPEAKER_39]: I can say a couple things on development and on Tufts University.

2359
03:27:00,785 --> 03:27:05,069
[SPEAKER_39]: We don't have the authority to stop Tufts University in many ways from doing what they do.

2360
03:27:05,109 --> 03:27:09,192
[SPEAKER_39]: They have exemptions that they, quite frankly, bought and paid for under the state law.

2361
03:27:13,356 --> 03:27:14,337
[SPEAKER_39]: Which one, sorry?

2362
03:27:17,780 --> 03:27:21,163
[SPEAKER_39]: The church, the church purchased that building.

2363
03:27:22,904 --> 03:27:25,567
[SPEAKER_39]: That's Vida Real is a church, so they purchased the building.

2364
03:27:37,611 --> 03:27:42,573
[SPEAKER_39]: We are working very hard on commercial and economic development.

2365
03:27:46,495 --> 03:27:47,676
[SPEAKER_39]: It is for profit, I believe.

2366
03:27:50,037 --> 03:27:50,357
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2367
03:27:50,477 --> 03:27:53,018
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to have to move us on to another speaker.

2368
03:27:53,278 --> 03:27:54,479
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2369
03:27:54,499 --> 03:27:55,499
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2370
03:27:55,639 --> 03:27:56,060
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2371
03:27:58,101 --> 03:28:01,202
[SPEAKER_39]: That actually used to be nonprofit and is now for profit and is taxed.

2372
03:28:01,782 --> 03:28:02,963
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2373
03:28:06,871 --> 03:28:07,852
[SPEAKER_57]: My name is Bree Brothers.

2374
03:28:08,352 --> 03:28:11,295
[SPEAKER_57]: I live on Gleason Street in Medford.

2375
03:28:12,395 --> 03:28:14,577
[SPEAKER_57]: And I have two children.

2376
03:28:14,597 --> 03:28:17,099
[SPEAKER_57]: I have a six-year-old and a two-year-old.

2377
03:28:17,559 --> 03:28:34,471
[SPEAKER_57]: And I just want to say, like, yes, it doesn't feel great that the idea of giving up $40 a month for children for the future of Medford, like sure, that in and of itself doesn't feel great.

2378
03:28:34,878 --> 03:28:41,700
[SPEAKER_57]: But it sucks more that you don't want others in your community to vote on it.

2379
03:28:43,121 --> 03:28:53,104
[SPEAKER_57]: It doesn't really make me feel like my children are part of this community that everyone is always not wanting to divide all of the time.

2380
03:28:53,984 --> 03:28:57,145
[SPEAKER_57]: It doesn't make me feel like their teachers matter in this community.

2381
03:28:59,133 --> 03:29:18,219
[SPEAKER_57]: And for those who constantly spew about the division and this progressive council and whatever, how I don't understand how we think keeping something out of the hands of the community, out of the vote of this community, I don't see how you think that won't create more division in our community.

2382
03:29:18,980 --> 03:29:25,462
[SPEAKER_57]: We'd want to obstruct the vote of the people in your community in the name of not dividing the community, I guess.

2383
03:29:26,809 --> 03:29:41,497
[SPEAKER_57]: And yes, as someone else pointed out, I was on the Columbus Renaming Committee, and the number of times people wanted to take it to a vote, even though that's not the process and falls within the jurisdiction of the school committee, they wanted to take it to a vote because they didn't like it.

2384
03:29:42,378 --> 03:29:45,640
[SPEAKER_57]: And now that it's actually coming to a vote, they still don't like it.

2385
03:29:46,020 --> 03:29:47,160
[SPEAKER_57]: So I don't know.

2386
03:29:47,341 --> 03:29:48,982
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't think it's about transparency.

2387
03:29:49,382 --> 03:29:53,224
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't really think it could be more transparent, honestly.

2388
03:29:54,622 --> 03:29:56,263
[SPEAKER_57]: Lastly, I'm all for new growth.

2389
03:29:56,503 --> 03:29:57,804
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm all for bringing in revenue.

2390
03:29:58,545 --> 03:29:59,926
[SPEAKER_57]: I want to see all that new growth.

2391
03:30:01,707 --> 03:30:01,947
[SPEAKER_57]: I do.

2392
03:30:02,027 --> 03:30:02,687
[SPEAKER_57]: I live here, too.

2393
03:30:02,948 --> 03:30:03,988
[SPEAKER_57]: But we can do both.

2394
03:30:05,149 --> 03:30:05,850
[SPEAKER_57]: And we need both.

2395
03:30:06,650 --> 03:30:11,693
[SPEAKER_57]: And quite frankly, my children don't have time to wait for all of this new growth.

2396
03:30:12,694 --> 03:30:15,776
[SPEAKER_57]: And they don't have time to pay for the decades of mismanagement.

2397
03:30:16,517 --> 03:30:18,558
[SPEAKER_57]: And frankly, they shouldn't have to.

2398
03:30:19,279 --> 03:30:20,279
[SPEAKER_57]: None of these issues are new.

2399
03:30:20,840 --> 03:30:22,841
[SPEAKER_57]: So I look forward to canvassing.

2400
03:30:23,629 --> 03:30:32,405
[SPEAKER_57]: for these overrides and the set exclusion for my children, for the teachers of my children, and for the future of the city.

2401
03:30:32,786 --> 03:30:33,007
[SPEAKER_57]: Thanks.

2402
03:30:33,528 --> 03:30:33,868
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2403
03:30:38,425 --> 03:30:39,186
[SPEAKER_40]: and address the record.

2404
03:30:39,206 --> 03:30:39,966
[SPEAKER_40]: You have three minutes.

2405
03:30:40,187 --> 03:30:40,447
[SPEAKER_56]: Yes.

2406
03:30:40,587 --> 03:30:41,628
[SPEAKER_56]: Matthew page Lieberman.

2407
03:30:41,668 --> 03:30:42,869
[SPEAKER_56]: I have about five items.

2408
03:30:42,909 --> 03:30:44,470
[SPEAKER_56]: I think I could keep it under three minutes.

2409
03:30:45,131 --> 03:30:48,894
[SPEAKER_56]: Uh, the first is that, um, I, I just want this on the record.

2410
03:30:48,934 --> 03:30:57,100
[SPEAKER_56]: It's not to Brown knows anybody here, but I find it extremely lamentable that anybody that is elected in our city is disparaged.

2411
03:30:57,160 --> 03:31:00,223
[SPEAKER_56]: It's not being qualified or child or not prepared for anything.

2412
03:31:00,903 --> 03:31:04,827
[SPEAKER_56]: Um, I, I feel that what we're looking at right now is some of the most

2413
03:31:06,001 --> 03:31:13,633
[SPEAKER_56]: You all, I think, are some of the most professional, prepared, visionary, and really diligent about getting work.

2414
03:31:13,913 --> 03:31:17,979
[SPEAKER_56]: I really think that more of us should publicly acknowledge all the work that's being done today.

2415
03:31:21,104 --> 03:31:21,845
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you so much.

2416
03:31:22,546 --> 03:31:27,512
[SPEAKER_56]: The second thing is around 2015 I came here to speak about participatory budgeting.

2417
03:31:28,833 --> 03:31:35,021
[SPEAKER_56]: One of the things that I talked about was that it was such a shame that people were mobilized about things that they were against.

2418
03:31:35,161 --> 03:31:38,966
[SPEAKER_56]: One of the things that was concerned for a lot of people was the opiate addiction and people dying.

2419
03:31:39,426 --> 03:31:41,107
[SPEAKER_56]: There was a councillor who responded to me.

2420
03:31:41,547 --> 03:31:43,968
[SPEAKER_56]: That was councillor Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

2421
03:31:44,608 --> 03:31:45,809
[SPEAKER_56]: And, you know, we had a meeting.

2422
03:31:45,969 --> 03:31:51,191
[SPEAKER_56]: I introduced her to the budget director and the budget analyst of Cambridge who were doing participatory budgeting.

2423
03:31:51,732 --> 03:31:58,575
[SPEAKER_56]: And at that time, Brianna kind of laughed about it when, because she was the chair of a budget meeting, budget subcommittee, just did not meet.

2424
03:31:58,955 --> 03:31:59,815
[SPEAKER_56]: It was just on paper.

2425
03:31:59,875 --> 03:32:02,577
[SPEAKER_56]: Today, these committees are actually meeting, doing work every month.

2426
03:32:03,477 --> 03:32:11,009
[SPEAKER_56]: you know, after that, you know, I met with the mayor the next year and she wanted to talk about PP, but we just didn't do P participative budget because I didn't follow up with it.

2427
03:32:11,049 --> 03:32:16,517
[SPEAKER_56]: But, but the really important things is I want to talk about even back then our mayor was ready to get to work.

2428
03:32:17,138 --> 03:32:18,680
[SPEAKER_56]: Um, and today the counselors.

2429
03:32:19,802 --> 03:32:22,685
[SPEAKER_56]: is exceptionally more prepared to get to work.

2430
03:32:22,925 --> 03:32:29,913
[SPEAKER_56]: Now, there was a particular thing that I keep hearing about transparency, which is, I think, it sounds like this bad faith that there's no transparency.

2431
03:32:30,394 --> 03:32:40,084
[SPEAKER_56]: I happen to recall that I attended a school committee meeting around 2015, and there was a consultant that was contracted to about five digit

2432
03:32:41,105 --> 03:32:48,508
[SPEAKER_56]: money was paid in order so they could tell the school committee that the school system could take advantage of something that was for free.

2433
03:32:49,168 --> 03:32:55,451
[SPEAKER_56]: Something that I would have said, I would have told them and I told my previous boss eight years earlier, you can do this stuff for free.

2434
03:32:55,911 --> 03:32:58,874
[SPEAKER_56]: But that was five digit number for that.

2435
03:32:59,174 --> 03:33:07,263
[SPEAKER_56]: And the reason that I bring this up is because back then, there was a totally different school committee, totally different mayor, and totally different superintendent.

2436
03:33:07,303 --> 03:33:12,849
[SPEAKER_56]: And the budget meetings happened in the superintendent's room over at the high school where there were no cameras.

2437
03:33:13,289 --> 03:33:18,454
[SPEAKER_56]: So I really get tired of hearing there's no transparency today when I know there's more transparency today.

2438
03:33:19,975 --> 03:33:22,116
[SPEAKER_56]: I guess perhaps the last item.

2439
03:33:22,136 --> 03:33:22,917
[SPEAKER_39]: You have 30 seconds.

2440
03:33:22,957 --> 03:33:23,137
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2441
03:33:23,337 --> 03:33:23,517
[SPEAKER_56]: Okay.

2442
03:33:23,797 --> 03:33:39,505
[SPEAKER_56]: So last week or two weeks ago, I was here and I was taught, I was a little bit dismissive and I want to apologize because I was so surprised anybody because of high taxes could be looking at losing their home because nobody that anybody knows about was talking about taking the deferment.

2443
03:33:40,325 --> 03:33:46,708
[SPEAKER_56]: And so, you know, I talked to you, Councilor Bears, and you were talking about people that are on lien, so I was incorrect.

2444
03:33:46,728 --> 03:33:49,369
[SPEAKER_56]: I wanna apologize to anybody if I was dismissive about that.

2445
03:33:49,809 --> 03:33:52,191
[SPEAKER_56]: However, over the past couple of weeks, I looked into it.

2446
03:33:52,551 --> 03:33:55,092
[SPEAKER_56]: I took a look at the deferments and the exemptions.

2447
03:33:55,652 --> 03:34:07,658
[SPEAKER_56]: And to be honest, myself and other people in the housing community, we have talked about this, and we would like to get work on the state level to expand the exemptions, the deferments for people having these economic things, because there was a resident

2448
03:34:08,638 --> 03:34:08,858
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2449
03:34:08,878 --> 03:34:09,399
[SPEAKER_39]: I've let you go.

2450
03:34:09,459 --> 03:34:09,740
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2451
03:34:09,780 --> 03:34:12,664
[SPEAKER_56]: I appreciate it.

2452
03:34:12,684 --> 03:34:17,871
[SPEAKER_56]: There was a resident who was wanting to know about these services and I just want to let you know that we will be working on it.

2453
03:34:18,132 --> 03:34:18,572
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2454
03:34:22,398 --> 03:34:23,499
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2455
03:34:23,519 --> 03:34:24,260
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2456
03:34:25,496 --> 03:34:26,837
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, my name is Sarah Vallier.

2457
03:34:26,877 --> 03:34:28,738
[SPEAKER_27]: I live at 26 Garfield Avenue.

2458
03:34:29,519 --> 03:34:37,464
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think it's great that you guys are looking at adding an override to the ballot for public schools.

2459
03:34:37,664 --> 03:34:49,091
[SPEAKER_27]: However, I want to let you know, when you reflect on this meeting, and when you reflect on the voters in general, I mean, I guess the truth will come out in the polling, not everyone

2460
03:34:49,831 --> 03:34:50,752
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's a good thing.

2461
03:34:51,012 --> 03:34:52,853
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll probably vote for the override.

2462
03:34:53,013 --> 03:34:55,074
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think we should have poor public schools.

2463
03:34:55,734 --> 03:34:57,695
[SPEAKER_27]: But I actually care more about infrastructure.

2464
03:34:58,315 --> 03:35:02,297
[SPEAKER_27]: And I view I perceive it as an enormous risk item in the city's budget.

2465
03:35:03,178 --> 03:35:07,080
[SPEAKER_27]: And I don't want you to walk away thinking that everyone in this room

2466
03:35:08,590 --> 03:35:11,112
[SPEAKER_27]: is kind of a one issue voter or whatever.

2467
03:35:11,432 --> 03:35:13,013
[SPEAKER_27]: And I just wanted to emphasize that point.

2468
03:35:13,173 --> 03:35:15,154
[SPEAKER_27]: The infrastructure is extremely important.

2469
03:35:15,855 --> 03:35:20,638
[SPEAKER_27]: Sewers, roads, bridges, which I assume come out of the municipal budget.

2470
03:35:22,159 --> 03:35:26,822
[SPEAKER_27]: I think people don't realize how they could really sink the city if we weren't careful.

2471
03:35:27,442 --> 03:35:28,423
[SPEAKER_27]: So thank you very much.

2472
03:35:30,865 --> 03:35:31,185
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2473
03:35:31,205 --> 03:35:35,347
[SPEAKER_39]: And I just want to respond quickly to that comment and I appreciate bringing it up.

2474
03:35:37,096 --> 03:35:49,147
[SPEAKER_39]: Part of this is about adding staff and DPW to address kind of the problem Anna was talking about earlier, trying to keep those B, C, and D roads from getting to an F grade where it costs that huge risk amount.

2475
03:35:50,128 --> 03:35:59,917
[SPEAKER_39]: And we are also working on, the administration is working on a comprehensive assessment on the water sewer system to assess the full cost of what it would take to bring us to a state of good repair.

2476
03:36:00,297 --> 03:36:03,000
[SPEAKER_39]: And we do have some reports on roads and sidewalks as well.

2477
03:36:03,700 --> 03:36:05,021
[SPEAKER_39]: where we will have to do more work on that.

2478
03:36:05,061 --> 03:36:06,482
[SPEAKER_39]: But yeah, the infrastructure is huge.

2479
03:36:06,542 --> 03:36:15,167
[SPEAKER_39]: And one of the other huge outstanding pieces is the fire headquarters being probably one of the two biggest facilities capital needs on the infrastructure side.

2480
03:36:15,247 --> 03:36:23,652
[SPEAKER_39]: So it is definitely, this whole package is probably 70% schools, 30% infrastructure, more work to come on that.

2481
03:36:23,712 --> 03:36:24,533
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you for the comment.

2482
03:36:25,873 --> 03:36:26,634
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2483
03:36:26,834 --> 03:36:27,774
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2484
03:36:27,794 --> 03:36:28,435
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2485
03:36:29,265 --> 03:36:31,267
[SPEAKER_54]: Jennifer Sullivan, 63 Marston Street.

2486
03:36:32,468 --> 03:36:35,511
[SPEAKER_54]: I was raised in Medford, and next week I become a Medford homeowner.

2487
03:36:40,174 --> 03:36:48,622
[SPEAKER_54]: It's been an incredibly scary process, but I'm really reassured that so many others also believe in this city's potential and want to invest in a better Medford for all of us.

2488
03:36:49,502 --> 03:36:51,424
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you for trusting residents to make that decision.

2489
03:36:52,505 --> 03:36:52,865
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2490
03:36:52,885 --> 03:36:56,348
[SPEAKER_40]: Name and address for the record, please.

2491
03:36:56,368 --> 03:36:57,149
[SPEAKER_40]: You have three minutes.

2492
03:36:57,731 --> 03:37:00,612
[SPEAKER_62]: My name is David Haynes, and I live on Canal Street.

2493
03:37:02,233 --> 03:37:04,093
[SPEAKER_62]: I want to look at this from a different perspective.

2494
03:37:05,654 --> 03:37:07,174
[SPEAKER_62]: We have the richest country in the world.

2495
03:37:07,774 --> 03:37:18,338
[SPEAKER_62]: And I think that what we're doing here with education and many other aspects of our public side is that we are funding it from a local perspective instead of a national perspective.

2496
03:37:18,858 --> 03:37:24,660
[SPEAKER_62]: There are a lot of things that municipal governments do that really should be done on a national level.

2497
03:37:25,560 --> 03:37:26,621
[SPEAKER_62]: We cannot compete.

2498
03:37:27,731 --> 03:37:40,263
[SPEAKER_62]: with Wellesley and other rich municipalities, but we could if the money came from the federal government instead of from the wealthy people in Wellesley and the poor people in Method.

2499
03:37:41,744 --> 03:37:49,251
[SPEAKER_62]: So I don't expect this to happen, but I would like to see the people from the lower levels of government

2500
03:37:50,691 --> 03:38:05,954
[SPEAKER_62]: petitioning to the people in the higher levels of government, state and federal, to say, you have to take on more of the responsibility so that we can have what we were raised to believe we had, which is a land of opportunity, and equal opportunity at that.

2501
03:38:06,774 --> 03:38:18,837
[SPEAKER_62]: No poor person living in a middle class community can compete with the wealth of the rich in these luxurious towns.

2502
03:38:20,191 --> 03:38:30,263
[SPEAKER_62]: And even there, people take their kids out of the public school to send them to a $50,000 a year private school because they can afford it.

2503
03:38:30,803 --> 03:38:32,966
[SPEAKER_62]: That certainly is not equal opportunity.

2504
03:38:33,426 --> 03:38:39,012
[SPEAKER_62]: I want every child in America to have the same kind of educational opportunity.

2505
03:38:39,733 --> 03:38:41,494
[SPEAKER_62]: that every rich kid gets.

2506
03:38:42,055 --> 03:38:53,402
[SPEAKER_62]: We're not getting there in dribs and drabs in 10,000 different communities across the country where this conversation has been going on since before the American Revolution.

2507
03:38:53,882 --> 03:38:54,523
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you very much.

2508
03:38:55,143 --> 03:38:55,623
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2509
03:38:55,644 --> 03:39:00,126
[SPEAKER_39]: And I will say, I just want to thank you for the comment.

2510
03:39:00,587 --> 03:39:08,132
[SPEAKER_39]: And one thing this council has been doing is at the very least asking our state government to give cities and towns more authority or to take a bigger role when they

2511
03:39:09,133 --> 03:39:11,214
[SPEAKER_39]: with the power that they have.

2512
03:39:12,495 --> 03:39:14,236
[SPEAKER_39]: And we have three on Zoom.

2513
03:39:14,276 --> 03:39:17,859
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm gonna go to Mr. Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi on Zoom.

2514
03:39:18,079 --> 03:39:19,379
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2515
03:39:19,399 --> 03:39:21,060
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2516
03:39:22,822 --> 03:39:24,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

2517
03:39:26,104 --> 03:39:29,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Andrew Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi of East Ford, Massachusetts.

2518
03:39:30,386 --> 03:39:31,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone brought up business.

2519
03:39:31,627 --> 03:39:34,709
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna start this business talk with Medford.

2520
03:39:35,490 --> 03:39:53,159
[SPEAKER_17]: In 1960, my father told me, as we lived on Mystic Ave, the old highway to Boston, that there was only two businesses that made money back in those days, and that was the Old Carol's Diner and Grava, which is now another company.

2521
03:39:54,264 --> 03:40:18,162
[SPEAKER_17]: okay and by the way this country is not so rich eh we owe over 17 or 32 trillion i can't keep track without a scorecard we are past the point of bankruptcy now i'm going to get to my points if you're still listening sir i'm listening first off first off you grouped these four or five agenda items for one vote

2522
03:40:20,231 --> 03:40:25,032
[SPEAKER_17]: Wouldn't it be better for each agenda item to have a separate vote, in my opinion?

2523
03:40:26,633 --> 03:40:29,753
[SPEAKER_39]: Any member of the committee can request a division of the question.

2524
03:40:32,414 --> 03:40:36,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so I have a few mathematical questions.

2525
03:40:36,535 --> 03:40:40,636
[SPEAKER_17]: What is this year's levy, the budget this year?

2526
03:40:41,736 --> 03:40:43,317
[SPEAKER_17]: How much is it, the total?

2527
03:40:44,877 --> 03:40:46,538
[SPEAKER_39]: The paper for the general fund was about $189 million.

2528
03:40:48,829 --> 03:40:50,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'm gonna call it 190.

2529
03:40:51,571 --> 03:40:56,315
[SPEAKER_17]: And two and a half percent of that would be what, about 5 million?

2530
03:40:59,098 --> 03:41:02,120
[SPEAKER_39]: The 190 includes more than just the property tax levy.

2531
03:41:02,321 --> 03:41:12,349
[SPEAKER_17]: So the property tax levy, I believe is- And then my next question would be after that is how much new growth do we have in real estate taxes right now coming up?

2532
03:41:13,370 --> 03:41:14,791
[SPEAKER_39]: There was 2.8 million this year.

2533
03:41:14,811 --> 03:41:16,893
[SPEAKER_39]: It was the highest amount in the last 20 fiscal years.

2534
03:41:19,133 --> 03:41:23,994
[SPEAKER_17]: That's good news, not compared to Summerville, but better than last year.

2535
03:41:24,514 --> 03:41:36,977
[SPEAKER_17]: So five and three, $8 million on top of the 190, without doing an override, we're going to have another $8 million more than last year's by right, without doing anything.

2536
03:41:38,877 --> 03:41:42,378
[SPEAKER_17]: But still, I guess it's not enough, and you want more?

2537
03:41:43,238 --> 03:41:44,238
[SPEAKER_17]: That's ouch.

2538
03:41:45,599 --> 03:41:46,099
[SPEAKER_17]: That hurts.

2539
03:41:49,225 --> 03:41:55,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford never asked for a prop two and a half override or a debt exclusion.

2540
03:41:56,730 --> 03:41:57,930
[SPEAKER_17]: We are not Winchester.

2541
03:41:58,110 --> 03:41:59,391
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have deep pockets.

2542
03:41:59,851 --> 03:42:01,312
[SPEAKER_17]: We're a working class town.

2543
03:42:02,013 --> 03:42:04,674
[SPEAKER_17]: God help us forever and ever to pay our bills.

2544
03:42:04,974 --> 03:42:06,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Good night and good health.

2545
03:42:07,356 --> 03:42:07,856
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2546
03:42:07,876 --> 03:42:09,857
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to the podium.

2547
03:42:10,097 --> 03:42:11,959
[SPEAKER_39]: Name and address for the record, please.

2548
03:42:12,599 --> 03:42:15,881
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 9 Adams Circle.

2549
03:42:17,355 --> 03:42:26,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanna say that I think this city has been run on a penny wise and pound foolish basis for many, many, many years.

2550
03:42:27,539 --> 03:42:29,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks like it's stopping here.

2551
03:42:29,760 --> 03:42:33,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank all the councilors that have worked on this.

2552
03:42:35,562 --> 03:42:37,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a senior citizen.

2553
03:42:37,923 --> 03:42:41,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not happy about paying high taxes, but I'm willing to do it.

2554
03:42:42,642 --> 03:42:46,525
[SPEAKER_06]: for the people in my town, for the children in my town.

2555
03:42:46,985 --> 03:42:49,828
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just about me, it's about all of us.

2556
03:42:50,528 --> 03:42:59,195
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree very much with the man who talked about investing, investing in our city, investing in our children.

2557
03:42:59,255 --> 03:43:04,579
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to produce a lot of results that we can't even imagine, I think.

2558
03:43:05,420 --> 03:43:09,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I just wanna congratulate all of you.

2559
03:43:09,873 --> 03:43:14,386
[SPEAKER_06]: and say that I'm really happy with this initiative even though

2560
03:43:15,672 --> 03:43:19,893
[SPEAKER_06]: As one person said, nobody's excited about paying more taxes.

2561
03:43:20,633 --> 03:43:40,878
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do agree that we need to put pressure on the state officials to put pressure on the federal government because I also agree it shouldn't be on the working people, on the poor people to do this when there are people who are billionaires who have more money than many countries have.

2562
03:43:42,518 --> 03:43:45,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's just so, so ridiculous.

2563
03:43:47,741 --> 03:43:50,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so thank you all again for your efforts.

2564
03:43:51,144 --> 03:43:51,584
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2565
03:43:51,604 --> 03:43:57,808
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to go to Tony Tanks on Zoom.

2566
03:43:57,928 --> 03:43:59,649
[SPEAKER_39]: Tony, name and address for the record, please.

2567
03:43:59,669 --> 03:44:00,570
[SPEAKER_39]: You have three minutes.

2568
03:44:00,850 --> 03:44:02,671
[SPEAKER_47]: Hi, Tony Tanks, 16 Locust Street.

2569
03:44:04,172 --> 03:44:07,514
[SPEAKER_47]: The irony on this decision to consider this override is fallible.

2570
03:44:08,554 --> 03:44:13,916
[SPEAKER_47]: The council has made it evident that the budget cannot be met effectively without this override.

2571
03:44:14,417 --> 03:44:18,919
[SPEAKER_47]: Their answer, reach out to the homeowners of the city and obtain more funds.

2572
03:44:19,119 --> 03:44:21,640
[SPEAKER_47]: Well, homeowners are operating on budgets too.

2573
03:44:22,260 --> 03:44:27,062
[SPEAKER_47]: They do not have the luxury of reaching out to anyone for that additional burden on their budget.

2574
03:44:27,863 --> 03:44:29,443
[SPEAKER_47]: Are we expected to ask for raises?

2575
03:44:29,603 --> 03:44:34,265
[SPEAKER_47]: Are we expected to get second and third jobs to fill this new expenditure caused by this override?

2576
03:44:34,766 --> 03:44:37,667
[SPEAKER_47]: Or perhaps we might have to make cuts to budgets

2577
03:44:38,757 --> 03:44:58,284
[SPEAKER_47]: by eliminating or maybe eliminating some of the contributions to the savings or the children's college funds or retirement funds, or while the elderly or disabled and others who are on fixed budgets will in fact be made to face hard decisions, perhaps by cutting their food costs or even having to choose to cut their medications to make ends meet.

2578
03:44:58,865 --> 03:45:03,746
[SPEAKER_47]: Unfortunately, some have irresponsibly equated this increase as a mere cup of coffee.

2579
03:45:05,623 --> 03:45:06,584
[SPEAKER_47]: That's an outright lie.

2580
03:45:07,044 --> 03:45:15,309
[SPEAKER_47]: Many homes are assessed at differing values, and what might be a $40 a month for some, it might be much more for those with homes of higher values.

2581
03:45:15,710 --> 03:45:21,373
[SPEAKER_47]: My disabled mother has already eliminated her cup of coffee daily to be able to afford the increasing costs of her medications.

2582
03:45:22,014 --> 03:45:22,814
[SPEAKER_47]: But back to budgets.

2583
03:45:23,094 --> 03:45:25,596
[SPEAKER_47]: Homeowners do not have the luxury to ask for more money.

2584
03:45:26,096 --> 03:45:32,541
[SPEAKER_47]: Unfortunately, many residents are just not confident in the manner of operation of the current administration, council, and school committee.

2585
03:45:33,141 --> 03:45:34,502
[SPEAKER_47]: We are not prepared or willing

2586
03:45:34,810 --> 03:45:36,491
[SPEAKER_47]: to hand over our hard-earned income.

2587
03:45:37,452 --> 03:45:45,139
[SPEAKER_47]: And over the years, all the promises and the hype have been just peanuts for everyone in the residency.

2588
03:45:45,179 --> 03:45:46,280
[SPEAKER_47]: It's just business as usual.

2589
03:45:46,720 --> 03:46:02,854
[SPEAKER_47]: Perhaps the elected officials who run the city need to look at other ways to find income, starting with what other cities are very successful at, which is increasing the commercial tax base and being friendly to business, then seeking linkage fees that make sense, not just, hey, we got a few blue bike stands.

2590
03:46:03,476 --> 03:46:07,560
[SPEAKER_47]: Seriously, what has this current mayor, council, and school committee done for us?

2591
03:46:07,960 --> 03:46:08,521
[SPEAKER_47]: The library?

2592
03:46:08,621 --> 03:46:10,002
[SPEAKER_47]: No, that was a previous council.

2593
03:46:10,062 --> 03:46:10,883
[SPEAKER_47]: The police station?

2594
03:46:11,103 --> 03:46:12,444
[SPEAKER_47]: Again, previous councils.

2595
03:46:12,884 --> 03:46:22,893
[SPEAKER_47]: Give us a reason to trust that our investments in the city will be worth it and put to programs that benefit the entire residency, not just a special interest that you seek for re-election.

2596
03:46:23,434 --> 03:46:28,418
[SPEAKER_47]: If we had better management of the city, then I am certain more would be on board with this request for more money.

2597
03:46:29,019 --> 03:46:41,722
[SPEAKER_47]: Lastly, if this override is really desperately needed, as bad as this council claims, and has any member of the council considered what will happen if it's not successfully passed at the ballot box?

2598
03:46:42,642 --> 03:46:45,443
[SPEAKER_47]: If so, then perhaps maybe we should try that answer first.

2599
03:46:46,143 --> 03:46:52,204
[SPEAKER_47]: Please do not be misguided into believing all the lovely outcomes that more money will bring.

2600
03:46:52,664 --> 03:46:54,324
[SPEAKER_47]: We already said that it's not going to be enough.

2601
03:46:54,364 --> 03:46:55,245
[SPEAKER_47]: It'll never be enough.

2602
03:46:56,285 --> 03:46:56,585
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2603
03:46:58,988 --> 03:46:59,388
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2604
03:46:59,408 --> 03:47:08,733
[SPEAKER_39]: I have, uh, two people who have spoken already on zoom, and I also have two public comments to read.

2605
03:47:08,773 --> 03:47:10,274
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to read the public comments now.

2606
03:47:11,174 --> 03:47:14,336
[SPEAKER_39]: Um, Jessica Taddeo, 50 fells.

2607
03:47:14,376 --> 03:47:14,976
[SPEAKER_39]: You have mentored.

2608
03:47:14,996 --> 03:47:17,437
[SPEAKER_39]: I may to the members of the city council, the mayor and the public.

2609
03:47:17,477 --> 03:47:26,662
[SPEAKER_39]: I write to you today to express my support for proposition two and a half override and use of a free cash reserves to fund our schools, fix our infrastructure and provide mentor for the permanent support structure.

2610
03:47:26,782 --> 03:47:28,503
[SPEAKER_39]: I do not believe it as a generalization to claim,

2611
03:47:28,976 --> 03:47:33,562
[SPEAKER_39]: and a majority of residents were shocked and appalled to see potential outline cuts to various programs.

2612
03:47:33,622 --> 03:47:37,668
[SPEAKER_39]: And as one of those residents, I believe wholeheartedly that this is the only solution to these problems we face.

2613
03:47:38,128 --> 03:47:43,596
[SPEAKER_39]: I ask that you use the city's free cash as a short-term solution so a budget that funds all necessary programs can be passed by this council.

2614
03:47:43,996 --> 03:47:46,760
[SPEAKER_39]: The free cash is meant for emergencies and this is without a doubt an emergency.

2615
03:47:47,199 --> 03:47:52,304
[SPEAKER_39]: I believe the use of these reserves are a necessary step prior to a vote taken by the public regarding a debt exclusion and override.

2616
03:47:52,385 --> 03:47:59,132
[SPEAKER_39]: I've spent a lot of time talking to voters over the last four months, and many of them are quick to voice their concerns over funding for the schools and the state of our infrastructure.

2617
03:47:59,592 --> 03:48:01,634
[SPEAKER_39]: These are the two biggest issues for residents in my eyes.

2618
03:48:01,675 --> 03:48:02,816
[SPEAKER_39]: This seems like a perfect fix.

2619
03:48:03,216 --> 03:48:05,739
[SPEAKER_39]: I believe that with a coordinated effort, strong message, and open dialogue,

2620
03:48:06,199 --> 03:48:09,741
[SPEAKER_39]: Many residents would be in support of any measure taken that promises a strong school system.

2621
03:48:10,261 --> 03:48:15,844
[SPEAKER_39]: I am a product of Medford Public Schools, and I am endlessly grateful for the education and support I received.

2622
03:48:15,884 --> 03:48:23,748
[SPEAKER_39]: It is important to me that future generations of students receive the same support, programs, and opportunities my classmates and I enjoyed, specifically fostering a performing arts program.

2623
03:48:24,148 --> 03:48:32,772
[SPEAKER_39]: Research shows that those involved in art, performance, music, and dance are smarter, better analytical thinkers, and bring a necessary perspective to more, quote, conventional disciplines.

2624
03:48:33,482 --> 03:48:37,788
[SPEAKER_39]: Additionally, these spaces are refuge for many children seeking communities and way to express themselves.

2625
03:48:38,168 --> 03:48:45,998
[SPEAKER_39]: The proposed cuts are daunting and I believe that 7.5 million as a minimum for an override would set up younger generations for a future of success, knowledge and creativity.

2626
03:48:46,431 --> 03:48:52,754
[SPEAKER_39]: Opponents of this will claim that supporters are squeezing money from working families, unfairly taxing residents, and that the city will not use the money responsibly.

2627
03:48:53,134 --> 03:48:59,376
[SPEAKER_39]: These opponents are the same people with the loudest voices expressing concerns about our schools, roads, potholes, and lack of services for residents.

2628
03:48:59,776 --> 03:49:08,640
[SPEAKER_39]: To opponents, I say, no matter your politics or views on the city finances, a strong foundation for future generations is paramount to any political or financial concerns in the present.

2629
03:49:09,060 --> 03:49:12,482
[SPEAKER_39]: To opponents, I say these resolutions are proof that your elected officials are listening and helping.

2630
03:49:12,862 --> 03:49:16,083
[SPEAKER_39]: I implore you to consider a budget that allows our schools to flourish for decades to come.

2631
03:49:16,516 --> 03:49:18,417
[SPEAKER_39]: The time is now to fix this longstanding issue.

2632
03:49:18,857 --> 03:49:19,237
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2633
03:49:19,257 --> 03:49:22,538
[SPEAKER_39]: And I have from Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street.

2634
03:49:23,358 --> 03:49:36,862
[SPEAKER_39]: Dear Medford City Council members, I am part of a demographic that might be expected to oppose tax overrides such as the ones being proposed for the November ballot, a senior citizen with no children or grandchildren in the Metro Public Schools on a fixed income and with new and increasing medical bills and other expenses.

2635
03:49:37,282 --> 03:49:42,783
[SPEAKER_39]: But in fact, I am 100% in favor of this measure being approved to appear on the November ballot, where I'll be eager to vote for it.

2636
03:49:43,163 --> 03:49:46,044
[SPEAKER_39]: Simply put, the city of Medford, the cost of business continues to go up,

2637
03:49:46,500 --> 03:49:50,881
[SPEAKER_39]: just like my plumber does when costs increase, it is reasonable to ask the paying customer to pay more for services.

2638
03:49:51,381 --> 03:50:02,644
[SPEAKER_39]: It has never been more clear than during the current budget process, especially regarding the schools, that we don't have enough revenue to cover the basic costs of running a high-functioning city, let alone major capital improvements such as a new fire headquarters or high school.

2639
03:50:03,124 --> 03:50:06,145
[SPEAKER_39]: It is appropriate for the city to examine how to increase revenue from each leg

2640
03:50:06,585 --> 03:50:09,408
[SPEAKER_39]: of the multi-leg stool of sources, including property taxes.

2641
03:50:09,868 --> 03:50:17,854
[SPEAKER_39]: True, in my 24 years as a Medford homeowner, our taxes have been low compared to neighboring communities, one of the many things that make Medford such an appealing place to live.

2642
03:50:18,355 --> 03:50:29,684
[SPEAKER_39]: Sure, everyone wants their taxes to be as low as possible, but a small increase in this segment by way of an override is a reasonable proposition and a good investment in helping the city bring its annual budget closer to where it needs to be to cover essential needs.

2643
03:50:30,205 --> 03:50:34,229
[SPEAKER_39]: residents should know that the city is working hard to increase revenue from the other legs of that stool as well.

2644
03:50:34,950 --> 03:50:50,146
[SPEAKER_39]: After a major decline in life sciences, sidelined several promising large projects, major commercial development projects have reemerged, including a $20 million makeover of former Century Bank building at 400 Mystic Avenue and large residential projects at 970 Felsway and 280 Mystic Avenue.

2645
03:50:50,726 --> 03:50:55,327
[SPEAKER_39]: These and others to follow will be providing substantial commercial tax and other revenue to the city.

2646
03:50:55,907 --> 03:51:15,332
[SPEAKER_39]: The Mass Gaming Commission recently approved the city's current request of $1.04 million from its Community Mitigation Fund for 10 projects across the city, including $300,000 for improvements to Chevalier Theatre, the primary economic engine for Medford Square that has created tens of thousands of dollars in meal and hotel tax revenue for the city alone, not to mention jobs and steady purchases from a multitude of other Medford businesses.

2647
03:51:16,618 --> 03:51:20,959
[SPEAKER_39]: Those are just two examples I cite in response to people say the city is overburdening the residential taxpayer.

2648
03:51:21,039 --> 03:51:30,923
[SPEAKER_39]: Finally, I noted above, we're talking about the city covering essential needs such as robust education, that doesn't short-range departments such as the arts, and not that many things in the city could truly use help to make it thrive.

2649
03:51:31,403 --> 03:51:32,843
[SPEAKER_39]: Our city's departments are hardly bloated.

2650
03:51:32,923 --> 03:51:37,825
[SPEAKER_39]: For example, Somerville, albeit a bit larger city, has 10 staff members for its arts council.

2651
03:51:37,905 --> 03:51:43,067
[SPEAKER_39]: The Medford Arts Council has zero staff members, and the council's volunteer members do not even receive a stipend for serving.

2652
03:51:43,567 --> 03:52:00,553
[SPEAKER_39]: just think how much stronger this important community asset both in terms of quality of life and its significant economic benefit to the city could be with just one staff member rather than the city relying almost completely on volunteers such as those with cache west medford open studios medford porch fest etc to put on more than 1 000 events you'd see 1 000 events a year almost totally on their own

2653
03:52:03,274 --> 03:52:07,076
[SPEAKER_39]: Last, the city must be able to offer competitive wages in order to attract top quality employees.

2654
03:52:07,556 --> 03:52:14,119
[SPEAKER_39]: Many city hiring managers will tell you about strong candidates who are lost to other municipalities, not to mention the private sector due to higher salary offers.

2655
03:52:14,619 --> 03:52:18,641
[SPEAKER_39]: The city needs more revenue to provide residents with the best possible staff and best possible services.

2656
03:52:19,101 --> 03:52:23,763
[SPEAKER_39]: I strongly urge the city council to vote in favor of putting three proposed tax overrides on the November ballot.

2657
03:52:24,523 --> 03:52:27,525
[SPEAKER_39]: And thank you for all your hard work in bringing forward these vitally important measures.

2658
03:52:27,565 --> 03:52:30,246
[SPEAKER_39]: Sincerely, Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

2659
03:52:31,984 --> 03:52:39,410
[SPEAKER_39]: Pursuant to the new rule, I'm gonna go for one minute to Jess H, and then one minute to Sharon Deeso.

2660
03:52:39,510 --> 03:52:41,812
[SPEAKER_39]: Jess H, you have one minute, name and address.

2661
03:52:41,992 --> 03:52:43,353
[SPEAKER_39]: Well, you've already given your name and address.

2662
03:52:43,373 --> 03:52:44,534
[SPEAKER_39]: Just confirm that you're Jess Healy.

2663
03:52:45,395 --> 03:52:47,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it is me, Jessica Healy.

2664
03:52:48,317 --> 03:52:53,701
[SPEAKER_19]: I know it's a little off, but with the lady stating a methadone clinic on Salem Street, can anyone verify that?

2665
03:52:55,883 --> 03:52:57,804
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, can you restate the question one more time?

2666
03:52:58,465 --> 03:52:58,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

2667
03:53:00,158 --> 03:53:05,862
[SPEAKER_19]: With a methadone clinic going on Salem Street, can anyone verify that is definitely happening?

2668
03:53:06,803 --> 03:53:15,489
[SPEAKER_39]: There is a proposal before the Community Development Board and the Zoning Board of Appeals for a substance use clinic on Salem Street.

2669
03:53:16,270 --> 03:53:19,352
[SPEAKER_39]: The Zoning Board of Appeals is the final decision maker on that proposal.

2670
03:53:20,493 --> 03:53:24,156
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay, so is that who I would more reach out to, the Zoning Board?

2671
03:53:25,377 --> 03:53:27,499

2680
03:53:53,376 --> 03:53:56,197
[SPEAKER_39]: Sharon, you're going to have one minute if you could just confirm

2681

03:54:39,689 --> 03:54:40,210
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2694
03:54:40,250 --> 03:54:41,390
[SPEAKER_64]: Can you hear me now?

2695
03:54:41,430 --> 03:54:41,851
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2696
03:54:42,471 --> 03:54:45,132
[SPEAKER_64]: I was just reviewing some of the interesting comments.

2697
03:54:45,212 --> 03:54:46,073
[SPEAKER_64]: It's our podium.

2698
03:54:46,873 --> 03:54:48,774
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your time again this evening.

2699
03:54:49,254 --> 03:54:51,015
[SPEAKER_64]: I'd just like to make a few remarks.

2700
03:54:51,896 --> 03:54:52,416
Thank you.

03:54:52,476 --> 03:54:53,637
Can you hear me now?

2702
03:54:53,657 --> 03:54:54,057
Thank you.

2703
03:54:54,717 --> 03:54:56,058
I was just reviewing some of

2704
03:54:58,132 --> 03:54:59,635
[SPEAKER_53]: Okay, Vice President Collins.

2705
03:55:05,796 --> 03:55:06,556
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, President Bears.

2706
03:55:07,056 --> 03:55:11,377
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm really glad that we've had the opportunity to consider all of these papers together.

2707
03:55:11,437 --> 03:55:17,458
[SPEAKER_26]: Like I said earlier, I don't think there's any other way to consider all of these pieces than in context with each other.

2708
03:55:17,478 --> 03:55:28,420
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm really glad that we got to hear from so many members of the community about each of these and about these budget-related proposals together.

2709
03:55:28,920 --> 03:55:33,281
[SPEAKER_26]: With that, I'm gonna motion that we divide the question and consider each item in this order.

2710
03:55:34,121 --> 03:55:35,982
[SPEAKER_26]: 24-413, which is the debt exclusion.

2711
03:55:36,002 --> 03:55:38,903
[SPEAKER_26]: 24-414, which is the mayor's $3.5 million override.

2712
03:55:38,923 --> 03:55:40,344
[SPEAKER_26]: 24-415, which is President Bears and mine $4 million override.

2713
03:55:40,364 --> 03:55:41,565
[SPEAKER_26]: 24-410, which is the ARPA allocation.

2714
03:55:41,585 --> 03:55:42,565
[SPEAKER_26]: And then 24-045, which is the budget proposal.

2715
03:55:42,585 --> 03:55:42,725
[SPEAKER_26]: Second.

2716
03:56:00,424 --> 03:56:04,027
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, as Councilor Collins has moved to divide the question, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2717
03:56:04,067 --> 03:56:06,349
[SPEAKER_39]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to divide the question.

2718
03:56:06,469 --> 03:56:06,549
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2719
03:56:06,569 --> 03:56:15,296
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

2720
03:56:15,316 --> 03:56:15,376
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

2721
03:56:15,416 --> 03:56:15,576
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

2722
03:56:15,616 --> 03:56:15,736
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

2723
03:56:15,976 --> 03:56:16,177
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

2724
03:56:17,257 --> 03:56:17,337
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

2725
03:56:28,231 --> 03:56:29,735
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none negative.

2726
03:56:29,755 --> 03:56:30,618
[SPEAKER_39]: The question is divided.

2727
03:56:31,159 --> 03:56:33,105
[SPEAKER_39]: I did want to note before we move through.

2728
03:56:33,604 --> 03:56:38,166
[SPEAKER_39]: The mayor did submit slightly amended versions of these papers.

2729
03:56:38,226 --> 03:56:41,527
[SPEAKER_39]: Those were the versions that I read prior to this.

2730
03:56:42,047 --> 03:56:45,388
[SPEAKER_39]: I did have a suggestion if a motion could be made.

2731
03:56:45,868 --> 03:56:48,389
[SPEAKER_39]: I believe there is a copy edit error in 24414 and 24415.

2732
03:56:48,429 --> 03:56:51,890
[SPEAKER_39]: If we could strike the words FY 2025 before general operations.

2733
03:56:51,910 --> 03:56:53,871
[SPEAKER_39]: If folks need a second to review that.

2734
03:57:04,670 --> 03:57:05,570
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins.

2735
03:57:10,675 --> 03:57:14,278
[SPEAKER_26]: I reviewed the corrections that were sent over from the mayor's office, and I just want to note.

2736
03:57:14,298 --> 03:57:19,822
[SPEAKER_26]: I got a lot of pages in this packet.

2737
03:57:24,386 --> 03:57:29,671
[SPEAKER_26]: Just to clarify, is the correction being made that in the mayor's override proposal, which

2738
03:57:31,267 --> 03:57:37,613
[SPEAKER_26]: 4-414, the first instance that for FY25 appears, that's being deleted?

2739
03:57:38,414 --> 03:57:39,435
[SPEAKER_39]: It's in the question.

2740
03:57:39,955 --> 03:57:40,756
[SPEAKER_26]: In the question, right.

2741
03:57:41,457 --> 03:57:46,602
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, it would just be before the words general operations.

2742
03:57:46,662 --> 03:57:47,923
[SPEAKER_26]: Just because that appears twice.

2743
03:57:48,564 --> 03:57:49,645
[SPEAKER_39]: Then it would be for both, thank you.

2744
03:57:49,665 --> 03:57:50,466
[SPEAKER_26]: For both, okay, great.

2745
03:57:53,206 --> 03:57:55,447
[SPEAKER_26]: and I'd be happy to make that motion to adopt the corrections.

2746
03:57:55,767 --> 03:57:56,548
[SPEAKER_39]: I'll be happy to second.

2747
03:57:56,928 --> 03:58:11,835
[SPEAKER_39]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to amend 24414 and 24415 to strike the phrase FY 2025 before the word general operations in the question language, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2748
03:58:12,895 --> 03:58:13,996
[SPEAKER_39]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2749
03:58:20,259 --> 03:58:21,880
[SPEAKER_46]: Can you repeat that again, Council President?

2750
03:58:21,900 --> 03:58:22,400
[SPEAKER_46]: I apologize.

2751
03:58:23,604 --> 03:58:31,270
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, it's a copy edit to the question language on 24414 and 24415.

2752
03:58:32,291 --> 03:58:44,240
[SPEAKER_39]: The question states for the FY 2025 general operations and then also states for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.

2753
03:58:44,681 --> 03:58:52,026
[SPEAKER_39]: So it would just be removing the duplicative FY 2025 general before the words general operations.

2754
03:58:52,307 --> 03:58:52,747
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2755
03:58:57,577 --> 03:58:58,818
[SPEAKER_39]: for everyone's edification.

2756
03:58:59,379 --> 03:59:02,781
[SPEAKER_39]: Fiscal year 2025 is the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.

2757
03:59:06,284 --> 03:59:07,105
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins.

2758
03:59:07,265 --> 03:59:11,909
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry, was that amendment to do a similar deletion in 24-415?

2759
03:59:12,489 --> 03:59:13,670
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, that was my understanding.

2760
03:59:13,850 --> 03:59:14,631
[SPEAKER_39]: OK, great.

2761
03:59:14,791 --> 03:59:16,212
[SPEAKER_39]: I just wanted to make sure we were doing the same thing.

2762
03:59:16,232 --> 03:59:17,053
[SPEAKER_39]: Thanks for all the questions.

2763
03:59:17,493 --> 03:59:18,754
[SPEAKER_39]: And that's how the clerk has it as well.

2764
03:59:19,435 --> 03:59:19,635
[SPEAKER_39]: Great.

2765
03:59:19,835 --> 03:59:21,436
[SPEAKER_39]: On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2766

[SPEAKER_39]: I have a motion passes.

2878
04:05:53,700 --> 04:05:55,261
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Collins, I'm gonna ask you to take the chair.

2879
04:05:55,281 --> 04:05:55,301
[SPEAKER_39]: 24-412.

2880
04:05:58,092 --> 04:06:07,176
[SPEAKER_39]: resolution to recognize and discuss the Stop the Sigma campaign in relation to our neighbors with substance use disorder, whereas substance use disorder is a recognized disease by the medical community, and whereas in 2023,

2881
04:06:08,467 --> 04:06:14,992
[SPEAKER_39]: Medford was home to 403 individuals with active prescriptions for buprenorphine and medications as a treatment for opioid recovery.

2882
04:06:15,112 --> 04:06:20,456
[SPEAKER_39]: And whereas buprenorphine and methadone are lifesaving medications to treat substance use disorder and are effective at treating opioid dependence.

2883
04:06:20,596 --> 04:06:27,101
[SPEAKER_39]: And whereas between July, 2022 and June, 2023, Medford was home to 22 individuals who died for reasons related to substance use disorder.

2884
04:06:27,662 --> 04:06:36,128
[SPEAKER_39]: And whereas in 2018, 16% of individuals with a substance use disorder did not seek treatment because they were worried it would have a negative impact on their employment and approximately 15%

2885
04:06:38,069 --> 04:06:39,910
[SPEAKER_39]: 15% felt it would impact their community's view of them.

2886
04:06:40,530 --> 04:06:57,118
[SPEAKER_39]: And whereas a disease is not a moral failing now, therefore be it hereby resolved that the Medford City Council recognize that all Medford residents are deserving of care and respect, regardless of their medical disability or disability status, be it further resolved that when we speak of the services we can offer our residents, we do so while offering the utmost dignity to all people at all times.

2887
04:06:57,218 --> 04:06:57,779
[SPEAKER_39]: Council Luzardo.

2888
04:06:59,099 --> 04:06:59,539
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2889
04:06:59,799 --> 04:07:00,700
[SPEAKER_25]: I know it is late.

2890
04:07:01,100 --> 04:07:03,521
[SPEAKER_25]: I will try to keep this brief.

2891
04:07:03,541 --> 04:07:05,062
[SPEAKER_25]: I have worked with many,

2892
04:07:05,831 --> 04:07:12,256
[SPEAKER_25]: people with substance use disorders in my time working at the Malden Warming Center.

2893
04:07:13,197 --> 04:07:31,011
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's been some conversation about something that our body will never approve or not approve, but there's been discussion in our community about a clinic that will offer

2894
04:07:34,746 --> 04:07:38,509
[SPEAKER_25]: medication-assisted treatment, medicines for opioid use disorder.

2895
04:07:39,889 --> 04:07:56,660
[SPEAKER_25]: And when those conversations are happening, I just thought it would be prudent to bring up something called Stop the Stigma, which is a campaign that highlights that the stigma against people dealing with substance use disorder can be

2896
04:07:58,137 --> 04:08:03,740
[SPEAKER_25]: Additionally, damaging to people with substance use disorders and can prevent people from seeking treatment.

2897
04:08:04,961 --> 04:08:05,921
[SPEAKER_25]: People in recovery.

2898
04:08:07,782 --> 04:08:14,506
[SPEAKER_25]: Deal with a lot of negative stigma associated with The disease of addiction.

2899
04:08:14,586 --> 04:08:14,726
[SPEAKER_25]: So

2900
04:08:15,938 --> 04:08:24,884
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to present this and encourage folks to research this topic.

2901
04:08:24,944 --> 04:08:39,713
[SPEAKER_25]: It's very close to my heart and very important to me, and I'd be happy to discuss it at length if people are interested, but I know it is after 11 p.m., and this is the budget meeting, so that being said,

2902
04:08:41,934 --> 04:09:02,498
[SPEAKER_25]: My great hope in presenting this now is only that we recognize that substance use disorder is recognized as a disease by the medical community and that people with that disease are protected, have a protected status and should be considered people with a disability.

2903
04:09:02,618 --> 04:09:10,499
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's not appropriate to talk about people with a disability in a blanket kind of negative

2904
04:09:11,811 --> 04:09:12,071
[SPEAKER_25]: manner.

2905
04:09:13,272 --> 04:09:13,552
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2906
04:09:14,873 --> 04:09:16,074
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much, Councilor Lazzaro.

2907
04:09:17,075 --> 04:09:19,676
[SPEAKER_26]: Any additional comments from Councilors on this motion?

2908
04:09:20,196 --> 04:09:20,797
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Callahan?

2909
04:09:23,578 --> 04:09:39,168
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess my only, not knowing very much about this, my only comment is that I will admit I do not quite understand what this actually does and if it restricts the ability for people to speak in a certain way or, like, I'm just trying to understand what this

2910
04:09:39,978 --> 04:09:42,800
[SPEAKER_18]: actually changes material for people.

2911
04:09:43,921 --> 04:09:51,027
[SPEAKER_25]: It's sort of like how we celebrate Haitian American Flag Day, in my mind.

2912
04:09:51,567 --> 04:10:02,175
[SPEAKER_25]: Stop the Stigma doesn't have a day, though during my work in Malden at the Malden Warming Center, there is a day that's celebrated in Malden.

2913
04:10:02,395 --> 04:10:04,237
[SPEAKER_25]: It's celebrated in March, I think.

2914
04:10:04,597 --> 04:10:08,940
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's just a it was just decided in as a city to celebrate it on a day.

2915
04:10:08,960 --> 04:10:11,662
[SPEAKER_25]: So we don't we don't do that in Medford.

2916
04:10:11,742 --> 04:10:20,287
[SPEAKER_25]: But and this wouldn't be to encourage us to do a day I just wanted to present it as an awareness raising issue.

2917
04:10:21,988 --> 04:10:33,116
[SPEAKER_25]: Mainly because as a an elected body, we are not approving or not approving the business that is

2918
04:10:33,976 --> 04:10:35,657
[SPEAKER_25]: trying to open on Salem Street.

2919
04:10:36,298 --> 04:10:42,403
[SPEAKER_25]: So we don't have any ability to like stake a claim in that.

2920
04:10:43,323 --> 04:10:49,428
[SPEAKER_25]: But I did feel that it was a it was something that was important to me to state sort of that

2921
04:10:51,977 --> 04:11:06,084
[SPEAKER_25]: the way that we talk about Medford residents and the way that we as a community engage with people with disabilities, people with diseases, and the way that we try to sort of help our residents should be sort of front of mind.

2922
04:11:06,784 --> 04:11:12,066
[SPEAKER_25]: And I just wanted to raise awareness of it as a community issue.

2923
04:11:12,086 --> 04:11:17,469
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2924
04:11:17,489 --> 04:11:19,390
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

2925
04:11:20,916 --> 04:11:21,977
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll now move to the public perspective.

2926
04:11:22,538 --> 04:11:23,499
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, President Burris.

2927
04:11:23,840 --> 04:11:25,642
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Madam President.

2928
04:11:25,742 --> 04:11:30,668
[SPEAKER_39]: I just want to thank my fellow counselor for putting this item on the agenda, bringing up some very important issues.

2929
04:11:32,110 --> 04:11:37,096
[SPEAKER_39]: And I think we all know how much the opioid crisis has impacted our community.

2930
04:11:38,017 --> 04:11:39,339
[SPEAKER_39]: Such a serious, serious issue.

2931
04:11:40,846 --> 04:11:56,072
[SPEAKER_39]: And, you know, whether it's meant for overcoming addiction or our prevention and outreach office or just the sheer amount of work that so many people in this community have done to do harm reduction and also try to just save lives.

2932
04:11:56,733 --> 04:12:02,635
[SPEAKER_39]: I think it's important that we acknowledge that, you know, yes, it's a difficult issue.

2933
04:12:02,755 --> 04:12:03,455
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, it's tough.

2934
04:12:04,796 --> 04:12:05,156
[SPEAKER_39]: But that

2935
04:12:06,052 --> 04:12:14,796
[SPEAKER_39]: There are people and families in our community who have been so deeply affected by substance use disorders and people in our community.

2936
04:12:14,816 --> 04:12:31,745
[SPEAKER_39]: I mean, I have been to funerals of people I went to school with in Medford, at Medford High School, who maybe if our society thought about these a little bit differently or spoke about these issues a little bit differently,

2937
04:12:32,512 --> 04:12:35,574
[SPEAKER_39]: would have gotten the help that they needed and they'd be alive.

2938
04:12:35,935 --> 04:12:56,971
[SPEAKER_39]: So for every statement that is made that I can understand fear and concern, but I think that humanizing these human beings in our community and these human beings in our, whether they're just in Medford or they're around the region, it's important for us to do that.

2939
04:12:57,011 --> 04:12:58,852
[SPEAKER_39]: And I see that as the intent of this resolution.

2940
04:12:58,912 --> 04:13:00,213
[SPEAKER_39]: So I thank you for putting it forward.

2941
04:13:01,974 --> 04:13:02,855
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, President Bears.

2942
04:13:02,895 --> 04:13:04,876
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go now to Councilor Scarpelli on Zoom.

2943
04:13:05,896 --> 04:13:07,697
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.

2944
04:13:09,078 --> 04:13:30,350
[SPEAKER_46]: I also appreciate the resolution because it definitely is something that we should understand and with a little compassion, but to what relates to the proposed site, I think it's also

2945
04:13:32,250 --> 04:13:46,654
[SPEAKER_46]: conversations I've had with former addicts and, um, and people that were once on methadone that really stressed to me that, uh, the location is, um, is something that should be looked at.

2946
04:13:46,855 --> 04:13:57,638
[SPEAKER_46]: I think that, um, to help the city find a location, um, that would be suitable, but, um, in the area that's being requested where it's.

2947
04:13:58,775 --> 04:14:04,537
[SPEAKER_46]: a few blocks from the school, across the street from the dance studio, a park right down the block.

2948
04:14:05,037 --> 04:14:14,720
[SPEAKER_46]: So there are some concerns there for the residents and the parents of the Roberts school.

2949
04:14:14,820 --> 04:14:17,181
[SPEAKER_46]: So I think that has to come into play.

2950
04:14:17,201 --> 04:14:17,781
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think that

2951
04:14:19,523 --> 04:14:22,246
[SPEAKER_46]: Um, like again, this isn't coming arbitrarily.

2952
04:14:22,266 --> 04:14:34,977
[SPEAKER_46]: This is coming from discussions that I've had with, uh, with addicts themselves and who've, who've told me that it should be in a place because, uh, there are some serious concerns there.

2953
04:14:35,017 --> 04:14:45,967
[SPEAKER_46]: So, although I appreciate my fellow council bringing this forward and I feel for, uh, and respect, um, a resolution at the same time.

2954
04:14:46,807 --> 04:15:01,078
[SPEAKER_46]: uh, in the same breath is understanding that, um, having the location in part of the community that could negatively affect so many, um, we have to look at their well being as well.

2955
04:15:01,139 --> 04:15:03,020
[SPEAKER_46]: So, um, I thank you for that.

2956
04:15:09,585 --> 04:15:10,546
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2957
04:15:12,694 --> 04:15:14,435
[SPEAKER_39]: I just wanted to note one thing.

2958
04:15:14,455 --> 04:15:16,635
[SPEAKER_39]: I misspoke on the dates of the meetings.

2959
04:15:17,136 --> 04:15:18,216
[SPEAKER_39]: It's not the 25th and the 26th.

2960
04:15:18,336 --> 04:15:21,917
[SPEAKER_39]: It is June 26th, Community Development Board, June 27th, Zoning Board of Appeals.

2961
04:15:21,957 --> 04:15:22,517
[SPEAKER_39]: My apologies.

2962
04:15:23,677 --> 04:15:23,957
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2963
04:15:23,977 --> 04:15:36,720
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, just to reaffirm that the city council is not the decision maker on the use of this parcel that is with the CDB and the DBA during the week of the 24th.

2964
04:15:37,741 --> 04:15:38,701
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

2965
04:15:39,662 --> 04:15:41,664
[SPEAKER_58]: Shower Rodriguez, 21 Park Street.

2966
04:15:42,084 --> 04:15:50,070
[SPEAKER_58]: I would be approximately 0.2 miles away from the proposed site of 360 Sound Street, but not as close as some people who are about five feet away from this site.

2967
04:15:51,091 --> 04:15:56,815
[SPEAKER_58]: So it's pretty easy to not talk about the negative impacts of this dispensary when it's not in your neighborhood.

2968
04:15:57,055 --> 04:16:03,120
[SPEAKER_58]: When you don't have to be afraid that your children are walking down the street or waiting for the school bus or across the street at the dance studio.

2969
04:16:03,540 --> 04:16:06,943
[SPEAKER_58]: When desperate drug addicted people aren't concentrated in your backyard.

2970
04:16:07,583 --> 04:16:12,625
[SPEAKER_58]: It's very easy when you're willing to sacrifice a neighborhood so that you can look like a good person.

2971
04:16:13,005 --> 04:16:15,225
[SPEAKER_58]: No neighborhood needs to be the draw for these people.

2972
04:16:15,786 --> 04:16:16,686
[SPEAKER_58]: It's unfortunate.

2973
04:16:16,966 --> 04:16:27,569
[SPEAKER_58]: We want them to have treatment, but we are wishing for them to be placed in the right location, not supporting an operator who has a negative history of operating similar facilities in other cities.

2974
04:16:27,609 --> 04:16:33,551
[SPEAKER_58]: A quick Google search will pull this operator up and find out that there are problems in the areas where he operates.

2975
04:16:34,628 --> 04:16:38,630
[SPEAKER_58]: So the petitioner admits that he is going to do harm to the neighborhood.

2976
04:16:38,850 --> 04:16:42,072
[SPEAKER_58]: He just claims that the harm is worth the sacrifice.

2977
04:16:42,552 --> 04:16:45,573
[SPEAKER_58]: And this neighborhood is saying, we don't have to sacrifice the neighborhood.

2978
04:16:45,613 --> 04:16:48,295
[SPEAKER_58]: We can zone them similarly to pot dispensaries.

2979
04:16:48,795 --> 04:16:51,876
[SPEAKER_58]: They can be in commercial two and industrial one.

2980
04:16:51,936 --> 04:17:00,240
[SPEAKER_58]: If we don't allow a pot dispensary at this location, an opioid dispensary should be treated no differently and should also be zoned in the proper location.

2981
04:17:00,260 --> 04:17:01,481
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

2982
04:17:07,930 --> 04:17:09,010
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record, please.

2983
04:17:10,691 --> 04:17:11,852
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you for your patience.

2984
04:17:11,952 --> 04:17:17,554
[SPEAKER_60]: My name is Joan Lindler, and I live at 56 Farragut Avenue, and I've been there for about 25 years.

2985
04:17:18,174 --> 04:17:26,558
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm also a licensed clinician that has dedicated over two decades of my professional career to the substance addicted population.

2986
04:17:28,226 --> 04:17:35,929
[SPEAKER_60]: I feel very positive about the fact that we would do anything in my town to eliminate stigma.

2987
04:17:37,029 --> 04:17:50,793
[SPEAKER_60]: I do have some concerns that I have learned through my many years of being involved, and it's basically there are four things that really are important.

2988
04:17:51,173 --> 04:17:56,595
[SPEAKER_60]: Right treatment, the right time, in the right place, with the right provider.

2989
04:17:57,461 --> 04:18:03,606
[SPEAKER_60]: And the right provider actually involves a number of components.

2990
04:18:04,787 --> 04:18:22,780
[SPEAKER_60]: It's not just meeting accreditation and standards and getting the constant regulatory monitoring, but it's also involvement of stakeholders in the clinic or the corporation, be it nonprofit or profit-making.

2991
04:18:23,400 --> 04:18:25,702
[SPEAKER_60]: And my concern is that

2992
04:18:26,164 --> 04:18:43,825
[SPEAKER_60]: At this very time that we are introducing this resolution to de-stigmatize services, if all the boxes aren't checked, with the right treatment, the right time, the right place, and the right provider,

2993
04:18:44,662 --> 04:18:48,783
[SPEAKER_60]: Those R's that are all right become W's wrong.

2994
04:18:49,344 --> 04:19:01,828
[SPEAKER_60]: And what that results is what I would call a setup for the individuals that we hope would be helped by the committee, by this particular agency.

2995
04:19:02,706 --> 04:19:09,129
[SPEAKER_60]: So I guess what I want to express is that I know there are meetings at the end of the month.

2996
04:19:09,749 --> 04:19:28,296
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm very concerned that the stakeholders that would need to be involved with bringing successful treatment to the Medford community are not currently or have not been to date involved in the particular proposal.

2997
04:19:28,855 --> 04:19:33,841
[SPEAKER_60]: that is on the table for increasing services in our community.

2998
04:19:34,301 --> 04:19:44,933
[SPEAKER_60]: And I would ask all the council members, as well as other people who are involved, to think very seriously about how, when we introduce new

2999
04:19:46,351 --> 04:19:48,172
[SPEAKER_60]: resources to our community.

3000
04:19:48,552 --> 04:19:59,576
[SPEAKER_60]: We really work very diligently to make sure that any providers check off all the boxes to be right and not wrong.

3001
04:19:59,756 --> 04:20:12,161
[SPEAKER_60]: And I personally, I've sent you all an email today and I'm willing to work with different committees or Department of Public Health to give some of my volunteer time to perhaps

3002
04:20:12,714 --> 04:20:21,938
[SPEAKER_60]: work collegially with people in the city to perhaps increase access, increase treatment options.

3003
04:20:22,418 --> 04:20:42,286
[SPEAKER_60]: But I'm very worried and it's just ironic that at the same time that we're introducing a resolution here, it won't have its maximum mileage if we have a operation which doesn't check all those boxes.

3004
04:20:43,018 --> 04:20:55,001
[SPEAKER_60]: And that's why I wanted to come to express my concerns, as well as to let you know that I want to be available and to help in the efforts.

3005
04:20:56,161 --> 04:20:58,342
[SPEAKER_60]: But this is a very critical month.

3006
04:20:58,722 --> 04:21:02,203
[SPEAKER_60]: These decisions that are coming up are very serious and

3007
04:21:04,180 --> 04:21:09,303
[SPEAKER_60]: You've heard comments, this is not to address the issue at 360 sales.

3008
04:21:09,944 --> 04:21:14,687
[SPEAKER_60]: And I am relatively close to that particular location.

3009
04:21:15,227 --> 04:21:23,092
[SPEAKER_60]: But I'm speaking from a clinical professional, as well as a community based perspective.

3010
04:21:23,852 --> 04:21:29,576
[SPEAKER_60]: And stakeholders, I was very pleased to hear one person mentioned that they had to

3011
04:21:30,472 --> 04:21:35,554
[SPEAKER_60]: that you've talked to ex-addicts or recovering addicts was part of the stakeholders.

3012
04:21:35,934 --> 04:21:37,335
[SPEAKER_60]: It's not just the community.

3013
04:21:37,795 --> 04:21:53,121
[SPEAKER_60]: It's recovering or ex-addicts, terminology changes over the years, but also communities, professionals, and peer review, you know, other types of clinics or operations.

3014
04:21:54,062 --> 04:21:59,084
[SPEAKER_60]: All that is initial and ongoing stakeholder input.

3015
04:21:59,520 --> 04:22:00,761
[SPEAKER_60]: That is so critical.

3016
04:22:01,341 --> 04:22:11,147
[SPEAKER_60]: So I just wanted to share that and wondered if there was anything else the city council would be doing other than referring people to the end of the month meetings.

3017
04:22:12,228 --> 04:22:23,375
[SPEAKER_60]: What can we rely on you to do in this effort to ensure that the services check all the R boxes right instead of wrong?

3018
04:22:24,693 --> 04:22:28,394
[SPEAKER_60]: Is there anything else the council will be able to do?

3019
04:22:29,015 --> 04:22:32,936
[SPEAKER_60]: And I know- Councilor Zero.

3020
04:22:33,276 --> 04:22:46,360
[SPEAKER_25]: If I may, since we do not, it's a special permit to approve that space and we are sort of limited in what we're capable of saying yes or no to as far as that clinic opening in that space.

3021
04:22:46,581 --> 04:22:50,242
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's the Community Development Board and then the Zoning Board of Appeals.

3022
04:22:51,283 --> 04:22:58,328
[SPEAKER_25]: It really is a matter of referring folks to those meetings and saying, you can review the documents that are on file.

3023
04:22:59,269 --> 04:23:06,254
[SPEAKER_25]: They're all online with those boards on their, it's the city's website, but it'll be under those umbrellas.

3024
04:23:07,375 --> 04:23:15,741
[SPEAKER_25]: But also the Board of Health in Medford is very involved in this kind of work, and I'm sure they would appreciate hearing from you.

3025
04:23:17,262 --> 04:23:19,844
[SPEAKER_25]: And that would be where I would start.

3026
04:23:21,004 --> 04:23:29,349
[SPEAKER_25]: because there is a great interest in trying to help people navigate this sort of thing, definitely.

3027
04:23:29,930 --> 04:23:30,970
[SPEAKER_25]: And I appreciate hearing from you.

3028
04:23:30,990 --> 04:23:31,751
[SPEAKER_25]: I did get your email.

3029
04:23:31,771 --> 04:23:33,432
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't have a chance to reply to it, but I'll write you back.

3030
04:23:34,253 --> 04:23:34,693
[SPEAKER_60]: Yeah.

3031
04:23:34,753 --> 04:23:34,853
[SPEAKER_60]: OK.

3032
04:23:34,873 --> 04:23:34,913
[SPEAKER_60]: OK.

3033
04:23:35,093 --> 04:23:35,894
[SPEAKER_60]: Well, OK.

3034
04:23:36,114 --> 04:23:40,637
[SPEAKER_60]: So let's get somebody in here who checks all the R's and not the W's.

3035
04:23:41,157 --> 04:23:42,818
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much for your nuanced perspective.

3036
04:23:43,078 --> 04:23:43,819
[SPEAKER_26]: Really appreciate it.

3037
04:23:43,899 --> 04:23:45,800
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to go to Zoom next.

3038
04:23:47,141 --> 04:23:48,642
[SPEAKER_26]: Danielle, on Zoom, you have three minutes.

3039
04:23:53,217 --> 04:23:53,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, thank you.

3040
04:23:54,297 --> 04:23:56,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Danielle Balaka, 17 Wilson Street.

3041
04:23:57,279 --> 04:24:02,621
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll save my comments about the actual methadone clinic space for the other meetings, but I do support it.

3042
04:24:02,961 --> 04:24:09,603
[SPEAKER_16]: And I really am grateful for this, what Councilor Lazzaro is putting forward here.

3043
04:24:10,604 --> 04:24:17,526
[SPEAKER_16]: I work with survivors of rape and there's a big overlap of folks who use substances to cope with the impacts of that.

3044
04:24:17,567 --> 04:24:20,288
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have a lot of empathy for how people arrive.

3045
04:24:22,116 --> 04:24:24,297
[SPEAKER_16]: in a situation where they would be utilizing a methadone clinic.

3046
04:24:24,337 --> 04:24:32,283
[SPEAKER_16]: I also have a son at the Roberts and I also have a neighbor who died of an opioid overdose when her son was a student at the Roberts.

3047
04:24:32,323 --> 04:24:40,708
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's really important that we think about the language that we use when we're talking about this issue because people are going to be hearing it that are greatly impacted by this.

3048
04:24:41,549 --> 04:24:48,073
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just want to be, and I support this motion because I think it is, I think it's,

3049
04:24:49,264 --> 04:24:53,267
[SPEAKER_16]: really considering how we can be respectful of people while we have this conversation.

3050
04:24:53,848 --> 04:25:08,580
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think highlighting this point that we're talking about human lives here, and if there are steps that we can take to help support the health of our community and the lives of our neighbors and friends, I think that we should do it.

3051
04:25:08,600 --> 04:25:09,600
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, thank you.

3052
04:25:11,302 --> 04:25:11,822
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much.

3053
04:25:12,543 --> 04:25:13,283
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go to the podium now.

3054
04:25:13,343 --> 04:25:14,384
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

3055
04:25:14,825 --> 04:25:17,827
[SPEAKER_59]: Hi, I'm Marian Tomaszczuk, and I live on Garfield Ave.

3056
04:25:18,920 --> 04:25:23,182
[SPEAKER_59]: And I want to stress that this is a methadone distribution center.

3057
04:25:23,302 --> 04:25:24,743
[SPEAKER_59]: It is not a clinic.

3058
04:25:25,363 --> 04:25:28,625
[SPEAKER_59]: There is no treatment at this place.

3059
04:25:28,725 --> 04:25:30,265
[SPEAKER_59]: There are no doctors.

3060
04:25:30,325 --> 04:25:31,526
[SPEAKER_59]: There are no nurses.

3061
04:25:31,646 --> 04:25:34,827
[SPEAKER_59]: There are no therapy sessions.

3062
04:25:35,048 --> 04:25:36,868
[SPEAKER_59]: There is no treatment at all.

3063
04:25:41,272 --> 04:25:43,334
[SPEAKER_59]: Nobody is going to get therapy.

3064
04:25:43,634 --> 04:25:52,201
[SPEAKER_59]: Nobody is going to get any type of help other than coming in and getting your medication.

3065
04:25:53,662 --> 04:25:54,523
[SPEAKER_59]: That's all you're getting.

3066
04:25:56,825 --> 04:26:00,268
[SPEAKER_59]: So it is just a distribution center.

3067
04:26:00,908 --> 04:26:07,334
[SPEAKER_59]: It is in the middle of two densely populated family neighborhoods.

3068
04:26:08,074 --> 04:26:10,216
[SPEAKER_59]: It is directly across the street

3069
04:26:11,067 --> 04:26:13,468
[SPEAKER_59]: from a dance studio.

3070
04:26:14,169 --> 04:26:19,131
[SPEAKER_59]: It is less than 0.2 miles from an elementary school.

3071
04:26:20,652 --> 04:26:27,556
[SPEAKER_59]: It is diagonally across from a karate studio, which is also an after-school program.

3072
04:26:29,657 --> 04:26:32,319
[SPEAKER_59]: There is only one bus that goes by.

3073
04:26:32,779 --> 04:26:33,139
[SPEAKER_59]: It is the 101.

3074
04:26:35,561 --> 04:26:39,943
[SPEAKER_59]: It doesn't go by that often, because all the buses that went by got cut.

3075
04:26:41,291 --> 04:26:43,693
[SPEAKER_59]: We used to have quite a good bus system.

3076
04:26:44,373 --> 04:26:45,334
[SPEAKER_59]: I used to take them.

3077
04:26:45,414 --> 04:26:51,239
[SPEAKER_59]: I used to be able to go with express buses into Boston and everywhere, but they don't go there anymore.

3078
04:26:52,419 --> 04:26:58,624
[SPEAKER_59]: So no, it's not on a very good bus, commuter rail bus thing, you know, bus system.

3079
04:27:01,666 --> 04:27:05,910
[SPEAKER_59]: It is not a good location.

3080
04:27:07,971 --> 04:27:08,952
[SPEAKER_59]: It is right next to

3081
04:27:11,363 --> 04:27:14,604
[SPEAKER_59]: a restaurant, a very successful restaurant, Nappy's.

3082
04:27:17,625 --> 04:27:21,187
[SPEAKER_59]: It's near two parks, actually three.

3083
04:27:22,488 --> 04:27:27,770
[SPEAKER_59]: The School Park, Hickey Park, and Logan Park.

3084
04:27:31,312 --> 04:27:34,733
[SPEAKER_59]: It is heavily populated with children.

3085
04:27:38,035 --> 04:27:40,136
[SPEAKER_59]: And it is in a very good neighborhood.

3086
04:27:43,476 --> 04:27:47,457
[SPEAKER_59]: but it is not a commercial neighborhood.

3087
04:27:48,918 --> 04:27:49,578
[SPEAKER_59]: You have 30 seconds.

3088
04:27:50,438 --> 04:27:52,299
[SPEAKER_59]: So I think you need to move this.

3089
04:27:52,899 --> 04:27:56,340
[SPEAKER_59]: If you want to have something like this, you put it in an industrial area.

3090
04:27:56,640 --> 04:28:04,043
[SPEAKER_59]: You put it in a neighborhood that has a good transportation system and an area where it can be useful.

3091
04:28:05,143 --> 04:28:05,503
[SPEAKER_59]: Thank you.

3092
04:28:05,703 --> 04:28:06,004
[SPEAKER_59]: Thank you.

3093
04:28:07,884 --> 04:28:10,045
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go now to Zoom.

3094
04:28:10,385 --> 04:28:11,625
[SPEAKER_26]: Mariana, I'll ask you to unmute.

3095
04:28:11,665 --> 04:28:13,106
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

3096
04:28:17,712 --> 04:28:19,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Mariana Coombs, 113 Dudley Street.

3097
04:28:22,534 --> 04:28:37,838
[SPEAKER_22]: I know we're not voting today, but I just want to make everyone aware that this is a for-profit company that is owner in the business of this methadone clinic.

3098
04:28:38,258 --> 04:28:43,040
[SPEAKER_22]: They are profiting on keeping people addicted to a substance.

3099
04:28:43,100 --> 04:28:46,401
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you ask a lot of addicts, they'll tell you that

3100
04:28:46,934 --> 04:28:53,579
[SPEAKER_22]: methadone is actually harder to, it's a worse withdrawal from methadone than it is from heroin, let's say.

3101
04:28:53,599 --> 04:29:04,106
[SPEAKER_22]: And a lot of really reputable treatment facilities won't actually take a person that is on methadone because it is so hard to come off of.

3102
04:29:05,647 --> 04:29:07,569
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanted to make everyone aware of that.

3103
04:29:07,769 --> 04:29:14,734
[SPEAKER_22]: And in addition, for more logistical purposes, you know, Salem Street is already heavily traffic area.

3104
04:29:15,949 --> 04:29:18,131
[SPEAKER_22]: There's people walking on crosswalks.

3105
04:29:18,251 --> 04:29:23,356
[SPEAKER_22]: There's already cars that fly by and don't stop for those pedestrians.

3106
04:29:24,076 --> 04:29:25,197
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of kids.

3107
04:29:26,778 --> 04:29:32,683
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, a lot of businesses that, you know, it just wouldn't be a good appearance for those small businesses.

3108
04:29:32,723 --> 04:29:35,145
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know Method is pro small business, so.

3109
04:29:39,909 --> 04:29:40,490
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

3110
04:29:41,411 --> 04:29:41,991
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go now to

3111
04:29:43,322 --> 04:29:46,824
[SPEAKER_26]: Bill on Zoom, I'll ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.

3112
04:29:52,086 --> 04:29:54,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, my name is Bill Giglio, I work for Street Method.

3113
04:29:56,588 --> 04:30:01,770
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna thank Councilor Lazzaro for putting this on, and she does make a couple of very good points.

3114
04:30:02,670 --> 04:30:10,694
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what most people are concerned about is not the actual treatment, it's the actual location as to where it is.

3115
04:30:11,621 --> 04:30:21,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the last caller said, it's a dispensary for profit, which kind of baffles my mind because we just got money for the opioid crisis and methadone is an opioid.

3116
04:30:23,248 --> 04:30:25,089
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm for treatment.

3117
04:30:25,169 --> 04:30:26,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm all for treatment.

3118
04:30:26,390 --> 04:30:30,673
[SPEAKER_11]: I raised a little girl now because of someone with addiction.

3119
04:30:30,813 --> 04:30:33,034
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, she lost her mother and we took her in.

3120
04:30:33,794 --> 04:30:39,618
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure there's no one in the world that would want this for people than probably that little girl to be with her mother.

3121
04:30:40,379 --> 04:30:48,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, we love her and she, you know, we wouldn't have it any other way, but I would say, you know, a child wants to be with their parent more than, you know, more than an aunt or an uncle.

3122
04:30:49,803 --> 04:30:56,686
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, and I know from, you know, I know from past experience that, you know, methadone, um, it doesn't always work either.

3123
04:30:56,726 --> 04:31:09,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the last caller said, it's just, it's just another, it's just another drug to try to, to, to appeal you from another drug that both opioids and the, and, uh, you know, I know I'm rambling because it's very late and I just left there, but I,

3124
04:31:10,701 --> 04:31:16,104
[SPEAKER_11]: I do like the fact that we want to help people, and I definitely want to be part of trying to help people.

3125
04:31:16,164 --> 04:31:17,464
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's just the location.

3126
04:31:17,564 --> 04:31:27,509
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think we've heard anybody, or at least I haven't heard anybody say or read that, you know, talking about people calling them junkies and not in my neighborhood and stuff like that.

3127
04:31:27,529 --> 04:31:33,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is just the location and the proper way to dispense this type of medication.

3128
04:31:33,732 --> 04:31:34,092
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

3129
04:31:37,274 --> 04:31:37,794
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

3130
04:31:38,635 --> 04:31:38,935
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

3131
04:31:39,787 --> 04:31:43,409
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go next to Mr. Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi.

3132
04:31:48,451 --> 04:31:49,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, counselor.

3133
04:31:53,393 --> 04:31:53,933
[SPEAKER_17]: You read me?

3134
04:31:56,294 --> 04:31:58,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

3135
04:32:01,756 --> 04:32:04,958
[SPEAKER_17]: I have much empathy for people with addictions.

3136
04:32:05,798 --> 04:32:08,159
[SPEAKER_17]: I've seen it in the sixties, a tough spot.

3137
04:32:08,786 --> 04:32:13,690
[SPEAKER_17]: I seen a few people go down with the needle, and it was sad.

3138
04:32:13,710 --> 04:32:16,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Reminds me of a song.

3139
04:32:16,032 --> 04:32:22,177
[SPEAKER_17]: I seen the needle and the damage done, a little bit of it in every one.

3140
04:32:22,197 --> 04:32:23,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh-oh, the damage done.

3141
04:32:24,579 --> 04:32:26,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, now it's worse.

3142
04:32:26,501 --> 04:32:32,045
[SPEAKER_17]: We got Chinese chemicals going into Mexico, then the fentanyl's coming across the border.

3143
04:32:32,065 --> 04:32:32,346
[SPEAKER_17]: We're having 100,000

3144
04:32:35,083 --> 04:32:39,305
[SPEAKER_17]: plus dead a year in the 50 continental states.

3145
04:32:40,425 --> 04:32:43,206
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, this is really, really bad.

3146
04:32:44,707 --> 04:32:56,292
[SPEAKER_17]: And if they can get to the pharmacy and pick up the methadone, which is a little better than fentanyl, I'm sure, and heroin, but we don't know what the hell's in this stuff besides the point, okay?

3147
04:32:57,132 --> 04:32:58,753
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so the point is,

3148
04:32:59,867 --> 04:33:11,609
[SPEAKER_17]: Give them their methadone, if that's what works, and maybe they can become functioning members of society and go to work and stop robbing Mama and Papa and their neighbors, for God's sakes.

3149
04:33:12,690 --> 04:33:18,631
[SPEAKER_17]: But we should not have this location in a residential bordering neighborhood.

3150
04:33:19,531 --> 04:33:23,392
[SPEAKER_17]: If they insist on Medford, how about we put it in the

3151
04:33:25,223 --> 04:33:31,069
[SPEAKER_17]: section of Mystic Avenue, south of Harvard Street, in a commercial district.

3152
04:33:32,871 --> 04:33:37,896
[SPEAKER_17]: That would make more sense and keep them away from Medford Square because we've got enough problems as is.

3153
04:33:38,217 --> 04:33:38,557
[SPEAKER_17]: Good night.

3154
04:33:41,203 --> 04:33:43,265
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Lozano, and then we'll take our vote.

3155
04:33:43,565 --> 04:33:55,177
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to say thank you to the folks that spoke, and I'm just sorry for your loss, Bill, and anybody who has lost folks.

3156
04:33:55,277 --> 04:34:00,702
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a very tough thing, and the only point I was making here is that I want us to

3157
04:34:01,483 --> 04:34:09,425
[SPEAKER_25]: speak about our residents and our family members and our friends and maybe parents at the Roberts who are currently in recovery and maybe they're walking their kids to school right now.

3158
04:34:09,965 --> 04:34:15,626
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe they take methadone or Suboxone and maybe they're just in your community right now as we speak.

3159
04:34:16,206 --> 04:34:19,247
[SPEAKER_25]: So the way that we talk about each other should be respectful and kind.

3160
04:34:21,907 --> 04:34:23,007
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

3161
04:34:23,027 --> 04:34:24,588
[SPEAKER_26]: Appreciate that clarification.

3162
04:34:24,708 --> 04:34:30,329
[SPEAKER_26]: Before we go to our final hand on Zoom, I just want to segue from that to recenter that again.

3163
04:34:31,473 --> 04:34:35,355
[SPEAKER_26]: The city council will not be taking a vote on where this use ought to go.

3164
04:34:35,415 --> 04:34:37,816
[SPEAKER_26]: We do not have the authority to take a vote on that matter.

3165
04:34:37,836 --> 04:34:44,599
[SPEAKER_26]: The resolution before us tonight is not a referendum on the efficacy of methadone.

3166
04:34:44,939 --> 04:34:47,500
[SPEAKER_26]: We know that it is a medication that is used to treat a disease.

3167
04:34:48,741 --> 04:34:52,643
[SPEAKER_26]: Substance use disorder is like every disease, not something that anybody chooses.

3168
04:34:54,103 --> 04:34:59,786
[SPEAKER_26]: And all patients should be treated with dignity and given every ability to

3169
04:35:00,612 --> 04:35:01,192
[SPEAKER_26]: receive care.

3170
04:35:01,212 --> 04:35:16,102
[SPEAKER_26]: And I thank the counselor for recentering us on the intent of her resolution, which is to affirm that throughout the community of Medford, which is of course, and unfortunately, yet another community that has been ravaged by the opioid epidemic.

3171
04:35:16,962 --> 04:35:22,546
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm glad to see us having discussions about how to best address that within our community for community members.

3172
04:35:23,687 --> 04:35:25,268
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll go to Tony on Zoom.

3173
04:35:26,148 --> 04:35:27,229
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address for the record.

3174
04:35:32,866 --> 04:35:36,109
[SPEAKER_47]: I just wanted to chime in.

3175
04:35:36,129 --> 04:35:58,566
[SPEAKER_47]: I know most people, I don't want to repeat what most people have said, but one of the points that I want to just talk about real quick is, again, this is a for-profit business and I think the business owners of this facility have made a business decision by putting this on Route 60, which is a thoroughfare into Malden where there is already a clinic available.

3176
04:35:58,626 --> 04:36:00,588
[SPEAKER_47]: I think this business is just trying to

3177
04:36:01,128 --> 04:36:06,010
[SPEAKER_47]: get the people to get an earlier stop rather than go into Malden off of Route 93.

3178
04:36:06,651 --> 04:36:11,733
[SPEAKER_47]: It's not a good decision to put this in this area for obvious reasons that everyone spoke about.

3179
04:36:11,753 --> 04:36:14,954
[SPEAKER_47]: We definitely need treatment facilities, no argument there.

3180
04:36:16,275 --> 04:36:24,159
[SPEAKER_47]: Perhaps they consider someplace like at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital or a treatment facility that's already there that has vacant spaces.

3181
04:36:26,351 --> 04:36:30,973
[SPEAKER_47]: Again, I know you're not voting on a resolution tonight, but I just appreciate the platform to talk about this.

3182
04:36:31,174 --> 04:36:31,814
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you so much.

3183
04:36:33,835 --> 04:36:34,135
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

3184
04:36:36,036 --> 04:36:37,277
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further comment from councilors?

3185
04:36:37,977 --> 04:36:38,958
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there a motion on the floor?

3186
04:36:40,318 --> 04:36:42,439
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to receive and place on file.

3187
04:36:42,780 --> 04:36:43,000
[SPEAKER_25]: Second.

3188
04:36:43,660 --> 04:36:47,582
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to receive and place on file, offered by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by President Bears.

3189
04:36:50,003 --> 04:36:51,044
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

3190
04:37:02,114 --> 04:37:02,314
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3191
04:37:02,554 --> 04:37:02,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

3192
04:37:04,014 --> 04:37:04,154
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3193
04:37:04,174 --> 04:37:04,294
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3194
04:37:04,314 --> 04:37:04,434
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3195
04:37:04,474 --> 04:37:04,795
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3196
04:37:04,915 --> 04:37:05,095
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3197
04:37:05,655 --> 04:37:18,317
[SPEAKER_50]: Seven favor none opposed motion passes most of the most take paper 24416 wish to spend the rules and take.

3198
04:37:33,353 --> 04:37:34,674
[SPEAKER_26]: Whatever it was, I'll let you say it again.

3199
04:37:34,854 --> 04:37:36,796
[SPEAKER_50]: It's the Arabian American here.

3200
04:37:36,956 --> 04:37:37,617
[SPEAKER_50]: It's our one, yeah.

3201
04:37:38,057 --> 04:37:38,317
[SPEAKER_50]: It's late.

3202
04:37:43,682 --> 04:37:44,843
[SPEAKER_50]: Just want to please call the roll.

3203
04:37:54,811 --> 04:37:55,732
[SPEAKER_26]: We're taking it from the table.

3204
04:37:55,792 --> 04:37:56,252
[SPEAKER_26]: How's it going?

3205
04:38:00,636 --> 04:38:01,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, thank you.

3206
04:38:02,930 --> 04:38:03,571
[SPEAKER_50]: Vice President.

3207
04:38:03,691 --> 04:38:04,852
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3208
04:38:04,892 --> 04:38:05,113
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3209
04:38:06,194 --> 04:38:07,656
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3210
04:38:08,256 --> 04:38:08,477
Yes.

3211
04:38:10,119 --> 04:38:10,980
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3212
04:38:11,000 --> 04:38:11,240
[SPEAKER_50]: Yes.

3213
04:38:11,520 --> 04:38:11,741
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

3214
04:38:11,801 --> 04:38:22,454
[SPEAKER_39]: I mean from the negative motion passes to 4416 offered by President President Vice President Collins be resolved that the member city council recognize and celebrate Caribbean American Heritage Month Vice President Collins.

3215
04:38:22,793 --> 04:38:26,156
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, President Bears, and thank you for co-sponsoring this resolution with me.

3216
04:38:26,176 --> 04:38:32,662
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm very happy to recognize and celebrate Caribbean American Heritage Month.

3217
04:38:33,142 --> 04:38:45,233
[SPEAKER_26]: We have many community members that are part of this vibrant community here in Medford, and it's great to have an opportunity to acknowledge these folks who hail from the Caribbean and have landed in Medford.

3218
04:38:45,954 --> 04:38:54,436
[SPEAKER_26]: sometimes for a short time, sometimes for many generations, and to celebrate the ways that their culture and their contributions add so much to our community here in Medford.

3219
04:38:54,476 --> 04:38:58,177
[SPEAKER_26]: So a happy Caribbean American Heritage Month to us all.

3220
04:38:58,957 --> 04:39:00,997
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

3221
04:39:01,217 --> 04:39:01,897
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Tseng.

3222
04:39:02,758 --> 04:39:03,158
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

3223
04:39:04,718 --> 04:39:12,460
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a very, you know, happy occasion for the Caribbean American members of our community.

3224
04:39:14,434 --> 04:39:31,503
[SPEAKER_37]: There's not much I'm going to say that isn't repeating what Vice President Collins has already said, but we have a very vibrant Haitian community here, very vibrant Puerto Rican American community here, in addition to a lot of other Caribbean nations whose immigrants have come to America and called Medford home.

3225
04:39:33,364 --> 04:39:38,447
[SPEAKER_37]: This is in the spirit of making everyone feel and feel accepted as a part of our community.

3226
04:39:38,847 --> 04:39:42,829
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm very excited to celebrate this month with all of our neighbors.

3227
04:39:43,976 --> 04:39:45,297
[SPEAKER_39]: Any councilor saying any further comment?

3228
04:39:46,677 --> 04:40:01,283
[SPEAKER_39]: Seeing none, just want to acknowledge this is a month, a heritage month that is acknowledged and created by the federal government under presidents of all parties, congresses of all parties, and has been around since the early 2000s.

3229
04:40:01,343 --> 04:40:04,884
[SPEAKER_39]: So it is just another great thing to celebrate.

3230
04:40:04,924 --> 04:40:09,806
[SPEAKER_39]: And thank you to all of our residents from Caribbean American communities who make

3231
04:40:11,013 --> 04:40:24,662
[SPEAKER_39]: up a wonderful part of the tapestry that is on the motion of vice-president Collins to approve seconded by councilor saying Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3232
04:40:24,702 --> 04:40:24,902
