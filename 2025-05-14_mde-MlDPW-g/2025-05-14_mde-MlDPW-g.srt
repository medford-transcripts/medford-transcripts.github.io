[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully Councilor Scarpelli will be able to join us.

8
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:45,134
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the meantime, we can get started.

[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli, I believe, is absent as well, but I don't, I'm just going to call his name.

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:30,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see him.

[SPEAKER_09]: Three present, two absent.

25
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:41,137
[SPEAKER_09]: The meeting is called to order.

26
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:50,099
[SPEAKER_09]: The action discussion item for this meeting is, once again, paper 24-033, Zoning Ordinance Updates with the NS Associates team.

27
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,841
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the 25th Zoning Updates project meeting that we've had with NS Associates in this committee.

28
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:04,626
[SPEAKER_09]: The topic for this committee meeting, we are beginning a new part of our zoning map tonight.

29
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:12,470
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be a preliminary discussion on what we're calling the, quote unquote, other corridors part of the map.

30
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:22,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Before I hand it over to Paola for the substantive presentation that she has prepared, just want to quickly set the table with what do we mean when we're talking about some of the other corridors in the city.

31
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:25,118
[SPEAKER_09]: In no way is this intended to

32
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:29,988
[SPEAKER_09]: rank the importance or centrality of any of the corridors in the city.

33
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:30,949
[SPEAKER_09]: We certainly have a lot of them.

34
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:37,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Earlier in this process, we rezoned two very prominent large corridors in the city where there was a lot of active development pressure.

35
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:39,752
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we moved those earlier in the queue.

36
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:45,534
[SPEAKER_09]: That being, of course, Mystic Avenue Corridor District and Salem Street Corridor District, now both ordained.

37
00:17:46,835 --> 00:18:00,527
[SPEAKER_09]: At this point in the process, at the same time as working through several other proposals we are applying a lot of the same zoning principles to a batch of other smaller main drags and thoroughfares in the city to make sure that they also get a tailored

38
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:17,556
[SPEAKER_09]: approach that's right for well corridors a mix of potentially higher density residential and mixed use that is appropriate for these places where there might be increased transit access a lot of existing density existing mixed use existing ground floor commercial activation.

39
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:19,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight we're going to be talking about

40
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:29,739
[SPEAKER_09]: High Street in between West Medford and Arlington, Harvard Avenue, parts of Boston Avenue, Main Street and South Medford, and the Broadway Corridor District.

41
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:36,460
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do want to make really clear up top, this is not the meeting where we're going to be reviewing a draft of Tufts Institutional Zoning.

42
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:44,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the plan is to begin reviewing that draft on May 28, but the zoning consultant is going to spend more time

43
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:51,428
[SPEAKER_09]: reviewing that zone and resuming and reviewing the feedback from the May 1st community forum before that draft is presented.

44
00:18:52,649 --> 00:19:07,543
[SPEAKER_09]: At this meeting, we'll also begin talking about the neighborhood nodes strategy, wherein we can put kind of a really tailored amount, small amount of commercial activation or allow a small and tailored amount of commercial activation into the fabric of the residential parts of the city.

45
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:19,458
[SPEAKER_09]: With that, I know Paola is going to go into a lot more detail about all of these topics, so I'll leave it there unless any city staff or committee members have anything they'd like to say before we dive in.

46
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And seeing none, Paola, go ahead.

47
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:27,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for being here.

48
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everyone.

49
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:38,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Chair, if I may, I will start to share the presentation.

50
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:03,324
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as

51
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:17,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Collins said, we are starting with a new topic.

52
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:40,968
[SPEAKER_03]: This means that we are just bringing some ideas and that we expect from city staff, from city councillors and from the public to give us comments and so that we can build on a draft for the next time.

53
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:51,477
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a brief introduction of why are we here, what are we doing, a bit of the process timeline.

54
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:58,044
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing several parts of the zoning at the same time in different

55
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:00,602
[SPEAKER_03]: parts of the process.

56
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:11,725
[SPEAKER_03]: So we try to give the updates of when new dates for meetings, et cetera, how are going.

57
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:20,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we will go into the analysis and previous versions that we have been working on, on those different topics.

58
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:27,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will go into the other corridors and this neighborhood commercial.

59
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:29,390
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing that idea.

60
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,811
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are we doing here?

61
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,792
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a long, it's been a long process and continues.

62
00:21:37,273 --> 00:21:39,453
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been for more than a year doing this.

63
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:48,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what we're doing is taking the everything that was done, all the principles about zoning that was done in the comprehensive plan.

64
00:21:49,345 --> 00:21:57,031
[SPEAKER_03]: that was published in January 2023 and also from the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan that was published on April 2022.

65
00:21:58,372 --> 00:22:14,185
[SPEAKER_03]: We took all those principles and strategies and goals that are related with zoning and we are going through the zoning and trying to pull those together and update the zoning with these principles in mind.

66
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:20,458
[SPEAKER_03]: From that comprehensive plan, there was this vision map that you see here.

67
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:30,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So they divided the areas in the corridors, squares, civic and institutional areas, and then the residential from low to high density.

68
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:33,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have taken a similar approach.

69
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:41,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are taking this corridors individually, the squares individually, all the residential districts,

70
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:47,868
[SPEAKER_03]: and the institutional districts, and then making different proposals.

71
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:55,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, a lot of time there is a back and forth, so we are updating things as long as we go with the other topics.

72
00:22:56,531 --> 00:23:01,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these are specific and some of the principles are also to be applied citywide.

73
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:13,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So how this process works is that first we bring a topic as we are going to do today with the other corridors to the city council to this plan and permitting committee meetings.

74
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:25,756
[SPEAKER_03]: We hear from the public, then we go to the city council again, planning and permitting committee meeting, and we present those changes and the draft for the zoning.

75
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:33,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they agree with it, they will refer it to the CDB, which is the Community Development Board.

76
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:39,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So that topic that was referred from the city council goes to the city board.

77
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It is presented.

78
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:48,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we hear from the public and comments and the city board takes recommendations from the city staff or from the public.

79
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:53,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also referred back with their recommendations to the city council.

80
00:23:53,908 --> 00:24:02,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally is voted on at the city council again at that last moment also public comments.

81
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,080
[SPEAKER_03]: are being taken.

82
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:14,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So in every part of this process, we hear from the public and we adapt and recommend according to what is being said.

83
00:24:14,464 --> 00:24:18,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So your participation in this process is very, very crucial and important.

84
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:26,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the planning and permitting committee meetings, you will have them all these dates in the web.

85
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:33,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the events calendar, you can see when the public, when the planning and permitting committee meetings are.

86
00:24:33,957 --> 00:24:39,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in each one of these meetings, we are presenting topics, discussing about all this process.

87
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:43,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So today, May 14th, we are talking about other corridors.

88
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,800
[SPEAKER_03]: In May 28th, so the next meeting,

89
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:54,863
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be about other corridors again, so we will bring a draft and we will discuss as well Medford Tubs.

90
00:24:55,504 --> 00:25:03,668
[SPEAKER_03]: In June 11, it will be parking in TDM and this is a citywide recommendations and we will see Wellington after that.

91
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:12,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so community development boards, so everything that gets referred from the city council goes into the city board.

92
00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:25,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and right now we are at, um, sorry, there is a little bit mistake here because in May 21st we will be, uh, continue with residential districts.

93
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:28,047
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry for that, there is a typo there.

94
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:42,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next one will be May 21st and we will continue with the discussion of the residential districts that we've been doing in the last, it's going to be the fourth meeting about this topic.

95
00:25:43,282 --> 00:25:49,208
[SPEAKER_03]: The scores and ADUs were referred from the city council, but it will become next to the city board.

96
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:52,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have the public meetings.

97
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:56,176
[SPEAKER_03]: The next two that we are doing is in May 29th.

98
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:59,637
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing exactly this topic, other corridors.

99
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:06,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in June 9th, we will present a very of the current situation.

100
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:08,220
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to hear from all of you.

101
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:16,642
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think or what would you like to see as in the parking regulations and transport?

102
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:19,284
[SPEAKER_03]: management.

103
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:26,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a little bit more by topic and all the different steps.

104
00:26:27,372 --> 00:26:30,435
[SPEAKER_03]: This meeting, this slide should be on the

105
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,361
[SPEAKER_03]: on the agenda or it will be in the web so you can look at it more carefully.

106
00:26:36,401 --> 00:26:39,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the same, just in a different way.

107
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:44,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we are starting with the other corridors, we see here we are in the first step.

108
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:52,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next one, next meeting, we will have the other corridors again, et cetera.

109
00:26:52,585 --> 00:26:59,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next steps will be added as long as we know for sure what are we going to do in the next meetings.

110
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:03,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So more on the topic.

111
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:05,659
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have some, sorry.

112
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:15,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the last proposal for the residential district.

113
00:27:16,314 --> 00:27:20,116
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said before, we are doing some back and forth.

114
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:28,560
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing the residential districts, also looking into the corridors and some things will fit the others.

115
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So some things can, especially in the edges, can change and shift a little bit.

116
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:37,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the latest that we present

117
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:47,098
[SPEAKER_03]: on the city board the latest update map for the residential districts and these are all the non-residential only districts.

118
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:51,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are talking about corridors.

119
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the Mystic Avenue that was a very generic corridor.

120
00:27:55,171 --> 00:28:00,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have the others, more neighborhood corridors that are, we did Salem Street.

121
00:28:02,093 --> 00:28:04,234
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about the squares already.

122
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:06,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So Medford Square and West Medford.

123
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:13,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are now doing all those other corridors like Main Street, Harbor Street.

124
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:17,338
[SPEAKER_03]: We will also look into Broadway and Boston Avenue.

125
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:25,940
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the very first proposal for the commercial framework.

126
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:28,779
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have a more updated version.

127
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:45,787
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one we brought together all the residential districts with the approved districts for Salem Street and Mystic, the latest updates on the squares.

128
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:49,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, this was only the framework.

129
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are the ones that we will look into today, these corridors.

130
00:28:57,322 --> 00:28:58,403
[SPEAKER_03]: and which ones those are.

131
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:03,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are looking at Boston Avenue, Main Street, Broadway, Harvard Street.

132
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:09,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in Medford West area, we are looking into High Street and Boston Avenue.

133
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:19,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So we always start with what is there and what is in your current zoning, so what is allowed right now.

134
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:26,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we have, and this is where we are going to focus today, these are the areas.

135
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:31,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we have are these districts right here, we are going to zoom in a little bit.

136
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:48,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we have is some areas with commercial 1, commercial 1 is allows residential building up to 6 stories by right commercial building up to 4 stories by right and other permitted structures to 15 stories by right.

137
00:29:49,413 --> 00:30:00,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So wherever you see this pinkish areas, we have some in Boston Avenue, we have between Harvard Street and Main Street, we have already that existing.

138
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:06,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And along Broadway, we have some of those pink areas that are commercial one districts.

139
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:12,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have apartment one, and that is a little bit more Salmon kind of color.

140
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:17,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Residential building up to three stories and commercial building is not allowed.

141
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:31,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we see is that, for example, in Main Street, we do have existing commercial buildings, commercial uses that in this area, it's not allowed with this current.

142
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:35,284
[SPEAKER_03]: with this current district.

143
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:41,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have industrial that are permitted building, industrial buildings up to two stories.

144
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:48,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Office two, that's this very magenta kind of color, very flashy pink.

145
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,523
[SPEAKER_03]: And those permit six stories by right.

146
00:30:54,180 --> 00:31:15,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have the orange, that's general residential is single unit, two unit, and right now the ADU will also be allowed, and some more yellow single family that we see mainly in West Medford High Street area, that is single unit dwelling and ADUs.

147
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:16,432
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your current zoning.

148
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:19,714
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what is existing in the zoning right now.

149
00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:31,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are some issues with what is there as, for example, the uses that a lot of these commercial uses that are existing are not allowed within your current zoning.

150
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:36,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a little bit more of in-depth.

151
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:53,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Your zoning is a little bit different from others in the sense that it's not the district that regulates the standards, the dimension standards, but within the district that are different uses and the uses regulate different dimensional standards.

152
00:31:55,261 --> 00:32:00,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a little bit more in-depth of all the dimension standards that are currently in your zoning.

153
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:06,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want, we can talk about that later.

154
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:13,162
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to go with the proposal.

155
00:32:13,523 --> 00:32:18,785
[SPEAKER_03]: But if anyone has any doubt, we can go back to the tables and answer any questions.

156
00:32:20,686 --> 00:32:21,687
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a proposal.

157
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:23,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is where we are.

158
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:26,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to zoom in the area that we're looking for.

159
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:34,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we have is we propose these different uses.

160
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:44,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have mixed use 1B, mixed use 2A, mixed use 2B, and then we go to urban residential 2.

161
00:32:44,983 --> 00:32:48,606
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is mainly the districts that we are using in this area.

162
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:54,651
[SPEAKER_03]: These are districts that we've been using on the squares mainly.

163
00:32:55,205 --> 00:33:07,331
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've seen and are familiar with the squares, these are the same dimension of standards and the same industries that we are using there.

164
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:21,377
[SPEAKER_03]: So mixed use 1B, and that is the lighter blue color that we see on Boston Avenue in some areas, on Main Street, and then on High Street,

165
00:33:22,954 --> 00:33:28,956
[SPEAKER_03]: which usually is where we already have the commercial use.

166
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:34,417
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are existing buildings that are having that use.

167
00:33:35,277 --> 00:33:41,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have mixed use 1B, which is four stories by right and allows another one.

168
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So up to five with incentive zoning.

169
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:54,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have mixed use 2A, and this is five stories by right plus two with incentive zoning, so seven with incentive zoning.

170
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:59,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we see it's this more bright blue.

171
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,851
[SPEAKER_03]: We see it also in Boston Avenue.

172
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:09,533
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have any of this in the corridors in West Medford.

173
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:14,994
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have this more in the core of the square, but we don't have it in the corridors.

174
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:19,538
[SPEAKER_03]: of High Street and Boston Avenue, West Medford area.

175
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:30,870
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have them at the south of Boston Avenue, almost with Broadway, mainly because existing that are already buildings of five stories high.

176
00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:42,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Broadway, we also have, and also in Broadway, there is a study that has been done by Medford and Somerville.

177
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:50,623
[SPEAKER_03]: So we took from the views of that study asking for, that they could go up to six stories by right.

178
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:54,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville right now allows four stories by right.

179
00:34:55,668 --> 00:35:11,398
[SPEAKER_03]: They are in this mid-rise four zoning, but the discussion and the community was asking for that up to six stories, so we have five plus two that could be with incentive zoning.

180
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:15,863
[SPEAKER_03]: We can obviously discuss about that.

181
00:35:16,963 --> 00:35:20,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have several areas, usually it's in crossings.

182
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:27,508
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Harvard with Mystic, which already as your current zoning allows six by right.

183
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:32,831
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're doing is having five by right plus two with incentive zoning.

184
00:35:34,472 --> 00:35:42,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have in front of the park in some areas where we have crossings.

185
00:35:43,116 --> 00:35:44,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um.

186
00:35:45,418 --> 00:35:51,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we think that there is enough depth to go up to 7 and being able to decrease then towards the.

187
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,986
[SPEAKER_03]: That we are able to have a transition towards the.

188
00:35:57,867 --> 00:36:01,410
[SPEAKER_03]: The residential neighborhoods, we allow for that.

189
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Height of the mix used to a.

190
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:16,435
[SPEAKER_03]: If the area is not that deep, then we go to the mixed-use 1B, so four stories by right plus one incentive zoning.

191
00:36:18,657 --> 00:36:29,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have mixed-use 2B that is pretty much located in one area, what you have right now as office two.

192
00:36:31,887 --> 00:36:35,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And we allow seven stories by right plus two with incentive zoning.

193
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,132
[SPEAKER_03]: These areas are quite big lots.

194
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:43,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the rail tracks are going along that area.

195
00:36:44,657 --> 00:36:49,341
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to provide, if there is a future T station,

196
00:36:51,462 --> 00:37:01,751
[SPEAKER_03]: in this area that could give us flexibility to be able to up zone, to be able to build some residential buildings in that area.

197
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:08,017
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is enough space to transition towards the residential districts.

198
00:37:10,137 --> 00:37:27,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the rest is mainly urban residential too, and this allows townhouse, three-unit dwelling, multiplex from four to six, multiple-unit dwelling plus six, so there is not a cap on the units, the residential units.

199
00:37:29,687 --> 00:37:32,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And then ADU for one, two and three unit dwelling.

200
00:37:32,331 --> 00:37:41,925
[SPEAKER_03]: The one and two are not permitted as new, but will be protected by the zoning and by general law.

201
00:37:42,446 --> 00:37:44,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those could have an ADU.

202
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:52,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And this could go up to 3 stories maximum, and we are adding 1 as incentive zoning.

203
00:37:53,073 --> 00:38:00,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all these urban residential 2 areas could go up to 4 with incentive zoning.

204
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:01,517
[SPEAKER_03]: By right would be 3.

205
00:38:04,736 --> 00:38:07,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So we go now to neighborhood commercial hubs.

206
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,880
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not very long, so that's why I'm going to do it.

207
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,284
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just to present what they are and the strategy that we could follow.

208
00:38:19,085 --> 00:38:26,089
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only two slides, so I'm going to just go directly into this so that we can comment all of it.

209
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So neighborhood hubs,

210
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:44,483
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, in Milwaukee, Oregon, they have these neighborhood hubs, and they call it as gathering places where residents have easy access to goods and services close to their homes.

211
00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:50,288
[SPEAKER_03]: These zones are designated for small business, so we will have that

212
00:38:50,926 --> 00:38:58,971
[SPEAKER_03]: arranged with minimum and also maximum surface that serve and are located near or within residential areas.

213
00:38:59,611 --> 00:39:04,014
[SPEAKER_03]: This is mainly for those residential districts, not for the corridors.

214
00:39:04,294 --> 00:39:15,000
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be, but not really for the areas that already have the surface, but more for the neighborhood areas that do not have easy access.

215
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:24,316
[SPEAKER_03]: that they would have to take their car and go to a specific area to do their groceries, et cetera.

216
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:35,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So to serve those neighborhood areas, we will designated this neighborhood commercial hubs so they could have easy access to small businesses.

217
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,621
[SPEAKER_03]: What businesses this could be?

218
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:43,923
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be convenience stores, coffee shops, dry cleaners, drug stores, barber shops, beauty salons,

219
00:39:44,492 --> 00:39:58,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything that we need, not sometimes on the daily basis, but that are those services that are very essential for our daily lives.

220
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:03,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And that makes it a lot easier if they are within a walking distance.

221
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:14,341
[SPEAKER_03]: So this type of development can increase convenience for residents, reduce the need for parking areas and help create vibrant and walkable neighborhoods.

222
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:24,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And then neighborhood commercial zoning plays an essential role in meeting the everyday needs of residents while preserving the character of the community.

223
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:50,300
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not talking about bringing big buildings, super high buildings into residential areas, but bringing small businesses in house-like typologies or within a house that preserves the character of the neighborhood, but giving the possibility of having these type of uses.

224
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:55,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And how can we define them in zoning?

225
00:40:56,093 --> 00:40:59,374
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it through two different ways.

226
00:40:59,454 --> 00:41:03,094
[SPEAKER_03]: We can make them as a base district.

227
00:41:03,615 --> 00:41:07,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the districts that we are talking about are your base districts.

228
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:18,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means that whatever your parcel is located, you have a district that will tell you what uses you can do and what dimensional standards you have to adhere to.

229
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:20,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That is your base district.

230
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:24,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sometimes we also have overlay districts.

231
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And these districts will be sitting on top of your base district.

232
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:33,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you have is a choice of doing one or the other.

233
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:50,926
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these neighborhood commercial hubs, it could be that we select an area, very site-specific, and we say, here you have neighborhood commercial hubs, and these are your base district, and these are your uses, and this is what you can do.

234
00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:52,827
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be one way.

235
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:57,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one is overlay district, and that means give the choice of.

236
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:06,675
[SPEAKER_03]: You are incentivizing them, but you're not making them mandatory, you make the choice.

237
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:10,657
[SPEAKER_03]: This overlay district can be done by two ways.

238
00:42:10,817 --> 00:42:18,422
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it citywide and just say, if you meet these characteristics, you can have this overlay district.

239
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:25,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will apply in a sense everywhere, but with a certain characteristics.

240
00:42:26,621 --> 00:42:31,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what we can do is have already site-specific.

241
00:42:31,325 --> 00:42:39,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So we choose where we want to see those commercial hubs, and we make them as a choice.

242
00:42:39,912 --> 00:42:44,276
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, we already locate areas like near parks, where

243
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:56,654
[SPEAKER_03]: that are already active and that would be very beneficial for people and residents to have these other uses.

244
00:42:57,154 --> 00:43:04,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can already choose them and say, here you have the, these are going to be mainly in residential, right?

245
00:43:04,258 --> 00:43:14,385
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can choose to build your NR3, for example, you can have a single family, you can have a two units, you can have a three units.

246
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,447
[SPEAKER_03]: in your base district.

247
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:25,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And in your overlay, you can have a business in your three units or a business in the ground floor and two units above.

248
00:43:27,215 --> 00:43:35,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And these can be your dry cleaning or a cafe or co-working space.

249
00:43:36,402 --> 00:43:42,327
[SPEAKER_03]: So very specific uses and very reduced sizes of those uses.

250
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:46,256
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want a very small scale, neighborhood scale.

251
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:49,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where we are.

252
00:43:49,498 --> 00:43:54,260
[SPEAKER_03]: We are also going to bring the idea of accessory commercial units.

253
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have your, for example, three unit that it can have

254
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:09,975
[SPEAKER_03]: and like an ADU, an accessory building that has a very small cafe or has a small bakery or et cetera.

255
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:19,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So these things, we need to set the rules for those and the sizes and where they should be located, et cetera.

256
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the regulations that can go with them, but that's also something that we are exploring to bring.

257
00:44:25,183 --> 00:44:28,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, that's what we have.

258
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:33,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to stop sharing and hearing from all of you.

259
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:34,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

260
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:37,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for the presentation, Paola.

261
00:44:39,456 --> 00:44:40,317
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a great overview.

262
00:44:40,337 --> 00:44:41,938
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a substantive overview.

263
00:44:43,259 --> 00:44:50,325
[SPEAKER_09]: We kind of have two related separate topics that we're both seeing for the first time tonight, and we will come back to both of these.

264
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:52,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So if folks are just

265
00:44:53,948 --> 00:44:58,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Digesting the presentation on or that know that more comments and questions will come up in the future.

266
00:44:58,489 --> 00:44:59,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry.

267
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:03,230
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly the point of tonight just to introduce these topics and then revisit them in future meetings.

268
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:12,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So we were talking about this very initial draft of the other corridors throughout.

269
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:13,733
[SPEAKER_09]: the city.

270
00:45:14,353 --> 00:45:16,594
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're also talking about the neighborhood commercial hubs.

271
00:45:16,634 --> 00:45:28,798
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to underline something that Paola said, we're talking about the neighborhood commercial hubs specifically occurring in the parts of the city where that are not already well served by commercial and residential being well woven together.

272
00:45:29,618 --> 00:45:35,320
[SPEAKER_09]: So these would probably occur in different parts of the map, the corridors and the neighborhood commercial hubs.

273
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:41,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a few questions, but I will get to them after my fellow committee members.

274
00:45:41,302 --> 00:45:42,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan, please go ahead.

275
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:44,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

276
00:45:45,026 --> 00:45:46,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited about the neighborhood community hubs.

277
00:45:47,147 --> 00:45:53,811
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been my favorite part of zoning so far of everything that we've done.

278
00:45:54,672 --> 00:46:01,777
[SPEAKER_08]: And just my sort of initial thoughts about the types of businesses that would be there.

279
00:46:02,057 --> 00:46:04,398
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this is, I'm not married to this.

280
00:46:05,379 --> 00:46:07,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's totally up for discussion.

281
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,223
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would, I think with the concept that,

282
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:14,606
[SPEAKER_08]: These are going to be within a half mile of every home.

283
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:15,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

284
00:46:15,727 --> 00:46:23,731
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's a there's a limited sphere of no parking right so the concept is really this is for people to walk to to make us a more walkable city.

285
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:27,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I would lean toward.

286
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:34,641
[SPEAKER_08]: choosing businesses that can survive on that amount of traffic.

287
00:46:34,821 --> 00:46:45,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And by that, I kind of mean another way to think about it is that these businesses should be the kind of businesses that any one family might go to multiple times per week.

288
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think to me that means co-working.

289
00:46:48,396 --> 00:46:50,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make sure we get co-working in there.

290
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:50,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see it.

291
00:46:50,596 --> 00:46:53,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make sure that co-working is absolutely in there.

292
00:46:53,357 --> 00:46:58,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Co-working, coffee shops, bookstores, kids activities.

293
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:06,341
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think there are places that, you know, laundromat, sure, but I think there are places where

294
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:11,030
[SPEAKER_08]: you might go multiple times per week.

295
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:32,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a store that people go to only once every three months or so, like perhaps, you know, a hair salon, and I could be wrong about this, so, you know, maybe people who know more about that particular business model, I think if their primary, if we have them everywhere in the city and their primary people are only within a half mile, they may not have enough

296
00:47:32,985 --> 00:47:42,809
[SPEAKER_08]: business to survive, which is why I'm trying to think, like, what are the, what are the businesses, like a bakery, you know, like, I mean, we stopped by there, we walked by it every day on our way to school.

297
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:46,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And sadly, it means that I eat a lot of pastries because we can't help.

298
00:47:46,971 --> 00:47:49,032
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to just walk in, you know, we got to get something.

299
00:47:50,373 --> 00:48:05,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope we can think carefully about the kinds of businesses that we think will survive and will do well if in fact they are within a half mile of folks and don't have parking.

300
00:48:05,864 --> 00:48:16,271
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's truly like the design is that it's for the people who can walk there and we want to have small ones but scattered throughout the city so that everybody has their local ice cream shop, everybody has their local

301
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:31,156
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, co-working space, their local coffee shop, where they see their neighbors, and it really gives us this feeling of this neighborhood feel, where people get to know the folks that live within a half mile, mile of them.

302
00:48:36,277 --> 00:48:38,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you so much, Councilor Hellihan.

303
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:40,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a

304
00:48:43,678 --> 00:48:50,223
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great to get exactly that type of first reaction out on the record at this point in the proposal.

305
00:48:50,684 --> 00:48:51,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Going next to President Bears.

306
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:56,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there.

307
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:58,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the presentation.

308
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:00,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it looks really great.

309
00:49:01,132 --> 00:49:02,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two questions.

310
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:09,900
[SPEAKER_00]: One on the Broadway corridor.

311
00:49:11,774 --> 00:49:13,595
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have the five plus two.

312
00:49:14,696 --> 00:49:18,919
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if we want to, I mean, I can see it both ways.

313
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:37,372
[SPEAKER_00]: So just going to put out there may be a discussion of like, if we want to align it with the Somerville, if Somerville intends, and that's maybe a communication we should have with them to go to the six that's in the recommendations from the kind of joint research about because all of those lots are split between both cities.

314
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:40,615
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure we align with them.

315
00:49:41,888 --> 00:49:44,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and their intent, I, I kind of see it both ways.

316
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:50,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I like the idea of the 5 plus 2, because then if they want to go to 6, then there's incentive.

317
00:49:50,973 --> 00:49:54,155
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's not that it's not aligned in that sense.

318
00:49:54,215 --> 00:49:56,997
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that there's more community benefit from the alignment.

319
00:49:57,157 --> 00:49:57,417
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

320
00:49:58,017 --> 00:50:00,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stick there, but also.

321
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:03,781
[SPEAKER_00]: If the folks are just going to go to the buy, right?

322
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:07,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an important discussion for us to have.

323
00:50:09,149 --> 00:50:13,790
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wonder about the alignment on the dimensionals to, you know, I don't know what they're intending over there.

324
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:18,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if they're going to keep this same dimensionals, generally, is there for district?

325
00:50:18,951 --> 00:50:19,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

326
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:22,651
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just some thoughts on that.

327
00:50:22,711 --> 00:50:24,372
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's just an added level of.

328
00:50:24,892 --> 00:50:29,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Complexity because of the coordination with the planning department.

329
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:35,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then on the neighborhood nodes hubs, whatever we want to end up calling them.

330
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:44,496
[SPEAKER_00]: I would lean towards node over hub because I don't know that they will be hubs in practice.

331
00:50:45,756 --> 00:50:48,577
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think there's kind of different implications.

332
00:50:51,557 --> 00:51:05,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Hub implies a level of traffic and gathering that maybe isn't going to end up being there, kind of to Councilor Callaghan's point, like it really is a foot traffic oriented

333
00:51:07,843 --> 00:51:36,249
[SPEAKER_00]: a place for people to come and get some basic commercial services close to them but not necessarily a place where we intend to have big gatherings so it's just like totally word semantic and I know I'm just kind of going into that but that has been a part of I think our conversation and this whole process is how do we pick words that residents and property owners and people reading our zoning

334
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:38,292
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what they mean.

335
00:51:38,452 --> 00:51:39,813
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a thought on that.

336
00:51:40,233 --> 00:51:48,739
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am really interested in the different options around the base district versus the citywide overlay versus the site-specific overlay.

337
00:51:48,759 --> 00:52:04,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering, you know, I'm really wondering how what you talked about, Paola, with the characteristics element, like how that constrains or allows, you know, in both ways, what can go where?

338
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:05,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Because

339
00:52:05,975 --> 00:52:13,898
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think there are a lot of places that, you know, either pre zoning or pre the 60s zoning, like have these kinds of things.

340
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the zoning made them nonconforming.

341
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:29,184
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the places where I think focusing the nodes discussion really works because we actually have, you know, I think we should identify if there are neighborhoods where that's really not something that happened and make sure that we don't leave them out.

342
00:52:29,264 --> 00:52:33,705
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also think for the neighborhoods where it does exist, like that's where we should focus the nodes and.

343
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:51,999
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wonder, of those three options, which of those allows us to do the most and like I'm not, I think the base district thing I don't want to have a million little base districts everywhere like I think that's an option that just makes things complicated.

344
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:56,585
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I worry on the overlay does the city wide thing, maybe.

345
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Expand this into places where it doesn't really make sense.

346
00:52:59,831 --> 00:53:02,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just because of how the characteristics conversation works.

347
00:53:02,332 --> 00:53:02,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

348
00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:05,914
[SPEAKER_00]: It pushes me into kind of the site specific overlay.

349
00:53:06,694 --> 00:53:11,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Idea, um, but that also creates, you know.

350
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:16,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically, I'm saying, I think the overlay makes more sense than the base districts.

351
00:53:16,898 --> 00:53:20,540
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wonder how does the city wide versus the site specific.

352
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:29,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that these are in the targeted places we want and then if we go site specific, what's our process going to be for identifying especially places that neighborhoods.

353
00:53:30,046 --> 00:53:34,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we don't have this existing type of infrastructure.

354
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:38,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, community infrastructure, I mean.

355
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,059
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to go about that?

356
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:53,883
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just kind of if we really think that the citywide with the constraints basically means that these are mostly going to be in the same types of places that we have those existing uses and things now, that's great.

357
00:53:55,184 --> 00:53:58,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can see how that works, that makes sense to me.

358
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:10,689
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if it's not, then I think we have to look at the site specific just to make sure, you know, there's not a weird lot or a few weird lots in certain parts of the city that would end up having this kind of thing allowed on them and then actually

359
00:54:11,887 --> 00:54:13,867
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't make sense for whatever reason.

360
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:18,528
[SPEAKER_00]: The street can't handle it, or it's actually really close to something else.

361
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:20,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's just some weird externalities.

362
00:54:20,209 --> 00:54:27,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure in practice, even if we did it, like people are in the market and property owners aren't going to build things that don't make sense in some sense.

363
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:34,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think that's a guarantee, but I don't think they're going to put like a, you know, convenience store in the middle of the Brooks estate or something.

364
00:54:34,632 --> 00:54:34,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

365
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:35,772
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't make any sense.

366
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:36,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

367
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:41,119
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just worry that there's kind of an externality there depending on which direction we go.

368
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:46,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to interrogate and talk about that, the model a little bit more and what approach makes the most sense.

369
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:47,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

370
00:54:49,946 --> 00:54:50,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Bears.

371
00:54:51,347 --> 00:54:53,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Important questions to be bringing up at this part in the process.

372
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll recognize Director Hunt.

373
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:56,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Please go ahead.

374
00:54:58,893 --> 00:54:59,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, good evening.

375
00:55:00,448 --> 00:55:12,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And just as an aside, I do want to mention and introduce that Christian, and I'm not going to slaughter your last name right now, is a new graduate student in our office who is very interested in zoning.

376
00:55:12,995 --> 00:55:18,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've actually already introduced him to Claire at Burbys, and he's going to be helping us with zoning.

377
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:21,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to say that as an aside.

378
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:29,905
[SPEAKER_04]: As I'm looking at the map, so one thing I'm trying to keep in my head, I didn't actually take notes the way I did last night.

379
00:55:30,843 --> 00:55:43,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we're present bears mentions the Broadway corridor, I think it would make sense for Danielle and I to reach out to our counterparts over in Somerville, and just ask them like what's their plan and what's on their radar.

380
00:55:44,211 --> 00:55:51,856
[SPEAKER_04]: They're happy to have, you know, candid conversations about with us about what's what's happening to help us understand what makes the most sense.

381
00:55:52,476 --> 00:56:04,210
[SPEAKER_04]: It does make sense to align our zoning as closely as possible to theirs, particularly for the parcels that are split into the boat into the two cities.

382
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:10,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can absolutely talk to them about what their plans are I will tell you that was what was in the.

383
00:56:11,218 --> 00:56:18,464
[SPEAKER_04]: the document that came out of the Broadway Corridor Study, they're very much in alignment with that document, right?

384
00:56:18,524 --> 00:56:27,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That document was very heavily influenced by outreach and communications and working with the public, and then how did that fit with, sit well with the staff.

385
00:56:30,018 --> 00:56:35,622
[SPEAKER_04]: The question that I think is the open question is like, is that like a one year plan or like a seven year plan?

386
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:36,943
[SPEAKER_04]: That I don't know.

387
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:45,569
[SPEAKER_04]: We can ask them and I'm not sure that it matters because it would be nice for us to put in the zoning in place.

388
00:56:45,629 --> 00:56:49,192
[SPEAKER_04]: If we knew that they were planning to go there in seven years, just do it now.

389
00:56:49,312 --> 00:56:50,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do it?

390
00:56:50,213 --> 00:56:50,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Why wait?

391
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,522
[SPEAKER_04]: don't come back and notice that they've changed their zoning and change zoning.

392
00:56:56,142 --> 00:57:04,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, there was so much outreach and study in that Broadway corridor that my recommendation would be to align with the Broadway corridor study.

393
00:57:06,386 --> 00:57:07,807
[SPEAKER_04]: So that one piece.

394
00:57:09,407 --> 00:57:12,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, I've been kind of eyeballing some of this.

395
00:57:12,148 --> 00:57:18,571
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a few places where I'm kind of like, why commercial there and not, why mixed use there and not residential?

396
00:57:20,372 --> 00:57:32,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just residential and mostly that's coming out for so just as an FYI, there are actually multiple parks in our town in our city that have the name Brooks.

397
00:57:34,224 --> 00:57:38,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you say Brooks Park, there are three different locations you may be referring to.

398
00:57:39,226 --> 00:57:57,632
[SPEAKER_04]: So on this corridor on Main Street, the Brooks Park that is there kind of across from the Royal House, those are the two white splotches are the Royal House Park and the Brooks Park.

399
00:57:58,452 --> 00:57:59,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm certain that's a Brooks Park.

400
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:05,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious why so much commercial mixed-use around.

401
00:58:06,489 --> 00:58:08,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a strong feeling of it.

402
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:19,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one area that jumped out to me that is mostly resident, that is, I thought, completely residential, but we're basically taking the main street corridor and running it all the way up and down.

403
00:58:20,484 --> 00:58:21,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just noticing it.

404
00:58:22,987 --> 00:58:26,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I did wanna sort of flip to the commercial nodes.

405
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:33,131
[SPEAKER_04]: My feeling on the commercial nodes is that those have grown organically in a number of locations in the city.

406
00:58:33,871 --> 00:58:37,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Those locations should get this treatment.

407
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:41,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm leaning towards an overlay because I don't wanna force it on people.

408
00:58:41,794 --> 00:58:46,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wanna require mixed use in these residential areas.

409
00:58:46,855 --> 00:58:51,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna say that if a commercial use makes sense, let's go for it.

410
00:58:52,163 --> 00:59:00,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we should look at what businesses are in these little areas and definitely allow those.

411
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:06,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we wanna go a little broader to encourage other things like the coworking, great.

412
00:59:07,155 --> 00:59:12,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very familiar up in North Medford where we have a corner store that also sells ice cream.

413
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:16,001
[SPEAKER_04]: It sells Kino, which may be part of what keeps it alive up there.

414
00:59:17,543 --> 00:59:19,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have Jim's Market, which is basically

415
00:59:21,155 --> 00:59:23,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to call it an old fashioned subs and French fries.

416
00:59:23,677 --> 00:59:26,418
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell French fries and e-boys.

417
00:59:26,899 --> 00:59:28,980
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to have a hair salon up there.

418
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:36,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure why it closed, unless it was completely because the owner sold the property and the new owner made it all residential.

419
00:59:37,305 --> 00:59:43,449
[SPEAKER_04]: There is also some sort of stained glass company up there.

420
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:49,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Not saying we should be encouraging something like that, but there is a very interesting little

421
00:59:51,968 --> 00:59:56,473
[SPEAKER_04]: industrial building in the middle of Fulton Heights.

422
00:59:57,314 --> 01:00:04,441
[SPEAKER_04]: And then looking down at Classic Cafe that's over right close to the park on Central Ave.

423
01:00:05,382 --> 01:00:11,989
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I actually, through this process, became aware that there is a bunch of little businesses

424
01:00:12,878 --> 01:00:20,182
[SPEAKER_04]: down and off the top of my head, I'm gonna say it's down in the South Medford area.

425
01:00:21,363 --> 01:00:28,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we should be sort of saying, one of the things we don't have, I don't have it at my fingertips, is what are the current uses in all of these areas?

426
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:32,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be really useful for us to be looking at.

427
01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:37,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that we're sort of looking at those as well.

428
01:00:37,591 --> 01:00:41,754
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a little corner with like three or four businesses

429
01:00:42,534 --> 01:00:46,395
[SPEAKER_04]: down in South Medford in the middle of the residential area.

430
01:00:47,476 --> 01:00:56,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think we should be recognizing those and making those allowable and maybe encouraging growth.

431
01:00:56,839 --> 01:01:09,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather see four or five businesses in a corner in the middle of a residential district than one business here and three blocks later another business and three blocks later another business.

432
01:01:09,242 --> 01:01:10,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they should be grouped together.

433
01:01:12,221 --> 01:01:15,904
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think is what I've seen naturally occurring for the most part.

434
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:21,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I kind of wanted to flag on all of this.

435
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:23,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

436
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:24,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

437
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:25,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Very useful.

438
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:28,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go to Paola.

439
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:32,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

440
01:01:33,936 --> 01:01:36,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Chair, if I may.

441
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:38,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for the comments.

442
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:39,439
[SPEAKER_03]: These are great comments.

443
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:45,630
[SPEAKER_03]: About the Broadway corridor, absolutely.

444
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:54,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be great if we can talk to Somerville and see what they are thinking.

445
01:01:55,335 --> 01:01:58,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, they have less than what is in the vision.

446
01:01:59,617 --> 01:02:04,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they would also have to update their zoning with the vision.

447
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:24,255
[SPEAKER_03]: To us, it made sense to go in the Broadway to go up to that six stories high instead of pushing it to more on the back so that the highest buildings would be there.

448
01:02:25,555 --> 01:02:34,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to have that conversation with Somerville so that we can really be in the same line with the Broadway corridor.

449
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:43,586
[SPEAKER_03]: about the neighborhood hubs and the name, we can totally look for it.

450
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:51,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I think hub is more about that is a collection of, right, like it is a higher density of

451
01:02:51,773 --> 01:02:54,355
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial in that specific area.

452
01:02:54,475 --> 01:03:00,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So being just a group of, and that's how we've found them in zoning.

453
01:03:02,299 --> 01:03:05,201
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can also look for nodes and we can change it to node.

454
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:07,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's more like, it seems like a smaller scale.

455
01:03:07,803 --> 01:03:09,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes total sense for us.

456
01:03:13,439 --> 01:03:22,368
[SPEAKER_03]: We are also thinking that not using it as the base, but to use them as overlaid makes a lot of sense.

457
01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:44,305
[SPEAKER_03]: and we can look instead of doing citywide our recommendation will be study where do we want them where they are naturally occurring but also where do we think it would be interesting I think near parks and open space makes a lot of sense to have that group because then you have you profit from one activity and the other

458
01:03:45,705 --> 01:03:54,587
[SPEAKER_03]: as well to have them group in smaller areas instead of having one here, two blocks away another.

459
01:03:54,887 --> 01:04:03,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to have that activity more, even though we are not looking at a lot, we are looking at small areas.

460
01:04:04,389 --> 01:04:10,990
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not congested or anything, but to have a group, smaller groups together.

461
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:18,898
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are thinking also leaning towards overlay and being site specific.

462
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:21,179
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can study the criteria.

463
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:30,267
[SPEAKER_03]: We will look obviously the already naturally occurring where they are and how we can use those areas.

464
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:34,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if we need others where those could be.

465
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are leaning towards that strategy.

466
01:04:38,344 --> 01:04:46,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And about the main street, we do have that bigger mixed-use in the beginning.

467
01:04:47,549 --> 01:04:50,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the site, there are

468
01:04:51,455 --> 01:05:11,412
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of like in one block you have one business, in another block you have two, in another block you have another one, so it seemed when you have a mixed use district you can have only residential, it doesn't mean that you have to do a mixed building

469
01:05:14,379 --> 01:05:17,840
[SPEAKER_03]: And just that, you can have a residential.

470
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:22,442
[SPEAKER_03]: We ask for an active ground floor, but you can have that mix.

471
01:05:23,222 --> 01:05:24,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can look at it.

472
01:05:25,143 --> 01:05:36,447
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we think that it's too much of that mixed use, we can reduce it and targeted areas where there is already existing businesses and living more the urban residential too.

473
01:05:38,347 --> 01:05:40,288
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can totally look into that.

474
01:05:41,848 --> 01:05:43,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's all my comments.

475
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:47,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

476
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:48,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Paola.

477
01:05:53,152 --> 01:05:56,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some questions and comments as well.

478
01:05:56,513 --> 01:06:06,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm also going to go in semi-chronological order in terms of the order that the presentation presented them in.

479
01:06:08,888 --> 01:06:19,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I also just wanted to note because I think Paola, you mentioned this in your presentation and for people paying very close attention, they would have noticed this, but just for anybody who might have missed it, I just want to make it clear.

480
01:06:19,617 --> 01:06:28,064
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking at this map with the various sub-district allocations, MX1B, MX2A, MX2B, et cetera, et cetera.

481
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:33,949
[SPEAKER_09]: The specific buy right and incentive height allowances

482
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:46,599
[SPEAKER_09]: are not necessarily, MX1 doesn't necessarily, on this map, doesn't necessarily mean what MX1 meant on another map that was already ordained earlier in this process.

483
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:47,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to flag that.

484
01:06:48,660 --> 01:07:04,132
[SPEAKER_09]: We are working on a new nomenclature just so that it's more obvious that the bi-right heights and dimensionals vary district by district, but I just wanted to flag that for people when you're looking at this map, make sure that you're also looking at the legend so that you're clear on what each color means for this map.

485
01:07:06,254 --> 01:07:16,624
[SPEAKER_09]: And Paola, I noticed there were just like two tiny areas on the other corridors map that we just looked at that were not any of the four main sub-districts, but they were a green color.

486
01:07:16,644 --> 01:07:18,586
[SPEAKER_09]: That's UR1, is that right?

487
01:07:19,387 --> 01:07:20,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

488
01:07:20,227 --> 01:07:23,190
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have that from other maps, I just wanted to confirm that while we were looking at it.

489
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:27,515
[SPEAKER_09]: in general.

490
01:07:27,555 --> 01:07:31,117
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll just go quickly through just my general impressions for this initial draft.

491
01:07:31,137 --> 01:07:33,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like where this is starting.

492
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:37,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is the right starting point.

493
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:40,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think with every other zoning proposal, we've kind of started at this level.

494
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:44,585
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we've gotten a little more fine grained and a little more granular with every meeting.

495
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:45,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what we'll do here.

496
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:53,464
[SPEAKER_09]: We were kind of just having this discussion about Main Street in terms of why are some blocks mixed and why are some blocks residential.

497
01:07:54,304 --> 01:08:01,709
[SPEAKER_09]: On High Street, I noticed that there was kind of that zigzag as you go across the street between Urban Residential 2 and Mixed Use 1.

498
01:08:02,129 --> 01:08:13,076
[SPEAKER_09]: My assumption is that we're kind of giving that the same treatment as we did on Salem Street, where we're putting mixed use where there's already ground floor commercial and just doing residential on the blocks where there's just residential.

499
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:15,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that kind of roughly the strategy that you used on this first draft?

500
01:08:19,998 --> 01:08:23,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, as much as possible, yes.

501
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:40,685
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also want to have, there are some areas that would have only been residential, that if we think that could profit some businesses around, like for example, in front of the parks, that would be a good area to have some mixed use.

502
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:43,626
[SPEAKER_03]: We've placed that mixed use.

503
01:08:44,566 --> 01:08:48,370
[SPEAKER_03]: some crossing, main crossings.

504
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:51,573
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not exactly a Salem Street.

505
01:08:51,693 --> 01:08:53,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we extended it.

506
01:08:53,835 --> 01:09:01,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason is because it could profit from more activity or because as well mixed use allows residential buildings.

507
01:09:02,323 --> 01:09:05,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they don't want to have a business, that's fine.

508
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,168
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do residential as well.

509
01:09:07,468 --> 01:09:09,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just to have more possibilities.

510
01:09:10,403 --> 01:09:10,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

511
01:09:11,725 --> 01:09:11,965
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

512
01:09:12,105 --> 01:09:12,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

513
01:09:12,386 --> 01:09:13,047
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really helpful.

514
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:18,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's another one of those helpful disclaimers that we probably don't say often enough is a mixed use building.

515
01:09:19,796 --> 01:09:21,518
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not necessarily always going to have.

516
01:09:23,461 --> 01:09:24,963
[SPEAKER_09]: It can just be a residential building.

517
01:09:26,425 --> 01:09:27,166
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't say that often.

518
01:09:29,515 --> 01:09:35,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kind of swinging through the map, I thought the proposal for the Boston Ave corridor looked like a really good start.

519
01:09:35,897 --> 01:09:43,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's in our conversations about the zoning proposal for West Medford Square, we kind of naturally started talking about the area outside of West Medford Square.

520
01:09:43,618 --> 01:09:50,520
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a lot of interest in kind of exactly this area, kind of on the northwest side of the river.

521
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,361
[SPEAKER_09]: People saying, well, there's a lot of ground floor commercial there already.

522
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:54,101
[SPEAKER_09]: There's restaurants.

523
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:55,401
[SPEAKER_09]: What about those?

524
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:57,362
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a purely residential area.

525
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:58,542
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was happy to see that.

526
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:04,364
[SPEAKER_09]: designated for MX2A in this draft.

527
01:10:04,384 --> 01:10:05,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it makes sense.

528
01:10:05,105 --> 01:10:11,007
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a really, you know, I know that's a place that people really, that people really know and love for going out to eat and getting takeout.

529
01:10:11,027 --> 01:10:16,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that makes sense, especially given the treatment that's been proposed for

530
01:10:18,918 --> 01:10:29,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, COB): Harvard right next to it happy to see a higher intensity use proposed for the cummings property and the whole foods Plaza what's currently go to over there, I think that makes a lot of sense.

531
01:10:30,498 --> 01:10:31,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, COB): um.

532
01:10:32,523 --> 01:10:38,207
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had a lot of discussions about a higher intensity residential for Harvard Avenue.

533
01:10:38,227 --> 01:10:40,388
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that really makes a lot of sense.

534
01:10:41,429 --> 01:10:52,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Throughout this zoning process, we're talking about proposing zoning that reflects what's already on the ground and incrementally allows a little bit more residential density everywhere that it makes sense.

535
01:10:52,936 --> 01:10:58,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that allowing urban residential, too, around a lot of Harvard Avenue

536
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:01,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Main Street, which is my neighborhood.

537
01:11:03,483 --> 01:11:06,485
[SPEAKER_09]: It does that because there's a lot of high intensity residential there.

538
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:15,952
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to want the zoning to reflect that and allow it to go just a little bit further or allow the option of going a little bit further over time.

539
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:24,550
[SPEAKER_09]: getting further towards part of South Medford.

540
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:30,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think this proposal for Main Street, I think it's pretty bold, but I think it's the right place to start in.

541
01:11:31,614 --> 01:11:37,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I spend a lot of time going up and down Main Street, and it's true, there is a lot of small scale commercial scattered up and down.

542
01:11:37,957 --> 01:11:48,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it makes sense to reflect that as we have been trying to do all across the city, where we have ground floor commercial, we should take that out of nonconformity, make it doable by right.

543
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:55,832
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't need to restate everything that's been said about the Broadway Corridor District.

544
01:11:55,872 --> 01:12:09,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I live right by there, and I think me and all my neighbors are excited for the very long, vacant buildings that are victims of being subject to two different zoning laws being able to develop and operate under just one set of rules.

545
01:12:12,059 --> 01:12:17,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So swinging quickly into the neighborhood commercial nodes or hubs.

546
01:12:20,574 --> 01:12:22,855
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a strong feeling at this time about what word that we use.

547
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:29,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I think probably people, different people bring different connotations to either of our options here but I'm glad we're being thoughtful about it.

548
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:41,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing that most people who have a preference at this time are preferring site specific overlay, as opposed to a citywide overlay.

549
01:12:42,764 --> 01:12:43,765
[SPEAKER_09]: or base districts.

550
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:45,526
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my preference as well.

551
01:12:45,546 --> 01:12:53,710
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be concerned that applying base districts would make our zoning map quite complicated.

552
01:12:54,310 --> 01:13:05,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, zoning necessitates a certain level of complexity, but I think having these really small zones in many, many places throughout the neighborhoods would maybe be more complicated than it is helpful.

553
01:13:06,756 --> 01:13:12,439
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also worry that with a citywide overlay, we might see what could be a node just get very diffuse.

554
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:25,624
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think to me, the primary function of the neighborhood commercial nodes is to get useful services into the neighborhoods where people want them and use them in the way that we see people already using them in places where they exist.

555
01:13:27,365 --> 01:13:29,546
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would be great if in addition, those could be clustered.

556
01:13:29,586 --> 01:13:34,028
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do have these little corners like we're beginning to have in places like the Albion Triangle.

557
01:13:34,929 --> 01:13:47,284
[SPEAKER_09]: where we have a little coffee shop and there's like some really small businesses and in South Medford Square, where you do see that cluster kind of jumping up organically in defiance of current nonconformity.

558
01:13:48,946 --> 01:13:50,308
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be my preference as well.

559
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:54,271
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that the approach that's been outlined makes a lot of sense.

560
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:58,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we just need to look at where these nodes are organically occurring in the community.

561
01:13:58,273 --> 01:14:01,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, where are they like, what are the dimensions?

562
01:14:01,414 --> 01:14:03,635
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the uses we could take that as guidance?

563
01:14:03,655 --> 01:14:08,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we need to be constrained by that, but I think we should absolutely, our starting point should be what's there right now.

564
01:14:09,437 --> 01:14:15,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and I will be very curious to hear as we go forward, what those regulations will.

565
01:14:16,579 --> 01:14:21,180
[SPEAKER_09]: include in terms of how we frame the criteria, like what are the criteria for the site-specific overlays?

566
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,260
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you get in that category?

567
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:24,860
[SPEAKER_09]: What wouldn't fit in that category?

568
01:14:25,981 --> 01:14:32,422
[SPEAKER_09]: And how we will regulate this neighborhood commercial type of use.

569
01:14:32,522 --> 01:14:43,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I know in the past when we've done neighborhood uses, we've thought about floor area, we've thought about number of employees, and I think that'll be a useful thing for us to talk about in more detail as we get further into this, like exactly how we'll be saying.

570
01:14:44,684 --> 01:14:48,188
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a commercial use that's really more appropriate for a corridor or a square.

571
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:53,173
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the type of small scale use that's appropriate for a residential district.

572
01:14:53,213 --> 01:14:56,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's the specific standards that we'll use to define that.

573
01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:01,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to Councilor Callahan.

574
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:03,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just have a question.

575
01:15:04,091 --> 01:15:12,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love it if somebody could give like a slightly different definition of the different types of districts, like overlay, the two kinds of overlays.

576
01:15:12,514 --> 01:15:31,881
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, I will admit, I haven't really understood how they differ in terms of our decision making and where they will allow the businesses and who can, you know, so if I can have like maybe someone take a stab at that explanation, that would be really helpful.

577
01:15:35,157 --> 01:15:41,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually, if I may be so bold, I'm going to jump in first and then let Paola or Alicia correct me because this is also something that I struggled with.

578
01:15:41,739 --> 01:15:47,501
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe me as a person who had to put it into different words to understand it, we can convey something.

579
01:15:48,322 --> 01:15:49,342
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding is that

580
01:15:52,740 --> 01:16:02,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Base districts, for example, we're looking at the zoning map just before, we're looking at what the, we're essentially looking at base district zoning for these different areas around the city.

581
01:16:02,164 --> 01:16:10,128
[SPEAKER_09]: If we were to go with a base district model, we'd be saying, okay, this little area right over here, that's a district, and that's what you can do here and what size is.

582
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:15,830
[SPEAKER_09]: With the overlay, it's my understanding, and this is where I'm looking for Paola to correct me if need be.

583
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:19,872
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't put new areas and colors on the map.

584
01:16:20,871 --> 01:16:25,112
[SPEAKER_09]: The existing zoning applies, whether it's corridor square, in this case, it'd be neighborhood.

585
01:16:26,193 --> 01:16:27,613
[SPEAKER_09]: NR123, you are one or two.

586
01:16:28,314 --> 01:16:38,057
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a separate layer that rests on top of it and says, if you meet this criteria, then here are the zoning uses that you have access to that you can do in this zone.

587
01:16:38,657 --> 01:16:41,438
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of like a layer that rests on top of the existing zoning.

588
01:16:42,876 --> 01:16:54,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I can ask, is that still laying on top with very specific, like these plots of land, only these plots of land, or is it a little more lucid than that?

589
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it has a geographic barrier.

590
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

591
01:16:58,441 --> 01:16:59,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two options.

592
01:16:59,921 --> 01:17:04,883
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it can either lay over a specific area or it could be everywhere.

593
01:17:05,463 --> 01:17:06,923
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a citywide overlay district.

594
01:17:06,963 --> 01:17:08,124
[SPEAKER_00]: So it overlays everywhere.

595
01:17:08,244 --> 01:17:09,604
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like an example of like,

596
01:17:10,493 --> 01:17:23,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cities have created a citywide affordable housing overlay where it's like, regardless of district, if you want to build affordable housing, you get this, you know, 100% affordable housing, for example, you get this, but Paula can probably say more.

597
01:17:24,744 --> 01:17:24,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

598
01:17:24,984 --> 01:17:25,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

599
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:31,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia and Danielle, if you want, you can also jump in, but mainly that description is good.

600
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:39,173
[SPEAKER_03]: You have what you're looking right now, all the districts that we've said are those base districts, right?

601
01:17:39,193 --> 01:17:45,879
[SPEAKER_03]: So you look at your plot and there is a base district, mixes one and tells you what you can do.

602
01:17:47,421 --> 01:17:49,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if we do an overlay exactly,

603
01:17:50,563 --> 01:17:59,085
[SPEAKER_03]: we can do it citywide and say certain characteristics are able to trigger another district that you can choose from.

604
01:17:59,205 --> 01:18:02,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can choose either to do your base district or the overlay.

605
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:08,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is not a specific geography, that is that if you meet these requirements, then you could choose that.

606
01:18:08,447 --> 01:18:10,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the citywide, right?

607
01:18:10,068 --> 01:18:15,009
[SPEAKER_03]: We give, it has to be 250, within 200, sorry, within a quarter mile of the park.

608
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:16,289
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be within,

609
01:18:22,452 --> 01:18:33,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know right now, but there are certain decisions that will trigger that overlay district.

610
01:18:33,624 --> 01:18:42,313
[SPEAKER_08]: The one question I've been most curious about is, could one of those triggering things be, it is more than a quarter mile from the nearest neighborhood, other neighborhood commercial?

611
01:18:43,187 --> 01:18:43,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

612
01:18:43,607 --> 01:18:49,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have those, um, those characteristics in the ones that we decide.

613
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:58,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, now we can do that as well and do that analysis ourselves, bring it in and say, these are the locations.

614
01:18:59,196 --> 01:19:00,697
[SPEAKER_03]: And so be specific.

615
01:19:00,817 --> 01:19:03,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is when we say site specific.

616
01:19:03,699 --> 01:19:10,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we decide this geographies and usually they have like a dash, like a line, um,

617
01:19:11,658 --> 01:19:13,300
[SPEAKER_03]: a hatch on top of the base.

618
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:21,647
[SPEAKER_03]: They are usually the market on your zoning in your plans, in the map zoning.

619
01:19:21,688 --> 01:19:26,772
[SPEAKER_03]: We already say these are the ones that can choose between their base district.

620
01:19:26,932 --> 01:19:30,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say here we will have neighborhood residential mostly.

621
01:19:32,378 --> 01:19:35,320
[SPEAKER_03]: You can choose from that or this commercial.

622
01:19:36,181 --> 01:19:40,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can do these extra things with the commercial.

623
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:43,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it depends a little bit on how we set them.

624
01:19:44,643 --> 01:19:49,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes if you choose one, you have to stay with that one and you can go back to the other one.

625
01:19:50,265 --> 01:19:52,405
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to continue that new use.

626
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:58,487
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's say that you have that choice in the beginning.

627
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:03,268
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can also bring the sets of rules on how does that apply.

628
01:20:03,808 --> 01:20:07,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you choose one, what happens with the base district?

629
01:20:07,353 --> 01:20:11,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can give that more information next time.

630
01:20:12,531 --> 01:20:12,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

631
01:20:12,811 --> 01:20:13,672
[SPEAKER_08]: That's super helpful.

632
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:35,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And kind of exciting, I think, if you know, include like artisan, like, I like that kind of what was a glassblower stained glass or something that exists, like if we include the sort of artisanal stuff there, then what's exciting to me is like, if it's more than a quarter mile from any of the nearest one, then you who could be a glassblower could, you know, convert your

633
01:20:36,902 --> 01:20:54,288
[SPEAKER_08]: your first floor into an artisan's space, and then maybe next door it'll be a coffee shop, like allowing residents to use their own creativity to be able to use their spaces for these kinds of things, I think would be a lovely organic way to make this happen.

634
01:20:57,209 --> 01:20:58,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Or somebody who loves baking.

635
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:02,371
[SPEAKER_08]: They'd be like, I'm gonna use my garage, it's gonna become a bakery.

636
01:21:02,631 --> 01:21:03,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't that be cool?

637
01:21:03,512 --> 01:21:04,012
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be super cool.

638
01:21:06,841 --> 01:21:07,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

639
01:21:07,621 --> 01:21:08,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

640
01:21:08,662 --> 01:21:22,088
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I think that this kind of this topic of what does it just make obvious sense to allow by right and where do we want to go a little bit broader to allow a little bit more choice in what commercial could mean in this district.

641
01:21:22,148 --> 01:21:26,310
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we'll talk about that more as we continue to just explore the accessory commercial units topic.

642
01:21:27,951 --> 01:21:31,833
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that we really should be thinking hard about those concentric circles.

643
01:21:31,873 --> 01:21:35,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I think obviously most important, as we've discussed, is to make sure that it's easier

644
01:21:36,715 --> 01:21:43,705
[SPEAKER_09]: to develop the commercial uses that people really want and some neighborhoods really need but haven't seen so far.

645
01:21:44,286 --> 01:21:52,237
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do think that we should give a little bit of thought to these somewhat less obvious commercial uses that we don't

646
01:21:53,845 --> 01:21:56,827
[SPEAKER_09]: that we don't see as apparent a need for, but there are really an apparent need for.

647
01:21:56,867 --> 01:22:21,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, since it's been brought up, I'll just say, I don't actually do a lot of advocating for my personal professional sector and city council meetings, but I think talking about maker spaces and studio spaces, allowing that by right within the fabric of our neighborhoods, I know from personal experience, but actually more importantly from constituent experiences would be very, very useful to not have that be disallowed in our zoning and so much of our zoning, especially since there is so little,

648
01:22:23,845 --> 01:22:27,628
[SPEAKER_09]: studio space available in Bedford and many of our other surrounding metro communities.

649
01:22:27,648 --> 01:22:28,769
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll just put in a plug for that.

650
01:22:28,809 --> 01:22:40,118
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something that we'll certainly talk about more as we get deeper into this, that list of what uses to definitely allow by right and what of the kind of some of the more fringe uses that we might also like to allow by right in these districts as well.

651
01:22:46,106 --> 01:23:00,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Any additional questions, comments from committee members or city staff on this initial draft of the corridors zoning or the neighborhood hubs or the accessionary commercial units?

652
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:01,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Director Hunt.

653
01:23:02,771 --> 01:23:03,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

654
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:14,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to sort of mention that something that I noticed as I was looking at this, and so I had a knee-jerk reaction of like, wow, there's a lot of commercial, because mixed use,

655
01:23:15,884 --> 01:23:22,869
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'm realizing is that one of the things that we've talked about is wanting stronger commercial base in Medford.

656
01:23:23,589 --> 01:23:35,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there are more places where you're allowed to choose to open a business or to redevelop a block to make it have ground floor commercial apartments upstairs, for example.

657
01:23:35,918 --> 01:23:40,699
[SPEAKER_04]: then we are likely to get more, expand our commercial base.

658
01:23:41,139 --> 01:23:53,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I am concerned that we have areas that have been traditionally very industrial, that as we're switching them to allow more residential, we're gonna lose some of our businesses in our commercial industrial base.

659
01:23:53,782 --> 01:24:04,644
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is a way of sort of saying, we don't want big stinky old fashioned factories, we want a lot of smaller things going on here.

660
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:10,868
[SPEAKER_04]: and that I think that I just wanted to observe that that's what we're seeing here and that I like it.

661
01:24:11,409 --> 01:24:16,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also observing that there are a lot of places where it's not one parcel deep.

662
01:24:17,294 --> 01:24:27,942
[SPEAKER_04]: When I zoom way in, that I'm seeing a lot of this as like two and three parcels deep, which allows them to assemble parcels to do bigger projects.

663
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:34,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you're going to have height, like we were looking at a parcel, a larger parcel along Main Street,

664
01:24:35,157 --> 01:24:42,043
[SPEAKER_04]: that would really like to do some ground floor commercial, some apartments, but they have to have parking.

665
01:24:42,383 --> 01:24:49,690
[SPEAKER_04]: So there has to be space for a driveway to come in and enter the parking area.

666
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:52,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it means there's less space for commercial.

667
01:24:53,073 --> 01:24:55,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually seeing this on Salem Street as well.

668
01:24:55,983 --> 01:25:00,985
[SPEAKER_04]: because you have to have parking somewhere and there has to be a way to enter that parking.

669
01:25:01,465 --> 01:25:06,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So you lose what I would think of as a commercial storefront to a driveway.

670
01:25:07,648 --> 01:25:19,633
[SPEAKER_04]: So you kind of need to assemble some stuff to make it work because we're not ready to say you can be far up on Salem Street or in the middle of Main Street and have zero parking.

671
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:21,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford's not ready for that.

672
01:25:21,414 --> 01:25:22,975
[SPEAKER_04]: The culture isn't ready for that.

673
01:25:24,002 --> 01:25:25,623
[SPEAKER_04]: and street parking isn't enough.

674
01:25:26,483 --> 01:25:43,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am sort of observing this, and I do think one of the questions that we would get as residents dig into here is, well, what happens if somebody actually wants to develop the parcel that's up whatever side street and not the front parcel?

675
01:25:43,611 --> 01:25:50,854
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now are we saying that we're allowing commercial ground floor commercial on these side streets off of the main street?

676
01:25:50,874 --> 01:25:51,854
[SPEAKER_04]: And

677
01:25:53,503 --> 01:25:54,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that okay?

678
01:25:54,483 --> 01:26:01,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Which it very well might be, but I think that that's the kind of thing people are going to say and go, that's my house.

679
01:26:02,065 --> 01:26:04,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've just said that's in a mixed use zone.

680
01:26:04,966 --> 01:26:05,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

681
01:26:05,286 --> 01:26:07,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So we, we need to be prepared for that.

682
01:26:09,968 --> 01:26:15,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I mostly, I just wanted to flush out these observations so that people are thinking about these things.

683
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:18,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, director Hunt.

684
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:20,410
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a really helpful.

685
01:26:21,631 --> 01:26:22,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to Paola.

686
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:25,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

687
01:26:25,782 --> 01:26:28,583
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great observation, Alicia.

688
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:44,149
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that as we, for example, did in Salem, we give the incentives, et cetera, where more for the lots abutting the Salem street.

689
01:26:44,589 --> 01:26:53,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we can do something like that in here where we have the lots that are abutting the main street are the ones that can really go higher.

690
01:26:54,533 --> 01:27:04,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the others, in order to get the incentive, you get the 75% of the active business in the front.

691
01:27:05,777 --> 01:27:13,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will trigger more the incentives towards getting that front parcel instead of going to the side.

692
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:13,600
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can

693
01:27:14,671 --> 01:27:16,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for bringing that up.

694
01:27:16,612 --> 01:27:24,534
[SPEAKER_03]: We can study a little bit more how to incentivize more than the lots that front Main Street and not the side lots.

695
01:27:28,235 --> 01:27:29,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

696
01:27:29,836 --> 01:27:30,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Going back to Director Hunt.

697
01:27:31,442 --> 01:27:41,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and a word that you said triggered something else that I remembered that I wanted to just sort of mention, and that I think this is the one of the appropriate meetings to flip, bring it out.

698
01:27:43,065 --> 01:27:51,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So, on Monday, I had the opportunity to go to the Metro mayors climate event you may have seen it in the press.

699
01:27:52,187 --> 01:27:58,112
[SPEAKER_04]: where Mayor Wu and Senator Markey spoke, and actually Mayor Brianna also spoke at that.

700
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:02,096
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very exciting, but I had some opportunity to chit chat.

701
01:28:02,466 --> 01:28:06,068
[SPEAKER_04]: with some of the staff from some of the Metro Mayors communities.

702
01:28:06,588 --> 01:28:30,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things Cambridge mentioned to me was some concerns that have been coming up in Cambridge about their rezoning around solar and how by allowing so much more height by right throughout the community, a lot of people who have already put solar on their buildings are very concerned that new buildings are gonna come up and shade their solar

703
01:28:30,782 --> 01:28:34,684
[SPEAKER_04]: and ruin their investments, and how that's a big thing that they're looking at.

704
01:28:34,704 --> 01:28:38,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big concern they're hearing, and I did sort of play that around.

705
01:28:38,666 --> 01:28:55,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Brenda Pike, our climate planner, was there with me, and so we talked about it a little bit, because there's also, you know, your neighbor's tree or your tree could grow and shade your solar, and now you don't have solar anymore, or you could be a one-story house with solar and somebody builds a

706
01:28:56,213 --> 01:28:58,035
[SPEAKER_04]: two and a half right next to it.

707
01:28:58,896 --> 01:29:03,621
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think that it is something that is an active conversation there.

708
01:29:03,641 --> 01:29:10,147
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, thinking about what are the heights, how are the heights impacting the other parcels.

709
01:29:11,157 --> 01:29:29,983
[SPEAKER_04]: is a good thing for us to also be thinking about and looking at, because if the whole area goes taller, that's fine, but what if you already have your building and you have solar on it, and now somebody builds a five-story building next to you, and it's on the south side and it's shading your house now?

710
01:29:30,944 --> 01:29:32,464
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your rights under that?

711
01:29:32,484 --> 01:29:40,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have great answers, but I did want to share that it's an active conversation one community over.

712
01:29:42,987 --> 01:29:43,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

713
01:29:43,827 --> 01:29:44,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

714
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:45,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Paola, go ahead.

715
01:29:46,488 --> 01:29:47,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, just very quickly.

716
01:29:48,389 --> 01:30:07,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the reason why we brought for the squares the development standard of the minimum daylight, so that we make sure that whoever will build certain story, and especially when we trigger that incentives, that they need to study that they are not affecting the existing

717
01:30:08,024 --> 01:30:13,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially certain hours of the day that we have to to study a little bit more.

718
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:17,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thinking on that, and thank you for that.

719
01:30:19,712 --> 01:30:20,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

720
01:30:21,093 --> 01:30:23,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I raised that to Kimmeridge and one thought they had was

721
01:30:25,157 --> 01:30:32,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Are are you allowed to do so part of it was the does it have to be that the property next to you is in a different zone.

722
01:30:33,204 --> 01:30:48,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you are both in so main street runs north and south right so if you're in the same mixed use zone and you're still a short building and somebody in the same zone builds a taller building can we have.

723
01:30:48,766 --> 01:30:55,109
[SPEAKER_04]: standards that say you have to respect that shorter building, but then they could build up tall later, right?

724
01:30:55,309 --> 01:30:59,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it only if you're between two different zones versus if you're all in the same zone?

725
01:31:01,732 --> 01:31:02,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we will have to study that.

726
01:31:03,212 --> 01:31:06,073
[SPEAKER_03]: For now, it was more abutting residential districts.

727
01:31:07,054 --> 01:31:08,094
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, absolutely.

728
01:31:08,734 --> 01:31:13,477
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do some analysis, some sections, and see how that would affect, but absolutely.

729
01:31:16,798 --> 01:31:16,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

730
01:31:17,676 --> 01:31:18,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Paola.

731
01:31:18,216 --> 01:31:19,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate this being brought up.

732
01:31:19,617 --> 01:31:25,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I know elsewhere in the zoning map, we've talked a lot about shadow.

733
01:31:25,598 --> 01:31:31,600
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been looking at shadow studies in the various ways that that can impact existing development.

734
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:43,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to hear solar brought up because we absolutely goals of increasing positive development and enabling solar and especially not impeding on solar that's already been resolved are

735
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:47,910
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, all goals that we hold at the same time.

736
01:31:47,950 --> 01:31:50,813
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to make sure that we're not, I don't think those have to be in conflict.

737
01:31:51,093 --> 01:31:54,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And to that end, it's good that we're talking about it now.

738
01:31:54,135 --> 01:32:09,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did notice other places on the map, just even in this initial draft, where I assumed that there was a lot of thoughtfulness about shadow kind of informing what we saw at this meeting already, specifically where the tallest bi-rite heights were allocated along Boston Ave.

739
01:32:09,849 --> 01:32:11,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed those were abutting the tracks.

740
01:32:12,412 --> 01:32:18,998
[SPEAKER_09]: which I assumed was intentional, so that that shadow would fall on the tracks and not on residences.

741
01:32:20,099 --> 01:32:26,146
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure that's something that we'll look into in greater detail as we go forward with this topic.

742
01:32:26,606 --> 01:32:28,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to hear it being brought up.

743
01:32:33,637 --> 01:32:33,997
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

744
01:32:36,519 --> 01:32:44,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any additional questions or comments that committee members or city staff want to put on the table right now?

745
01:32:44,824 --> 01:32:52,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, we can go to public comment, and then I'll just kind of recap some of what we heard tonight and our next steps for this topic.

746
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:57,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe this can be a rare and delightful under two and a half hour zoning meeting.

747
01:33:00,695 --> 01:33:02,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other comments from committee members or city staff right now?

748
01:33:05,527 --> 01:33:08,531
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, seeing none, we will go to public participation.

749
01:33:11,656 --> 01:33:14,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody who would like to speak can raise their hand on Zoom.

750
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:18,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to get my timer up.

751
01:33:19,567 --> 01:33:21,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody will have three minutes to speak.

752
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:28,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

753
01:33:29,695 --> 01:33:31,417
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll go first to Judith.

754
01:33:31,818 --> 01:33:33,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Judith, name and address for the record, please.

755
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,022
[SPEAKER_09]: You will have three minutes.

756
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:35,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for being here.

757
01:33:42,612 --> 01:33:45,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, I'm clicking the Ask to Unmute button.

758
01:33:45,676 --> 01:33:46,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hi.

759
01:33:46,336 --> 01:33:46,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

760
01:33:47,093 --> 01:33:48,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Judith Weinstock, 144 Breguet.

761
01:33:49,575 --> 01:33:50,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

762
01:33:50,276 --> 01:33:52,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for hosting tonight.

763
01:33:54,119 --> 01:33:56,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go right out there and say, boy, am I confused.

764
01:33:57,862 --> 01:34:02,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking forward to having the documents on the website.

765
01:34:03,247 --> 01:34:06,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought that I looked and I didn't see them there.

766
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:09,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they there now, this proposal?

767
01:34:10,297 --> 01:34:13,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I don't think they're on the city council's public portal yet.

768
01:34:13,078 --> 01:34:14,838
[SPEAKER_09]: We just received them today.

769
01:34:14,938 --> 01:34:16,378
[SPEAKER_09]: They will be up there by tomorrow.

770
01:34:16,838 --> 01:34:17,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

771
01:34:17,459 --> 01:34:18,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And will they're up there?

772
01:34:19,339 --> 01:34:19,679
[SPEAKER_06]: They are.

773
01:34:19,699 --> 01:34:22,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked earlier today and I hadn't seen them.

774
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:23,680
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will.

775
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:25,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we zoom in on those?

776
01:34:26,941 --> 01:34:30,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a feature to zoom in to see more city street names?

777
01:34:31,441 --> 01:34:33,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I don't believe on the maps.

778
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:35,847
[SPEAKER_09]: that are available tonight.

779
01:34:37,028 --> 01:34:38,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what you see is what you see.

780
01:34:38,549 --> 01:34:41,431
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the future, there'll be more detail added.

781
01:34:42,912 --> 01:34:45,254
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, because I think I'm going to have to study them.

782
01:34:45,314 --> 01:34:48,156
[SPEAKER_06]: And Paolo, I'll wait to hear what you have to say, too, about that.

783
01:34:49,737 --> 01:34:53,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to study them in a lot more detail because I'm real confused.

784
01:34:55,461 --> 01:34:56,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Sad, but true.

785
01:34:58,586 --> 01:35:01,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any further questions or comments you wanted to put out there at this point?

786
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:02,590
[SPEAKER_09]: One more time.

787
01:35:02,671 --> 01:35:03,852
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

788
01:35:04,112 --> 01:35:04,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

789
01:35:04,393 --> 01:35:07,036
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

790
01:35:07,116 --> 01:35:07,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Judith.

791
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:10,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Paula, did you have a direct response?

792
01:35:12,062 --> 01:35:13,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, totally understand.

793
01:35:15,584 --> 01:35:18,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are also working on the interactive map.

794
01:35:18,205 --> 01:35:22,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will tomorrow bring this districts in the interactive map.

795
01:35:23,068 --> 01:35:26,990
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can also look at there and that is a lot easier than than in here.

796
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:32,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have what we have, we cannot zoom in and see other street names pop up.

797
01:35:33,933 --> 01:35:37,775
[SPEAKER_03]: But we the presentation will be there and we will do the interactive map.

798
01:35:39,775 --> 01:35:39,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

799
01:35:40,035 --> 01:35:40,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

800
01:35:40,335 --> 01:35:40,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Pella.

801
01:35:40,655 --> 01:35:45,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for mentioning the interactive map, which is on the city's zoning Web page already.

802
01:35:45,678 --> 01:35:50,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So the presentation that we just saw tonight is not incorporated into that yet, but it will be very soon.

803
01:35:50,601 --> 01:35:51,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that will be, uh.

804
01:35:52,582 --> 01:35:54,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably the best thing for questions like these.

805
01:35:54,183 --> 01:35:54,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

806
01:35:54,463 --> 01:35:55,003
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bears.

807
01:35:55,903 --> 01:35:59,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologistic clarify if you on the interactive map, you can see street names, right?

808
01:35:59,685 --> 01:36:00,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's

809
01:36:10,703 --> 01:36:12,887
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, going next to Andrew.

810
01:36:12,907 --> 01:36:14,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

811
01:36:15,991 --> 01:36:18,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And you will have three minutes.

812
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:24,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there, Andrew McRobert, 63 Kenmere Road.

813
01:36:24,925 --> 01:36:25,686
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the

814
01:36:27,432 --> 01:36:47,643
[SPEAKER_01]: subject to the neighborhood commercial because I see neighborhood commercial as the opportunity, a big opportunity for residents to invest in their own neighborhood and to provide the services that their immediate neighbors in streets and neighborhood need in the places that they need them.

815
01:36:48,663 --> 01:36:52,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I see them as a great way to remove traffic.

816
01:36:52,944 --> 01:37:15,531
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love for the uses that are allowed to, yeah, this has been brought up before, but yeah, I just want to hammer home that I really appreciate that the uses are being guided towards things that, yeah, you know, a family might go to multiple times a week, as I think Councilor Callaghan mentioned.

817
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:19,481
[SPEAKER_01]: to that.

818
01:37:20,382 --> 01:37:22,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that would take cars off of the road, basically.

819
01:37:22,263 --> 01:37:25,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm walking there instead of driving further out.

820
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:37,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are some pretty homogenous residential zones in Medford that I would love to see more commercial in to reduce VMT.

821
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:37,978
[SPEAKER_01]: To

822
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:50,883
[SPEAKER_01]: But, of course, the other side to that is the commercial needs to be stuff that isn't attracting people from outside the neighborhood to drive their cars in, adding congestion.

823
01:37:52,923 --> 01:37:54,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I have a bunch of loose notes.

824
01:37:55,104 --> 01:37:58,545
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a clear train of thought here.

825
01:37:58,565 --> 01:38:06,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, something I wanted to mention was that among the uses, I would love to see home daycares included.

826
01:38:08,807 --> 01:38:09,848
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that.

827
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:13,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

828
01:38:13,132 --> 01:38:22,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, in terms of parking and cars, I don't know if this is the purview of zoning, but maybe rather than parking minimums for these.

829
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:32,025
[SPEAKER_01]: These commercial or neighborhood commercial areas, we could have parking maximums or at the very minimum, no parking minimums.

830
01:38:32,886 --> 01:38:41,431
[SPEAKER_01]: So that to really reinforce that these are walkable neighborhood, commercial neighborhood serving businesses.

831
01:38:44,346 --> 01:39:03,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and and yeah, just to reiterate, I, I, well, I would love for where this is the zoning to be as permissive as possible in terms of where these neighborhood commercial businesses can can grow organically.

832
01:39:03,699 --> 01:39:09,043
[SPEAKER_01]: So that they can really meet serve the needs of the neighborhood rather than.

833
01:39:10,538 --> 01:39:15,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we don't necessarily know where that's going to be in 20 or 30 years.

834
01:39:16,161 --> 01:39:16,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

835
01:39:19,744 --> 01:39:19,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

836
01:39:20,304 --> 01:39:22,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for your comments.

837
01:39:22,866 --> 01:39:27,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrew, go next to Micah.

838
01:39:27,689 --> 01:39:29,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

839
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:30,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll have three minutes.

840
01:39:31,887 --> 01:39:32,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

841
01:39:32,127 --> 01:39:36,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to just sort of like info dump really quick because I probably have to go really soon.

842
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:38,771
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm Micah Kesselman.

843
01:39:39,531 --> 01:39:41,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at 499 Main Street.

844
01:39:42,053 --> 01:39:45,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was really great to see as a presentation.

845
01:39:45,174 --> 01:39:45,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

846
01:39:45,534 --> 01:39:53,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I live most of my life on one of the main streets under direct scrutiny here tonight.

847
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:59,822
[SPEAKER_07]: So one small thing that I noticed is that you have the intersection of

848
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:05,109
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's like mixed use zoning, which is cool, but that that.

849
01:40:07,927 --> 01:40:13,628
[SPEAKER_07]: is, like, an area where, like, people who live around here have been constantly saying, like, is ripe for development.

850
01:40:13,688 --> 01:40:18,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's a really perfect spot to, like, put some really cool commercial things there.

851
01:40:18,889 --> 01:40:27,191
[SPEAKER_07]: But then in between that and Harvard and Maine, there's, like, this just straight residential block, which is just sort of weird.

852
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:35,613
[SPEAKER_07]: It just seems like you could make the mixed user continuous all the way to Harvard and Maine there to make that more, like,

853
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:40,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a South Medford square type sort of vibe to it.

854
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:58,888
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing, though, on that topic in general, like Councilor Collins mentioned, Main Street is this sort of intermittent commercial use corner as it is, so that's why

855
01:41:01,338 --> 01:41:13,224
[SPEAKER_07]: for those of you who aren't familiar with the street are probably are seeing this sort of like weird looking like body distribution of commercial, but it actually makes a lot of sense for Main Street in the way that Main Street is right now.

856
01:41:13,724 --> 01:41:23,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And frankly, I think like you could honestly just make the whole thing like mixed use commercial and it wouldn't be like it doesn't have to be commercial, right?

857
01:41:23,309 --> 01:41:25,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said, so it wouldn't hurt any.

858
01:41:25,571 --> 01:41:27,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would do nothing but help things.

859
01:41:29,266 --> 01:41:42,310
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I wanted to mention was that I love the idea of the accessory commercial units, sort of getting to the previous residents point about neighborhood commerce.

860
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:54,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that if you implement a very permissive allowance for accessory commercial units, you will effectively get the neighborhood commercial

861
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:58,993
[SPEAKER_07]: into the field as it is.

862
01:41:59,373 --> 01:42:01,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So that could be a really great way to go about it.

863
01:42:01,554 --> 01:42:09,800
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is a way that cities organically have, you know, for hundreds of years prior to the modern time, developed that way.

864
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:17,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were sustainable when they developed that way and were given the leeway to like these localized commercial endeavors.

865
01:42:18,607 --> 01:42:22,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, the last thing I want to say in the remaining few seconds is that the

866
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:26,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, when it comes to solar, uh, 1.

867
01:42:28,272 --> 01:42:31,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Approach that might be worth considering, um, and I'm giving it too much thought is.

868
01:42:32,874 --> 01:42:44,458
[SPEAKER_07]: That you could require where there would be a shadow impact on an installed solar installation on a neighboring lot.

869
01:42:45,319 --> 01:42:52,462
[SPEAKER_07]: The developer would be required to negotiate a commercial or negotiate a license to actually.

870
01:42:56,528 --> 01:42:57,709
[SPEAKER_07]: That would do a couple of things.

871
01:42:57,729 --> 01:43:00,591
[SPEAKER_07]: 1, it would address this issue.

872
01:43:00,611 --> 01:43:11,740
[SPEAKER_07]: But the other thing is that I would actually incentivize people to put up solar much more often right now with the expectation in the future developers will want to negotiate some sort of commercial arrangement to enable.

873
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:18,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Higher development in their areas, and that's it for me only 1 minute over.

874
01:43:20,449 --> 01:43:26,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Micah, appreciate your comments and a relatively small crowd tonight so we can give people who needed an extra minute or so.

875
01:43:27,955 --> 01:43:28,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your comments.

876
01:43:29,877 --> 01:43:32,839
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, going next to Cheryl, name and address for the record, please.

877
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:34,961
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll have three minutes.

878
01:43:36,963 --> 01:43:39,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

879
01:43:40,506 --> 01:43:49,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just noticed a few things that really stuck out were when they were saying that some don't want the nodes to be an overlay because they don't want them to be in areas, quote,

880
01:43:49,666 --> 01:44:02,132
[SPEAKER_05]: where they don't belong sounds kind of like a NIMBY attempt to keep some areas character that is prevalent in the zoning proposals that we have seen this far in any area outside of an environmental justice neighborhood.

881
01:44:02,672 --> 01:44:12,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Some areas are being deliberately less dense and to have them be also excluded from neighborhood nodes seems to be really an issue that you should be having with your own goals.

882
01:44:13,372 --> 01:44:20,633
[SPEAKER_05]: But, and Salem Street was very concerned about the shadows, the loss of solar panel efficiency, and just plain sunlight.

883
01:44:21,054 --> 01:44:25,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was brought up by many, many residents, many, many times, and we were dismissed.

884
01:44:25,654 --> 01:44:26,555
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no study.

885
01:44:27,035 --> 01:44:38,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that now that you're considering this for other corridors, perhaps it'll be time to go back and study on Salem Street, because there is a good deal of sun loss that will be happening here on Salem Street.

886
01:44:38,653 --> 01:44:46,698
[SPEAKER_05]: As many of you have said, even tonight, there is a lot of development pressure on Salem Street, and that will definitely impact our neighbors.

887
01:44:47,978 --> 01:45:00,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And just last one thing is, it's been repeatedly asked of Innis to have their materials available ahead of time, so that people can look at these documents, so that we can have questions answered in real time when we're seeing

888
01:45:01,923 --> 01:45:08,707
[SPEAKER_05]: these presentations, we still didn't see any zoning for ADUs, despite it being voted out of this committee.

889
01:45:09,047 --> 01:45:15,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a real lag in materials being given to the public so that people can have informed conversations.

890
01:45:16,392 --> 01:45:21,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm very concerned that it's not only continuing, but it seems to be worsening as time goes on.

891
01:45:22,035 --> 01:45:22,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

892
01:45:22,456 --> 01:45:26,438
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

893
01:45:26,918 --> 01:45:27,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your comments, Cheryl.

894
01:45:29,145 --> 01:45:45,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, all of the documents from our ADU, uh, discussions are available on medfordma.org slash zoning, um, including all the proposals that have been referred out of city council to the community development board.

895
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:55,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think we're all totally sympathetic to the fact that sometimes folks don't have the time that they need to, um, fully review, um,

896
01:45:56,784 --> 01:46:02,486
[SPEAKER_09]: the meeting materials before the very first meetings on the topic, especially when we're all seeing this for the first time.

897
01:46:04,766 --> 01:46:12,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Folks are always welcome to reach out to planning development sustainability staff or city councilors to state comments or lodge their questions.

898
01:46:14,529 --> 01:46:15,050
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime,

899
01:46:20,153 --> 01:46:36,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And the neighborhood context regulations for Salem Street and other corridors are intended to get at mitigating various factors, including the impact of shadow and height where it abuts neighborhood uses.

900
01:46:39,231 --> 01:46:43,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other public participation on the topics we discussed tonight?

901
01:46:49,489 --> 01:46:53,173
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, seeing none, if you think of anything, raise your hand.

902
01:46:54,214 --> 01:46:59,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Paola, for the introduction to these two topics tonight.

903
01:47:00,139 --> 01:47:09,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So I understand that we will be talking about these again on May 28th, and we'll also probably be seeing a preliminary draft of Tufts institutional zoning for the first time on that date as well.

904
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:38,845
[SPEAKER_09]: So I anticipate for our next steps with the other corridors proposal, I think we're going to take a, as associates in consultation with city staff, we'll be taking a magnifying glass to all of these corridors, really dialing down on the details and looking at a lot of the questions and comments that were raised tonight, making sure that all of our initial sub-district assignments are where they should be, where they ought to be, taking into account those questions and comments.

905
01:47:40,626 --> 01:48:01,265
[SPEAKER_09]: be looking deeper at criteria for the neighborhood nodes where we want to encourage those and taking guidance from where they're occurring organically and thinking deeply about how to define neighborhood commercials that we make sure that we're encouraging the type of uses that we want to see, thinking about the uses that should be by right and how we're making sure that they're at the scale that makes sense for neighborhoods.

906
01:48:04,893 --> 01:48:06,494
[SPEAKER_09]: scanning my notes to see if there's anything else.

907
01:48:06,574 --> 01:48:14,598
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be talking to Somerville to make sure that the Broadway Corridor District zoning in particular agrees with the zoning on the other side of the line.

908
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:24,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other next steps that we want to flag on these topics?

909
01:48:29,647 --> 01:48:29,887
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

910
01:48:31,495 --> 01:48:34,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, thank you so much for the presentation, Paola.

911
01:48:34,357 --> 01:48:38,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to my colleagues, city staff, and members of the public for weighing in on this.

912
01:48:40,121 --> 01:48:44,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And we hope that you will join us at the next planning and permitting committee meeting on this topic as well.

913
01:48:45,665 --> 01:48:46,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to adjourn.

914
01:48:48,467 --> 01:48:48,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

927
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:23,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everybody.

928
01:49:24,902 --> 01:49:25,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
