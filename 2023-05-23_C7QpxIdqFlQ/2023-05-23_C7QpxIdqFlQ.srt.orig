1
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:06,066
[SPEAKER_11]: How y'all doing today?

2
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:12,734
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Prince Alcidor.

3
00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:13,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Guess what his name is.

4
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:14,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Also Prince.

5
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:25,949
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so first off, we're going to be introducing y'all to the Haitian National Anthem by Kernessa and Yamile.

6
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:55,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Pour les aïeux, pour la patrie, Aux dieux des poids, aux dieux des poids.

7
00:00:56,408 --> 00:01:05,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Sous ta garde infinie, Prenons droit notre vie,

8
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:20,583
[SPEAKER_12]: O Dieu des Pouvoirs, O Dieu des Pouvoirs, pour les ailleurs, pour la Patrie.

9
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:34,707
[SPEAKER_12]: O Dieu, O Dieu, O Dieu des Pouvoirs, pour les ailleurs, pour la Patrie.

10
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:44,279
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you tell them?

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nothing.

12
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:57,048
[SPEAKER_12]: O Haiti, pays en cette joie.

13
00:01:57,088 --> 00:02:02,430
[SPEAKER_12]: C'est pour marcher maintenant à main.

14
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:12,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Nous m'y donnes pas fait pour qu'entre-t' nous fêtes pour s'admettre.

15
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:19,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Nous allons marcher maintenant

16
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:24,562
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I know, I know.

17
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,561
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we will be welcoming our very own Mr. Principal de Leyva.

18
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:16,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone.

19
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,574
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big day for our Haitian community as today marks our annual celebration of Haitian Flag Day.

20
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:34,775
[SPEAKER_01]: These assemblies help us understand the diversity of our Mustang population, as we all can learn about other cultures and have a better understanding of one another.

21
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:37,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to recognize a few people today.

22
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:46,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, our superintendent, Dr. Maryse Edvard-Vincent, who will be participating in this assembly, and I'm going to let her do more of the chanting than I will do.

23
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:52,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to recognize our mayor who's not here, but she would be presenting a proclamation.

24
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:54,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the superintendent's gonna be doing that as well.

25
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely have to thank the Black Student Union.

26
00:03:58,464 --> 00:03:59,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give them a round of applause.

27
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:11,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Without them, we wouldn't have had our assembly, and without the guidance of Ms.

28
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrea Artsell, Ms.

29
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:19,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Jemiah Jackson, and Mr. Rose Walker for all their guidance in having this assembly happen, so let's congratulate them as well.

30
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:34,430
[SPEAKER_01]: So on May 18th each year, Haitians across the world commemorate the country's independence from France.

31
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:38,816
[SPEAKER_01]: and a moment of red and blue flag that was hoisted up for the first time in 1803.

32
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:55,969
[SPEAKER_01]: For a little history, that's when the white band was taken out of the flag during the French rule, creating the first Haitian flag that's symbolic of the alliance of black and mixed race people left behind to fight for freedom.

33
00:04:57,335 --> 00:05:05,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to welcome back our two princes, Medford High's two princes, to continue with the celebration, and I'm glad to be part of this assembly.

34
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:06,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all.

35
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,735
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, we have an opening dance.

36
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:31,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again for being here, and I'm very privileged and grateful to be able to share this space again with you all.

37
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:43,785
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're going to watch is a dance that we create, not only me as a choreographer who helped them, but those young people really have so much passion and so much eager to do so much more.

38
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,868
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you feel the vibe while they're dancing, just shake yourself wherever you are.

39
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,693
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to welcome you, Ibo, because Ibo is a dance of freedom.

40
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,937
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dance really represent Haiti at its core.

41
00:05:57,037 --> 00:06:02,924
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the day of celebrating the flag, this is the best way we could definitely share our culture with you with Ibo.

42
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:03,966
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome, Ibo.

43
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we will be sharing opening remarks by Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent, the superintendent of Bedford Public Schools, who will be sharing the Haitian Flag Day proclamation on behalf of Mayor Brianna Luongo-Kern.

44
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Good afternoon, everyone.

45
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:23,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Sac passe!

46
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Sac passe!

47
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:29,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Sakpase.

48
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:32,409
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

49
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:37,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Sakpase means it's good.

50
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:38,556
[SPEAKER_08]: What's happening?

51
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:39,477
[SPEAKER_08]: How's it going?

52
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:43,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Napule, even though if you take it literally,

53
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:48,709
[SPEAKER_08]: It says like it's burning, but you don't really use it literally that way.

54
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:50,410
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's good.

55
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,071
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's good to hear everyone knowing that phrase.

56
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited to be here, always to come before you.

57
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:03,176
[SPEAKER_08]: As I begin my remarks today, I want to say thank you again to the BSU.

58
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:05,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank all, Ms.

59
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Andrea Pierre-Paul, Ms.

60
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:09,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Walker, Charose Walker.

61
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Ms.

62
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,720
[SPEAKER_08]: A, Ms.

63
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Jackson.

64
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:27,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure of all of the other advisors that helped, but thank you for coordinating today's event and just giving us an opportunity to share with the larger community about the Haitian culture.

65
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:41,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, as I said, I'm going to share very, very brief remarks, and then I have a special citation from the mayor from the city of Medford to share because she was not able to be with us today.

66
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:52,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, I am going to do something a little bit different than what I've done in the past.

67
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:59,777
[SPEAKER_08]: This past Saturday, I had the opportunity to be at the city of Medford Haitian Flag Day celebration as well.

68
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:03,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And I shared a few key proverbs.

69
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to share a few of them with you here as well.

70
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:13,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Because within the Haitian culture, proverbs are used a lot.

71
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:22,050
[SPEAKER_08]: And for my staff and people that I work with, a lot of times when I share, I give visual images.

72
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:33,576
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do feel it's because of my culture and how I was raised that usually there is either a proverb or a visual image to connect to something that you're trying to say.

73
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:38,639
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you can see, the wonderful red and blue today represents the flag.

74
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:54,224
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the flag, the statement on the flag says, L'union fait la force, which means our unity, our strength is being in unity or being in accord.

75
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is a guiding principle of Haitians.

76
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:11,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And as superintendent, there are many times when I have spoken in the past, I've said we are one Medford, one district, because we are stronger together than we are apart, and you can take that on all levels.

77
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,071
[SPEAKER_08]: So together we stand strong, but divided we will fall.

78
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:22,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford and Haiti are similar in that we have diverse and historic populations.

79
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:28,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of us in the room have different skin color tones.

80
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,033
[SPEAKER_08]: We practice different religions.

81
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,676
[SPEAKER_08]: We speak different languages.

82
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:36,258
[SPEAKER_08]: We have different traditions.

83
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:44,265
[SPEAKER_08]: But together, we are a blend of cultures, much like our mascot here, the Mustang horse.

84
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:50,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I've said many times that mustangs come in a variety of colors.

85
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:56,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Some have patches, some have spots, and some have stripes.

86
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:05,893
[SPEAKER_08]: They are intelligent, peaceful horses who are hard workers and live in herds led by a female.

87
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:12,198
[SPEAKER_08]: We are all Mustangs, no matter our color, heritage, or creed.

88
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:17,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And our Mustangs happen to be led by a female, me.

89
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:25,449
[SPEAKER_08]: As we come together today to celebrate, I want to share a quote with you from Maya Angelou.

90
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:43,074
[SPEAKER_08]: She said, we all should know that diversity makes for a rich tapestry and we must understand that all the threads of the tapestry are equal in value no matter what their color.

91
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:47,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I say that to you because I feel it's symbolic of Medford.

92
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:55,681
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter what color you are, what creed you are, we are stronger together and everyone has equal value.

93
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:59,428
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to just share a few proverbs with you.

94
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,050
[SPEAKER_08]: One is this.

95
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:04,193
[SPEAKER_08]: It's three words.

96
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:07,037
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can repeat after me, I'd greatly appreciate it.

97
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:09,239
[SPEAKER_08]: The first word is shita.

98
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:11,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Pa.

99
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:13,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Bai.

100
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Shita, pa, bai.

101
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:19,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

102
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,711
[SPEAKER_08]: A plus for all of you.

103
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:21,412
[SPEAKER_08]: A plus.

104
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,232
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that mean?

105
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:27,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It means sitting doesn't yield.

106
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:33,254
[SPEAKER_08]: What it means is if you're sitting down, you're not able to produce.

107
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:41,316
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's an encouraging proverb that tells you get up, get out there, do what you need to do.

108
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:43,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Shita pabai.

109
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:47,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Another proverb I want to just share with you, which is a short proverb,

110
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:52,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Tutmunsemun.

111
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:53,445
[SPEAKER_08]: It's four words.

112
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:53,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Tut.

113
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:55,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Mun.

114
00:14:57,286 --> 00:14:57,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Se.

115
00:14:58,746 --> 00:14:59,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Mun.

116
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:01,847
[SPEAKER_08]: People are people.

117
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,367
[SPEAKER_08]: It means we love one another.

118
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,168
[SPEAKER_08]: We care for one another.

119
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,228
[SPEAKER_08]: We are all people.

120
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:10,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone has equal value.

121
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Tutmunsemun.

122
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:13,789
[SPEAKER_08]: One more time.

123
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Tutmunsemun.

124
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:17,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

125
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:32,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say I am so proud and grateful for this opportunity to stand before all of you and share a little bit of my culture, which all of these wonderful students are sharing with you as well.

126
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:34,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thank you for that.

127
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:45,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to share the proclamation from the city of Medford from Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kurd.

128
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:49,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Haitian American Heritage Month.

129
00:15:51,239 --> 00:16:02,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas Haitian American Heritage Month is a jubilant celebration in the United States, embracing Haitian heritage and culture,

130
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:21,862
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas first celebrated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1988, Haitian American Heritage Month is now observed nationwide in the month of May from Florida to Massachusetts with parades, festivals, and school activities.

131
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:40,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And, whereas, Haitian American Heritage Month salutes Haitian and Haitian American communities who exhibit appreciation for their culture and heritage that has immeasurably enriched the lives of the people of Medford, our state and our nation.

132
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:42,990
[SPEAKER_08]: And, whereas,

133
00:16:44,111 --> 00:17:04,136
[SPEAKER_08]: As educators, authors, community leaders, activists, athletes, artists, musicians, and politicians, Haitian Americans have made their mark in every facet of society and have contributed to the betterment and diversity of our city, state, and nation.

134
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:09,438
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas May 18th is Haitian Flag Day,

135
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:21,003
[SPEAKER_08]: in Haiti, which celebrates the culture and heritage of the Haitian flag, which honors their forefathers and replenishes their resolve for Haiti's future.

136
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:34,894
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas the city of Medford and the United States of America have thrived as a melding of immigrants, united by common values and the promise of a better tomorrow,

137
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:50,356
[SPEAKER_08]: and whereas there is a strong connection between Haitians and Medford's community and I encourage all of our residents to honor this observance now therefore I

138
00:17:51,778 --> 00:18:08,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Breonna Lungo-Kern, Mayor of the City of Medford, do hereby proclaim the month of May as Haitian American Heritage Month, signed with the seal of Medford by our Mayor, Mayor Breonna Lungo-Kern.

139
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:09,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

140
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:30,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we have a poem written by our very own Dionysia.

141
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:11,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, everybody.

142
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:19,905
[SPEAKER_07]: My first love, my first struggle.

143
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:22,647
[SPEAKER_07]: My smile, but also my snag.

144
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,549
[SPEAKER_07]: All black pride, my toxic relationship.

145
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,172
[SPEAKER_07]: We are afflicted by all these walls and these lies.

146
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:32,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Aren't we the cause of all these incurable diseases?

147
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:34,456
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their fault.

148
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:36,438
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your fault, but also my fault.

149
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,821
[SPEAKER_07]: They simply had to dump my nationality to deny you.

150
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:44,313
[SPEAKER_07]: But today, when they put me down because of you, I get up because of my freedom.

151
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:49,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I carry your name because I'm Haitian, and my bravery also comes from my roots.

152
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:57,999
[SPEAKER_07]: To greet you, do not hesitate if I ask you sac passe, because my origin also the blood that runs in my veins.

153
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I love my country, I will not only die for it, I will also live for it.

154
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:09,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm Haitian, I will not only fall fighting for it, but I will also rise.

155
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:12,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Because ADA is my only family.

156
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:14,672
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom owe my pride.

157
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for that.

158
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,265
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we have another poem by Wejena Prince.

159
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:57,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it work?

160
00:20:57,741 --> 00:20:57,921
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

161
00:20:58,602 --> 00:20:59,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, everyone.

162
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:00,582
[SPEAKER_06]: My name's Gina.

163
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I wrote this poem.

164
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:07,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be reading a poem about the earthquake in Haiti that happened.

165
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:16,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Haiti, the land of pride and joy, where our ancestors fought with courage and ploy for freedom from the French long ago.

166
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:20,209
[SPEAKER_06]: to choose their own faith and no longer bow.

167
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:32,654
[SPEAKER_06]: From Toussaint Levati to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, from the north to the south, from Port-au-Prince to Cap-Haïtien, we have fought and we have bled, only for our freedom we have wed.

168
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:39,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Then came the earthquake, so dreadful and strong, the land shook and trembled, nothing to be done.

169
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:44,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I was only seven, lost and scared.

170
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,359
[SPEAKER_06]: All I could think about was how scared I was.

171
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,843
[SPEAKER_06]: As my world crumbled and many lost, it was a tragic day that we will never forget.

172
00:21:55,664 --> 00:22:00,126
[SPEAKER_06]: For it seems our hope and dreams were swept, but we could not break.

173
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,728
[SPEAKER_06]: We could not be stopped.

174
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:07,411
[SPEAKER_06]: So we picked up pieces, built new, and took a stand.

175
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:11,334
[SPEAKER_06]: We remember our history, our strength, and our courage.

176
00:22:11,794 --> 00:22:15,717
[SPEAKER_06]: We vowed to never forget the revolution and the power it gave us.

177
00:22:16,497 --> 00:22:22,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Haiti, the land of pride and joy, we will continue to fight for freedom, no matter the cost.

178
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:25,583
[SPEAKER_06]: So let us remember the earthquake and our revolution.

179
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:29,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us never forget our courage and strength and our will to move on.

180
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:30,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

181
00:22:43,186 --> 00:22:46,247
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we'll be introducing Labodai.

182
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,348
[SPEAKER_11]: But before that, let me explain what it is.

183
00:22:55,648 --> 00:23:00,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a rhythm of traditional dance music played to the drum and arranged to electronic music.

184
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:03,010
[SPEAKER_11]: How we as Haitians express ourselves to the world.

185
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,090
[SPEAKER_11]: The love for our country and people.

186

[SPEAKER_10]: All right, and now we are going to introduce the legendary dance of the whole Haitian community.

198
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:49,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Introducing, Kupa!

199
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,832
[SPEAKER_10]: A little quick mistake over here.

200
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:21,935
[SPEAKER_10]: So while they're getting ready, I'm going to just read one of my poems for y'all.

201
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:26,958
[SPEAKER_10]: So this poem I wrote about Hades.

202
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:28,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to just read that to y'all.

203
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Haiti is a land of vibrant hues where the sun shines bright and never snooze.

207
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Their joy and passion shine so bright.

208
00:28:46,582 --> 00:28:50,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Their food is simply divine, with spices and flavors that intertwine.

209
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:55,070
[SPEAKER_10]: From guyo to akra to zijonjon, each dish is a delicious marathon.

210
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:00,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Haiti has seen these shares of struggles, but its people always rise in juggles.

211
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:04,517
[SPEAKER_10]: They rise above the challenges with the strength that's as firm as metal hinges.

212
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:06,478
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a land of wonder.

213
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:09,500
[SPEAKER_10]: May its beauty and its people never surrender.

214
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,983
[SPEAKER_10]: May its people forever be... Damn.

00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:15,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Never mind.

00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,106
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the lands of mountains and sea, a place of beauty and history.

00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:24,029
[SPEAKER_10]: From the lush green hills to the sandy shore, it is a land that you'll always adore.

218
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:27,872
[SPEAKER_10]: The people of Haiti are strong and brave, with a spirit that's never been enslaved.

219
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:31,655
[SPEAKER_10]: They face their fair share of trials and pain, but they will always rise up again.

220
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:39,482
[SPEAKER_10]: The culture of Haiti is rich and diverse, from the music to the art that they converse, with rhythms that make your heart beat fast, and colors that make your senses vast.

221
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:43,423
[SPEAKER_10]: The food of Haiti is a feast for the soul with flavors that makes you feel whole.
