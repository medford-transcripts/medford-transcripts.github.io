1
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:06,066
How y'all doing today?

2
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:12,734
My name is Prince Alcidor.

3
00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:13,935
Guess what his name is.

4
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:14,896
Also Prince.

5
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:25,949
All right, so first off, we're going to be introducing y'all to the Haitian National Anthem by Kernessa and Yamile.

6
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:55,487
Pour les aïeux, pour la patrie, Aux dieux des poids, aux dieux des poids.

7
00:00:56,408 --> 00:01:05,033
Sous ta garde infinie, Prenons droit notre vie,

8
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:20,583
O Dieu des Pouvoirs, O Dieu des Pouvoirs, pour les ailleurs, pour la Patrie.

9
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:34,707
O Dieu, O Dieu, O Dieu des Pouvoirs, pour les ailleurs, pour la Patrie.

10
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:44,279
What did you tell them?

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,001
Oh, nothing.

12
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:57,048
O Haiti, pays en cette joie.

13
00:01:57,088 --> 00:02:02,430
C'est pour marcher maintenant à main.

14
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:12,554
Nous m'y donnes pas fait pour qu'entre-t' nous fêtes pour s'admettre.

15
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:19,797
Nous allons marcher maintenant

16
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:24,562
I know, I know, I know.

17
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,561
And now we will be welcoming our very own Mr. Principal de Leyva.

18
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:16,489
Thank you everyone.

19
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,574
It's a big day for our Haitian community as today marks our annual celebration of Haitian Flag Day.

20
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:34,775
These assemblies help us understand the diversity of our Mustang population, as we all can learn about other cultures and have a better understanding of one another.

21
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:37,416
I'd like to recognize a few people today.

22
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:46,301
Obviously, our superintendent, Dr. Maryse Edvard-Vincent, who will be participating in this assembly, and I'm going to let her do more of the chanting than I will do.

23
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:52,654
I'd also like to recognize our mayor who's not here, but she would be presenting a proclamation.

24
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:54,998
I think the superintendent's gonna be doing that as well.

25
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,443
Definitely have to thank the Black Student Union.

26
00:03:58,464 --> 00:03:59,665
Let's give them a round of applause.

27
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:11,292
Without them, we wouldn't have had our assembly, and without the guidance of Ms.

28
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,693
Andrea Artsell, Ms.

29
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:19,979
Jemiah Jackson, and Mr. Rose Walker for all their guidance in having this assembly happen, so let's congratulate them as well.

30
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:34,430
So on May 18th each year, Haitians across the world commemorate the country's independence from France.

31
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:38,816
and a moment of red and blue flag that was hoisted up for the first time in 1803.

32
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:55,969
For a little history, that's when the white band was taken out of the flag during the French rule, creating the first Haitian flag that's symbolic of the alliance of black and mixed race people left behind to fight for freedom.

33
00:04:57,335 --> 00:05:05,463
I'd like to welcome back our two princes, Medford High's two princes, to continue with the celebration, and I'm glad to be part of this assembly.

34
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:06,104
Thank you all.

35
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,735
And now, we have an opening dance.

36
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:31,335
Thank you again for being here, and I'm very privileged and grateful to be able to share this space again with you all.

37
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:43,785
What you're going to watch is a dance that we create, not only me as a choreographer who helped them, but those young people really have so much passion and so much eager to do so much more.

38
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,868
So if you feel the vibe while they're dancing, just shake yourself wherever you are.

39
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,693
So I would like to welcome you, Ibo, because Ibo is a dance of freedom.

40
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,937
It's a dance really represent Haiti at its core.

41
00:05:57,037 --> 00:06:02,924
So for the day of celebrating the flag, this is the best way we could definitely share our culture with you with Ibo.

42
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:03,966
So welcome, Ibo.

43
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,909
And now we will be sharing opening remarks by Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent, the superintendent of Bedford Public Schools, who will be sharing the Haitian Flag Day proclamation on behalf of Mayor Brianna Luongo-Kern.

44
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,896
Good afternoon, everyone.

45
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:23,899
Sac passe!

46
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,821
Sac passe!

47
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:29,846
Sakpase.

48
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:32,409
That's good.

49
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:37,094
Sakpase means it's good.

50
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:38,556
What's happening?

51
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:39,477
How's it going?

52
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:43,222
Napule, even though if you take it literally,

53
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:48,709
It says like it's burning, but you don't really use it literally that way.

54
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:50,410
It's just, it's good.

55
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,071
So it's good to hear everyone knowing that phrase.

56
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,993
I'm so excited to be here, always to come before you.

57
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:03,176
As I begin my remarks today, I want to say thank you again to the BSU.

58
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:05,597
I want to thank all, Ms.

59
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,698
Andrea Pierre-Paul, Ms.

60
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:09,399
Walker, Charose Walker.

61
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,120
I know Ms.

62
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,720
A, Ms.

63
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,221
Jackson.

64
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:27,991
I'm not sure of all of the other advisors that helped, but thank you for coordinating today's event and just giving us an opportunity to share with the larger community about the Haitian culture.

65
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:41,700
And so, as I said, I'm going to share very, very brief remarks, and then I have a special citation from the mayor from the city of Medford to share because she was not able to be with us today.

66
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:52,213
Today, I am going to do something a little bit different than what I've done in the past.

67
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:59,777
This past Saturday, I had the opportunity to be at the city of Medford Haitian Flag Day celebration as well.

68
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:03,840
And I shared a few key proverbs.

69
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,422
And I want to share a few of them with you here as well.

70
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:13,086
Because within the Haitian culture, proverbs are used a lot.

71
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:22,050
And for my staff and people that I work with, a lot of times when I share, I give visual images.

72
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:33,576
And I do feel it's because of my culture and how I was raised that usually there is either a proverb or a visual image to connect to something that you're trying to say.

73
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:38,639
So as you can see, the wonderful red and blue today represents the flag.

74
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:54,224
And on the flag, the statement on the flag says, L'union fait la force, which means our unity, our strength is being in unity or being in accord.

75
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,905
So that is a guiding principle of Haitians.

76
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:11,390
And as superintendent, there are many times when I have spoken in the past, I've said we are one Medford, one district, because we are stronger together than we are apart, and you can take that on all levels.

77
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,071
So together we stand strong, but divided we will fall.

78
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:22,594
Medford and Haiti are similar in that we have diverse and historic populations.

79
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:28,131
Many of us in the room have different skin color tones.

80
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,033
We practice different religions.

81
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,676
We speak different languages.

82
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:36,258
We have different traditions.

83
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:44,265
But together, we are a blend of cultures, much like our mascot here, the Mustang horse.

84
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:50,886
I've said many times that mustangs come in a variety of colors.

85
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:56,669
Some have patches, some have spots, and some have stripes.

86
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:05,893
They are intelligent, peaceful horses who are hard workers and live in herds led by a female.

87
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:12,198
We are all Mustangs, no matter our color, heritage, or creed.

88
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:17,282
And our Mustangs happen to be led by a female, me.

89
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:25,449
As we come together today to celebrate, I want to share a quote with you from Maya Angelou.

90
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:43,074
She said, we all should know that diversity makes for a rich tapestry and we must understand that all the threads of the tapestry are equal in value no matter what their color.

91
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:47,536
I say that to you because I feel it's symbolic of Medford.

92
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:55,681
No matter what color you are, what creed you are, we are stronger together and everyone has equal value.

93
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:59,428
So I want to just share a few proverbs with you.

94
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,050
One is this.

95
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:04,193
It's three words.

96
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:07,037
If you can repeat after me, I'd greatly appreciate it.

97
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:09,239
The first word is shita.

98
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:11,802
Pa.

99
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:13,925
Bai.

100
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,968
Shita, pa, bai.

101
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:19,371
Excellent.

102
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,711
A plus for all of you.

103
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:21,412
A plus.

104
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,232
What does that mean?

105
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:27,153
It means sitting doesn't yield.

106
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:33,254
What it means is if you're sitting down, you're not able to produce.

107
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:41,316
So it's an encouraging proverb that tells you get up, get out there, do what you need to do.

108
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:43,316
Shita pabai.

109
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:47,977
Another proverb I want to just share with you, which is a short proverb,

110
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:52,345
Tutmunsemun.

111
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:53,445
It's four words.

112
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:53,846
Tut.

113
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:55,966
Mun.

114
00:14:57,286 --> 00:14:57,666
Se.

115
00:14:58,746 --> 00:14:59,167
Mun.

116
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:01,847
People are people.

117
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,367
It means we love one another.

118
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,168
We care for one another.

119
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,228
We are all people.

120
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:10,709
Everyone has equal value.

121
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,249
Tutmunsemun.

122
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:13,789
One more time.

123
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,250
Tutmunsemun.

124
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:17,670
Wonderful.

125
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:32,658
I just want to say I am so proud and grateful for this opportunity to stand before all of you and share a little bit of my culture, which all of these wonderful students are sharing with you as well.

126
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:34,619
And I thank you for that.

127
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:45,837
I want to share the proclamation from the city of Medford from Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kurd.

128
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:49,658
Haitian American Heritage Month.

129
00:15:51,239 --> 00:16:02,543
Whereas Haitian American Heritage Month is a jubilant celebration in the United States, embracing Haitian heritage and culture,

130
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:21,862
And whereas first celebrated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1988, Haitian American Heritage Month is now observed nationwide in the month of May from Florida to Massachusetts with parades, festivals, and school activities.

131
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:40,829
And, whereas, Haitian American Heritage Month salutes Haitian and Haitian American communities who exhibit appreciation for their culture and heritage that has immeasurably enriched the lives of the people of Medford, our state and our nation.

132
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:42,990
And, whereas,

133
00:16:44,111 --> 00:17:04,136
As educators, authors, community leaders, activists, athletes, artists, musicians, and politicians, Haitian Americans have made their mark in every facet of society and have contributed to the betterment and diversity of our city, state, and nation.

134
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:09,438
And whereas May 18th is Haitian Flag Day,

135
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:21,003
in Haiti, which celebrates the culture and heritage of the Haitian flag, which honors their forefathers and replenishes their resolve for Haiti's future.

136
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:34,894
And whereas the city of Medford and the United States of America have thrived as a melding of immigrants, united by common values and the promise of a better tomorrow,

137
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:50,356
and whereas there is a strong connection between Haitians and Medford's community and I encourage all of our residents to honor this observance now therefore I

138
00:17:51,778 --> 00:18:08,375
Breonna Lungo-Kern, Mayor of the City of Medford, do hereby proclaim the month of May as Haitian American Heritage Month, signed with the seal of Medford by our Mayor, Mayor Breonna Lungo-Kern.

139
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:09,336
Thank you.

140
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:30,340
And now we have a poem written by our very own Dionysia.

141
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:11,879
Hi, everybody.

142
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:19,905
My first love, my first struggle.

143
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:22,647
My smile, but also my snag.

144
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,549
All black pride, my toxic relationship.

145
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,172
We are afflicted by all these walls and these lies.

146
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:32,815
Aren't we the cause of all these incurable diseases?

147
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:34,456
It's their fault.

148
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:36,438
It's your fault, but also my fault.

149
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,821
They simply had to dump my nationality to deny you.

150
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:44,313
But today, when they put me down because of you, I get up because of my freedom.

151
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:49,695
I carry your name because I'm Haitian, and my bravery also comes from my roots.

152
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:57,999
To greet you, do not hesitate if I ask you sac passe, because my origin also the blood that runs in my veins.

153
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,222
Because I love my country, I will not only die for it, I will also live for it.

154
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:09,644
Because I'm Haitian, I will not only fall fighting for it, but I will also rise.

155
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:12,370
Because ADA is my only family.

156
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:14,672
My mom owe my pride.

157
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,461
Thank you for that.

158
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,265
And now we have another poem by Wejena Prince.

159
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:57,221
Does it work?

160
00:20:57,741 --> 00:20:57,921
OK.

161
00:20:58,602 --> 00:20:59,462
Hello, everyone.

162
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:00,582
My name's Gina.

163
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,044
I wrote this poem.

164
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:07,305
I'll be reading a poem about the earthquake in Haiti that happened.

165
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:16,168
Oh, Haiti, the land of pride and joy, where our ancestors fought with courage and ploy for freedom from the French long ago.

166
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:20,209
to choose their own faith and no longer bow.

167
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:32,654
From Toussaint Levati to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, from the north to the south, from Port-au-Prince to Cap-Haïtien, we have fought and we have bled, only for our freedom we have wed.

168
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:39,657
Then came the earthquake, so dreadful and strong, the land shook and trembled, nothing to be done.

169
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:44,257
I was only seven, lost and scared.

170
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,359
All I could think about was how scared I was.

171
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,843
As my world crumbled and many lost, it was a tragic day that we will never forget.

172
00:21:55,664 --> 00:22:00,126
For it seems our hope and dreams were swept, but we could not break.

173
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,728
We could not be stopped.

174
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:07,411
So we picked up pieces, built new, and took a stand.

175
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:11,334
We remember our history, our strength, and our courage.

176
00:22:11,794 --> 00:22:15,717
We vowed to never forget the revolution and the power it gave us.

177
00:22:16,497 --> 00:22:22,401
Our Haiti, the land of pride and joy, we will continue to fight for freedom, no matter the cost.

178
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:25,583
So let us remember the earthquake and our revolution.

179
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:29,826
Let us never forget our courage and strength and our will to move on.

180
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:30,467
Thank you.

181
00:22:43,186 --> 00:22:46,247
And now we'll be introducing Labodai.

182
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,348
But before that, let me explain what it is.

183
00:22:55,648 --> 00:23:00,449
It's a rhythm of traditional dance music played to the drum and arranged to electronic music.

184
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:03,010
How we as Haitians express ourselves to the world.

185
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,090
The love for our country and people.

186
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,051
Join us as we show you how we show our love with Labodai.

187
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:28,276
♪ Shower on pencil and just love it back it ♪

188
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,836
We are the champions!

189
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:39,930
I'm

190
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,102
Watch out!

191
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:12,183
Watch out!

192
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,844
Watch out!

193
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:15,405
Watch out!

194
00:26:15,445 --> 00:26:16,386
Watch out!

195
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:05,275
All right, and now we're going to introduce

196
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:35,730
I apologize.

197
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:46,101
All right, and now we are going to introduce the legendary dance of the whole Haitian community.

198
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:49,304
Introducing, Kupa!

199
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,832
A little quick mistake over here.

200
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:21,935
So while they're getting ready, I'm going to just read one of my poems for y'all.

201
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:26,958
So this poem I wrote about Hades.

202
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:28,679
I'm going to just read that to y'all.

203
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,601
Haiti is a land of vibrant hues where the sun shines bright and never snooze.

204
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:37,564
From the mountains to the sea, its beauty never ceases to be.

205
00:28:38,044 --> 00:28:41,207
Its people are full of life with a spirit that can't be cut by any knife.

206
00:28:41,547 --> 00:28:43,048
They dance and sing with all their might.

207
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,102
Their joy and passion shine so bright.

208
00:28:46,582 --> 00:28:50,265
Their food is simply divine, with spices and flavors that intertwine.

209
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:55,070
From guyo to akra to zijonjon, each dish is a delicious marathon.

210
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:00,574
Haiti has seen these shares of struggles, but its people always rise in juggles.

211
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:04,517
They rise above the challenges with the strength that's as firm as metal hinges.

212
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:06,478
It is a land of wonder.

213
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:09,500
May its beauty and its people never surrender.

214
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,983
May its people forever be... Damn.

215
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:15,764
Never mind.

216
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,106
It is the lands of mountains and sea, a place of beauty and history.

217
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:24,029
From the lush green hills to the sandy shore, it is a land that you'll always adore.

218
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:27,872
The people of Haiti are strong and brave, with a spirit that's never been enslaved.

219
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:31,655
They face their fair share of trials and pain, but they will always rise up again.

220
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:39,482
The culture of Haiti is rich and diverse, from the music to the art that they converse, with rhythms that make your heart beat fast, and colors that make your senses vast.

221
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:43,423
The food of Haiti is a feast for the soul with flavors that makes you feel whole.

222
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:47,048
From the spicy stews to the sweetest treats, it's a cuisine that can't be beat.

223
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:52,135
So let us remember Haiti, this land of the free, and all the beauty and the strength that we see.

224
00:29:52,395 --> 00:29:57,442
Let us stand with the people who face each day with grace and honor the spirit of this remarkable place.

225
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:02,718
All right.

226
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:05,300
All right.

227
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:12,444
Now, for real, we're going to... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

228
00:30:12,484 --> 00:30:16,027
Before we get to this dancing, Stevens Exeter, can you please come down?

229
00:30:18,388 --> 00:30:19,509
That sunshine, nah.

230
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,431
Yo, Stevens.

231
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:22,511
Yo.

232
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:33,205
Yo, Steve-O.

233
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:33,545
Now, now.

234
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:05,549
Now we're going to really announce the Kumbaya dance.

235
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,432
Hope y'all enjoy.

236
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:41,488
It's brutal, she wants me to hit her, she loves the style, she likes it.

237
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:50,895
She says I'm cool, she wants me to be cool, she wants me to go crazy, she makes me freak out.

238
00:31:50,955 --> 00:31:52,656
Honestly, do it for me, sir.

239
00:32:18,141 --> 00:32:19,522
Si c'est ça.

240
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:45,564
Si l'pas commandé ou pon di tête en bas, Kembe l'nacheux de pou a pou gaif li la, Pédé a pointé toute cocaïla, Pou a balta pou pou gaila, Pousse l'lique mandé ou l'éveil, Mettez sous tabla, Pou l'marcher sous quatre pattes, L'éveil bat chante la, Pou qu'on enlève l'sa.

242
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:45,105
You got your gym suit on.

foreign foreign

244
00:35:15,543 --> 00:35:17,344
That was very bell, you know?

245
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:18,765
So I'm Bell Bagari.

246
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:20,306
I love my culture.

247
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,226
Did y'all enjoy that?

248
00:35:22,707 --> 00:35:23,107
Yeah.

249
00:35:24,448 --> 00:35:29,631
All right, we got that.

250
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:33,654
And now we have some closing remarks by Sheryl Swalker.

251
00:35:38,717 --> 00:35:39,857
Good afternoon, everyone.

252
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:40,778
How was that?

253
00:35:45,147 --> 00:35:52,708
Our BSU members, they worked really hard on all of this for months, so let's give them another round of applause.

254
00:35:57,412 --> 00:36:07,359
And I'd like to personally thank them, so I'm going to call them out one by one by name, starting with Prince Altador.

255
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,580
Come on out, Prince.

And unfortunately, our BSU advisors are not here, so that would be Miss Jackson and Miss A, but Mr. De La Russo, can you please come to the stage?

286
00:37:55,137 --> 00:38:01,118
As well as, last but not least, our wonderful Miss Andrea Pierpont, please.

287
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,840
Just want to thank you all, and it has been a pleasure as I will be leaving.

288
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,501
It makes me a little sad, but I am so proud of you.

289
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:20,242
And yes, this is a great performance today.

290
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:22,382
So take care.
