    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=251.224s">Okay,</a>  and you're here representing Dunkin' Donuts, correct?</p>

    <p>[GswFX5Excbs_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=254.085s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=255.522s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=256.863s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=258.203s">I</a>  see everything is in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=260.264s">The</a>  question I have is hours of operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=262.465s">Can</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=262.765s">Fischel</a>  just review that with us?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=266.647s">Yes,</a>  the business opens at 4 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=268.688s">and</a>  closes at nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=269.769s">However,</a>  the employees go in at 3.30 to prepare the shop.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=277.533s">That's</a>  not the practice at the other Dunkin' Donuts, if I'm correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=280.734s">We've</a>  passed a few of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=282.888s">recently</a>  and 3.30 seems very early for our neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=295.994s">I</a>  think five o'clock is the normal opening time.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=299.256s">Right,</a>  that's why I'm a little.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=300.176s">Yeah,</a>  you need a special. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=301.757s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=303.978s">To</a>  open at four. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=306.099s">You</a>  can open at five right now, but if you wanna open at four, you'd have to come back for a special permit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=312.616s">Okay,</a>  so we can open at five o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=314.118s">7</a>  to 11.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=316.64s">7</a>  to 11 is the normal business hours and anything other than that requires a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=328.073s">So</a>  what was with the previous owner is eliminated as we move forward with our takeovers now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=335.895s">So,</a>  Mr. President, other than the hours and making that a restriction for the record, I see everything else is in order, move approval.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=348.299s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=349.76s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=352.041s">Second,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=363.835s">and</a>  then they can come back for a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=367.097s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=370.658s">And</a>  seconded by Vice President Knight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=375.16s">If</a>  I may, so the current closing time is 9 p.m., is that what she said?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=379.222s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=384.284s">I</a>  think she said the current closing time you said was 9 p.m.? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=389.487s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=390.567s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=390.927s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=393.205s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Scarpelli as amended, seconded by Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=398.667s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=458.238s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=459.058s">Yeah,</a>  Laurel and Jim are on the call right now, so I'll pass it to them in one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=462.9s">But</a>  they are the co-chairs of this commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=464.501s">Many</a>  of the members are on the call right now as well, who put in an incredible amount of work that they also catalog. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=470.424s">I</a>  know it's been more than this, but at least 62 hours of meetings, you know, a number of representatives from different community members, representatives of business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=479.989s">And</a>  the report was delivered to the mayor about a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=482.711s">And</a>  then I shared it with the council a week ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=485.612s">It</a>  was made public later in the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=487.774s">a</a>  lot of recommendations for how to move forward and parking policy and enforcement in the city based off of a number of specific charges from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=497.022s">So</a>  I'll hand it off to Laurel and Jim to provide a kind of overview and update on that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=502.546s">Okay,</a>  Mr. Mayor, I mean, Mr. President, Councilor Scarpelli, if I can, I really appreciate the hard work this committee has done, and I appreciate Councilor Morell sending us the <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=517.172s">the</a>  report, but I think it would truly do this committee an injustice that if we just hold it to a, just a review and just talking about it in a council session, I would feel really comfortable and do a quick synopsis maybe, but I would really call, you know, make the motion that we call for a committee, the whole meeting with the whole committee and the council, because there are a number of questions I have, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=548.298s">And</a>  it was only done because of the hard work to this commission that brought up some great concerns and great issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=557.023s">So,</a>  and in resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=559.664s">So,</a>  like I said, I appreciate them being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=563.627s">I'd</a>  love to hear a brief synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=566.608s">And</a>  if that, if my colleagues agree with me, I think this really needs a whole committee, the whole meeting that we could really spend <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=575.024s">a</a>  whole evening on this, really breaking this down because it is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=579.147s">It's</a>  probably like I said, other than the streets and sidewalks, probably the next biggest question we get on the council from constituents is traffic and parking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=589.435s">So</a>  I make that into a form of motion.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=592.557s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=595.319s">Mr.</a>  President, I certainly would support that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=597.621s">The</a>  paper that was provided to us was an 80 page document. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=600.062s">And</a>  I think it would be <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=601.508s">uh,</a>  most appropriate if we had an opportunity to review it and then we could ask him phone questions that it could be able to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=606.987s">I</a>  don't think that's a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=608.552s">Um,</a>  in preparation for a committee of the whole, that's the direction of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=611.533s">So</a>  chooses to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=612.873s">Um,</a>  I also think it would be proper that we get a copies of all the documents that are related to all the public documents that are related to the meetings that took up, you know, the copies of the minutes, the meeting minutes, so that we can kind of, uh, put into context what the report says. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=623.935s">And,</a>  uh, we can look at that chronological history of, uh, how we got to this 80 page document. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=628.336s">So</a>  I think that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=629.696s">Um,</a>  Mr. President asked that that be provided by the membership at the committee of the whole meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=634.75s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=635.631s">Councilor</a>  Morell, then I'll offer the second to the motion as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=638.333s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=639.213s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=640.635s">Yeah,</a>  I fully support Councilor Scarpelli's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=642.796s">In</a>  discussions with Jim and Laurel, we had that same conversation about, you know, the idea that this would probably be great for Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=649.121s">So</a>  really just introducing this tonight, and I fully agree that there's a lot of conversation and questions that can be asked about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=655.866s">So</a>  just getting the ball rolling, and I agree with Councilor Scarpelli that we should have a Committee of the Whole on this.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=661.028s">We</a>  wanna hear from a brief synopsis on the- They're here, I would not disrespect- Jim Silva.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=667.571s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=669.792s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=671.232s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=672.893s">I</a>  agree with both my colleagues, Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=678.535s">I</a>  think this warrants a far more in-depth detailed meeting, which would be precisely a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=684.818s">So</a>  I agree with that assumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=687.599s">The</a>  question I did have, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=689.814s">And</a>  it's great to have the full membership of the Traffic Advisory Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=697.936s">However,</a>  that was the first step in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=701.997s">And</a>  I think it would be equally as helpful to also have someone from the administration present, because the next phase of this, to my understanding, is rollout, implementation, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=714.599s">And</a>  that's a vital component. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=718.523s">This</a>  was fact gathering and making recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=721.205s">I</a>  believe there were 21 really worthy recommendations made, but there's also two other steps in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=729.192s">And</a>  I wanna make sure that this doesn't just end up in step one, that we see this to fruition, step two and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=736.038s">So</a>  I would ask that the committee of whole also includes representatives from the city administration that can speak on this, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=744.425s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=744.906s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=746.938s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=747.699s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Morell for bringing this forward and also state that I am in full agreement with Councilor Scarpelli as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=756.406s">And</a>  I thank the task force for being on the call tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=761.01s">I</a>  think it'd be good to get a synopsis of the work that they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=766.815s">And</a>  I thank them for the work that they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=768.296s">I</a>  know a lot of hours and hard work has gone into this, but I do think it'd be very beneficial to have a committee of the whole meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=776.605s">just</a>  so we can look at just this topic and really, you know, take a look at this report and ask all the questions that we need to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=782.767s">And</a>  I agree with Councilor Marks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=784.567s">I</a>  think it's vital that someone from the administration is there to, you know, to give us their opinions on the report and to talk about, you know, how this can be implemented if that's the way we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=798.728s">but</a>  I look forward to that and I am definitely in support of the Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=803.569s">And</a>  I wanna, once again, thank the task force for all their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=806.629s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=807.209s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=808.29s">Jim</a>  or Laura, do you wanna give a brief synopsis or you wanna wait for the Committee of the Whole meeting?</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=814.831s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=815.691s">My</a>  name is Laurel Ruma. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=816.591s">I</a>  live at 149 Burgett Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=820.412s">The</a>  context for this commission is probably quite important for folks who may be hearing about this for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=828.124s">which</a>  is when the mayor came in, one of her, to office, one of her primary goals was to figure out Park Medford and how to improve parking in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=838.627s">Unfortunately,</a>  then the pandemic hit and in October of 2020, this commission was assembled. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=844.109s">So</a>  it is a group of folks from around the city, business owners and residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=850.151s">We</a>  have a contract lawyer, a writer, data scientist, all sorts of folks who've lived here for a long time and who've just moved here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=858.441s">And</a>  the hope was to start the process, start the process, which is going to be a very long process, of collecting as much data as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=866.763s">So</a>  I'm sorry you haven't had a chance to read this thrilling 60-page report, because it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=873.684s">It's</a>  a fascinating deep dive into why parking is so difficult, specifically in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=880.025s">The</a>  issues that we highlight in the 21 recommendations are not the only 21 recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=885.687s">There</a>  are recommendations throughout the entire report <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=888.29s">I</a>  please ask everyone just give a read through and come to the committee of the whole meeting ready with lots of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=895.954s">The</a>  charge from the mayor was to emphasize looking at the South Medford and Hillside neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=903.759s">Jim</a>  and I have been the representatives for the city, for the MBTA's construction working group since 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=912.644s">We've</a>  been appointed by two mayors now, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=918.225s">And</a>  I've been working on this project since 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=920.066s">So</a>  the Green Line extension is real. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=922.707s">It's</a>  coming to Medford and actually will be open in January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=927.149s">So</a>  unfortunately, the pandemic delayed us quite a bit, but the hope was that we would always start looking at parking specifically for these two neighborhoods where the stations are situated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=937.833s">The</a>  complexity of parking is that there is, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=942.313s">It's</a>  a give and take process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=944.034s">And</a>  this is what we really want folks to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=947.156s">We</a>  recommended zoned parking for across the city, but a trade off with zoned parking is to have more flexibility with better permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=955.841s">For</a>  example, home health care aids, being able to call the city 24 hours before your kid has a birthday party, things like this that will actually make the parking program much more humane. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=966.559s">Another</a>  issue that my neighbors have thankfully asked me about, we've gotten quite a bit of feedback, so I really appreciate all that feedback as well, has been the issue of allowing Tufts students who are enrolled at Tufts University, as well as on the lease of the apartment, making them residents of the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=987.538s">able</a>  to get some kind of resident parking pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=990.159s">Again,</a>  this is something that we have to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=993.38s">If</a>  we decide not to do it as a city, that's fine, but this is one of those major issues that not only do neighbors have on the street, but landlords as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1003.064s">You'll</a>  also notice that the report takes a look at zoning changes that the state has made very recently, like last month, which allow less restrictive zoning around <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1017.842s">transit</a>  stations, that means Ball Square in Medford, which is the Medford station is in Ball Square, and Tufts Medford station, which is College and Boston Avenue, obviously also Medford, and West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1034.334s">That</a>  radius is half a mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1037.116s">So</a>  if you're standing on the corner of Boston and College Avenue, you're talking about more permissive zoning all the way down Bob's to Bob's on Main Street <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1047.809s">to</a>  the entire length of Main Street to Broadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1051.11s">So</a>  these are big challenges for our city, and this is why parking is so integral to everything else that we're trying to think about as a city as we roll out our master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1061.233s">Also,</a>  you'll notice that the state has, as well as the federal government, a very aggressive goal by 2030 and then by 2050 to reduce carbon emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1069.896s">That</a>  means a lot more electric vehicles on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1072.316s">This</a>  is an opportunity for the city to invest in electric vehicle charging stations, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1077.833s">I</a>  am positive we can get some really good grant funding as we start to think about where we'd like to see electric vehicles parking be situated in neighborhoods and at businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1087.362s">Again,</a>  we tried to boil the ocean here, but we have just a short report of what we could possibly talk about, and the reason Jim and I are so <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1097.231s">absolutely</a>  obsessed with this is that we live in these neighborhoods of South Medford and Hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1101.432s">We've</a>  been involved in this green line change for a very long time, and we know the impact it's going to have in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1109.934s">And</a>  it's not being hyperbolic to say it will absolutely change this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1115.296s">And</a>  so we need the city to help South Medford and Hillside to become that great place that people want to come and take the green line to and from. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1126.123s">The</a>  other important thing that everyone should understand is that the MBTA considers walking distance from train stations to be a one mile radius. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1134.145s">So</a>  that encompasses Boston Avenue, all the way down to South Street, all the way over to Route 16, and then obviously way into South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1146.008s">So</a>  it affects literally the entire half of the city that is on the west side of the river.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1155.3s">That's</a>  why we need the whole committee of a whole, because you bring up so many points that it would be just impossible to cover it in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1163.302s">So</a>  again, I say, in two minutes, you brought up 10 great points that all need to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1171.684s">I</a>  will give you a date for the committee to hold by the end of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1176.805s">I'll</a>  get it to both you and Jim, and you can pass it on to your committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1180.986s">And</a>  probably within the next, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1184.102s">two</a>  weeks, so I'll check the calendar to see what the next Wednesday we have available. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1189.807s">Does</a>  the Wednesday work for your committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1193.61s">Because</a>  I think we would need a full two hours and I don't want to be pushing us against the clock on a council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1199.976s">So</a>  I think a Wednesday night would be the best way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1202.698s">That</a>  work for you guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1203.359s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1207.222s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1577.506s">You</a>  want the users identified?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1580.968s">I</a>  want the users to be notified that there was a data breach. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1585.55s">They</a>  may have been notified by Park Mobile, but I think it would be helpful if Park Medford would notify them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1595.579s">Do</a>  you want to make that a form of amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1598.32s">Sure,</a>  it's in my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1600.101s">So</a>  if they're consolidated, I think it's already included.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1605.323s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1605.784s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1607.364s">Anybody</a>  else want to speak on this?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1638.768s">Vice</a>  President Knighton. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1642.43s">I</a>  believe Republic Parking is the parking enforcement agent that is acting as Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1648.478s">It</a>  uses ParkMobile as the application to allow individuals to purchase parking electronically. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1654.602s">And</a>  the data breach affected that third party vendor, who is the largest in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1661.246s">So</a>  it seems to me like Metro residents have been impacted because they have been notified.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1667.17s">Okay,</a>  thank you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1668.13s">I</a>  misheard with all the different park this, park that, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1759.04s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1760.26s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1761.9s">One</a>  of the best kept mysteries in the city of Medford is how to get a brick down at Tufts Park at the Gone Too Soon Memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1768.581s">This</a>  issue has been brought to my attention a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1771.542s">I've</a>  tried to <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1772.978s">reach</a>  out to individuals that are associated with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1775.799s">And</a>  that's, it's really been a non fruitful search. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1780.201s">However,</a>  I think that this going to some soon Memorial in Tufts Park is something that needs a little bit of love and attention, Mr. President needs a little bit more involvement from our city and our parks commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1792.985s">And</a>  I think the application process also needs to be opened up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1796.006s">Since</a>  the last time applications were accepted, we've lost a number of individuals in this community factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1800.9s">I</a>  don't think anybody will ever agree that somebody's gone on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1803.302s">Everybody's</a>  gone too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1804.824s">And</a>  self-benefit is a great neighborhood filled with a lot of people that have pride from the area that they come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1810.209s">And</a>  I've heard a number of individuals that are seeking applications for this purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1814.954s">So</a>  I'm asking that the Parks Commission reopen the application process and maybe this summer we can install some bricks down at Tufts Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1822.201s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, because we have the Community Preservation Act, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1825.297s">I</a>  thought that this might be an opportunity to see if we are eligible to receive CPA funding for this project to offset the cost for the families that are seeking to put bricks in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1834.944s">So</a>  with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1838.066s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1838.987s">Again,</a>  I want to thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1841.669s">I</a>  myself have received many calls from people asking how to purchase bricks, and I didn't know how to get in touch with anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1847.333s">And</a>  again, this is one of those little secret down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1853.756s">I've</a>  got several friends that are part of that memorial down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1857.237s">And</a>  again, thank you for doing this for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1859.198s">So</a>  on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1863.699s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1889.06s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1890.841s">Over</a>  the last several weeks, I received a number of phone calls and emails from area residents concerned about our waste collection. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1900.624s">And</a>  the fact that for many residents of this community that have to deal with residents that putting their barrels out <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1912.103s">too</a>  early, and it's creating not only debris, Mr. President, on these windy nights, as we all know, it's also creating an increase in rodents throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1926.275s">And</a>  I'm getting complaint after complaint in many of our neighborhoods about an increase in rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1933.921s">And</a>  we were told on many occasions, if you give them a water source and a food source, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1939.662s">rats</a>  will come. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1941.123s">And</a>  indeed, putting the barrels out too early is an additional food source. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1947.525s">So</a>  I asked Mr. President not to be punitive and ask that the city find residents, but to notify residents that there is an ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1958.849s">And</a>  the reason why I bring it up is <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1960.946s">You</a>  never hear much discussion regarding the ordinance itself, but it does exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1966.634s">And</a>  I happen to have done a little research and asked our police department, code enforcement and border health, how many tickets <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1976.555s">were</a>  issued over the past year for a violation of section 70-4, which is the placement of receptacles, which are trash bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1988.099s">And</a>  I was told, Mr. President, that there were 55 tickets written in the past year, not all for putting out trash too early, for putting out <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2001.754s">So</a>  for other items that are against the ordinance that are left overnight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2007.838s">So</a>  it's clear to me that we've probably issued a dozen or two tickets for putting out trash too early in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2017.803s">And</a>  I would just like to read the solid waste ordinance so people are aware, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2023.827s">I</a>  don't think people are malicious. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2025.848s">I</a>  know I'm always trying to get my trash out ahead of time to make sure it's out on the <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2030.08s">the</a>  street, Mr. President, but I think once people are aware what the rules and regulations are, they will comply, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2038.765s">And</a>  it's not just compliance for the sake of compliance, it's for the sake of not having trash blown all over the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2047.396s">not</a>  having rodent problems and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2049.998s">So</a>  section 70-4 of the solid waste article states, article one states, placement of receptacles. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2059.164s">All</a>  receptacles containing ashes or rubbish, I think that shows you how old this ordinance is, shall be placed on the outer edge of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2070.492s">It</a>  shall be placed in such a manner <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2072.675s">so</a>  that the free flow of travel on the sidewalk is not obstructed nearby. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2078.917s">No</a>  such receptacles containing ashes or rubbish shall be placed on the sidewalk earlier than 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2087.761s">of</a>  the day immediately preceding the day appointed by the city for the collection of the receptacles. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2094.545s">So</a>  if your trash is on a Tuesday, Mr. President, you can't put your barrel out before 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2101.83s">on</a>  the Monday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2103.451s">So</a>  if you put it out at three, four, five, six in the evening, you're in violation of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2110.416s">It</a>  has to go out after seven, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2113.658s">And</a>  I think once residents are aware of that, they will respect the ordinance, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2121.61s">And</a>  I would ask that even if the reverse 911 call went out on this, just to notify residents, Mr. President, because it is becoming an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2133.68s">I</a>  was going up on Riverside Ave the other day, and as we all know, it's been windy the last few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2140.425s">Literally</a>  trash, it looked like a tape parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2144.108s">Trash</a>  was blown everywhere, the tops were off the barrels, and really it was a mess and a hop. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2150.638s">Mr.</a>  President, and that's not what we want to give the impression of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2155.964s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, section 70-6, collection for businesses enforcement, all business establishments, rubbish shall be placed on the sidewalk for collection no earlier than 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2169.885s">on</a>  the day appointed by the city for collection of rubbish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2174.409s">And</a>  I know some businesses have put their trash out the night before because they may not get in to put the trash out the day of it after nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2185.78s">And</a>  that is also a concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2188.842s">And</a>  I would just ask if the Chamber of Commerce can let their membership know that, indeed, there is an ordinance that covers that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2197.328s">And</a>  it also states, Mr. President, which someday may require an update from this council, it shall be the duty of the police officers to enforce the provisions of this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2208.375s">And</a>  from what I'm being told by the building commissioner, Paul Mulkey, who I spoke to today, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2214.87s">It's</a>  typically the Board of Health and court enforcement, our court enforcement officers that are issuing the tickets, not the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2224.218s">So</a>  I would ask that subsection B of section 70-6 be updated by this council, probably the public works subcommittee to include language that would include enforceable by DPW, I'm sorry, by the building department <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2243.78s">and</a>  by the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2246.802s">So</a>  that's pretty much it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2249.684s">In</a>  the interest of just getting the word out, I would ask that the city administration offer an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2257.35s">The</a>  city administration do just an informational 911 alerting residents of the both business and homeowners of the trash ordinance and when trash receptacles <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2272.97s">are</a>  allowed to be put out on the sidewalk for pickup, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2276.172s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2277.613s">Any</a>  discussion on Councilor Marksley? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2279.333s">Councilor</a>  Marksley, I want to commend you for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2283.555s">70-6</a>  has been a long, long theme of mine when I go through the business districts, especially on some businesses that close on a Friday and don't open up again for the weekend, put them out on a Friday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2295.301s">And</a>  I've had discussion with the past mayors about this, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2301.088s">I</a>  can't understand why waste management, which is a 24-hour company, can't come by at 11 o'clock at night or 12 o'clock at night and pick up the couple of business dishes that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2312.979s">They</a>  put their rubbish on so they don't have to do it during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2315.902s">And</a>  it doesn't sit out there sometimes all weekend, especially some of the food establishments that put their rubbish on and sit there for a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2323.729s">So</a>  again, I thank you for bringing this forward.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2326.362s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2327.403s">Just</a>  if I could, Mr. President, I realize that we signed a long-term contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2333.549s">Actually,</a>  the administration signed a long-term contract with waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2338.018s">But</a>  in my opinion, over the years, this council has offered a number of resolutions requesting different solutions to some of the constituent calls that we're getting, Mr. President, to no avail. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2351.16s">And</a>  it seems like either the city administration, and I'm not saying this administration, but past administrations are not willing to sit down because of a long-term contract and talk to waste management <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2365.235s">You</a>  know, during COVID, it hasn't been much of an issue, but I can tell you firsthand that waste management picks up trash between seven and nine o'clock on the major thoroughfares when people are rushing to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2378.8s">And</a>  I can tell you, it makes traffic go back 20 minutes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2383.922s">On</a>  any high street, Riverside Ave, Salem, you mentioned on many of the major thoroughfares, that was one request they offered over the years, that they stay off the thoroughfares <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2393.722s">between</a>  certain hours, and that would be seven or nine in the morning, and, you know, four to six in the evening, when we know there's a high impact of traffic to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2405.207s">And</a>  for whatever reason, that always falls on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2407.968s">And</a>  I think would alleviate some of the concerns when we talk about congestion in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2413.35s">So</a>  I want to thank you for your recommendations as well.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2417.352s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2418.032s">Okay,</a>  on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2422.338s">Oh,</a>  excuse me, Councilor Villescaz at the end.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2424.56s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2427.162s">As</a>  the chair of public works, I'd be happy to work through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2430.744s">Were</a>  you just suggesting, Councilor Marks, looking at 70-6 subsection B, or do you want to look at the whole section?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2438.67s">You</a>  know, looking at the whole section, it probably would require an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2443.293s">This</a>  language is probably 60, 70 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2446.376s">So</a>  I wouldn't say we look at the entire section.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2450.78s">Okay,</a>  I will work to schedule a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2453.162s">Is</a>  that an amendment that we're sending this to public works or?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2456.964s">And</a>  especially the 70 districts for the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2460.787s">There's</a>  no reason why those can't get picked up at 10 o'clock at night, like other cities do.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2467.551s">May</a>  I be so bold to suggest Mr. President that we send the paper to the administration and have them mark it up for us to reflect what existing practices and then we can build upon that document as opposed to us trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2480.854s">go</a>  through that 60 year old piece of paper and figure out what it is.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2486.258s">So</a>  we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2488.379s">I'm</a>  amenable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2489.8s">I'm</a>  not opposed to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2492.022s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2492.682s">Mr.</a>  Clerk to get that amendment from councilor.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2499.787s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2502.829s">We</a>  just have to send it with our request because we can't just send a paper to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2508.462s">So</a>  I think we have to also include what we're trying to accomplish.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2633.628s">Mr.</a>  President, first and foremost, I'd like to congratulate Senator Russo on her service as the former president, the outgoing president. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2641.854s">She</a>  did a great job over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2644.816s">But</a>  recently, Mr. Pauli Camuso was elected as president of the Method Youth Hockey Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2649.9s">Mr.</a>  President, I was wondering <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2652.362s">what</a>  was going on with Paul and I kept seeing him show up at these meetings and the city council on TV every once in a while calling in and I didn't know if he was getting the bug again and he was gonna be seeking electoral office. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2662.866s">But</a>  I guess he is seeking electoral office, a subtle electoral office, but it was at the local level on the board of directors for Medford Youth Hockey, where he spends a lot of his time with his son, James. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2672.929s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, it's great to see Paul continue to stay involved in the community after so many years serving on this council and in the school committee and I just wanted <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2681.405s">reach</a>  out and congratulate Paul for making another foray into elected politics and keeping his undefeated streak alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2691.309s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4015.304s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4016.144s">Robert</a>  Penta, Zero Summit Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4017.645s">I'm</a>  a member of the Society of Sprite. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4019.848s">I</a>  want to go back to the December of 2002. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4022.61s">And</a>  at that point in time, there was a gentleman by the name of Donald Ouellette, who became the city engineer here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4031.658s">And</a>  one of the reasons why he became the new city engineer is because he came from the community of Air Mass, where he instituted a new water metering program. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4042.567s">At</a>  the time, Paul Guia was our director of public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4046.37s">And</a>  in December of 2002, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4048.535s">Mr.</a>  Roulette came on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4051.176s">In</a>  January 20th of 2003, Councilor Marks and myself at the time were interviewed by the local newspaper for the purposes of the concerns that were out in the neighborhood regarding the water meter and the bills that were going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4067.242s">And</a>  at that point in time, information came forward that for the past three years, prior to 2003, there were over 709 abatements <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4077.335s">that</a>  were issued by the city of Medford because of faulty water meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4082.259s">Mr.</a>  Roulette, when he came in, indicated that the city of Medford's water meters at that time were no more, they should be no more than 10 years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4091.225s">They</a>  were 17 years old at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4095.208s">So</a>  that began the crusade, so to speak, of figuring out how are we going to change these water meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4102.013s">Should</a>  we change these water meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4103.534s">And</a>  when are we going to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4105.687s">At</a>  the time, there was over 15,000 households that had water meters that needed to be changed, as well as 150 large capacity commercial district people, which represented 50% of the water consumption and the use at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4123.961s">Now,</a>  in August of 2003, the concerns kept multiplying on the council from residents complaining about their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4134.294s">And</a>  October 23rd, in a very rare moment by former Mayor McGlynn, he acknowledged at a public meeting that it was his fault that the meters were not changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4144.72s">And</a>  the reason is the concern wasn't as bad as it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4148.502s">And</a>  he told the Water and Soil Commission at that point in time that blame me, that was his quote, blame me because they just didn't want to get into the financial obligation of getting into the water meters, not realizing how serious everything was. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4161.809s">And</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4163.279s">because</a>  that got itself corrected after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4166.241s">Then</a>  on February 17 of 2004, Mayor McGlynn presented before the city council a prelude, a prelude so to speak as to what the water meter sewer count should look like and what do we need to do here to go in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4183.255s">But</a>  what he did and what he proposed, which was kind of interesting, he proposed to finance $18,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4189.402s">have</a>  the city council vote for $18,000 to do a preliminary review on X amount of homes and X amount of businesses in the city, just to see how bad these water meters were in commercial meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4201.666s">And</a>  what they found out was an atrocious, the decision or the results were atrocious, because what came out of all of that, where these meters were running much slower, and as a result of them running much slower, the city was losing a tremendous amount of revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4215.75s">So</a>  in October of 2004, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4219.526s">straight</a>  down October 19th, the city council voted the appropriation for $4.2 million to put new water meters here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4228.13s">And</a>  subsequent to that, the chase goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4231.272s">At</a>  that point in time, and that's back in 2003, at the end of 2003, the city of Medford was losing on a daily basis 189 million gallons of water a day, not getting billed, and their leakage was 113 million gallons a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4248.325s">Those</a>  two numbers, and I would hope somebody in the council would pick up on that and make a request as to what our leakage is and loss of revenue from then it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4258.407s">The</a>  new water meters that came in, once again, had a 10 year lifespan and the meters on this new meeting system, they had batteries in their battery life, according to their own information that they passed up as a 10 year life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4275.433s">We've</a>  well exceeded a 10 year life on these batteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4279.515s">I</a>  believe most recently there have been some concerns with people who have gotten their bills and their bills have been higher or lower than expected than what they received in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4291.819s">I</a>  really think as the concern is for parking in the city, the concern should equally be as where are we going? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4298.141s">You're</a>  sitting on over $5 million in your water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4302.043s">There</a>  needs to be some addressing to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4303.743s">When</a>  is it going to take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4305.988s">And</a>  if it's, if in fact, they're accurate in their information that they submitted and they gave us at the time when the council voted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4314.633s">I</a>  think council Max was the only one on the council at the time when we voted on this, something really needs to be done because you're gonna find yourself right back to where you were before. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4323.879s">If</a>  in fact, 10 years is the mandate as their brochure says. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4329.262s">So</a>  with that being said, I would hope somewhere along the line, what a 10 year battery and a 10 year life of the meter <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4335.555s">something</a>  needs to be looked at because we're going to find ourselves right back into the same problem that we were when they were 17 years of age and you brought in a new person. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4344.78s">Second</a>  comment, Mr. President, I think it was three weeks ago when I appeared before here, when they were talking about the 5G situation, I said at that point in time that I believed, I believed, and it's my mistake, I misquoted myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4359.93s">I</a>  believe that that time that one of the people who happens to be the director of public, what's her name? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4366.774s">Public</a>  health at that point in time had voted for some of the passing and not for passing some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4374.519s">Sort</a>  of like split down the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4376.36s">I</a>  want to thank council Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4377.641s">I</a>  want to compliment him because of his institution of pushing forward the folks that had their place, not have that 5G go in front of their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4390.984s">at</a>  their last meeting, I think that sets the tempo for people to stand up and say, hey, you can fight the government and you can push them back if you have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4398.83s">They've</a>  set the standard now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4400.832s">And</a>  people out there, if you don't want that 5G in front of your house, now's your time to complain because they've already set the trademark. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4406.917s">And</a>  the council, I believe the vote was four to nothing on that particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4413.262s">Two</a>  last comments, and they go like this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4416.125s">The</a>  two gentlemen that you just talked about, Tom Kianciano and Bob McGovern, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4420.21s">I</a>  think the underlying issue there to their lives are that they were born and bred in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4426.836s">True</a>  Medford family folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4429.899s">Something</a>  that's very hard to understand today for people who just move in here, who think that even though they've been here for 10 to 15 years, they know Medford like somebody in their family who's lived here their whole life, who's been well respected within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4445.132s">They</a>  both happen to have a Wellington background. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4448.135s">And</a>  they both happen to have a big family background, something that's hard to find today and to be respected for and to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4455.678s">So</a>  with that being said, I congratulate you for bringing the issue of dedicating the meeting on their behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4461.581s">And</a>  I think it's a true honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4463.962s">I</a>  think also would be a true honor for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4466.962s">You're</a>  getting ready to deal with your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4468.483s">It's</a>  coming up pretty soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4470.184s">This</a>  is a big issue as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4472.144s">If</a>  I was running for office right now, I would be running to find out where are and is the money for these meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4479.088s">Do</a>  they have to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4480.348s">When</a>  are they going to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4482.129s">And</a>  how and where is the money going to be found? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4484.13s">Are</a>  they going to take it out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise account or what have you? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4488.712s">This</a>  is serious money and this is serious community money. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4492.294s">And</a>  let me just leave you with one last thought, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4494.194s">I'd</a>  like to ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4495.72s">because</a>  I look forward to every Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4498.002s">You</a>  started this about three or four weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4500.324s">I</a>  don't hear any more from the director of public health on an update as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4504.948s">And</a>  is there a reason for that?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4506.91s">She</a>  had been on vacation the last couple, last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4509.592s">For</a>  the last three weeks? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4510.793s">She</a>  had a meeting, she had a prior commitment one week and the following week she was on vacation.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4515.277s">But</a>  if I remember correctly, the one week she couldn't come, she gave you a written synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4519.46s">I</a>  haven't heard, I haven't heard anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4521.96s">because</a>  people look forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4523.22s">So</a>  I would just hope maybe, you know, that gets itself reinstituted. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4526.901s">But</a>  as far as just getting back real quick on the water meters and the whole idea of the meters, it's going to turn out to be a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4534.722s">It's</a>  going to be a financial concern for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4536.703s">And</a>  I'm quite sure when council Marks and myself at that point in time in 2003, we viewed 709 abatements having been filed because the meters were not cooperating correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4550.485s">And</a>  thankfully, Mayor McGlynn finally understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4552.527s">And</a>  that's the reason why he put the appropriation in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4555.268s">You</a>  don't want to get yourself into that position again right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4559.111s">I</a>  don't think it will serve you any good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4561.413s">So</a>  I have all the records here of everything that took place, how we got to where we got at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4568.658s">So</a>  I would hope that the council does not find themselves in that same position again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4572.741s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4573.642s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4576.464s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4579.584s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4582.025s">And</a>  anytime my former colleague starts off with, I want to go back to 2002, I think we all know we're in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4591.25s">But,</a>  you know, I think what Councilor Penta mentioned, Mr. President, is valuable institutional knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4601.114s">And</a>  when I say that, Mr. President, many of us behind the reel probably don't remember the days <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4607.938s">when,</a>  as Councilor Penter alluded to, where we used to have five, six, seven, 800 abatements in the water and sewer department a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4618.06s">And</a>  that wasn't because, you know, everything was running smoothly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4622.261s">It</a>  was the fact, Mr. President, that we were estimating probably 50 to 60% of our water meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4630.963s">And</a>  that was creating so much confusion in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4635.484s">It</a>  was really a crazy, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4637.543s">crazy</a>  time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4638.784s">It</a>  was probably one of the biggest issues of that day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4644.267s">And</a>  when we moved to the new water meters, we really, in my opinion, solved a lot of the abatement issues, a lot of the issues of why is my bill so high, what's happening, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4658.478s">And</a>  now, as Councilor Penta rightfully alluded to, we don't want to go back to those days, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4664.062s">Because</a>  I remember those days, and they were awful, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4668.225s">The</a>  number of phone calls and the number of research that was taken, the amount of research, I should say, that was taken on each and every resident's complaint was unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4681.335s">And</a>  as Councilor Penta alluded to, I believe the life expectancy was around 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4687.757s">We</a>  far surpassed the 10 years and eventually we're going to get into an issue and it's going to be all of our issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4695.161s">It's</a>  not going to be, well, that's water and sewer or the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4698.623s">It's</a>  going to be this council's issue that we go down that slippery slope again, when these meters one at a time across the city start to malfunction, we don't replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4709.989s">And</a>  eventually we just start to estimate, which was the slippery slope we got into back in 2002. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4716.758s">as</a>  Councilor Penta mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4718.86s">And</a>  I think it's only appropriate, this is not a sexy issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4723.463s">It's</a>  not something that people are gonna be banging your door down until it impacts them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4729.548s">And</a>  why not head it off as Councilor Penta mentioned, we have over 5 million in the water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4737.814s">And</a>  that money can only be spent to offset a deficit or infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4744.559s">Why</a>  not look <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4746.052s">at</a>  the replacement of either the batteries or a new water meter right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4752.774s">Why</a>  not head off the potential of this heartache that you know is going to come down the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4759.556s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, as Councilor Penter alluded to, the city used to do a lot of I&I, inflow and infiltration, with the sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4769.259s">It</a>  also was very aggressive with the leak detection program. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4773.55s">When</a>  we discuss the meters, we have to look at INI and leak detection to see where we stand with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4780.254s">Because</a>  those two alone cost the taxpayers millions of dollars a year in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4787.678s">And</a>  it's strange, but if you know anything else in this community that was costing you as a rate payer millions of dollars, you would say, let's address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4797.344s">But</a>  for some reason, water and sewer, it falls under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4801.406s">Because</a>  the pipes are underground, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4803.452s">You</a>  know, it's something that we don't look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4805.333s">Out</a>  of sight, out of mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4806.933s">But</a>  it's an inherent problem in this community that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4811.655s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, when we brought the system back some years ago, we were sold a bill of sales by the former engineers, Councilor Penter alluded to, Don Roulette, who I had a lot of respect at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4824.2s">It</a>  was a big job, and as you know, every department was understaffed, and this was a big undertaking to change the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4831.415s">We</a>  saw the bill of sales that the program was also going to have what they call an exception report. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4840.157s">And</a>  what that was, Mr. President, was a report that was run daily by the city, or at least they had access to running it, that would show spikes in water usage in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4853.019s">So</a>  if you're a snowbird and you went to, you know, Florida in December, and you happen to have a leak in your house, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4861.208s">and</a>  you weren't home and no one was there, you could see the spike because you'd be using water at two, three in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4868.232s">You'd</a>  be using it on off days and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4871.094s">And</a>  the city would be able to spit out a report saying this particular address had an exception, had a spike. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4878.515s">And</a>  that's invaluable, Mr. President, to a resident and a homeowner that someone's watching over saying, hey, we're going to make sure that if there is a concern that we can address it and notify you as a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4892.814s">You</a>  also may have an internal link. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4896.71s">So</a>  you may have it a week that's not coming through a ceiling or a floor, but your bathroom toilet may be running constantly, and maybe you're not aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4907.033s">Or</a>  maybe you have several toilets that are running constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4910.394s">Or</a>  for instance, I got a call last week from a management company, and I won't mention the management company, and I won't mention the condo building in Method, but a management company reached out to me and said that they received, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4925.903s">a</a>  $40,000 water bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4927.504s">I</a>  got the same call. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4928.964s">You</a>  got the same call, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4931.245s">And</a>  they were not notified for two billing cycles. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4935.846s">So</a>  it was 40,000 and 40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4939.588s">Their</a>  typical bill may have been $4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4942.829s">And</a>  once the management company found out and alerted the Condo Association, by that time, you know, and then they try to figure out, they hired plumbers and so forth, they found a leak <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4956.191s">was</a>  internal, so it was after the meter on their property, but it was underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4963.195s">In</a>  the end, the ground was absorbing the water, and no one was the wiser, Mr. President, other than the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4969.778s">But</a>  if there was an exception report that showed, hey, typically, they're using just, say, 32,000 cubic gallons a month, and now they're using 450,000 cubic gallons a month, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4984.96s">That's</a>  an exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4986.541s">And</a>  the city should be notifying people saying, there's a huge exception, there's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4991.824s">Because</a>  how do you turn to a homeowner, a condo association, which are homeowners, and say, you know what, your bill went from $4,000 to $40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4999.828s">That</a>  could have happened to any one of us behind this wheel, or anyone in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5006.775s">And</a>  what do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5007.796s">What</a>  a hardship that would be, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5009.597s">When</a>  the city reaches out and says, you owe us 40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5012.459s">How</a>  do you dispute that? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5013.8s">The</a>  leak was on your side. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5015.001s">It</a>  wasn't the city's leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5016.262s">It</a>  was your leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5018.264s">And</a>  then the great fight is on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5020.705s">So</a>  that is extremely important with the exception report. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5024.048s">I'd</a>  like to offer an amendment to Councilor Pinter's, if we could vote on it next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5031.173s">That's</a>  fine, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5033.835s">But</a>  I'd like to offer an amendment, Mr. President, we can bring up next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5037.192s">whether</a>  or not the city is still actively involved with looking at exception reports, and if they have the capability, because this was some time back, if they still have the capability of running exception reports for unaccounted for water on behalf of residents and homeowners of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5060.26s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, an amendment next week, because Council Vice President's right <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5066.53s">this</a>  wasn't formally on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5069.451s">And</a>  under our new rules, it has to be formally on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5072.453s">And</a>  also Mr. President, that the 5 million surplus of water and sewer enterprise that the administration report back the status of the water meter systems in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5088.899s">And</a>  when and if and when these meters are being looked at for replacement <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5096.527s">in</a>  our community, where we stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5098.429s">I</a>  think it's only appropriate we get an update on that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5101.132s">You</a>  may want to invite Ron Baker to the meeting, to come on the call, because I think he's really the, and maybe the chairman of the Water and Soil Commission.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5111.083s">That</a>  would be great.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5112.164s">And</a>  I think, you know, I think for the edification... You can do that next week, on next week's thing.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5115.69s">That'd</a>  be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5116.911s">Whenever</a>  you could set it up, Mr. President, and the edification for the viewing audience and also this council, because water and sewer is a multi, multimillion dollar charge to this community through sewer and water. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5130.101s">I</a>  think it's important that we all receive updates periodically to know where we stand.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5134.444s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5136.666s">I</a>  just want to say that I would support discussing that next week and just add to what Councilor Marks was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5142.45s">I</a>  have heard of residents who have <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5144.651s">been</a>  notified automatically when their water usage spikes in the case of an issue with the water heater or some other leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5150.856s">So</a>  if that program does exist, I think it'd be great for all residents to know how to access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5157.782s">It</a>  would avoid situations like the one that you brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5160.625s">So</a>  I look forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5161.586s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5163.095s">If</a>  you do that, you can call the engineer's office and they can print you out a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5170.42s">So</a>  I've done it in my own house and they can show you where your spikes are and it tells you where the leaks are, but you have to ask for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5178.405s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5178.905s">Okay,</a>  yeah, if you do that next week, Councilor Marks, it'll be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5182.687s">Councilor</a>  Felton.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5185.069s">If</a>  I may really quick, and I thank former Councilor Patu for bringing this up and Councilor Marks for your statements as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5192.657s">but</a>  they both bring up a very good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5194.257s">And</a>  that's that the city should be proactive in reaching out and the residents shouldn't have to, I mean, the residents wouldn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5200.639s">So,</a>  I mean, if there's an issue and someone does spike, I mean, it's a report, someone should be responsible on a daily basis to kind of review to see where the spikes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5214.762s">There's</a>  some way to look at that and someone should be looking at it on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5219.323s">So</a>  it should be a proactive attempt by the city to reach out to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5223.018s">to</a>  look for those spikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5224.098s">So</a>  I thank you for bringing it forward.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5226.179s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5226.319s">Mr.</a>  President, just one quick, Council Marks and Council Falco are both correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5231.94s">The</a>  software that the city was supposed to purchase would cost anywhere between 100 and 115,000 at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5238.501s">And</a>  they figured that the reason that they would save the money on that is just think about all the abatements that you would not have to service, the people that would have to leave work or whatever it might be to come to a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5248.242s">And</a>  sometimes if they didn't even win on their abatement process, they'd have to take that to the <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5252.853s">district</a>  go over and some of them, but Councilor Falco is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5257.475s">The</a>  way the program was sold is you were going to have an abatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5261.037s">You</a>  were going to have a program with a software. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5263.598s">And</a>  if any house spiked irregularly, they would contact the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5268.301s">It</a>  should not be the taxpayer contacting the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5271.342s">And</a>  I think that's the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5273.764s">That</a>  was the key as Councilor Markswell alluded to and Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5277.446s">And</a>  it's just, you know, when you say out of sight out of mind, but that's not right either. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5282.689s">It's</a>  the biggest, other than doing a public works street or a sidewalk, it's the biggest financial obligation that the city has to its taxpayers as it relates to make sure that the water and sewer system works properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5297.121s">And</a>  if it's not working properly and there is something wrong with the infrastructure below the street, below the sidewalk, how's the taxpayer gonna know? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5304.987s">When</a>  in fact you're collecting, you're raising the taxes each and every year, you're raising the rates each and every year, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5310.664s">You</a>  supposedly have this system and you're still telling the taxpayer, you've got to call city hall to find out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5317.209s">That</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5318.41s">So</a>  I think you get your work cut off.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5320.532s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5321.333s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5321.653s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5323.374s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5323.615s">We'll</a>  take care of that next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5324.816s">That'd</a>  be great.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5325.856s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5327.378s">We</a>  have the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5330.4s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5332.342s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5332.602s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5333.022s">I</a>  just wanted to add, I believe that the program Councilor bears is referring to as the water smart program, which people can enroll in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5340.113s">on</a>  the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5341.213s">Again,</a>  that's something you would have to set up alerts, it needs to have internet access. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5344.214s">So</a>  I fully support the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5345.914s">I</a>  just wanted to reference the name of that program.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5349.535s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5349.915s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5353.016s">Records,</a>  the table records of the meeting of April 13 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5358.177s">Pass</a>  the Council of bears Council of bears.</p>
