00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,345

00:03:57,297 --> 00:03:59,318

[SPEAKER_12]: 280 Merrimack Street, Methuen, Mass.

78
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:13,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and you're here representing Dunkin' Donuts, correct?

79
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:14,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

80
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

81
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:17,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

82
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:19,504
[SPEAKER_16]: I see everything is in order.

83
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:22,425
[SPEAKER_16]: The question I have is hours of operations.

84
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:22,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Can Ms.

85
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:24,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Fischel just review that with us?

86
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:28,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the business opens at 4 a.m.

87
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:29,689
[SPEAKER_11]: and closes at nine.

88
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,110
[SPEAKER_11]: However, the employees go in at 3.30 to prepare the shop.

89
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,634
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not the practice at the other Dunkin' Donuts, if I'm correct.

90
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:42,135
[SPEAKER_16]: We've passed a few of these.

91
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:48,491
[SPEAKER_16]: recently and 3.30 seems very early for our neighborhoods.

92
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:59,056
[SPEAKER_14]: I think five o'clock is the normal opening time.

93
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:00,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, that's why I'm a little.

94
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you need a special.

95
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:03,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

96
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,719
[SPEAKER_14]: To open at four.

97
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:11,222
[SPEAKER_14]: You can open at five right now, but if you wanna open at four, you'd have to come back for a special permit.

98
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:14,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so we can open at five o'clock.

99
00:05:14,118 --> 00:05:16,460
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 to 11.

100
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,823
[SPEAKER_16]: 7 to 11 is the normal business hours and anything other than that requires a special permit.

101
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:35,835
[SPEAKER_16]: So what was with the previous owner is eliminated as we move forward with our takeovers now.

102
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:47,319
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Mr. President, other than the hours and making that a restriction for the record, I see everything else is in order, move approval.

103
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:49,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

104
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,021
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by?

105
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Second, Mr. President.

106
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:05,956
[SPEAKER_14]: and then they can come back for a special permit.

107
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:08,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

108
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:12,239
[SPEAKER_14]: And seconded by Vice President Knight.

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,202
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, so the current closing time is 9 p.m., is that what she said?

110
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:24,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

111
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:27,786
[SPEAKER_14]: I think she said the current closing time you said was 9 p.m.?

112
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:29,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

113
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:30,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

114
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:31,808

00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:02,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And the report was delivered to the mayor about a month ago.

159
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:05,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I shared it with the council a week ago.

160
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:07,233
[SPEAKER_01]: It was made public later in the week.

161
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:16,281
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of recommendations for how to move forward and parking policy and enforcement in the city based off of a number of specific charges from the mayor.

162
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:21,045
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll hand it off to Laurel and Jim to provide a kind of overview and update on that.

163
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:36,098
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Mr. Mayor, I mean, Mr. President, Councilor Scarpelli, if I can, I really appreciate the hard work this committee has done, and I appreciate Councilor Morrell sending us the

164
00:08:37,172 --> 00:09:06,532
[SPEAKER_16]: the report, but I think it would truly do this committee an injustice that if we just hold it to a, just a review and just talking about it in a council session, I would feel really comfortable and do a quick synopsis maybe, but I would really call, you know, make the motion that we call for a committee, the whole meeting with the whole committee and the council, because there are a number of questions I have,

165
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:16,963
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was only done because of the hard work to this commission that brought up some great concerns and great issues.

166
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,604
[SPEAKER_16]: So, and in resolution.

167
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:23,166
[SPEAKER_16]: So, like I said, I appreciate them being here tonight.

168
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:26,528
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd love to hear a brief synopsis.

169
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:34,213
[SPEAKER_16]: And if that, if my colleagues agree with me, I think this really needs a whole committee, the whole meeting that we could really spend

170
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:38,707
[SPEAKER_16]: a whole evening on this, really breaking this down because it is important.

171
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:49,375
[SPEAKER_16]: It's probably like I said, other than the streets and sidewalks, probably the next biggest question we get on the council from constituents is traffic and parking questions.

172
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:52,477
[SPEAKER_16]: So I make that into a form of motion.

173
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:55,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

174
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I certainly would support that motion.

175
00:09:57,621 --> 00:10:00,042
[SPEAKER_05]: The paper that was provided to us was an 80 page document.

176
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:00,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it would be

177
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:06,967
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, most appropriate if we had an opportunity to review it and then we could ask him phone questions that it could be able to answer.

178
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:07,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's a bad idea.

179
00:10:08,552 --> 00:10:11,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in preparation for a committee of the whole, that's the direction of this council.

180
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:12,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So chooses to move.

181
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:23,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I also think it would be proper that we get a copies of all the documents that are related to all the public documents that are related to the meetings that took up, you know, the copies of the minutes, the meeting minutes, so that we can kind of, uh, put into context what the report says.

182
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:28,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, we can look at that chronological history of, uh, how we got to this 80 page document.

183
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,296
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's very important.

184
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:34,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Mr. President asked that that be provided by the membership at the committee of the whole meeting as well.

185
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

186
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:38,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morrell, then I'll offer the second to the motion as well.

187
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:38,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

188
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:39,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

189
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:42,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I fully support Councilor Scarpelli's motion.

190
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:49,061
[SPEAKER_01]: In discussions with Jim and Laurel, we had that same conversation about, you know, the idea that this would probably be great for Committee of the Whole.

191
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:55,506
[SPEAKER_01]: So really just introducing this tonight, and I fully agree that there's a lot of conversation and questions that can be asked about this.

192
00:10:55,866 --> 00:11:00,190
[SPEAKER_01]: So just getting the ball rolling, and I agree with Councilor Scarpelli that we should have a Committee of the Whole on this.

193
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:07,291
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanna hear from a brief synopsis on the- They're here, I would not disrespect- Jim Silva.

194
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:09,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President.

195
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:10,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Max.

196
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:12,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

197
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:16,955
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with both my colleagues, Councilor Scott Kelly and Councilor Knight.

198
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:24,778
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this warrants a far more in-depth detailed meeting, which would be precisely a committee of the whole.

199
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,739
[SPEAKER_17]: So I agree with that assumption.

200
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,180
[SPEAKER_17]: The question I did have, Mr. President,

201
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:37,316
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's great to have the full membership of the Traffic Advisory Commission.

202
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:41,436
[SPEAKER_17]: However, that was the first step in this process.

203
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:53,939
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it would be equally as helpful to also have someone from the administration present, because the next phase of this, to my understanding, is rollout, implementation, and so forth.

204
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,820
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's a vital component.

205
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:01,165
[SPEAKER_17]: This was fact gathering and making recommendations.

206
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:08,672
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe there were 21 really worthy recommendations made, but there's also two other steps in the process.

207
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:15,618
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wanna make sure that this doesn't just end up in step one, that we see this to fruition, step two and three.

208
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:24,285
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would ask that the committee of whole also includes representatives from the city administration that can speak on this, Mr. President.

209
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:24,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

210
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:25,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

211
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:27,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

212
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:35,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank Councilor Morrell for bringing this forward and also state that I am in full agreement with Councilor Scott Kelly as well.

213
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:40,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank the task force for being on the call tonight.

214
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:46,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'd be good to get a synopsis of the work that they've done.

215
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank them for the work that they've done.

216
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:55,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of hours and hard work has gone into this, but I do think it'd be very beneficial to have a committee of the whole meeting

217
00:12:56,605 --> 00:13:02,267
[SPEAKER_07]: just so we can look at just this topic and really, you know, take a look at this report and ask all the questions that we need to ask.

218
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree with Councilor Marks as well.

219
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:17,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's vital that someone from the administration is there to, you know, to give us their opinions on the report and to talk about, you know, how this can be implemented if that's the way we go.

220
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:22,929
[SPEAKER_07]: but I look forward to that and I am definitely in support of the Committee of the Whole meeting.

221
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,549
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanna, once again, thank the task force for all their hard work.

222
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

223
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:27,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

224
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Jim or Laura, do you wanna give a brief synopsis or you wanna wait for the Committee of the Whole meeting?

225
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:35,191
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

226
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:36,551
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Laurel Ruma.

227
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:38,191
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 149 Burgett Avenue.

228
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:47,413
[SPEAKER_00]: The context for this commission is probably quite important for folks who may be hearing about this for the first time.

229
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:57,727
[SPEAKER_00]: which is when the mayor came in, one of her, to office, one of her primary goals was to figure out Park Medford and how to improve parking in the city.

230
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:03,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, then the pandemic hit and in October of 2020, this commission was assembled.

231
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:09,610
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a group of folks from around the city, business owners and residents.

232
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:17,913
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a contract lawyer, a writer, data scientist, all sorts of folks who've lived here for a long time and who've just moved here.

233
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:26,603
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hope was to start the process, start the process, which is going to be a very long process, of collecting as much data as possible.

234
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:33,084
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sorry you haven't had a chance to read this thrilling 60-page report, because it is.

235
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:39,225
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fascinating deep dive into why parking is so difficult, specifically in Medford.

236
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:45,647
[SPEAKER_00]: The issues that we highlight in the 21 recommendations are not the only 21 recommendations.

237
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,607
[SPEAKER_00]: There are recommendations throughout the entire report

238
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:54,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I please ask everyone just give a read through and come to the committee of the whole meeting ready with lots of questions.

239
00:14:55,954 --> 00:15:02,558
[SPEAKER_00]: The charge from the mayor was to emphasize looking at the South Medford and Hillside neighborhoods.

240
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:12,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim and I have been the representatives for the city, for the MBTA's construction working group since 2018.

241
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:13,565
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been appointed by two mayors now,

242
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:19,706
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been working on this project since 2008.

243
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Green Line extension is real.

244
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:26,549
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming to Medford and actually will be open in January of this year.

245
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:36,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, the pandemic delayed us quite a bit, but the hope was that we would always start looking at parking specifically for these two neighborhoods where the stations are situated.

246
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,314
[SPEAKER_00]: The complexity of parking is that there is, um,

247
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:43,814
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a give and take process.

248
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:46,636
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we really want folks to understand.

249
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:55,401
[SPEAKER_00]: We recommended zoned parking for across the city, but a trade off with zoned parking is to have more flexibility with better permits.

250
00:15:55,841 --> 00:16:05,807
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, home health care aids, being able to call the city 24 hours before your kid has a birthday party, things like this that will actually make the parking program much more humane.

251
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:26,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Another issue that my neighbors have thankfully asked me about, we've gotten quite a bit of feedback, so I really appreciate all that feedback as well, has been the issue of allowing Tufts students who are enrolled at Tufts University, as well as on the lease of the apartment, making them residents of the city,

252
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:29,859
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get some kind of resident parking pass.

253
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is something that we have to talk about.

254
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:41,164
[SPEAKER_00]: If we decide not to do it as a city, that's fine, but this is one of those major issues that not only do neighbors have on the street, but landlords as well.

255
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:57,150
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also notice that the report takes a look at zoning changes that the state has made very recently, like last month, which allow less restrictive zoning around

256
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:11,972
[SPEAKER_00]: transit stations, that means Ball Square in Medford, which is the Medford station is in Ball Square, and Tufts Medford station, which is College and Boston Avenue, obviously also Medford, and West Medford.

257
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,515
[SPEAKER_00]: That radius is half a mile.

258
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:27,183
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're standing on the corner of Boston and College Avenue, you're talking about more permissive zoning all the way down Bob's to Bob's on Main Street

259
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:30,470
[SPEAKER_00]: to the entire length of Main Street to Broadway.

260
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:39,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are big challenges for our city, and this is why parking is so integral to everything else that we're trying to think about as a city as we roll out our master plan.

261
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:49,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you'll notice that the state has, as well as the federal government, a very aggressive goal by 2030 and then by 2050 to reduce carbon emissions.

262
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:52,076
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot more electric vehicles on the road.

263
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:57,318
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an opportunity for the city to invest in electric vehicle charging stations,

264
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:06,661
[SPEAKER_00]: I am positive we can get some really good grant funding as we start to think about where we'd like to see electric vehicles parking be situated in neighborhoods and at businesses.

265
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:15,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we tried to boil the ocean here, but we have just a short report of what we could possibly talk about, and the reason Jim and I are so

266
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:21,392
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely obsessed with this is that we live in these neighborhoods of South Medford and Hillside.

267
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:28,494
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been involved in this green line change for a very long time, and we know the impact it's going to have in the neighborhood.

268
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:34,715
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not being hyperbolic to say it will absolutely change this city.

269
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:45,338
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need the city to help South Medford and Hillside to become that great place that people want to come and take the green line to and from.

270
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:53,545
[SPEAKER_00]: The other important thing that everyone should understand is that the MBTA considers walking distance from train stations to be a one mile radius.

271
00:18:54,145 --> 00:19:05,568
[SPEAKER_00]: So that encompasses Boston Avenue, all the way down to South Street, all the way over to Route 16, and then obviously way into South Medford.

272
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:13,110
[SPEAKER_00]: So it affects literally the entire half of the city that is on the west side of the river.

273
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:23,262
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we need the whole committee of a whole, because you bring up so many points that it would be just impossible to cover it in this meeting.

274
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:31,003
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I say, in two minutes, you brought up 10 great points that all need to be said.

275
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:35,444
[SPEAKER_14]: I will give you a date for the committee to hold by the end of the week.

276
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:40,405
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll get it to both you and Jim, and you can pass it on to your committee.

277
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:42,826
[SPEAKER_14]: And probably within the next,

278
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:48,986
[SPEAKER_14]: two weeks, so I'll check the calendar to see what the next Wednesday we have available.

279
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:52,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Does the Wednesday work for your committee?

280
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:59,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think we would need a full two hours and I don't want to be pushing us against the clock on a council meeting.

281
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:02,678
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think a Wednesday night would be the best way to do it.

282
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:03,319
[SPEAKER_14]: That work for you guys?

283
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,621
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you.

284
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:08,863
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly.

285
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

286
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:19,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just ask if possible that you consider including a resolution that I put forward last year 20-534.

287
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,262
[SPEAKER_10]: It was about a ball square district plan.

288
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:27,003
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like this might align with this in some way.

289
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:32,285
[SPEAKER_10]: So just putting that on your radar is something we may want to talk about at a future meeting as well.

290
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:36,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it would be this specific meeting or a follow-up meeting.

291
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:38,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilman Betz.

292
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:57,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks to have someone from the administration present, and as amended by Councilor Knight to have the documents that went along with the meeting also.

293
00:20:58,356 --> 00:20:59,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I forget anything?

294
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:02,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

295
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:05,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

296
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:06,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

297
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:08,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco?

298
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:08,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

299
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:10,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight?

300
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:10,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

301
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:11,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks?

302
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:11,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

303
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:12,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morrell?

304
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:13,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

305
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:15,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

306
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:15,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

307
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,210
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caravaglia?

308
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I move the affirmative motion passes.

309
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:32,342
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-3-3-1 offered by Councilor Beas, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration post all Memphis Traffic Commission rules and regulations to the city website in an easy, accessible, and searchable format.

310
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:32,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Beas.

311
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:34,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

312
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:36,805
[SPEAKER_10]: This is pretty self-explanatory.

313
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:45,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I have had residents reach out constantly asking me what the rules are, what are specific situations around parking enforcement.

314
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,932
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were, you know, unable to find the traffic commission's rules and regulations posted online.

315
00:21:51,752 --> 00:21:54,813
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important that that be accessible through the city website.

316
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:59,435
[SPEAKER_10]: So residents aren't, you know, unable to find that information when they need it.

317
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:02,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

318
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:06,958
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Scott Perry.

319
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:09,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

320
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:10,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Behrs.

321

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

322
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

323
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:12,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

324
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:13,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight.

325
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:13,983

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

327
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:15,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

328
00:22:15,264 --> 00:22:15,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morrell.

329
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:16,424

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

332
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:19,305
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caravaglia.

333
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:20,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, 70 affirmative motion passes.

334
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:23,687
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the consolidated papers 21332, 21333, 21334.

335
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:34,371
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, that we combine the three papers where they seem to be all identical.

336
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:36,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

337
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:40,507

00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:40,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

341
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:41,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

342
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:41,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

343
00:22:41,347 --> 00:22:41,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

344
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:41,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

345
00:22:41,948 --> 00:22:42,048

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

353
00:22:42,868 --> 00:22:42,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

354
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:43,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

355
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:43,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

356
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:44,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:44,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

358
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:45,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

359
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

362
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:46,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

363
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

364
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:46,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

365
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:46,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

366
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

367
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:18,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, for the record, I did receive a letter from Nate Stackhouse this afternoon.

368
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:19,542
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be happy to read it to the record, Mr. President.

369
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:20,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

370
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:22,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor, I'd want to read it to the record.

371
00:23:23,024 --> 00:23:23,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, yes.

372
00:23:23,824 --> 00:23:27,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Correspondence from Nathan Stackhouse, General Manager of Park Medford.

373
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:29,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

374
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:33,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Please see Republic Parking's response to the Park Mobile data breach below.

375
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Republic has learned that Park Mobile recently reported a data incident related to Park Mobile's mobile payment app.

376
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,747
[SPEAKER_05]: This was not a Republic data incident.

377
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:44,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Nonetheless, Republic has contacted ParkMobile for information.

378
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:57,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Republic has learned that ParkMobile is in the process of directly contacting those users who would like to use the ParkMobile app, and Republic has received a copy of that ParkMobile email to users, a copy of which is included below.

379
00:23:57,898 --> 00:24:03,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Republic will continue to monitor developments related to ParkMobile's incident and will update the city as we learn additional and relevant information.

380
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:06,904
[SPEAKER_05]: The email is as follows, important security update,

381
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:14,236
[SPEAKER_05]: In March, Mark Mobile became aware of a cybersecurity incident linked to a vulnerability in a third-party software that we use.

382
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:21,200
[SPEAKER_05]: In response, we immediately launched an investigation with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm to address the incident.

383
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:27,205
[SPEAKER_05]: We quickly eliminated the third-party vulnerability, and we continue to maintain our security and monitor our systems.

384
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:31,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of an abundance of caution, we also notified the appropriate law enforcement authorities.

385
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:36,331
[SPEAKER_05]: We recently concluded our investigation, and are now updating our uses of the findings.

386
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:37,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Below are the key points.

387
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:42,628
[SPEAKER_05]: One, the investigation confirmed that no credit card information was accessed.

388
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, no data related to a user's parking transaction history was accessed.

389
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, only basic user information was accessed.

390
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:56,752
[SPEAKER_05]: This includes license plate numbers, as well as email addresses, phone numbers, and vehicle nicknames, if provided by the user.

391
00:24:57,772 --> 00:25:01,093
[SPEAKER_05]: In a small percentage of cases, mailing addresses were also affected.

392
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Encrypted passwords were accessed,

393
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:07,208
[SPEAKER_05]: not the encryption keys required to read them.

394
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:12,329
[SPEAKER_05]: We protect user passwords by encrypting them with advanced hashing consulting technologies.

395
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,050
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not collect social security numbers, driver's license numbers, or dates of birth.

396
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,351
[SPEAKER_05]: We take extensive measures to protect our user passwords.

397
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:28,213
[SPEAKER_05]: However, as an added precaution, users can change their password in the settings section of the ParkMobile app or on the web by clicking this link.

398
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:32,394
[SPEAKER_05]: We recommend always using unique passwords for different online accounts.

399
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,982
[SPEAKER_05]: As the largest parking application in the United States, the trust of our users is our top priority.

400
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:41,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Please rest assured we take our responsible seriously and safeguard the security of our users' information.

401
00:25:42,044 --> 00:25:42,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

402
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:44,766
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from the third party vendor, Mr. President.

403
00:25:46,186 --> 00:25:47,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

404
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:49,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bass.

405
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:52,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

406
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I filed a very similar resolution to you, Mr. President, and to Vice President Knight.

407
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:02,034
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the note from Republic Parking.

408
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:03,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the only element

409
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:10,841
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't clear to me if residents who use Park Mobile would be notified of the data breach through Republic Parking.

410
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:16,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be one item that I would like to see addressed by Park Medford.

411
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:20,948
[SPEAKER_14]: You want the users identified?

412
00:26:20,968 --> 00:26:24,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I want the users to be notified that there was a data breach.

413
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:30,353
[SPEAKER_10]: They may have been notified by Park Mobile, but I think it would be helpful if Park Medford would notify them.

414
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:36,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to make that a form of amendment?

415
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, it's in my resolution.

416
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,682
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they're consolidated, I think it's already included.

417
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:45,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

418
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:47,004
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

419
00:26:47,364 --> 00:26:49,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody else want to speak on this?

420
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:50,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President?

421
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morocco.

422
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:53,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

423
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:59,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going off, and this might be Councilor Behrs' question as well, just going off the letter that Vice President Knight just read.

424
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So users of the Park Medford

425
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:17,888
[SPEAKER_01]: were or were not impacted, because I know now we're talking about Park Mobile, Republic Parking in Park Medford, and I'm having a hard time following whether or not people who park in Medford were actually impacted by this data breach.

426
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:21,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Knighton.

427
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Republic Parking is the parking enforcement agent that is acting as Park Medford.

428
00:27:28,478 --> 00:27:34,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It uses ParkMobile as the application to allow individuals to purchase parking electronically.

429
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:40,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And the data breach affected that third party vendor, who is the largest in the United States of America.

430
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:45,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So it seems to me like Metro residents have been impacted because they have been notified.

431
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you, sir.

432
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,252
[SPEAKER_01]: I misheard with all the different park this, park that, thank you.

433
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:55,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, any further discussion on this?

434
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:09,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the motion by Vice President Nayeed is seconded by Councilor Behrs as amended by Councilor Behrs that Park Medford notify the users of Medford.

435
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that correct, Councilor Behrs?

436
00:28:11,553 --> 00:28:12,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

437
00:28:13,635 --> 00:28:13,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

438
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:15,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, he does want that.

439
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:18,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Behrs, do you want that in there as an amendment?

440
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:20,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's fine, yes.

441
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:24,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

442
00:28:36,188 --> 00:28:36,768
[SPEAKER_03]: also bears.

443
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:37,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

444
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, vice president night.

445
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:41,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Council marks.

446
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:42,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

447
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:43,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

448
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:43,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

449
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

450
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:45,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

451
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:46,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

452
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:51,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes to 1335 offered by Vice President night.

453
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:04,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Being so resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the parks commission reopen the application process for the installation and additional

454
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:18,559
[SPEAKER_14]: memorial bricks at the Tufts Park Gone Too Soon Memorial and be it further resolved that the Memphis City Council requests that the park commission investigate the eligibility of CPA funds to cover the expenses.

455
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Knight.

456
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

457
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,981
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the best kept mysteries in the city of Memphis is how to get a brick down at Tufts Park at the Gone Too Soon Memorial.

458
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:30,722
[SPEAKER_05]: This issue has been brought to my attention a number of times.

459
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:32,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried to

460
00:29:32,978 --> 00:29:35,659
[SPEAKER_05]: reach out to individuals that are associated with the project.

461
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, it's really been a non fruitful search.

462
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:52,445
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I think that this going to some soon Memorial in Tufts Park is something that needs a little bit of love and attention, Mr. President needs a little bit more involvement from our city and our parks commission.

463
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:55,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the application process also needs to be opened up.

464
00:29:56,006 --> 00:30:00,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the last time applications were accepted, we've lost a number of individuals in this community factor.

465
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anybody will ever agree that somebody's gone on time.

466
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's gone too soon.

467
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:09,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And self-benefit is a great neighborhood filled with a lot of people that have pride from the area that they come from.

468
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:14,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard a number of individuals that are seeking applications for this purpose.

469
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:21,420
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm asking that the Parks Commission reopen the application process and maybe this summer we can install some bricks down at Tufts Park.

470
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:24,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Mr. President, because we have the Community Preservation Act,

471
00:30:25,297 --> 00:30:34,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that this might be an opportunity to see if we are eligible to receive CPA funding for this project to offset the cost for the families that are seeking to put bricks in.

472
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:37,246
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution.

473
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:38,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

474
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:40,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I want to thank you for bringing this forward.

475
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:47,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I myself have received many calls from people asking how to purchase bricks, and I didn't know how to get in touch with anybody.

476
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:51,636
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, this is one of those little secret down there.

477
00:30:53,756 --> 00:30:56,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got several friends that are part of that memorial down there.

478
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:58,978
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, thank you for doing this for me.

479
00:30:59,198 --> 00:31:03,659
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

480
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:04,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

481
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Behrs?

482
00:31:08,821 --> 00:31:09,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

483
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:10,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falcone?

484
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:11,221
Yes.

485
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:12,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight?

486
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:12,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

487
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:13,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks?

488
00:31:13,602 --> 00:31:13,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

489
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:14,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morrell?

490
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:15,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

491
00:31:16,283 --> 00:31:17,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

492
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:17,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

493
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:18,264
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraballo?

494
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:18,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

495
00:31:18,624 --> 00:31:20,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in favor of the motion passes.

496
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,805
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-3-3-6 offered by Councilor Marks.

497
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:25,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that trash collection citywide be discussed.

498
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

499
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

500
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:39,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Over the last several weeks, I received a number of phone calls and emails from area residents concerned about our waste collection.

501
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:51,167
[SPEAKER_17]: And the fact that for many residents of this community that have to deal with residents that putting their barrels out

502
00:31:52,103 --> 00:32:05,474
[SPEAKER_17]: too early, and it's creating not only debris, Mr. President, on these windy nights, as we all know, it's also creating an increase in rodents throughout the community.

503
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:13,180
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm getting complaint after complaint in many of our neighborhoods about an increase in rats.

504
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:19,025
[SPEAKER_17]: And we were told on many occasions, if you give them a water source and a food source,

505
00:32:19,662 --> 00:32:20,442
[SPEAKER_17]: rats will come.

506
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:27,085
[SPEAKER_17]: And indeed, putting the barrels out too early is an additional food source.

507
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:38,109
[SPEAKER_17]: So I asked Mr. President not to be punitive and ask that the city find residents, but to notify residents that there is an ordinance, Mr. President.

508
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:40,450
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reason why I bring it up is

509
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:45,933
[SPEAKER_17]: You never hear much discussion regarding the ordinance itself, but it does exist.

510
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:56,068
[SPEAKER_17]: And I happen to have done a little research and asked our police department, code enforcement and border health, how many tickets

511
00:32:56,555 --> 00:33:07,279
[SPEAKER_17]: were issued over the past year for a violation of section 70-4, which is the placement of receptacles, which are trash bins.

512
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:20,784
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was told, Mr. President, that there were 55 tickets written in the past year, not all for putting out trash too early, for putting out

513
00:33:21,754 --> 00:33:27,818
[SPEAKER_17]: So for other items that are against the ordinance that are left overnight, Mr President.

514
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:37,163
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's clear to me that we've probably issued a dozen or two tickets for putting out trash too early in this community.

515
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:43,366
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would just like to read the solid waste ordinance so people are aware, Mr President.

516
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:45,147
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think people are malicious.

517
00:33:45,848 --> 00:33:49,750
[SPEAKER_17]: I know I'm always trying to get my trash out ahead of time to make sure it's out on the

518
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:58,124
[SPEAKER_17]: the street, Mr President, but I think once people are aware what the rules and regulations are, they will comply, Mr President.

519
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:06,569
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's not just compliance for the sake of compliance, it's for the sake of not having trash blown all over the street.

520
00:34:07,396 --> 00:34:09,458
[SPEAKER_17]: not having rodent problems and so forth.

521
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:18,404
[SPEAKER_17]: So section 70-4 of the solid waste article states, article one states, placement of receptacles.

522
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:29,711
[SPEAKER_17]: All receptacles containing ashes or rubbish, I think that shows you how old this ordinance is, shall be placed on the outer edge of the sidewalk.

523
00:34:30,492 --> 00:34:32,133
[SPEAKER_17]: It shall be placed in such a manner

524
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:37,977
[SPEAKER_17]: so that the free flow of travel on the sidewalk is not obstructed nearby.

525
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:46,880
[SPEAKER_17]: No such receptacles containing ashes or rubbish shall be placed on the sidewalk earlier than 7 p.m.

526
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:53,743
[SPEAKER_17]: of the day immediately preceding the day appointed by the city for the collection of the receptacles.

527
00:34:54,545 --> 00:35:01,370
[SPEAKER_17]: So if your trash is on a Tuesday, Mr. President, you can't put your barrel out before 7 p.m.

528
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:02,711
[SPEAKER_17]: on the Monday night.

529
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:10,396
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you put it out at three, four, five, six in the evening, you're in violation of the ordinance.

530
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:12,898
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to go out after seven, Mr. President.

531
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:20,183
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think once residents are aware of that, they will respect the ordinance, Mr. President,

532
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:32,919
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would ask that even if the reverse 911 call went out on this, just to notify residents, Mr. President, because it is becoming an issue.

533
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,765
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going up on Riverside Ave the other day, and as we all know, it's been windy the last few days.

534
00:35:40,425 --> 00:35:43,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Literally trash, it looked like a tape parade.

535
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:49,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Trash was blown everywhere, the tops were off the barrels, and really it was a mess and a hop.

536
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:54,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, and that's not what we want to give the impression of our community.

537
00:35:55,964 --> 00:36:08,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, Mr. President, section 70-6, collection for businesses enforcement, all business establishments, rubbish shall be placed on the sidewalk for collection no earlier than 9 a.m.

538
00:36:09,885 --> 00:36:13,768
[SPEAKER_17]: on the day appointed by the city for collection of rubbish.

539
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:24,978
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know some businesses have put their trash out the night before because they may not get in to put the trash out the day of it after nine.

540
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,362
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is also a concern, Mr. President.

541
00:36:28,842 --> 00:36:36,827
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would just ask if the Chamber of Commerce can let their membership know that, indeed, there is an ordinance that covers that.

542
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:47,655
[SPEAKER_17]: And it also states, Mr. President, which someday may require an update from this council, it shall be the duty of the police officers to enforce the provisions of this section.

543
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:54,239
[SPEAKER_17]: And from what I'm being told by the building commissioner, Paul Mulkey, who I spoke to today,

544
00:36:54,870 --> 00:37:03,797
[SPEAKER_17]: It's typically the Board of Health and court enforcement, our court enforcement officers that are issuing the tickets, not the police department.

545
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:23,293
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would ask that subsection B of section 70-6 be updated by this council, probably the public works subcommittee to include language that would include enforceable by DPW, I'm sorry, by the building department

546
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,181
[SPEAKER_17]: and by the Board of Health.

547
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:28,984
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's pretty much it, Mr. President.

548
00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:37,189
[SPEAKER_17]: In the interest of just getting the word out, I would ask that the city administration offer an amendment.

549
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:52,080
[SPEAKER_17]: The city administration do just an informational 911 alerting residents of the both business and homeowners of the trash ordinance and when trash receptacles

550
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,152
[SPEAKER_17]: are allowed to be put out on the sidewalk for pickup, Mr. President.

551
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:56,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

552
00:37:57,613 --> 00:37:59,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Any discussion on Councilor Moxley?

553
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:03,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Moxley, I want to commend you for bringing this up.

554
00:38:03,555 --> 00:38:15,281
[SPEAKER_14]: 70-6 has been a long, long theme of mine when I go through the business districts, especially on some businesses that close on a Friday and don't open up again for the weekend, put them out on a Friday afternoon.

555
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:20,384
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've had discussion with the past mayors about this,

556
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:32,559
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't understand why waste management, which is a 24-hour company, can't come by at 11 o'clock at night or 12 o'clock at night and pick up the couple of business dishes that we have.

557
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:35,061
[SPEAKER_14]: They put their rubbish on so they don't have to do it during the day.

558
00:38:35,902 --> 00:38:43,388
[SPEAKER_14]: And it doesn't sit out there sometimes all weekend, especially some of the food establishments that put their rubbish on and sit there for a bit.

559
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:45,090
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I thank you for bringing this forward.

560
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:47,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

561
00:38:47,403 --> 00:38:53,148
[SPEAKER_17]: Just if I could, Mr. President, I realize that we signed a long-term contract.

562
00:38:53,549 --> 00:38:57,432
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, the administration signed a long-term contract with waste management.

563
00:38:58,018 --> 00:39:10,680
[SPEAKER_17]: But in my opinion, over the years, this council has offered a number of resolutions requesting different solutions to some of the constituent calls that we're getting, Mr. President, to no avail.

564
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:24,583
[SPEAKER_17]: And it seems like either the city administration, and I'm not saying this administration, but past administrations are not willing to sit down because of a long-term contract and talk to waste management

565
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:38,200
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, during COVID, it hasn't been much of an issue, but I can tell you firsthand that waste management picks up trash between seven and nine o'clock on the major thoroughfares when people are rushing to work.

566
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,542
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can tell you, it makes traffic go back 20 minutes, Mr. President.

567
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:53,306
[SPEAKER_17]: On any high street, Riverside Ave, Salem, you mentioned on many of the major thoroughfares, that was one request they offered over the years, that they stay off the thoroughfares

568
00:39:53,722 --> 00:40:04,587
[SPEAKER_17]: between certain hours, and that would be seven or nine in the morning, and, you know, four to six in the evening, when we know there's a high impact of traffic to our community.

569
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:07,548
[SPEAKER_17]: And for whatever reason, that always falls on deaf ears.

570
00:40:07,968 --> 00:40:13,310
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think would alleviate some of the concerns when we talk about congestion in our community.

571
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:17,152
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want to thank you for your recommendations as well.

572
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:17,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

573
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:21,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Max, seconded by Councilor Falco.

574
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:23,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, excuse me, Councilor Villescaz at the end.

575
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

576
00:40:27,162 --> 00:40:30,304
[SPEAKER_10]: As the chair of public works, I'd be happy to work through this.

577
00:40:30,744 --> 00:40:36,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you just suggesting, Councilor Marks, looking at 70-6 subsection B, or do you want to look at the whole section?

578
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:43,253
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, looking at the whole section, it probably would require an update.

579
00:40:43,293 --> 00:40:45,955
[SPEAKER_17]: This language is probably 60, 70 years old.

580
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:49,698
[SPEAKER_17]: So I wouldn't say we look at the entire section.

581
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I will work to schedule a meeting.

582
00:40:53,162 --> 00:40:55,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that an amendment that we're sending this to public works or?

583
00:40:56,964 --> 00:41:00,767
[SPEAKER_14]: And especially the 70 districts for the business district.

584
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:06,931
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no reason why those can't get picked up at 10 o'clock at night, like other cities do.

585
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:19,980
[SPEAKER_05]: May I be so bold to suggest Mr. President that we send the paper to the administration and have them mark it up for us to reflect what existing practices and then we can build upon that document as opposed to us trying to

586
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:26,238
[SPEAKER_05]: go through that 60 year old piece of paper and figure out what it is.

587
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:27,479
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can do that.

588
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:29,760
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm amenable to that.

589
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,962
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not opposed to that.

590
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:32,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

591
00:41:32,682 --> 00:41:36,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk to get that amendment from councilor.

592
00:41:39,787 --> 00:41:42,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

593
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:47,753
[SPEAKER_17]: We just have to send it with our request because we can't just send a paper to them.

594
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:51,763
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we have to also include what we're trying to accomplish.

595
00:41:55,324 --> 00:41:57,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

596
00:41:57,545 --> 00:42:01,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Existing ordinance to reflect for the current ordinance to reflect existing practice.

597
00:42:08,468 --> 00:42:11,209
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we'll probably end up going to subcommittee anyways, but yeah.

598
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:12,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

599
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:25,429
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Council Vice President seconded by Councilor Mayne.

600
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,010
[SPEAKER_14]: As amended by Councilor Marks.

601
00:42:29,251 --> 00:42:30,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

602
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:34,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Beers.

603
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:35,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

604
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:37,713
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, good.

605
00:42:37,793 --> 00:42:41,955
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, if we could also let the record reflect.

606
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:45,976
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, there's a service that's provided by waste management.

607
00:42:46,656 --> 00:42:48,077
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've asked this a million times.

608
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:52,316
[SPEAKER_17]: where they will come around and clean the barrels, Mr. President.

609
00:42:52,817 --> 00:42:54,238
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a great service.

610
00:42:54,979 --> 00:43:01,404
[SPEAKER_17]: I've asked a number of times that they provide, I think they subcontract, to go around.

611
00:43:01,444 --> 00:43:02,825
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had these barrels for years.

612
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:11,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Many of them are big and cumbersome to work with, and it would be a great asset to have them come around and clean the barrels out, Mr. President.

613
00:43:12,113 --> 00:43:13,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I was unaware of it.

614
00:43:13,955 --> 00:43:14,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

615
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:16,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, thank you for bringing that up.

616
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:19,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

617
00:43:20,984 --> 00:43:22,565
[SPEAKER_14]: As further amended by Council locks.

618
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:26,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

619
00:43:26,806 --> 00:43:27,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Council bears.

620
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:28,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

621
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:29,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Falco.

622
00:43:30,368 --> 00:43:31,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President night.

623
00:43:31,728 --> 00:43:32,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Also marks.

624
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:32,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

625
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:33,849
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a morale.

626
00:43:34,189 --> 00:43:34,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

627
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,150
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a scruplet.

628
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:36,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

629
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:37,551
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caribbean.

630
00:43:37,591 --> 00:43:42,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I mean affirmative motion passes to 1337 offered by Vice President night being so resolved.

631
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:51,986
[SPEAKER_14]: that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere congratulations to Pauli Camuso on his recent election as president of Method Youth Hockey.

632
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:53,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

633
00:43:53,628 --> 00:44:01,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, first and foremost, I'd like to congratulate Senator Russo on her service as the former president, the outgoing president.

634
00:44:01,854 --> 00:44:04,195
[SPEAKER_05]: She did a great job over the last several years.

635
00:44:04,816 --> 00:44:09,860
[SPEAKER_05]: But recently, Mr. Pauli Camuso was elected as president of the Method Youth Hockey Association.

636
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I was wondering

637
00:44:12,362 --> 00:44:22,185
[SPEAKER_05]: what was going on with Paul and I kept seeing him show up at these meetings and the city council on TV every once in a while calling in and I didn't know if he was getting the bug again and he was gonna be seeking electoral office.

638
00:44:22,866 --> 00:44:32,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess he is seeking electoral office, a subtle electoral office, but it was at the local level on the board of directors for Medford Youth Hockey, where he spends a lot of his time with his son, James.

639
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:40,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, it's great to see Paul continue to stay involved in the community after so many years serving on this council and in the school committee and I just wanted

640
00:44:41,405 --> 00:44:49,108
[SPEAKER_05]: reach out and congratulate Paul for making another foray into elected politics and keeping his undefeated streak alive.

641
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:52,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

642
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,110
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Council.

643
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President, I bring this forward.

644
00:44:56,671 --> 00:45:00,772
[SPEAKER_16]: First, I, too, wanted to congratulate and thank Annetta Russo.

645
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:06,715
[SPEAKER_16]: For one person being involved in board representation on

646
00:45:08,262 --> 00:45:11,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Little League, and basketball, and youth soccer.

647
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:20,224
[SPEAKER_16]: To take that position is a very stressful, tiresome, and daunting position.

648
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:22,744
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Annetta did a great job.

649
00:45:22,844 --> 00:45:32,626
[SPEAKER_16]: I really want to thank her for holding everything up, Memphis Youth Hockey, for her time as the president, and congratulate our own Paul Camuso.

650
00:45:33,266 --> 00:45:37,367
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sure he's going to do wonderful things as the president

651
00:45:38,045 --> 00:45:44,430
[SPEAKER_16]: If we know Paul, we'll see the Boston Bruins there soon playing against the Method Rock Midgets.

652
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:45,470
[SPEAKER_16]: So, thank you.

653
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:46,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

654
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:48,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

655
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:59,100
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to congratulate my former colleague, Councilor Camuso, on this prestigious appointment.

656
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:06,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, little known fact that Paul Camuso used to skate for the Method High hockey team.

657
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:17,534
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm supportive of this as long as he's not teaching our youth how to skate, because from what I recall, he wasn't a great skater, Mr. President.

658
00:46:18,755 --> 00:46:24,319
[SPEAKER_17]: And as long as he's in the administrative end, I do support this, Mr. President.

659
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:33,227
[SPEAKER_04]: As a past president of the Methodist Hockey Association, Councilor Caviello, do you have anything you want to add, maybe some advice for the wisdom team?

660
00:46:34,115 --> 00:46:35,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

661
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:38,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also like to congratulate Paul Camuso.

662
00:46:38,617 --> 00:46:44,379
[SPEAKER_07]: He's always been a strong advocate for the youth in our community, and I know he will do a great job in this role.

663
00:46:44,399 --> 00:46:46,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So congratulations to Paul on this new endeavor.

664
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

665
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

666
00:46:50,861 --> 00:46:51,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Baez.

667
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:57,624
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to congratulate Paul, wish him good luck, and he's definitely a better skater than I am.

668
00:46:57,944 --> 00:46:58,784
[SPEAKER_10]: So good luck.

669
00:46:59,844 --> 00:47:00,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

670
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:06,062
[SPEAKER_14]: First, I wanna thank Mr. Russo for being the past president for many years.

671
00:47:06,383 --> 00:47:12,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I myself, I'm a past president of Memphi Utahki, and I wanna thank Paul for taking the job.

672
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:19,551
[SPEAKER_14]: If you thought the politics of Memphis City Council was bad, well, I think it's the politics of Memphis Utahki.

673
00:47:19,691 --> 00:47:23,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, being involved with that, that's a great organization.

674
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:31,098
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been involved with them probably at least 15 years of my life with my kids and my daughters,

675
00:47:31,653 --> 00:47:32,634
[SPEAKER_14]: and son skated there.

676
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:34,535
[SPEAKER_14]: And I say, it's a great, it's a great thing.

677
00:47:34,575 --> 00:47:42,759
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's good to have people step up because I say that it's a lot bigger job than people think.

678
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:55,746
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got, you know, hundreds of hundreds of kids that skate through there and boys and girls, you know, and they, they start out, see them coming through there when they're three and four years old, they learn how to skate.

679
00:47:57,027 --> 00:47:57,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me.

680
00:47:58,972 --> 00:48:04,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I want to I want to take Paul take off the taking on the starting position.

681
00:48:04,474 --> 00:48:05,534
[SPEAKER_14]: That was going backwards.

682
00:48:05,554 --> 00:48:10,056
[SPEAKER_14]: The president learned to skate.

683
00:48:10,136 --> 00:48:10,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

684
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:16,258
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion by Vice President night seconded by Councilor Falco.

685
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:17,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clinton.

686
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Council bears.

687
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:24,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

688
00:48:24,961 --> 00:48:25,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Falco.

689
00:48:26,216 --> 00:48:26,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight?

690
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:27,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

691
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:28,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks?

692
00:48:28,398 --> 00:48:28,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

693
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:29,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morrell?

694
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:30,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

695
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

696
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:32,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

697
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:33,001
[SPEAKER_14]: President Cabrillo?

698
00:48:33,122 --> 00:48:34,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative, motion passes.

699
00:48:34,763 --> 00:48:39,106
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-3-3, an offer by President Cabrillo.

700
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:47,273
[SPEAKER_14]: We resolve that the Memphis City Council have the DOT immediately clean the section of roadway of debris between Route 16 and Route 93.

701
00:48:47,313 --> 00:48:54,339
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if anybody has ever had the opportunity in the last couple of months to drive down past the Meadow Glen Mall

702
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:57,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Turn onto Route 16.

703
00:48:57,671 --> 00:49:01,333
[SPEAKER_14]: When you look at the side of the road there, there's mattresses, there's trees, there's everything.

704
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:06,837
[SPEAKER_14]: And that whole section of roadway is really just a garbage pit.

705
00:49:07,517 --> 00:49:16,363
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would hope that the DOT immediately gets over there, cleans it up, and say it's a real distraction of people that drive through our city.

706
00:49:16,404 --> 00:49:19,446
[SPEAKER_14]: And it doesn't represent what our city looks like.

707
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:19,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk.

708
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:28,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't contact district board do today so they're, they're aware of their, their weather.

709
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:29,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

710
00:49:29,392 --> 00:49:32,994
[SPEAKER_14]: So they get down to the Scott council resolution.

711
00:49:33,494 --> 00:49:34,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

712
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:38,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Resolved.

713
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:46,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Take the motion for the DLT to me we clean section of roadways debris between 16 and 93.

714
00:49:52,920 --> 00:50:01,004
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could, if possible, amend the paper to add the on-ramp on Mystic Ave across from the inspection station.

715
00:50:01,044 --> 00:50:02,264
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of a similar area.

716
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:03,605
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also very dirty.

717
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

718
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:05,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

719
00:50:06,386 --> 00:50:08,007
[SPEAKER_14]: As amended by Councilor Beers.

720
00:50:08,387 --> 00:50:08,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President.

721
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:10,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

722
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:20,712
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank you, Mr. President, because I know you've been on top of these particular roadways, and in particular the underpass on

723
00:50:22,034 --> 00:50:24,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Riverside Ave that had the lights out and so forth.

724
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:27,097
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know you've been a big advocate of that.

725
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:42,588
[SPEAKER_17]: I would ask Mr. President also that they take a look in general at all the state roads, Mr. President, within the city of Method, in particular Wellington Circle and along the Felsway because of

726
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:57,415
[SPEAKER_17]: The number of businesses there, because of the number of cars that pass through that area, Mr. President, at any given time, if you take a walk through there, I think you'd be appalled on the amount of trash that is all over those.

727
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:04,176
[SPEAKER_17]: And really, DOT needs to step up and do it far more frequently than they do, Mr. President.

728
00:51:04,216 --> 00:51:04,696
[SPEAKER_17]: You are correct.

729
00:51:05,456 --> 00:51:05,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

730
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:08,257
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have that as an amendment, Mr. President.

731
00:51:08,277 --> 00:51:08,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President?

732
00:51:09,425 --> 00:51:09,985
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Baca.

733
00:51:10,086 --> 00:51:10,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

734
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:15,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank you for bringing this forward and thank Councilor Beers and Councilor Marks as well.

735
00:51:16,631 --> 00:51:31,503
[SPEAKER_07]: If you wouldn't mind, could we also amend, just to be really specific, the crossing the police station, kind of like the on-ramps and off-ramps to Route 16 near the police station and near South Street?

736
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:32,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

737
00:51:32,904 --> 00:51:35,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there are trees, there's all kinds of debris there.

738
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:42,310
[SPEAKER_07]: and they did a lot of construction there, but there are trees there that look like they're like 20 or 30 years old that are just dead.

739
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:43,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And they need to be removed.

740
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:48,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a lot of people, when they come through the city, that's the only section of the city that they see.

741
00:51:48,832 --> 00:51:49,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And they see that.

742
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:52,453
[SPEAKER_07]: And they should have been cleaned up a long time ago.

743
00:51:52,473 --> 00:51:58,734
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could amend that to include cleaning up those locations as well, I clearly appreciate it.

744
00:51:58,754 --> 00:51:59,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

745
00:51:59,135 --> 00:52:04,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on the motion as amended by Councilor Behrs and amended by Councilor Marks,

746
00:52:04,672 --> 00:52:12,535
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended by Council Falco Council night, just one further amendment Mr President, to make this the most amended paper in the history of the city council.

747
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:20,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I just like to ask that we request a copy of the maintenance schedule for the spring for the city of med on the DCR as well.

748
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:31,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr President, while I'm at it, if I can make one more amendment, the DCI property across from my St Francis Church.

749
00:52:32,522 --> 00:52:33,123
[SPEAKER_07]: If that could be.

750
00:52:35,256 --> 00:52:39,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, that can be cleaned as well that is dead trees all over the place.

751
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:40,598
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them fell down recently.

752
00:52:40,638 --> 00:52:42,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's been there for a few weeks.

753
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:43,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can.

754
00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:45,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you get that.

755
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:51,381
[SPEAKER_14]: As further amended by Councilor Knight and as amended again by Councilor Falco the content of the DCF.

756
00:52:52,261 --> 00:52:53,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone else?

757
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:55,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

758
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:59,443
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion by Councilor Scott Pele seconded by Vice President Knight Mr. Clerk let's call the roll.

759
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:05,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

760
00:53:06,781 --> 00:53:07,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

761
00:53:07,802 --> 00:53:08,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

762
00:53:08,482 --> 00:53:09,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight.

763
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:09,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

764
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:10,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

765
00:53:10,484 --> 00:53:10,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

766
00:53:11,145 --> 00:53:11,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morrell.

767
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:12,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

768
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:13,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

769
00:53:13,767 --> 00:53:13,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

770
00:53:14,227 --> 00:53:15,028
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caravaglia.

771
00:53:15,188 --> 00:53:16,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seven deferred most passes.

772
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:28,699
[SPEAKER_14]: 21339 offered by President Caravaglia, we've resolved the Memphis City Council request that the owner of 28 Main Street remove the graffiti from the roof of the building and possibly some assistance from the city.

773
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,022
[SPEAKER_14]: If anyone has come down route 16 and taken the method off ramp,

774
00:53:34,114 --> 00:53:40,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone has made it to the top of the building there on the corner right on the river and painted some graffiti on there.

775
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:44,060
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, it's no reflection on the owner.

776
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:57,348
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the owner is a good person, but where it is an historical building, maybe the historical commission can maybe step up and give the gentleman or the owner some assistance to remove the graffiti.

777
00:53:58,642 --> 00:54:02,204
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, remove the referee at least to cover it up.

778
00:54:02,224 --> 00:54:05,627
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if anyone has seen it as they get off the operator.

779
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:12,011
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion by Vice President Knight, second by Councilor Scarpelli.

780

[SPEAKER_14]: Sincerely, Randall McGillicuddy, Mayor.

802
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:09,031
[SPEAKER_14]: What door is being fixed, Mr. President?

803
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:12,773
[SPEAKER_16]: The door- I believe they've already come to us.

804
00:55:12,793 --> 00:55:15,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, they have come to us in the past, but it's great.

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative motion passes.

838
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:27,276

839
00:56:28,857 --> 00:56:29,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

840
00:56:30,492 --> 00:56:31,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

841
00:56:31,753 --> 00:56:43,604
[SPEAKER_17]: It is with a heavy heart, Mr. President, that we just lost one of Method's finest, Bob McGovern, who we all knew affectionately in this community.

842
00:56:44,245 --> 00:56:50,251
[SPEAKER_17]: You never saw or rarely saw Bob without his lovely wife, Ian.

843
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:51,312
[SPEAKER_17]: They were always together.

844
00:56:52,212 --> 00:56:53,814
[SPEAKER_17]: They own the Superette

845
00:56:54,636 --> 00:57:00,181
[SPEAKER_17]: which had the best soft-serve ice cream on Spring Street for many years.

846
00:57:00,961 --> 00:57:03,043
[SPEAKER_17]: It was known as McGovern's Superette.

847
00:57:03,864 --> 00:57:06,706
[SPEAKER_17]: They were truly a family-owned business, Mr. President.

848
00:57:07,627 --> 00:57:11,970
[SPEAKER_17]: If you didn't have the money to pay for an item, they put you what was called the cuff.

849
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:21,798
[SPEAKER_17]: They put you on the cuff and they allowed residents, Mr. President, that may have been just squeaking by to gain access to

850
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,326
[SPEAKER_17]: a lot of supplies within their Super Red.

851
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:30,330
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were truly, truly just a real good family in this community.

852
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:35,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Bob loved spending time with family and friends.

853
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:44,379
[SPEAKER_17]: If you ever saw him, he was always the first to talk politics, but also asked you how your family was doing and how you were doing.

854
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:46,260
[SPEAKER_17]: And he really cared.

855
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,882
[SPEAKER_17]: He didn't just ask and didn't wait for an answer.

856
00:57:49,242 --> 00:57:50,683
[SPEAKER_17]: He wanted to know how you were doing.

857
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,751
[SPEAKER_17]: and if there's anything he can help you out with.

858
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:55,833
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the type of person Bob was.

859
00:57:56,493 --> 00:58:04,278
[SPEAKER_17]: He grew up in the Wellington area, so I got to know him very well, Mr. President, and he will be sorely missed.

860
00:58:05,098 --> 00:58:18,666
[SPEAKER_17]: I would ask, there were two people that passed recently, Mr. President, I would ask that this meeting be dedicated on behalf of Bob McGovern for his many years of service

861
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:36,378
[SPEAKER_17]: and dedicated volunteerism in our community and for being the type of person that I think everyone wants to emulate as a family man, a businessman, and someone who really cared about the community and not about the bottom line.

862
00:58:36,978 --> 00:58:39,859
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is hard to find in this day and age, Mr. President.

863
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:45,760
[SPEAKER_17]: And on behalf of this council and his entire family, I want to wish them

864
00:58:50,425 --> 00:58:53,646
[SPEAKER_17]: the utmost sympathy during this very trying time.

865
00:58:54,086 --> 00:58:54,706
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

866
00:58:54,726 --> 00:58:55,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

867
00:58:55,306 --> 00:58:56,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarbelli.

868
00:58:59,028 --> 00:58:59,828
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

869
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:01,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marshall and this board.

870
00:59:01,268 --> 00:59:15,492
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that I've known the McGoverns, and again, here's another lifelong Medford resident and family in Medford who found a way to do their part to make Medford the community that it is today.

871
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:31,247
[SPEAKER_16]: They did that not only with the Super Red, I know that, believe it or not, I spent a few nights after baseball trying that soft serve, and the McGovern family has always been there for the community.

872
00:59:31,307 --> 00:59:46,235
[SPEAKER_16]: I know they taught this community how to deal with loss, with the loss of their first child, and I know that good friends with Patrice, who's been a teacher of the Method Public Schools, and I know the love she had for her dad,

873
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,922
[SPEAKER_16]: and how much their family loved each other and love Medford.

874

[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

991
01:00:43,982 --> 01:00:44,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

992
01:00:47,346 --> 01:00:56,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Bob McGovern and Thomas Cangiano, a name synonymous with volunteerism in this community, Mr. President.

993
01:00:56,293 --> 01:01:00,736
[SPEAKER_17]: He served on a number of boards and commissions with distinction over the years.

994
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:08,341
[SPEAKER_17]: We lost his lovely wife, Jane, back a few years ago, and they were inseparable as well.

995
01:01:09,102 --> 01:01:11,744
[SPEAKER_17]: You always saw them, they're like frick and frack together.

996
01:01:12,985 --> 01:01:15,867
[SPEAKER_17]: And Thomas was what,

997
01:01:16,594 --> 01:01:19,175
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say is the model citizen.

998
01:01:20,455 --> 01:01:35,178
[SPEAKER_17]: He was a guy that I had a lot of respect for, someone that shot from the hip and told you how it was, Mr. President, and was doing it in a caring way, and someone that really cared about his community.

999
01:01:35,978 --> 01:01:44,500
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know he was a loving husband, father, grandfather, uncle, and every time you saw him,

1000
01:01:45,251 --> 01:01:50,213
[SPEAKER_17]: He looked like an imposing guy when you saw him, but he had a heart of gold, let me tell you.

1001
01:01:50,834 --> 01:01:55,896
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, a person when you bumped into, the first thing he would ask you is, how are you doing?

1002
01:01:57,036 --> 01:02:00,018
[SPEAKER_17]: And in this day and age, you don't hear that too often.

1003
01:02:00,638 --> 01:02:03,499
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone's self-absorbed and looking at their own.

1004
01:02:04,379 --> 01:02:10,722
[SPEAKER_17]: And he was always a person that would ask how your family's doing, how are you doing?

1005
01:02:11,202 --> 01:02:13,203
[SPEAKER_17]: And is there any way he can help you?

1006
01:02:14,004 --> 01:02:14,804
[SPEAKER_17]: And he truly meant it.

1007
01:02:15,635 --> 01:02:29,162
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would ask Mr. President, for these two Method residents, that we also name this meeting, Mr. President, after Thomas Cangiano on his recent passing.

1008
01:02:29,182 --> 01:02:36,346
[SPEAKER_17]: So both Mr. Cangiano and Mr. McGovern, that this meeting be in their memories, Mr. President.

1009
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:37,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Mox.

1010
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:38,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scapelli.

1011
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:39,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you again, Councilor Mox.

1012
01:02:39,828 --> 01:02:40,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1013
01:02:41,569 --> 01:02:43,410
[SPEAKER_16]: Tom Cangiano, I've known for a long time.

1014
01:02:44,192 --> 01:02:55,278
[SPEAKER_16]: I was fortunate to be friends with his daughter, Andrea, who graduated together from Meffitt High School, and then coached Michael, a prolific goal scorer with our Meffitt High School soccer program.

1015
01:02:55,758 --> 01:02:58,260
[SPEAKER_16]: And Mr. Cangiano was the perfect parent.

1016
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:05,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Always had a kind word to say, things weren't going the right way, was always there to lend a hand.

1017
01:03:06,504 --> 01:03:12,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember a young man and his newlywed wife purchasing a home

1018
01:03:13,476 --> 01:03:18,619
[SPEAKER_16]: and Medford in going to Stonehenge Co-op, I believe, and sitting with Mr. Cangiano.

1019
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:27,665
[SPEAKER_16]: And like Council Member Mox said, that opposing gentleman standing across from me was probably the best person you could have in your corner because he was also a father figure.

1020
01:03:28,226 --> 01:03:32,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I still remember the time when we presented the mortgage, he said, everything looked good.

1021
01:03:32,848 --> 01:03:37,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Then the homeowner went up to him and said, I was a mess.

1022
01:03:38,352 --> 01:03:39,513
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to lose this house.

1023
01:03:40,352 --> 01:03:43,494
[SPEAKER_16]: He played it off like a true friend and father figure.

1024
01:03:44,034 --> 01:03:47,877
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe he told me, George, your mortgage will go up 55 cents.

1025
01:03:48,517 --> 01:03:58,243
[SPEAKER_16]: And to me, I thought it was devastating, but he was such a good person and he knew how to put you at ease and really help you get started with your life.

1026
01:03:58,323 --> 01:03:59,504
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's one story.

1027
01:03:59,524 --> 01:04:01,866
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember Mr. Canjano and I'll never forget him for that.

1028
01:04:01,886 --> 01:04:04,988
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you, Councilor Moxley for bringing this forward.

1029
01:04:05,028 --> 01:04:07,289
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is a terrible loss in our community.

1030
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:10,071
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know he's in a great place right now.

1031
01:04:10,659 --> 01:04:13,261
[SPEAKER_16]: with the person he loves and that's his lovely wife.

1032
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:16,082
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you so much and our condolences to them.

1033
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:21,406
[SPEAKER_14]: All in motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1034

1085
01:06:34,057 --> 01:06:35,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Public participation.

1086
01:06:37,318 --> 01:06:41,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Former Councilor Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.

1087
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:53,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Former Councilor Penta is requesting that a discussion about the city's water meter program be discussed, and also that a correction be made to a comment that I personally made during the 5G program.

1088
01:06:53,703 --> 01:06:55,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Penta, name and address of the record, please.

1089
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:55,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1090
01:06:56,144 --> 01:06:57,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road.

1091
01:06:57,645 --> 01:06:59,205
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a member of the Society of Sprite.

1092
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:01,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to go back to the December of 2002.

1093
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:10,897
[SPEAKER_15]: And at that point in time, there was a gentleman by the name of Donald Ouellette, who became the city engineer here in the city of Method.

1094
01:07:11,658 --> 01:07:21,707
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the reasons why he became the new city engineer is because he came from the community of Air Mass, where he instituted a new water metering program.

1095
01:07:22,567 --> 01:07:25,510
[SPEAKER_15]: At the time, Paul Guia was our director of public works.

1096
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:27,011
[SPEAKER_15]: And in December of 2002,

1097
01:07:28,535 --> 01:07:30,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Roulette came on board.

1098
01:07:31,176 --> 01:07:47,222
[SPEAKER_15]: In January 20th of 2003, Councilor Marks and myself at the time were interviewed by the local newspaper for the purposes of the concerns that were out in the neighborhood regarding the water meter and the bills that were going on.

1099
01:07:47,242 --> 01:07:54,724
[SPEAKER_15]: And at that point in time, information came forward that for the past three years, prior to 2003, there were over 709 abatements

1100
01:07:57,335 --> 01:08:01,438
[SPEAKER_15]: that were issued by the city of Medford because of faulty water meters.

1101
01:08:02,259 --> 01:08:10,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Roulette, when he came in, indicated that the city of Medford's water meters at that time were no more, they should be no more than 10 years of age.

1102
01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:14,287
[SPEAKER_15]: They were 17 years old at the time.

1103
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:21,973
[SPEAKER_15]: So that began the crusade, so to speak, of figuring out how are we going to change these water meters?

1104
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:23,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Should we change these water meters?

1105
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:24,755
[SPEAKER_15]: And when are we going to do it?

1106
01:08:25,687 --> 01:08:42,880
[SPEAKER_15]: At the time, there was over 15,000 households that had water meters that needed to be changed, as well as 150 large capacity commercial district people, which represented 50% of the water consumption and the use at that time.

1107
01:08:43,961 --> 01:08:53,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, in August of 2003, the concerns kept multiplying on the council from residents complaining about their tax bills.

1108
01:08:54,294 --> 01:09:03,919
[SPEAKER_15]: And October 23rd, in a very rare moment by former Mayor McGlynn, he acknowledged at a public meeting that it was his fault that the meters were not changed.

1109
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,681
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason is the concern wasn't as bad as it was.

1110
01:09:08,502 --> 01:09:21,789
[SPEAKER_15]: And he told the Water and Soil Commission at that point in time that blame me, that was his quote, blame me because they just didn't want to get into the financial obligation of getting into the water meters, not realizing how serious everything was.

1111
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:22,409
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's okay.

1112
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,261
[SPEAKER_15]: because that got itself corrected after that.

1113
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:42,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Then on February 17 of 2004, Mayor McGlynn presented before the city council a prelude, a prelude so to speak as to what the water meter sewer count should look like and what do we need to do here to go in the city of Medford.

1114
01:09:43,255 --> 01:09:47,519
[SPEAKER_15]: But what he did and what he proposed, which was kind of interesting, he proposed to finance $18,000

1115
01:09:49,402 --> 01:10:01,126
[SPEAKER_15]: have the city council vote for $18,000 to do a preliminary review on X amount of homes and X amount of businesses in the city, just to see how bad these water meters were in commercial meters.

1116
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:15,010
[SPEAKER_15]: And what they found out was an atrocious, the decision or the results were atrocious, because what came out of all of that, where these meters were running much slower, and as a result of them running much slower, the city was losing a tremendous amount of revenue.

1117
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,750
[SPEAKER_15]: So in October of 2004,

1118
01:10:19,526 --> 01:10:28,050
[SPEAKER_15]: straight down October 19th, the city council voted the appropriation for $4.2 million to put new water meters here in the city of Medford.

1119
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:30,772
[SPEAKER_15]: And subsequent to that, the chase goes on.

1120
01:10:31,272 --> 01:10:45,819
[SPEAKER_15]: At that point in time, and that's back in 2003, at the end of 2003, the city of Medford was losing on a daily basis 189 million gallons of water a day, not getting billed, and their leakage was 113 million gallons a day.

1121
01:10:48,325 --> 01:10:57,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Those two numbers, and I would hope somebody in the council would pick up on that and make a request as to what our leakage is and loss of revenue from then it is now.

1122
01:10:58,407 --> 01:11:14,250
[SPEAKER_15]: The new water meters that came in, once again, had a 10 year lifespan and the meters on this new meeting system, they had batteries in their battery life, according to their own information that they passed up as a 10 year life.

1123
01:11:15,433 --> 01:11:18,194
[SPEAKER_15]: We've well exceeded a 10 year life on these batteries.

1124
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:30,499
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe most recently there have been some concerns with people who have gotten their bills and their bills have been higher or lower than expected than what they received in the past.

1125
01:11:31,819 --> 01:11:37,621
[SPEAKER_15]: I really think as the concern is for parking in the city, the concern should equally be as where are we going?

1126
01:11:38,141 --> 01:11:41,343
[SPEAKER_15]: You're sitting on over $5 million in your water and sewer enterprise account.

1127
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:43,723
[SPEAKER_15]: There needs to be some addressing to this.

1128
01:11:43,743 --> 01:11:45,044
[SPEAKER_15]: When is it going to take place?

1129
01:11:45,988 --> 01:11:53,933
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's, if in fact, they're accurate in their information that they submitted and they gave us at the time when the council voted on it.

1130
01:11:54,633 --> 01:12:03,298
[SPEAKER_15]: I think council Max was the only one on the council at the time when we voted on this, something really needs to be done because you're gonna find yourself right back to where you were before.

1131
01:12:03,879 --> 01:12:08,581
[SPEAKER_15]: If in fact, 10 years is the mandate as their brochure says.

1132
01:12:09,262 --> 01:12:14,845
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I would hope somewhere along the line, what a 10 year battery and a 10 year life of the meter

1133
01:12:15,555 --> 01:12:23,639
[SPEAKER_15]: something needs to be looked at because we're going to find ourselves right back into the same problem that we were when they were 17 years of age and you brought in a new person.

1134
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:39,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Second comment, Mr. President, I think it was three weeks ago when I appeared before here, when they were talking about the 5G situation, I said at that point in time that I believed, I believed, and it's my mistake, I misquoted myself,

1135
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:46,094
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe that that time that one of the people who happens to be the director of public, what's her name?

1136
01:12:46,774 --> 01:12:54,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Public health at that point in time had voted for some of the passing and not for passing some of them.

1137
01:12:54,519 --> 01:12:55,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Sort of like split down the middle.

1138
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,581
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank council Max.

1139
01:12:57,641 --> 01:13:09,008
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to compliment him because of his institution of pushing forward the folks that had their place, not have that 5G go in front of their house.

1140
01:13:10,984 --> 01:13:18,510
[SPEAKER_15]: at their last meeting, I think that sets the tempo for people to stand up and say, hey, you can fight the government and you can push them back if you have to.

1141
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,511
[SPEAKER_15]: They've set the standard now.

1142
01:13:20,832 --> 01:13:26,877
[SPEAKER_15]: And people out there, if you don't want that 5G in front of your house, now's your time to complain because they've already set the trademark.

1143
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:31,180
[SPEAKER_15]: And the council, I believe the vote was four to nothing on that particular issue.

1144
01:13:33,262 --> 01:13:35,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Two last comments, and they go like this, Mr. President.

1145
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,967
[SPEAKER_15]: The two gentlemen that you just talked about, Tom Kianciano and Bob McGovern,

1146
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:46,115
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the underlying issue there to their lives are that they were born and bred in Medford.

1147
01:13:46,836 --> 01:13:49,078
[SPEAKER_15]: True Medford family folks.

1148
01:13:49,899 --> 01:14:04,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Something that's very hard to understand today for people who just move in here, who think that even though they've been here for 10 to 15 years, they know Medford like somebody in their family who's lived here their whole life, who's been well respected within the community.

1149
01:14:05,132 --> 01:14:07,374
[SPEAKER_15]: They both happen to have a Wellington background.

1150
01:14:08,135 --> 01:14:14,898
[SPEAKER_15]: And they both happen to have a big family background, something that's hard to find today and to be respected for and to.

1151
01:14:15,678 --> 01:14:21,001
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I congratulate you for bringing the issue of dedicating the meeting on their behalf.

1152
01:14:21,581 --> 01:14:23,162
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's a true honor.

1153
01:14:23,962 --> 01:14:26,183
[SPEAKER_15]: I think also would be a true honor for this council.

1154
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,403
[SPEAKER_15]: You're getting ready to deal with your budget.

1155
01:14:28,483 --> 01:14:29,663
[SPEAKER_15]: It's coming up pretty soon.

1156
01:14:30,184 --> 01:14:32,064
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a big issue as far as I'm concerned.

1157
01:14:32,144 --> 01:14:38,707
[SPEAKER_15]: If I was running for office right now, I would be running to find out where are and is the money for these meters.

1158
01:14:39,088 --> 01:14:40,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Do they have to be replaced?

1159
01:14:40,348 --> 01:14:41,689
[SPEAKER_15]: When are they going to be replaced?

1160
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:44,090
[SPEAKER_15]: And how and where is the money going to be found?

1161
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:48,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they going to take it out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise account or what have you?

1162
01:14:48,712 --> 01:14:51,693
[SPEAKER_15]: This is serious money and this is serious community money.

1163
01:14:52,294 --> 01:14:54,174
[SPEAKER_15]: And let me just leave you with one last thought, Mr. President.

1164
01:14:54,194 --> 01:14:55,175
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to ask you a question.

1165
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,962
[SPEAKER_15]: because I look forward to every Tuesday night.

1166
01:14:58,002 --> 01:14:59,483
[SPEAKER_15]: You started this about three or four weeks ago.

1167
01:15:00,324 --> 01:15:04,868
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't hear any more from the director of public health on an update as to what's going on.

1168
01:15:04,948 --> 01:15:06,289
[SPEAKER_15]: And is there a reason for that?

1169
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:09,392
[SPEAKER_14]: She had been on vacation the last couple, last week.

1170
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:10,773
[SPEAKER_14]: For the last three weeks?

1171
01:15:10,793 --> 01:15:15,197
[SPEAKER_14]: She had a meeting, she had a prior commitment one week and the following week she was on vacation.

1172
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:19,400
[SPEAKER_15]: But if I remember correctly, the one week she couldn't come, she gave you a written synopsis.

1173
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't heard, I haven't heard anything like that.

1174
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,180
[SPEAKER_15]: because people look forward to that.

1175
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:26,441
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would just hope maybe, you know, that gets itself reinstituted.

1176
01:15:26,901 --> 01:15:34,662
[SPEAKER_15]: But as far as just getting back real quick on the water meters and the whole idea of the meters, it's going to turn out to be a big issue.

1177
01:15:34,722 --> 01:15:36,683
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be a financial concern for this community.

1178
01:15:36,703 --> 01:15:49,785
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm quite sure when council Marks and myself at that point in time in 2003, we viewed 709 abatements having been filed because the meters were not cooperating correctly.

1179
01:15:50,485 --> 01:15:52,506
[SPEAKER_15]: And thankfully, Mayor McGlynn finally understood.

1180
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:54,728
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the reason why he put the appropriation in there.

1181
01:15:55,268 --> 01:15:59,071
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't want to get yourself into that position again right now, Mr. President.

1182
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:00,372
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it will serve you any good.

1183
01:16:01,413 --> 01:16:08,158
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have all the records here of everything that took place, how we got to where we got at that point in time.

1184
01:16:08,658 --> 01:16:12,661
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would hope that the council does not find themselves in that same position again.

1185
01:16:12,741 --> 01:16:13,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

1186
01:16:13,642 --> 01:16:15,843
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

1187
01:16:16,464 --> 01:16:16,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1188
01:16:19,584 --> 01:16:20,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1189
01:16:22,025 --> 01:16:29,869
[SPEAKER_17]: And anytime my former colleague starts off with, I want to go back to 2002, I think we all know we're in trouble.

1190
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:40,074
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I think what Councilor Penta mentioned, Mr. President, is valuable institutional knowledge.

1191
01:16:41,114 --> 01:16:47,297
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I say that, Mr. President, many of us behind the reel probably don't remember the days

1192
01:16:47,938 --> 01:16:57,060
[SPEAKER_17]: when, as Councilor Penter alluded to, where we used to have five, six, seven, 800 abatements in the water and sewer department a year.

1193
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:01,741
[SPEAKER_17]: And that wasn't because, you know, everything was running smoothly.

1194
01:17:02,261 --> 01:17:09,802
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the fact, Mr. President, that we were estimating probably 50 to 60% of our water meters.

1195
01:17:10,963 --> 01:17:15,024
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was creating so much confusion in this community.

1196
01:17:15,484 --> 01:17:17,124
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really a crazy,

1197
01:17:17,543 --> 01:17:18,404
[SPEAKER_17]: crazy time.

1198
01:17:18,784 --> 01:17:23,627
[SPEAKER_17]: It was probably one of the biggest issues of that day, Mr. President.

1199
01:17:24,267 --> 01:17:37,856
[SPEAKER_17]: And when we moved to the new water meters, we really, in my opinion, solved a lot of the abatement issues, a lot of the issues of why is my bill so high, what's happening, and so forth.

1200
01:17:38,478 --> 01:17:44,042
[SPEAKER_17]: And now, as Councilor Pinto rightfully alluded to, we don't want to go back to those days, believe me.

1201
01:17:44,062 --> 01:17:47,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I remember those days, and they were awful, Mr. President.

1202
01:17:48,225 --> 01:18:00,575
[SPEAKER_17]: The number of phone calls and the number of research that was taken, the amount of research, I should say, that was taken on each and every resident's complaint was unbelievable.

1203
01:18:01,335 --> 01:18:07,280
[SPEAKER_17]: And as Councilor Pinto alluded to, I believe the life expectancy was around 10 years.

1204
01:18:07,757 --> 01:18:14,761
[SPEAKER_17]: We far surpassed the 10 years and eventually we're going to get into an issue and it's going to be all of our issue.

1205
01:18:15,161 --> 01:18:18,262
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not going to be, well, that's water and sewer or the city administration.

1206
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:29,608
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be this council's issue that we go down that slippery slope again, when these meters one at a time across the city start to malfunction, we don't replace them.

1207
01:18:29,989 --> 01:18:35,371
[SPEAKER_17]: And eventually we just start to estimate, which was the slippery slope we got into back in 2002.

1208
01:18:36,758 --> 01:18:38,079
[SPEAKER_17]: as Councilor Penta mentioned.

1209
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:42,983
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's only appropriate, this is not a sexy issue.

1210
01:18:43,463 --> 01:18:48,707
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not something that people are gonna be banging your door down until it impacts them.

1211
01:18:49,548 --> 01:18:57,174
[SPEAKER_17]: And why not head it off as Councilor Penta mentioned, we have over 5 million in the water and sewer enterprise account.

1212
01:18:57,814 --> 01:19:03,338
[SPEAKER_17]: And that money can only be spent to offset a deficit or infrastructure improvements.

1213
01:19:04,559 --> 01:19:05,340
[SPEAKER_17]: Why not look

1214
01:19:06,052 --> 01:19:12,234
[SPEAKER_17]: at the replacement of either the batteries or a new water meter right now, Mr. President.

1215
01:19:12,774 --> 01:19:18,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Why not head off the potential of this heartache that you know is going to come down the line?

1216
01:19:19,556 --> 01:19:28,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, Mr. President, as Councilor Penter alluded to, the city used to do a lot of I&I, inflow and infiltration, with the sewer system.

1217
01:19:29,259 --> 01:19:32,960
[SPEAKER_17]: It also was very aggressive with the leak detection program.

1218
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:39,854
[SPEAKER_17]: When we discuss the meters, we have to look at INI and leak detection to see where we stand with that.

1219
01:19:40,254 --> 01:19:46,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Because those two alone cost the taxpayers millions of dollars a year in this community.

1220
01:19:47,678 --> 01:19:56,663
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's strange, but if you know anything else in this community that was costing you as a rate payer millions of dollars, you would say, let's address it.

1221
01:19:57,344 --> 01:20:01,066
[SPEAKER_17]: But for some reason, water and sewer, it falls under the radar.

1222
01:20:01,406 --> 01:20:02,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the pipes are underground,

1223
01:20:03,452 --> 01:20:04,993
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's something that we don't look at.

1224
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Out of sight, out of mind.

1225
01:20:06,933 --> 01:20:10,975
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's an inherent problem in this community that needs to be addressed.

1226
01:20:11,655 --> 01:20:23,760
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, Mr. President, when we brought the system back some years ago, we were sold a bill of sales by the former engineers, Councilor Penter alluded to, Don Roulette, who I had a lot of respect at the time.

1227
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:30,623
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a big job, and as you know, every department was understaffed, and this was a big undertaking to change the meters.

1228
01:20:31,415 --> 01:20:39,256
[SPEAKER_17]: We saw the bill of sales that the program was also going to have what they call an exception report.

1229
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:52,219
[SPEAKER_17]: And what that was, Mr. President, was a report that was run daily by the city, or at least they had access to running it, that would show spikes in water usage in the community.

1230
01:20:53,019 --> 01:21:00,540
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you're a snowbird and you went to, you know, Florida in December, and you happen to have a leak in your house,

1231
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:07,932
[SPEAKER_17]: and you weren't home and no one was there, you could see the spike because you'd be using water at two, three in the morning.

1232
01:21:08,232 --> 01:21:10,594
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd be using it on off days and so forth.

1233
01:21:11,094 --> 01:21:17,598
[SPEAKER_17]: And the city would be able to spit out a report saying this particular address had an exception, had a spike.

1234
01:21:18,515 --> 01:21:32,373
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's invaluable, Mr. President, to a resident and a homeowner that someone's watching over saying, hey, we're going to make sure that if there is a concern that we can address it and notify you as a resident.

1235
01:21:32,814 --> 01:21:35,076
[SPEAKER_17]: You also may have an internal link.

1236
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:46,713
[SPEAKER_17]: So you may have it a week that's not coming through a ceiling or a floor, but your bathroom toilet may be running constantly, and maybe you're not aware of that.

1237
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:49,834
[SPEAKER_17]: Or maybe you have several toilets that are running constantly.

1238
01:21:50,394 --> 01:22:05,079
[SPEAKER_17]: Or for instance, I got a call last week from a management company, and I won't mention the management company, and I won't mention the condo building in Method, but a management company reached out to me and said that they received,

1239
01:22:05,903 --> 01:22:07,384
[SPEAKER_17]: a $40,000 water bill.

1240
01:22:07,504 --> 01:22:08,704
[SPEAKER_17]: I got the same call.

1241
01:22:08,964 --> 01:22:10,345
[SPEAKER_17]: You got the same call, Mr. President.

1242
01:22:11,245 --> 01:22:15,306
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were not notified for two billing cycles.

1243
01:22:15,846 --> 01:22:18,127
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was 40,000 and 40,000.

1244
01:22:19,588 --> 01:22:21,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Their typical bill may have been $4,000.

1245
01:22:22,829 --> 01:22:35,693
[SPEAKER_17]: And once the management company found out and alerted the Condo Association, by that time, you know, and then they try to figure out, they hired plumbers and so forth, they found a leak

1246
01:22:36,191 --> 01:22:41,954
[SPEAKER_17]: was internal, so it was after the meter on their property, but it was underground.

1247
01:22:43,195 --> 01:22:48,858
[SPEAKER_17]: In the end, the ground was absorbing the water, and no one was the wiser, Mr. President, other than the bill.

1248
01:22:49,778 --> 01:22:59,343
[SPEAKER_17]: But if there was an exception report that showed, hey, typically, they're using just, say, 32,000 cubic gallons a month, and now they're using 450,000 cubic gallons a month,

1249
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,820
[SPEAKER_17]: That's an exception.

1250
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:11,083
[SPEAKER_17]: And the city should be notifying people saying, there's a huge exception, there's a problem.

1251
01:23:11,824 --> 01:23:19,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Because how do you turn to a homeowner, a condo association, which are homeowners, and say, you know what, your bill went from $4,000 to $40,000.

1252
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:26,032
[SPEAKER_17]: That could have happened to any one of us behind this wheel, or anyone in the community, Mr. President.

1253
01:23:26,775 --> 01:23:27,756
[SPEAKER_17]: And what do you do?

1254
01:23:27,796 --> 01:23:29,277
[SPEAKER_17]: What a hardship that would be, right?

1255
01:23:29,597 --> 01:23:31,859
[SPEAKER_17]: When the city reaches out and says, you owe us 40,000.

1256
01:23:32,459 --> 01:23:33,460
[SPEAKER_17]: How do you dispute that?

1257
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,981
[SPEAKER_17]: The leak was on your side.

1258
01:23:35,001 --> 01:23:36,242
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't the city's leak.

1259
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:37,283
[SPEAKER_17]: It was your leak.

1260
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:40,205
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the great fight is on, Mr. President.

1261
01:23:40,705 --> 01:23:43,728
[SPEAKER_17]: So that is extremely important with the exception report.

1262
01:23:44,048 --> 01:23:51,153
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to offer an amendment to Councilor Pinter's, if we could vote on it next week.

1263
01:23:51,173 --> 01:23:52,314
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine, Mr. President.

1264
01:23:53,835 --> 01:23:56,517
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'd like to offer an amendment, Mr. President, we can bring up next week.

1265
01:23:57,192 --> 01:24:19,660
[SPEAKER_17]: whether or not the city is still actively involved with looking at exception reports, and if they have the capability, because this was some time back, if they still have the capability of running exception reports for unaccounted for water on behalf of residents and homeowners of this community.

1266
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:25,322
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, Mr. President, an amendment next week, because Council Vice President's right

1267
01:24:26,530 --> 01:24:28,911
[SPEAKER_17]: this wasn't formally on the agenda.

1268
01:24:29,451 --> 01:24:31,872
[SPEAKER_17]: And under our new rules, it has to be formally on the agenda.

1269
01:24:32,453 --> 01:24:47,699
[SPEAKER_17]: And also Mr. President, that the 5 million surplus of water and sewer enterprise that the administration report back the status of the water meter systems in our community.

1270
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:54,902
[SPEAKER_17]: And when and if and when these meters are being looked at for replacement

1271
01:24:56,527 --> 01:24:57,969
[SPEAKER_17]: in our community, where we stand.

1272
01:24:58,429 --> 01:25:01,072
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's only appropriate we get an update on that.

1273
01:25:01,132 --> 01:25:11,002
[SPEAKER_14]: You may want to invite Ron Baker to the meeting, to come on the call, because I think he's really the, and maybe the chairman of the Water and Soil Commission.

1274
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:12,064
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be great.

1275
01:25:12,164 --> 01:25:15,287
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, you know, I think for the edification... You can do that next week, on next week's thing.

1276
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:16,811
[SPEAKER_17]: That'd be good.

1277
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:29,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Whenever you could set it up, Mr. President, and the edification for the viewing audience and also this council, because water and sewer is a multi, multimillion dollar charge to this community through sewer and water.

1278
01:25:30,101 --> 01:25:34,244
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important that we all receive updates periodically to know where we stand.

1279
01:25:34,444 --> 01:25:35,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1280
01:25:36,666 --> 01:25:41,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say that I would support discussing that next week and just add to what Councilor Marks was saying.

1281
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:43,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I have heard of residents who have

1282
01:25:44,651 --> 01:25:50,756
[SPEAKER_10]: been notified automatically when their water usage spikes in the case of an issue with the water heater or some other leak.

1283
01:25:50,856 --> 01:25:57,042
[SPEAKER_10]: So if that program does exist, I think it'd be great for all residents to know how to access it.

1284
01:25:57,782 --> 01:26:00,044
[SPEAKER_10]: It would avoid situations like the one that you brought up.

1285
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:01,466
[SPEAKER_10]: So I look forward to that.

1286
01:26:01,586 --> 01:26:01,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1287
01:26:03,095 --> 01:26:10,119
[SPEAKER_14]: If you do that, you can call the engineer's office and they can print you out a report.

1288
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:16,643
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've done it in my own house and they can show you where your spikes are and it tells you where the leaks are, but you have to ask for it.

1289
01:26:18,405 --> 01:26:18,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1290
01:26:18,905 --> 01:26:21,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, yeah, if you do that next week, Councilor Marks, it'll be great.

1291
01:26:22,687 --> 01:26:24,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Felton.

1292
01:26:25,069 --> 01:26:32,053
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may really quick, and I thank former Councilor Patu for bringing this up and Councilor Marks for your statements as well.

1293
01:26:32,657 --> 01:26:34,157
[SPEAKER_07]: but they both bring up a very good point.

1294
01:26:34,257 --> 01:26:40,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's that the city should be proactive in reaching out and the residents shouldn't have to, I mean, the residents wouldn't know.

1295
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:53,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, if there's an issue and someone does spike, I mean, it's a report, someone should be responsible on a daily basis to kind of review to see where the spikes are.

1296
01:26:54,762 --> 01:26:58,703
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some way to look at that and someone should be looking at it on a daily basis.

1297
01:26:59,323 --> 01:27:02,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So it should be a proactive attempt by the city to reach out to the residents.

1298
01:27:03,018 --> 01:27:04,078
[SPEAKER_07]: to look for those spikes.

1299
01:27:04,098 --> 01:27:05,858
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thank you for bringing it forward.

1300
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:06,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

1301
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:11,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, just one quick, Council Marks and Council Falco are both correct.

1302
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:17,921
[SPEAKER_15]: The software that the city was supposed to purchase would cost anywhere between 100 and 115,000 at the time.

1303
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:27,962
[SPEAKER_15]: And they figured that the reason that they would save the money on that is just think about all the abatements that you would not have to service, the people that would have to leave work or whatever it might be to come to a hearing.

1304
01:27:28,242 --> 01:27:32,423
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes if they didn't even win on their abatement process, they'd have to take that to the

1305
01:27:32,853 --> 01:27:36,955
[SPEAKER_15]: district go over and some of them, but Councilor Falco is absolutely right.

1306
01:27:37,475 --> 01:27:40,937
[SPEAKER_15]: The way the program was sold is you were going to have an abatement.

1307
01:27:41,037 --> 01:27:43,158
[SPEAKER_15]: You were going to have a program with a software.

1308
01:27:43,598 --> 01:27:48,241
[SPEAKER_15]: And if any house spiked irregularly, they would contact the taxpayer.

1309
01:27:48,301 --> 01:27:50,602
[SPEAKER_15]: It should not be the taxpayer contacting the city.

1310
01:27:51,342 --> 01:27:53,724
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's the key.

1311
01:27:53,764 --> 01:27:56,765
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the key as Councilor Maxwell alluded to and Councilor Falco.

1312
01:27:57,446 --> 01:28:01,788
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just, you know, when you say out of sight out of mind, but that's not right either.

1313
01:28:02,689 --> 01:28:16,540
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the biggest, other than doing a public works street or a sidewalk, it's the biggest financial obligation that the city has to its taxpayers as it relates to make sure that the water and sewer system works properly.

1314
01:28:17,121 --> 01:28:24,446
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's not working properly and there is something wrong with the infrastructure below the street, below the sidewalk, how's the taxpayer gonna know?

1315
01:28:24,987 --> 01:28:30,311
[SPEAKER_15]: When in fact you're collecting, you're raising the taxes each and every year, you're raising the rates each and every year,

1316
01:28:30,664 --> 01:28:36,529
[SPEAKER_15]: You supposedly have this system and you're still telling the taxpayer, you've got to call city hall to find out what's going on.

1317
01:28:37,209 --> 01:28:38,330
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't make any sense.

1318
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:40,052
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think you get your work cut off.

1319
01:28:40,532 --> 01:28:40,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1320
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:41,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1321
01:28:41,653 --> 01:28:42,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1322
01:28:43,374 --> 01:28:43,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

1323
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:44,796
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll take care of that next week.

1324
01:28:44,816 --> 01:28:45,376
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be great.

1325
01:28:45,856 --> 01:28:46,837
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1326
01:28:47,378 --> 01:28:49,099
[SPEAKER_17]: We have the clerk.

1327
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1328
01:28:52,342 --> 01:28:52,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1329
01:28:52,602 --> 01:28:52,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President.

1330
01:28:53,022 --> 01:28:58,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to add, I believe that the program counselor bears is referring to as the water smart program, which people can enroll in.

1331
01:29:00,113 --> 01:29:00,873
[SPEAKER_01]: on the city website.

1332
01:29:01,213 --> 01:29:04,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's something you would have to set up alerts, it needs to have internet access.

1333
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:05,894
[SPEAKER_01]: So I fully support the conversation.

1334
01:29:05,914 --> 01:29:08,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to reference the name of that program.

1335
01:29:09,535 --> 01:29:09,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1336
01:29:09,915 --> 01:29:11,395
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1337
01:29:13,016 --> 01:29:17,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Records, the table records of the meeting of April 13 2021.
