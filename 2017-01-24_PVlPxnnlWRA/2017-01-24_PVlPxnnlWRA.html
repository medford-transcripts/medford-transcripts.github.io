    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=10.696s">which</a>  is there for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=12.777s">So</a>  if there was a situation that any of the students experienced, she would be the resource for all of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=20.822s">Um,</a>  not just that one.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=23.584s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=24.124s">Because</a>  I know that when the BN director was here last week or two weeks ago, uh, she was saying that the rules have changed and it's very delicate because if it's the teacher who's giving out, let's say the medication, even though, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=39.578s">In</a>  this, it says that it's almost approved that a teacher could give out the medication.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=43.48s">I'll</a>  clarify this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=45.061s">We</a>  have a certificate from the Department of Public Health that nurses can train teachers to, we delegate the medication administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=55.948s">At</a>  the high school level, most students are able to self-administer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=60.211s">So</a>  we back up the delegation certification with a doctor's order and a parent consent saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=67.028s">that</a>  student is mature enough to self-administer a medication. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=70.869s">So</a>  it's sort of a two-fold protection that we use in those instances. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=78.651s">Where</a>  we get concerned is who holds on to the medication, because we all know that there can be issues with that.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=87.713s">Another</a>  piece to that is that by contract, teachers may decline to administer certain medications. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=94.531s">So</a>  they don't have to accept that responsibility if they don't want to.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=98.014s">And</a>  there are certain medications that they cannot administer by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=101.918s">And</a>  that would be insulin is one of the best examples of that.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=107.183s">And</a>  I guess the other concern for me would be is that I know that one of the options you had stated was that you could have a nurse contracted from where you're going.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=115.811s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=116.497s">But</a>  the thing is if you're talking about let's say we've had students that have gone across to Europe and they're taking different flights, it doesn't mean necessarily that the nurse will be with them from when they leave here until they get to where their destination is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=131.29s">So</a>  that's something I think that we also need to take in consideration and make sure that we do have coverage when we're thinking about this.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=138.996s">And</a>  the international flights pose an even more restrictive circumstance because <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=144.371s">Nobody</a>  from the United States can practice out of the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=148.373s">So</a>  we cannot send anybody on one of those trips.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=153.074s">So</a>  then could I just ask, I know that you are still in the middle of trying to get all the information for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=159.437s">If</a>  we could find out from other districts how they're doing it, because I mean, they're sending their students away, not away, but they're going on their trips.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=168.34s">And</a>  I have reached out to my Northeast regional consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=173.718s">We'll</a>  see what information we gather from all the school systems that are in our northeast region for Department of Public Health.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=180.962s">And</a>  this is something that's changing now, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=183.123s">We</a>  didn't have this implemented years ago or even up until last year.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=186.585s">And</a>  student need, I think that really speaks to student need that has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=191.267s">Because</a>  in years past, you know, many parents decided not to send their children on those type of field trips if they had a health care issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=201.567s">But</a>  now, you know, more and more students are able to go and parents want them to go.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=207.489s">And</a>  I guess my last question is that if there is a child who does need special services, let's say the parent turns around and says that they want to be the chaperone.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=216.811s">By</a>  all means, the parent can be the chaperone for the student.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=219.892s">And</a>  then we wouldn't have to worry about the nurse? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=221.633s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=224.666s">I'd</a>  like to make a motion at this point to have the superintendent do a policy and protocol and outline this so that way we have one on for the whole district K through 12 for both out-of-state and in-state travel <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=247.185s">that</a>  extends over the school day, like if it's an overnight trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=251.127s">Because</a>  we also have to think about in-state. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=253.608s">So</a>  this is a major issue, and I really believe that it needs your time and attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=258.39s">So</a>  I just would like to make that motion that you provide the school committee with the detailed policy procedure and protocol.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=265.633s">May</a>  I add something here? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=267.613s">Last</a>  year at the high school, we set up a task force that looked at and actually edited a lot of our field trip forms and the procedure for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=277.826s">And</a>  it really revolves a lot around communication so that the nurse's office is aware of the list of students going, they can review the list, and they can get all the proper medical forms into, you know, all organized. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=293.276s">And</a>  that has worked well this year at the high school in making sure that we're meeting the needs of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=300.801s">And</a>  similar processes are followed at the elementary and middle school level.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=305.64s">That's</a>  why we need it in writing district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=308.28s">We</a>  need it on our website, so if there's any question, that parents can look at it, and even teachers can look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=314.361s">If</a>  they're planning an event or travel with our students, that they can check the policy procedures and guidelines that they need to follow in here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=322.863s">And</a>  I also think then we're very clear, who are the decision makers? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=327.204s">Who</a>  actually decides whether a nurse is necessary or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=330.644s">Is</a>  it the teacher? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=331.504s">Is</a>  it the principal? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=332.425s">Is</a>  it the nurse at that building? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=333.845s">Or</a>  is it the head nurse? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=335.118s">throughout</a>  the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=336.039s">It</a>  tends to be a combination of a lot of team members. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=339.564s">A</a>  lot of people don't know that and that's why we need this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=342.327s">So</a>  I'm looking for one of my colleagues to second my motion.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=350.55s">Yes,</a>  I would urge the superintendent as he considers this not to choose the third option all students proportionately share in the cost which was what was originally presented to us last week in reference to when the band trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=367.022s">To</a>  me it just felt like that by doing it that way it could make students feel like their trip was more expensive because one of their <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=376.948s">fellow</a>  students needed a nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=379.57s">Instead</a>  I think that it would be much better for either us for us to decide that on whatever field trip there was a uniform every student puts 25 bucks into the kitty or whatever I mean just so that it was a uniform <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=393.64s">a</a>  cost to help offset the district's cost because option number one is the school system pays for the cost outright and that of course would be my choice but I'm also understanding that it is there's an expense and it could so by having some <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=412.948s">amount</a>  of money, but it would be uniform. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=414.971s">So</a>  it wouldn't be for just one field trip or the other would be across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=418.896s">Every</a>  time there's a field trip, every student would have as part of the cost, a small charge.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=425.368s">The</a>  only thing I would say is field trips differ in length and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=429.431s">So</a>  if you had a person for an entire week, the cost would be much more extensive than if it were for two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=435.555s">If</a>  the person had some severe issues, the cost of other things might be more substantial.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=440.098s">So</a>  the idea of having the kitty, if you would, would be so that money would be thrown into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=447.222s">to</a>  help offset the costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=450.064s">And</a>  it would be proportionate to, let's say it's a, if a, you know, $5 a day or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=456.709s">I'm</a>  just speaking off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=458.351s">So</a>  if it was a five-day field trip to Florida, the kids might put in 25 bucks.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=464.816s">You</a>  know, I mean, I just, I think that you do, there's going to be a recognition that you're paying for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=471.301s">And</a>  quite frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=473.846s">if</a>  you don't have some kind of distributive cost sharing, you're going to have to start denying certain field trips, because you have 10, 15 field trips, and you're going to be paying $2,000 for every one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=483.774s">You're</a>  going to have a budget line item that you're going to have to fund, or you may have to fund.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=488.998s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=489.818s">So</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=490.899s">I'm</a>  recognizing that, and I'm also proposing a way to help offset it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=494.482s">And</a>  I certainly think that we're smart enough to come up with a way to do that.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=498.812s">Well,</a>  you know, I take your guidance on, you know, as a group. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=500.995s">You</a>  know, I personally don't think the third one is a bad one, but that's my opinion, because I think that, you know, the cost of a field trip, you never know when someone's going to need medical help. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=510.647s">It</a>  could be anybody at any given time.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=512.249s">And</a>  if you're paying for a professional nurse to accompany a field trip, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=517.327s">then</a>  her services would be available to all, not just to Ronnie.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=520.648s">That's</a>  a personal opinion, but certainly the committee can make that decision in all honor.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=524.169s">If</a>  I could follow up, are you saying that if there's a field trip, let's suppose we're having two field trips as we are this year going to, or next year, Disney. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=533.05s">So</a>  on one there's a student who has medical needs and needs a nurse, but on the other one there are no students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=540.432s">So,</a>  in that case, what you're saying is that group of kids where the parent is having, where there's medical needs for one student have to share that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=550.739s">But</a>  that other group of students, just because they happen to have none. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=555.141s">So,</a>  in my mind, I would rather say, hey, let's develop a policy where everybody kicks something in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=561.265s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=562.106s">Everybody</a>  would benefit if there was a nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=564.588s">Everybody</a>  would, I mean, I just think it's more equitable and I think it takes away the onus or the burden of a student feeling that they were costing their peers more.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=576.617s">Again,</a>  we can take guidance from you and you can tell us what you prefer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=579.879s">You</a>  know, I think that, you know, different field trips are going to cost different things anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=584.222s">The</a>  cost of Disney for the band is going to be one cost and the cost of Disney for the science trip is going to be another cost regardless. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=590.855s">But,</a>  you know, again, it's your call and, you know, whatever wisdom you want to have us follow, we will.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=598.222s">And</a>  so much is dependent on the students attending the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=601.465s">I</a>  mean, there are instances where students are very, especially at the high school level, are able to manage themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=609.071s">And</a>  we promote those self-responsibility and self-advocacy with parent and doctor permission.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=616.208s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=616.368s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=617.369s">Just</a>  for a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=618.43s">I</a>  agree with, you know, making sure that we have the protocol, but my concern is that as we're speaking tonight, it doesn't seem like anything is really concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=626.437s">So</a>  I don't want to just rush into this and put something on our website or have parents know about it if we're not a hundred percent sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=633.103s">The</a>  motion was for the superintendent to draft a policy that we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=636.606s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=636.847s">So</a>  that was my clarification there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=638.328s">And</a>  as far as I think for us to discuss tonight, how to figure this out, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=643.172s">is</a>  really, there's a lot going on because there are a lot of trips that go on and first of all, whoever is planning it at that moment in time does not have to go out and advertise that there's gonna be a child who's going to be a nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=657.616s">It's</a>  just like everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=658.896s">I</a>  mean, if there's a particular trip that this particular trip is now going to have three meals included, it's not dissected because this person here needs a little bit extra, this one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=670.199s">I</a>  think it's really up <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=672.323s">to</a>  the group that's planning it, they don't have to go out and advertise and say, well, gee, we're going to be paying $2,000 more because we need a nurse for X child because it's not fair.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=682.59s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=683.19s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=683.971s">But</a>  I just, the point of information is that we just had a field trip presented to us at our last meeting where this issue was brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=694.297s">And</a>  so, uh, one, maybe it was a general, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=699.107s">It</a>  was a general idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=701.129s">OK,</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=702.069s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=702.249s">I</a>  mean, again, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=704.231s">But</a>  I just, you know, the superintendent, I think that the motion is a good one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=708.554s">We've</a>  asked him to develop something. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=709.855s">I</a>  personally have feelings that I wish to express tonight and have done so.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=715.159s">No,</a>  and I just want to finish it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=717.581s">But</a>  that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=718.262s">I</a>  think it's a little bit more involved than just us sitting here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=722.085s">So</a>  I definitely agree with the superintendent doing that and making sure that we look at it.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=727.409s">Another</a>  factor is that <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=729.392s">We</a>  generally don't know the enrollment of the trip until we get pretty close to the event, because youngsters may change their mind, may not make the commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=739.895s">And</a>  depending on when the trip is coming and when the cutoff date is, it may be a month before, a couple of months before, whatever it is, or it may be six months before. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=748.897s">So</a>  we may not know who's on the trip until we actually put the final enrollment on it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=757.659s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=758.967s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=759.968s">I</a>  really, I have great respect and understanding of what you're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=764.153s">I</a>  just don't agree that that's the best way to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=769.439s">I</a>  understand you just really don't want to have any child singled out or <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=774.568s">one</a>  who's to have to pay more for one child, so that becomes an issue for some people to be able to attend or not attend, which I have great respect for. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=784.234s">But</a>  I think administratively, it's really difficult to administer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=788.996s">And</a>  I really believe that we should take it as it arises. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=793.019s">And</a>  if this trip has a child that increases the cost, then it affects that trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=798.622s">I</a>  don't want to make every trip more expensive so less people go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=802.324s">So</a>  I don't agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=804.004s">So</a>  I just wanted to put my opinion out to the superintendent as he's developing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=809.029s">I</a>  think that the way that he had planned is what I agree with.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=814.615s">So</a>  I think the important line is the ADA and the OCR make it clear for equal access. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=822.598s">So</a>  I would think the ownership is on Medford Public Schools to pay the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=827.882s">I</a>  don't think it should be on the one child who needs a nurse or all the kids going. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=830.784s">I</a>  think it's we can find the money to have a nurse on every trip that needs a nurse.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=838.509s">It's</a>  a choice you make when you budget as to which things you'll fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=842.572s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=843.613s">That's</a>  a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=845.114s">When</a>  you fund certain student activities and not others, you've made a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=848.917s">So</a>  this is a choice you can make. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=851.725s">It's</a>  in your court. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=852.666s">I</a>  mean, we'll do whatever we're asked to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=854.987s">We're</a>  just giving you the options that we think are the most practical. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=859.709s">And</a>  Mrs. Vandekoot's raised another one, and, you know, we can add that to the mix of possible alternatives.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=865.172s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=865.332s">Vandekoot?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=865.792s">I</a>  should hasten to add, though, that if my colleagues were in agreement, I agree 100% with you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=871.655s">Mistone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=872.455s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=872.916s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=873.476s">So,</a>  you know, I'm just going to throw one more thing out, if I can, you know, which is, you know, insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=879.399s">You</a>  know, we had this discussion last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=881.79s">You</a>  know, some people will take the insurance, and some people will not take the insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=887.772s">Individually,</a>  all of us have flown on an airplane, and sometimes we've taken insurance, and sometimes we've not taken insurance to cover the cost of a trip that might have to change because of circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=898.194s">So</a>  as another example, there are variables built into all of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=903.216s">Some</a>  trips, you know, individuals will ask for other things that others don't need.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=908.371s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=908.551s">And</a>  insurance is optional, but as a nurse of a child needs a nurse, that's not optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=912.633s">The</a>  child needs a nurse.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=913.874s">Well,</a>  again, mandatory in some cases, we've already made it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=918.176s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=919.737s">I</a>  would advise the superintendent to prepare a line item for the 2017, 2018 school budget to cover this in the future.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=929.563s">We</a>  can do that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=931.134s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor by Mr. Benedetto that the superintendent draft a policy in and out of state and it was seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=940.4s">Van</a>  der Kloot and also a line item by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=943.642s">On</a>  the motion for approval, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=946.084s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=946.624s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=947.985s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=948.725s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=954.156s">Motion</a>  to revert to the regular order of business we have before us community participation Miss Judy Lonigan of the Jingle Bell road race would like to discuss the funds raised and the funds to be distributed miss Lonigan And members of the Jingle Bell</p>

    <p>[Mn4KS2yu_8U_SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1001.875s">First</a>  of all, I want to say thank you to all of you who are here tonight, who participated in the road race. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1007.396s">And</a>  I'm here to collect your checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1010.156s">I</a>  want to introduce John Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1011.897s">John</a>  Murphy is president of the Members Plus Credit Union. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1015.878s">The</a>  first three races are Lonergan Insurance and Real Estate Agency sponsored it by ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1021.859s">And</a>  this year, Members Plus wanted to come on board with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1025.359s">So</a>  they have participated in the road race. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1034.103s">John</a>  is really here for the eye candy tonight, because he's going to hand out the checks, and I'm going to call the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1040.466s">Checks</a>  are the candy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1042.186s">Right,</a>  that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1046.908s">Oh,</a>  I have a list here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1048.609s">I</a>  mean, Elaine Rocha gave me a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1051.11s">When</a>  we started out, this is our fourth race. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1053.871s">When</a>  we first started out, we had about 160 runners, and we gave away $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1060.307s">And</a>  in four years, we had over 700 runners this year, and we're giving you $32,229.05. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1066.249s">This</a>  is really due to the hard work that all of you kids did with your parents, your coaches, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1083.456s">And</a>  I say to them all the time, we're giving you the fundraiser, it's up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1088.711s">to</a>  jump on board, sell the raffles, get the sponsors and get the runners. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1092.653s">The</a>  more that you make on your own, the more money you get out of the pot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1098.795s">I</a>  hate that word, but that's how it works is if somebody runs or walks or is a sponsor and does not designate that it's going to a certain team or a school, it goes into a common pot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1112.361s">And</a>  then from there, we break it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1114.242s">The</a>  more that the first year we did it, everyone got the same amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1117.598s">And</a>  we realized that one team raised $1,800 and one team raised $50, and they were all getting the same amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1124.385s">So</a>  now we do it on a proportional basis so that it's an incentive to you to raise more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1132.633s">Let</a>  me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1133.854s">Over</a>  the past four years, including this year, we will have given from this race over $82,000 to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1146.666s">My</a>  last official statement is that once your picture is taken, when you go outside afterwards, we'd like to have the whole group of all your kids in the school committee and the mayor and Mr. Bellson have a group picture so that we can put it in the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1160.957s">But</a>  after you're finished, if you would go outside the quality, um, Mr. Thurberge is going to take everyone's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1167.282s">So</a>  we have them for the newspapers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1168.723s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1170.024s">Pat's</a>  stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1176.316s">To</a>  expedite this as fast as we can, if you would, all of you that are here to collect checks, if you would kind of go over to the side, and then I'll call the clubs, and then rather than everybody get up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1187.831s">So</a>  if we all have an en masse, over to the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1193.303s">I</a>  have a t-shirt <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=1219.803s">Members</a>  of the Asian Club, Asian

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2267.08s">Yes,</a>  good evening, mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2271.403s">The</a>  financial report as reported for January 9th, 2017.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2276.868s">Can</a>  you speak up a little bit more? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2279.11s">Okay,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2280.471s">I'll</a>  take care of it.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2296.37s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2296.77s">So</a>  as provided in a summary status, uh, we have reported out again that our, uh, general fund operating budget for FY 17 is 54,333,000 of which to date we have spent approximately 46.93% checks, uh, since August 29th, the start of school for calendar year, all 12 month employees have received 14 paychecks since July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2324.055s">All</a>  major positions and replacements have been filled and efforts continue for onboarding district-wide floating substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2332.457s">As</a>  previously reported, many of our subaccounts are listed in the general fund without a budget appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2338.918s">Some</a>  of this is due to the Department of Ed's specific specified reporting by school, by function, category, and district-wide expenses as they continue to <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2350.441s">revisit</a>  that report and further expand their reporting criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2354.589s">We</a>  try to stay compliant with that as well as being able to monitor our budget in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2363.883s">I</a>  am also the school business officials participating in some roundtable efforts that will be reviewing some of these additional reports so that hopefully we will have a heads up on any changes that will be occurring in upcoming fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2377.951s">In</a>  general we have some conservative projections for encumbrances included in our large area expenditure categories which would include our natural gas, energy, electricity, transportation, special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2391.484s">Reflected</a>  in the summary are updates on some program areas of interest, including our online payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2398.686s">The</a>  FACTS product is our online payment plan for households that encourages online payments for the before and after school programs, our MEAP programs, our preschool, Make Way for Kids, and Kids Corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2414.37s">Currently</a>  Medford Public Schools has 441 active payment plans that are making ongoing payments with fiscal to date collections of $888,548 and the total anticipated collection for fiscal year 17 of $1,000,926,937 across all of our program areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2436.298s">We</a>  continue to look for cashless payment options to further streamline the process and make available systems for families and their tracking purposes.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2449.121s">Mr.</a>  Skerry, point of information.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2451.781s">Any</a>  progress made, Kristen, with getting the vocational school and the high school general store online? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2461.624s">that</a>  they can accept visa or master charge?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2463.985s">We</a>  have looked into that process, working with City Hall and the Treasury Department, because that would be an entirely new, different bank account system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2475.068s">And</a>  monitoring those charges, we are looking at that process moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2480.529s">So</a>  our hope is for fiscal year 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2482.39s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2485.533s">Are</a>  there any other questions?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2489.796s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2492.858s">Continuing</a>  on the overview, we have our building maintenance and repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2497.802s">The</a>  high school has sustained some extraordinary urgent repairs this winter due to pipe leaks and bursts that required some major plumbing with the underground lines within our A building. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2512.512s">Additional</a>  to those were routine maintenance and repairs during the course of the start of school, including at the high school, we had the nurses' suite painted, as well as stairwells, lecture halls, and corridors near the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2526.822s">Curtis</a>  Tufts, we had painted classrooms on upper level, floor refinishing, and recreation room. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2533.227s">At</a>  the McGlynn Middle and Elementaries, we had stairwells and common areas painted, as well as filter cartridges replaced in sinks and faucet repairs throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2543.958s">At</a>  the Columbus, Roberts, and Brooks Elementary, we had the library carpet shampooed and gym floors refinished. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2552.152s">Moving</a>  on to transportation, we have contracted 18 main bus routes with Eastern Bus Company. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2559.195s">We</a>  have routes running morning and afternoon, serving all of our public schools, as well as St. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2564.697s">Joseph</a>  Catholic, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2565.797s">Raphael,</a>  and St. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2567.318s">Clement's,</a>  as well as Minuteman Vocational. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2571.259s">And</a>  all of our routes continue to be reviewed for overcrowding, time efficiencies, and making the best and safe stops available for all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2582.183s">Homeless</a>  transportation continues to be an unknown expense going through any fiscal year as that group is not known on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2595.287s">So</a>  we have students that <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2598.148s">happen</a>  to have that situation throughout the year, so we continue to monitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2602.829s">We</a>  do receive reimbursements from the state, but those do not cover all the expenses typically in a fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2609.951s">So</a>  we continue to watch that as well as monitoring the Department of Ed's reimbursement, which approximately has been running about 60% on their homeless transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2624.528s">Our</a>  utilities, the invoices received as of this reporting date were through November. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2630.99s">Obviously,</a>  our more expensive heating months have not been incurred or materialized as of yet, but we have a comparison that we did from prior fiscal year, FY 15 and 16, and we did have our natural gas expense was $61,730 for that same time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2651.616s">currently</a>  we have $68,888. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2654.94s">So</a>  the amount of therms used was similar in quantity. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2660.006s">The</a>  cost was slightly elevated, roughly $7,158 over the prior year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2667.103s">Some</a>  increases would come from changes within a supply and distribution fees, and that is on an annual basis as energy is a commodity and those different costs are ever-changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2680.906s">Our</a>  electric charges from comparative year FY16, July through November. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2687.308s">was</a>  $468,562, and currently that same time frame was $468,012. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2694.329s">So</a>  we have been notified that the Great Eastern Electric Supply Agreement has been in effect starting January 1st, and both city and school departments will see a slight increase in per kilowatt fees, which is based on an energy <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2714.913s">compliance</a>  that they have implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2717.776s">So</a>  as invoices are paid, we will be reviewing and monitoring those line items, liquidating where we can, but being conservative in our estimate through the next few months, which typically are the highest heating months of a fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2735.944s">The</a>  next category we have covered is special education, and the FY17 out-of-district tuition is projected to be $3.4 million, which is slightly lower than budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2747.71s">However,</a>  this category is another volatile area, as statuses can change at any point during the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2755.034s">So</a>  we continue to monitor those and keep up to date as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2760.917s">The</a>  three components to the funding of the out-of-district tuition were <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2765.726s">$1.2</a>  million from the general fund appropriations, $1 million from the IDEA grant, and $1.2 million in circuit breaker reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2773.988s">So</a>  the overall, the special ed transportation is currently encumbered at $1,030,000, which is higher than budgeted at $950,000 across multiple vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2785.13s">However,</a>  this, again, is a volatile and unknown component. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2789.311s">So</a>  we continue to monitor those expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2791.532s">And</a>  as we can, we liquidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2793.308s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2793.929s">Point</a>  of information through you to Kristen.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2795.491s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2796.192s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2796.433s">The</a>  special ed transportation count roughly is $80,000 over budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2802.642s">Have</a>  there been any transfers made into that to cover the costs?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2807.19s">There</a>  have not been any transfers requested or made at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2810.734s">Again,</a>  we encumber based on what we anticipate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2813.898s">However,</a>  that may not materialize, so we could be liquidating orders. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2819.184s">So</a>  we haven't yet requested a formal budget transfer.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2823.249s">I</a>  just want to make sure there's enough money in that account to pay our vendors.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2826.152s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2833.022s">Yes,</a>  I think this actually is for the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2836.283s">As</a>  a school committee member, I was not aware that we had sustained urgent repairs due to pipe leaks at the high school and bursts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2844.605s">Was</a>  that over the holiday break or was that in December when we, on that one cold snap we had?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2852.827s">The</a>  A building area has had ongoing issues for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2858.212s">And</a>  we went in there to diagnostically try to fix a few things, and we found that every time we fixed something, it got a little worse and a little bit worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2866.676s">So</a>  we decided to go in there and really just do a good job and try to clean it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2870.959s">So,</a>  you know, it isn't a big urgency thing, but it's an expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2876.862s">It's</a>  the kind of thing we can fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2878.322s">It</a>  requires things, I think, going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2880.403s">It</a>  should be part of the capital plan thinking as we go, but it's definitely an item that <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2886.017s">you</a>  know, taking a few dollars out of our repair budget this year.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2889.92s">So</a>  at this point, is that area repaired?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2893.303s">Well,</a>  it's repaired at this point in time, but you know, I think we may spring another leap. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2897.426s">Who</a>  knows, as the winter season's coming, it's very hard to know, you know, whether that's going to happen, but we've repaired it to the point that we need to right now.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2905.172s">Has</a>  any section had to be closed down?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2908.455s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2911.805s">If</a>  I may follow up with that, just in terms of the phrasing, extraordinary repairs, that is a Department of Ed category classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2921.893s">So</a>  it's not necessarily something that was identified in your normal budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2926.417s">This</a>  was something that occurred that needed to be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2930.72s">So</a>  in that terminology, that's where I use that extraordinary repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2936.084s">Does</a>  that mean it's a $10,000 job? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2939.898s">could</a>  be higher than $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2941.019s">Extraordinary</a>  Maintenance has a cap of $150,000 per fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2945.321s">Where</a>  does it start? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2948.362s">Where</a>  does it start? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2949.343s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2949.623s">In</a>  terms of dollars?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2950.883s">Dollars.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2953.525s">Whatever's</a>  needed for the project.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2955.906s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just thinking what's a minor versus an extraordinary repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2959.868s">So</a>  that's what I was asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2962.769s">OK,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2964.27s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2964.85s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2965.751s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2969.223s">the</a>  piping, it says here that we had sustained extra repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2975.607s">So</a>  if we've already had them, how much do we spend on those repairs and how much more do we need to spend? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2981.091s">Let's</a>  be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2981.851s">Let's</a>  put the dollar amounts out here.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2983.973s">Well,</a>  I'm not sure, you know, everything has an exact dollar amount yet because there's still some work going on, but I think we're in excess of $25,000 at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2992.358s">And</a>  that how much more we have to spend will depend on what actually takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2996.509s">What</a>  I said a few moments ago, I think is accurate, is that we're now doing an assessment to determine, you know, how much of this needs to go into a full capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3004.752s">We</a>  think that a building is an area that probably is going to need a lot of attention because, I don't know if you know the piping structure, but you know the flooring is terrazzo tile? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3016.036s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3016.747s">You've</a>  got to go into the terrazzo tile and go down under into the tunnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3021.389s">That</a>  alone is an expense, and that alone is a major activity, and then go down and in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3028.112s">To</a>  replace that piping is almost like ripping up a straight Winthrop street, taking out the thing, and then putting a pipe in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3033.615s">So</a>  I think in the long run, going into the capital plan, we're going to want to replace those pipes, because I think they're going to keep happening from now on.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3042.259s">And</a>  you'll be providing us a report?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3044.723s">I</a>  think that's the way we're going to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3046.907s">I</a>  think we're making this as more of a capital look.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3049.211s">Do</a>  you have a time frame on providing us a report of future expenses regarding?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3053.778s">Well,</a>  I think the capital plan will start to roll out in the next couple of months.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3056.91s">Okay,</a>  and will there be any other expenses in the interim, other than the $25,000 we just spent? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3061.955s">Well,</a>  there could be.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3063.236s">There</a>  could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3063.697s">We're</a>  in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3064.858s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3065.338s">And</a>  on a given day, you could walk in and, you know, we could have another pipeline.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3068.661s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3068.941s">We</a>  did last year, for example, you remember up in B building, in the second floor, there were several pipes that broke. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3075.227s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3075.788s">This</a>  is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3076.829s">I</a>  mean, this is part of, you know, the cold winter and also <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3080.363s">part</a>  of the structure of that building where some of the stuff is a little bit older. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3084.485s">So</a>  part of our capital planning will be to look at these weak areas and try to strengthen them.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3090.647s">So</a>  just for clarification, if there is an item that costs a lot of money, if you could put the dollar amount in this report, like the piping, the unexpected piping was approximately $25,000 to repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3104.793s">That's</a>  just general information that I'd like it more detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3110.69s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3111.811s">Also,</a>  as we're talking about schools and maintenance, we had the pleasure of going to an event at the Andrews School, and we noticed that in their gymnasium, their bleachers were broken, and they look somewhat unsafe, and they don't pull them out because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3129.636s">And</a>  there were a few other issues in that building as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3132.037s">My</a>  colleague was with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3133.177s">Him</a>  and I walked through since we were there for a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3137.592s">There</a>  was some light out in one of the gyms, music room or something, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3144.575s">That</a>  had been recently replaced and they still can't seem to get it working and I'm sure we spent a lot of money on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3150.817s">So</a>  these are some maintenance items I'd like you to look at.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3154.839s">I'll</a>  refer that to Mr. DeLaver and get a report.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3156.879s">Also,</a>  while we're speaking to that, we did start our tours of the buildings and I would like to, at some point, continue those. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3164.382s">and</a>  make time in that a priority with budget time coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3168.083s">We</a>  need to see as a committee where we want to focus our maintenance funding, and having our eyes and walking the grounds really makes a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3176.325s">So</a>  I'm requesting that that continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3180.186s">And</a>  as far as, oh, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3182.667s">One</a>  of the classrooms, Roy, that faces the river, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3186.335s">They</a>  get the sun, and it's so bad in the afternoon that the teacher had to put up a temporary, yeah, a temporary top to be able to work off the blue board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3194.78s">They</a>  have a rounded window. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3196.382s">I</a>  wonder if we could get a shade for that window and figure out somehow how to cut the sun.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3199.684s">Which</a>  room is it, do you know?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3201.605s">It's</a>  on the third floor.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3202.906s">Someone</a>  with a nice window. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3204.207s">It's</a>  a circular window.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3206.844s">And</a>  the clock in the gymnasium hasn't worked for several months.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3210.025s">I</a>  think throughout the district, the clocks need to be synced at some point or somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3214.647s">Oh</a>  yeah, and the school board doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3217.969s">The</a>  school board doesn't work at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3220.51s">Just</a>  a few things that while we were there, we just happened to notice, and that's why it's important for us to continue that, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3227.993s">My</a>  other question regarding the budget was on page two of 13, under permanent part-time <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3235.977s">Medford</a>  High School mentors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3238.818s">We</a>  budgeted an appropriated $2,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3240.618s">The</a>  expenditures have been $34,663.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3246.579s">Yes,</a>  that's not an accurate statement of what the mentor expense is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3253.761s">We</a>  have identified some job codes through the payroll system that have not matched up to the actual general ledger codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3260.822s">So</a>  those will be corrected moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3263.383s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3264.998s">So</a>  there isn't, like, this job created that was spending all this money on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3268.922s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3269.002s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3270.243s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3271.764s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3273.906s">Also,</a>  you know, as staffing needs change, if there's any need, any additional staff <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3282.021s">added</a>  throughout the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3285.343s">I'd</a>  like a list of that in a report with the financial report on the quarterly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3290.926s">Just</a>  a list of new people added in their salaries and when they were added and the reasoning for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3297.89s">So</a>  that's a request to go along with this financial report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3301.232s">Now,</a>  I know this has nothing to do with our new director. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3305.535s">It's</a>  directly to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3308.777s">I</a>  requested and actually, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3312.788s">The</a>  whole school committee voted to have the community schools budget presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3319.072s">We</a>  haven't seen one in over seven months, maybe eight or nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3323.854s">I</a>  know I requested it, and it was supposed to be here today, and I know there have been a lot of changes both on the city side and the school side, so I have patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3332.58s">I'm</a>  trying to be patient, but I'm reminding you I'm expecting it soon, and when it comes,</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3338.719s">Well,</a>  so let me just answer it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3340.16s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3340.7s">Reconciliation</a>  at the City Hall has to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3343.662s">We</a>  don't have the full reconciliation yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3345.463s">I'm</a>  not going to give you a report that I don't have a reconciliation yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3348.305s">We</a>  think from our internal documents that we're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3352.367s">But</a>  until, what do you call it, the money is moved properly, you know, I can't give you a reconciliation against the city's chart of accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3359.171s">So,</a>  we'll do that, and if necessary, we'll provide you our report, you know, with a disclaimer at the end of it.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3366.055s">For</a>  the iSchools? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3368.071s">for</a>  basically all the revolving. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3370.012s">So</a>  we're currently in the audit process as well.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3385.943s">So</a>  this school committee requested it done on a quarterly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3389.087s">So</a>  what I would suggest in the future, and this is a suggestion, is that you provide the school part with that disclosure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3396.676s">And</a>  then when we get the state, so we're not waiting eight months before we get a quarterly report.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3402.023s">I</a>  think going forward it will be easier simply because we've got a new operation down the hall and up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3408.548s">Once</a>  that's cleaned up one time and set, then we can do that with more confidence going forward every quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3416.154s">Right</a>  now, you know, there's stuff that's still moving.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3418.963s">So</a>  the last time I requested it, we shot for January, and that was November, early November. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3424.867s">So</a>  could I have an approximate date so that way I follow up with you again?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3428.749s">When</a>  the auditors are done, I'll be happy to give you a date.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3430.751s">In</a>  the next few meetings?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3431.971s">As</a>  soon as the auditors are done, I'll be happy to give you a date.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3434.073s">OK,</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3435.153s">You</a>  want to see it roll over the account, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3436.734s">Were</a>  you waiting for her to roll it over?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3439.016s">That</a>  was one piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3440.297s">There</a>  were some additional pieces in terms of revenue.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3444.139s">Can</a>  you call me tomorrow and let me know? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3445.16s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3446.671s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3447.432s">Also,</a>  I just had one more question about the community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3451.737s">I</a>  just had a question, are all registrations going through the online programming that we have currently set up, similar to the after school program and all that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3462.812s">We're</a>  not collecting checks up in a hallway for people to use our building, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3467.014s">We're</a>  actually having people sign up online, and we're renting the facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3473.236s">Or</a>  they're registering, even if it's free or voluntary. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3477.398s">If</a>  they're using our building, they're doing the online registration, and we can track who's in and out of our building at all times, because that program was set up last July. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3486.762s">That's</a>  a question both to you and the superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3490.705s">So</a>  there are still some people who do not go online and give us checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3495.107s">I</a>  mean, they walk in the door and they want to go swimming, and they give us a check or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3499.189s">But</a>  for the most part, most people are using the online system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3503.551s">But</a>  there are some, as far as vendors go, they're using an online system with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3507.473s">But</a>  the reality is that some people still walk in the door and hand us a check.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3513.196s">No,</a>  no, I'm not even talking about the payment piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3515.638s">I</a>  want them to register, even if it's a contribution or it's a charity and we're letting them in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3522.802s">I</a>  want it so we can say at the end of the year, okay, these are how many hours of charity time we've given. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3529.781s">the</a>  McGlynn School Gym or the auditorium up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3534.565s">I</a>  want data and be able to ask you and say, OK, how much is the community using this school? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3540.549s">What</a>  are we doing with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3541.97s">How</a>  much are we making from it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3543.391s">How</a>  much money is going back to the maintenance and repair and upgrades or an after school program? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3548.515s">So</a>  we did it mostly to track who's in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3551.998s">And</a>  then it's for our own good, too, to know who's in there, because we're responsible for them while they're there.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3559.207s">If</a>  I may, so that's a two part answer in terms of identifying and streamlining the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3566.289s">We</a>  have an online calendar that is maintained by our community services and they document every activity that is happening and occurring within our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3577.251s">Subsequently,</a>  the entities are then invoiced and or they are active through the MCC payment online. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3585.172s">So</a>  there's two pieces to that response in that <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3588.537s">Yes,</a>  we are tracking it within a new system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3591.658s">The</a>  calendars are being updated as the service and the entities are requesting participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3599.342s">So</a>  it is key that all of that is documented so that we know on any given time when the pool is being used, when the different locations are being utilized so that there's not a double booking situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3615.057s">So</a>  those are taking place, and we are able to pull a report on a calendar basis and identify the charges, so forth.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3623.438s">So</a>  I'm really happy to hear that, and I encourage even community members that request to use the building and it's donated to them for that time, that it go through the system and we can put a zero payment, so that way we can track who we're donating to as well.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3638.681s">That's</a>  internal for the community schools, not through the user.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3641.462s">Right,</a>  no, and I understand that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3643.87s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3644.41s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3645.05s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3645.17s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3646.29s">I</a>  wanted to go back to the discussion about the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3649.531s">At</a>  the time we were doing the walkthroughs, Kathy Kreatz, my fellow school committee member and I, went to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3657.812s">And</a>  we submitted to the superintendent a list, including the bleachers, the clock, the things that you guys mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3665.974s">And</a>  also at that point, because I don't remember, I'd gone to some other schools too, some of those very same things, the bleachers, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3672.935s">were</a>  on multiple. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3673.936s">So</a>  I'm thinking that that's part of the capital plan, because that's when we already talked about some of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3683.043s">I</a>  think we sort of got to the point where we were going together, and then the superintendent said, because it was difficult to bring us all together, go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3690.909s">And</a>  Kathy and I just both happened to do that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3695.952s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3697.934s">OK,</a>  is there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3699.495s">Oh,</a>  Ms.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3699.835s">Preston.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3700.516s">I</a>  have just a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3703.008s">Christine,</a>  I just wanted to thank you for getting back to me about the bus and the overcrowding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3706.71s">Can</a>  you let me know, is it still, is there still a lot of overcrowding on bus 14 departing to high school in the afternoon?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3716.514s">What</a>  we have seen is on bad weather days that there seems to be an influx of students attempting to ride that bus that don't <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3725.965s">normally</a>  ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3727.946s">So</a>  we have worked with faculty to monitor that bus in the afternoons to ensure that it's just the routine riders that are getting on.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3737.991s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3738.351s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3739.212s">And</a>  also, we were looking, me and I were looking at this report, and on page 3, could you let us know what is the after school pupil transportation encumbrance, the 26,040? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3756.684s">What</a>  does that relate to? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3758.085s">We</a>  were just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3758.905s">I</a>  don't know if you know what that is.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3761.166s">So</a>  that would be some transportation costs that are associated with an open PO currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3767.788s">So</a>  I would need to take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3770.529s">It's</a>  a contract service account. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3772.49s">So</a>  it would be any type of additional transportation could be programming that they have ongoing, but the encumbrance for that would be through a purchase order.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3785.502s">Primarily,</a>  that's the middle school bus in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3790.363s">No,</a>  the two or three days that you've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3793.784s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3794.464s">The</a>  after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3795.564s">But</a>  then why is it not budgeted?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3798.605s">You</a>  encumber when you know what the amount is for the contract.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3801.785s">And</a>  then as you build, you take away from the encumbrance.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3805.386s">So</a>  if you look next month, that number should go down maybe $3,000 or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3811.327s">You</a>  encumber it through the end of the year because you have a contract in place for that bus.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3815.303s">you</a>  anticipate a cost, you put that amount in there to say that that money is pretty much committed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3821.787s">And</a>  as you pay it down, you liquidate the amount that's been paid out so that the encumbrance decreases. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3828.511s">But</a>  sometimes the liquidation is slower than the actual expenditure.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3832.714s">Expenditure</a>  comes mostly everything else under encumbrance zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3835.576s">If</a>  things don't get liquidated, all the other line items.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3838.698s">So</a>  why does this one, they set up a purchase?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3841.159s">The</a>  other lines are salary accounts and those hit <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3844.635s">based</a>  on actual payroll processing, and they're automatically charged up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3848.317s">This</a>  is actually a contract with Eastern Bus, and so the total between the expenditure and the encumbrance is close to the $40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3856.98s">So</a>  the bills arrive usually a month and a half in arrears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3862.162s">So</a>  at this point of reporting, it would have included up through the November billing cycle.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3870.245s">Motion</a>  to accept the report, place on file, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3874.669s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3875.249s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3876.51s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3876.711s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3877.792s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3878.732s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3879.893s">Also,</a>  just a quick note, it does look like it's getting very, um, really bad outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3884.197s">So</a>  I know there's some people in the audience that may travel some lengths to get home. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3888.42s">So</a>  if we could just try to exercise. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3891.443s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3892.104s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3897.675s">item</a>  out of order.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3898.696s">On</a>  the motion to take item number four report on school food service program out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3903.599s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3903.759s">Patterson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3904.36s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3907.542s">So</a>  again it was requested for a review and reports of the food service program for the upcoming year and any anticipation for <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3919.532s">meal</a>  price changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3921.413s">After</a>  we had conducted the review year-to-date and the district-wide fiscal expenses and revenues, we did identify that it is a very tight operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3933.922s">The</a>  food service program is specific, unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3937.244s">It</a>  falls under the federal guidelines by the USDA and the National School Lunch Program, also under CFR 7, Section 210. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3949.242s">With</a>  regard to this particular account, we really cannot operate anything but a positive balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3956.924s">So</a>  as we look and identify what we're currently charging for meals, what the pricing of the actual food costs, labor, just for example, our average meal cost for a breakfast without the labor is upward of $1.25 per meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3977.272s">We</a>  are charging $1.10 at all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3981.833s">For</a>  the lunch programs, as the food service and lunch preparation guidelines have changed, there are much more restrictive nutritional components that have to be met, ensuring that fruits and vegetables are offered every day, substantially increasing offerings of the whole grain foods, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4004.96s">only</a>  fat-free or low-fat milk varieties, limiting the calories and serving sizes, as well as reducing the amounts of saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium within all of the menu items. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4018.024s">So</a>  those do incur additional food costs in terms of what vendors are preparing, what they're charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4026.986s">We</a>  try to do bulk ordering and do cost savings where we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4033.365s">the</a>  drive continues to be escalated food costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4037.788s">An</a>  average lunch cost per meal is upward of $2.45, and currently we are charging $2.75 at elementary and $3 at the middle high. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4050.415s">Additionally,</a>  part of the requirements for the National School Lunch Program is <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4056.26s">a</a>  mandatory professional development and ongoing service training for all of the food service staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4064.785s">So</a>  no longer are we able to just send those folks home on a half day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4070.067s">They</a>  need to stay on site and have their own training, their own PD, which also is additional costs, but it's required. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4078.572s">It's</a>  a mandatory requirement under the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4083.357s">As</a>  of the December 2016 month and reporting, we did share a synopsis of our enrollment, which we had identified as 4,496 students with a free and reduced count of 2,103, averaging 46.77 district wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4095.822s">So</a>  again, included with the summary was the breakdown by each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4110.223s">and</a>  overall district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4111.784s">Now</a>  the importance of these figures not only for food service but also for e-rate reimbursement for all of the components that we're eligible for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4123.17s">So</a>  it really is important that we continue to educate our families and inform them of the services available and as they are utilizing those that are <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4133.949s">available</a>  through the state, they automatically become eligible for free lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4139.19s">And</a>  with that, we increase our enrollment, we increase our reimbursement, we increase the participation, which is a win-win for the school departments and for the families as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4152.653s">So</a>  currently the 2017 reimbursement rate for a free lunch that the federal government issues back is $3.24. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4161.843s">A</a>  reduced lunch is $2.84, and the state reimburses .06, the six-cent rule, for each meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4171.647s">For</a>  the breakfast, we do qualify for severe needs, so we get $2.04. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4174.728s">For</a>  the reduced breakfast, we get $1.74. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4176.628s">For</a>  the paid breakfast, we get .29 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4179.129s">So</a>  for the December <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4187.886s">2016</a>  claim, our gross amount for reimbursement was $77,753. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4194.352s">Now</a>  from that, the state will reduce any commodity invoices that they send out to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4200.678s">So</a>  each schools are eligible for getting commodity, meat items, different available items that the state provides a list for, and we're able to <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4212.347s">take</a>  advantage of it at the lowest cost possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4215.448s">And</a>  they will automatically dock our reimbursement claim. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4219.728s">So</a>  even though it looks as though we get just straight reimbursement, they do come back and they charge off for commodity invoices. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4228.53s">So</a>  in terms of our school lunch reimbursement program, those amounts have increased coming back to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4238.936s">The</a>  cost for paid students must at least mirror the federal guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4243.54s">So</a>  it is necessary and we're requesting to increase the prices for two reasons in fiscal year 18, which is to remain compliant and consistent with federal guidelines so that we don't jeopardize our reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4258.254s">And</a>  two, for the anticipated increase in food <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4262.017s">food</a>  costs and pending labor contract negotiation impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4266.68s">So</a>  it's also important to note that any changes affect the paid portion of our student population and the district will continue to educate and inform families at various opportunities that service plans are available that could qualify them for <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4284.482s">those</a>  free and reduced meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4286.082s">So</a>  that's one really important factor that we continue to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4291.784s">And</a>  I think it was important to provide this information early in the school year so that we have the discussion and it's identified that, you know, we're going to maintain the costs in this fiscal year, but we really do need to look at the changes for fiscal year 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4310.107s">And</a>  the recommendation that we have provided is <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4314.01s">for</a>  the breakfast opportunity of $1.50 per breakfast at each location. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4320.051s">For</a>  the elementary lunches, increasing that to $3 per meal, and at the middle and high to $3.25. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4327.213s">This</a>  will get us closer in line with our reimbursement rate, and it will also provide new opportunities to engage and have potentials for some hot meal options at the breakfast <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4340.89s">and</a>  getting, uh, taking advantage of additional resources as, as we're able to serve more meals.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4348.057s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4348.918s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4349.418s">Thank</a>  you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4350.239s">It's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4351.52s">Um,</a>  so if we didn't raise our prices, would we still meet the minimum?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4358.807s">We</a>  will be operating very close to a breakeven scenario and that's without any <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4366.705s">labor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4367.605s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4369.326s">My</a>  only question reason for that question is I know that we're regulated to charge a certain amount and bring in a certain amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4377.25s">And</a>  that's why I asked for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4379.151s">But</a>  also I checked online. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4382.573s">I</a>  saw the pricing and I really like that you kept it only 25 cents for breakfast increase 25 cents for lunch and 25 cents for the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4391.577s">Like</a>  just just 25 cents increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4393.878s">It's</a>  not a huge amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4395.501s">and</a>  it's not three years from now and we're way behind and we have to raise it $2 a meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4402.066s">But</a>  I did look on a few of our neighboring communities and how much they're charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4408.511s">So</a>  Malden currently is charging $1 for breakfast, $2.55 for lunch and $2.78 for the middle high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4417.639s">Somerville</a>  has all free breakfast throughout their community and they charge $2.75 for lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4424.553s">Everett</a>  is now, there's two prices for breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4428.634s">It's</a>  either 125, I think, for the very young grades, and then 150 for the rest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4434.155s">They're</a>  currently at 275 for lunch, same as us, and $3. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4439.816s">So</a>  they're exactly where we are right now, and we're in line with a neighboring. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4446.777s">Some</a>  of them, these are their prices for next year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4449.717s">It's</a>  on their websites. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4451.298s">I</a>  did a quick query. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4453.755s">this</a>  afternoon to just really compare where we are and where not. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4459.458s">You</a>  know, it's always really difficult to raise prices on families because every day when you're packing up $3 for lunch and an extra buck 50 for breakfast, it's a lot to pull out of your wallet every morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4470.565s">And</a>  I'm very cautious about doing this, but I want to make sure that, you know, we stay within the federal guidelines and get as much money back to the community to feed all of our students in an appropriate, and we're required to do that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4484.152s">So,</a>  you know, it's a hard call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4486.673s">I</a>  mean, $0.25, I think, is very reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4490.094s">But</a>  at the same time, it's always difficult to raise this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4493.635s">I</a>  don't think it is.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4494.656s">So</a>  there are a couple of things we've just got to keep in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4497.637s">First</a>  of all, we have to stay compliant with the fact the federal government will give us a certain amount of money per student on free and reduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4506.359s">If</a>  we ask our paid students to pay less, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4508.908s">federal</a>  government's comeback is that we are subsidizing students who are not eligible for a free or reduced meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4516.051s">So</a>  we have to at least meet that in order to stay in compliance, because otherwise the government's saying, well, we're paying you for students who can afford to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4524.455s">That's</a>  one piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4525.316s">The</a>  second piece that we've got to keep in mind is that the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4529.618s">Department</a>  of Agriculture has got a new administration in Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4535.045s">Recent</a>  signals are they're looking to make cuts in agencies like USDA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4539.486s">If</a>  they're making cuts in USDA, that could reduce the subsidies coming back to states, could reduce the commodities and the like, and we could get through the back door for less availabilities to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4551.45s">So</a>  we've got to keep that in mind too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4553.27s">And</a>  three, we are in the process, we've had some discussions about negotiating with our cafeteria workers and what we've planned for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4563.763s">modest</a>  as it is, will impact this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4566.884s">And</a>  if we don't plan for that, we will drive our program off the, you know, off the balance sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4572.525s">So</a>  there's several things going on and you know, no one likes to see price increases, but on the other hand, we're trying to be realistic.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4579.527s">And,</a>  um, the reason I requested it specifically is cause we don't want to pit people very hard, like with a large increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4586.789s">And</a>  that's what happened a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4588.93s">when</a>  we hadn't been addressed in a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4592.332s">And</a>  I'd rather see a consistent review of this program to make sure we're in compliance and to make sure that we're not hitting people's pockets too deeply. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4602.179s">I</a>  mean, no matter what you do, I mean, 50 cents a day is still 250 a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4608.404s">And</a>  if you have multiple children, it's expensive and it's just not easy today to keep up with everything.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4619.098s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to, I think the breakfast actually would be going up 40 cents per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4624.662s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4625.222s">Is</a>  it $1.10 to $1.50? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4627.804s">So</a>  $2 a week times how many weeks are there in a school year?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4631.427s">30,</a>  36, 36 times five is 180 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4635.189s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4636.87s">So</a>  30, 40 weeks, general 36, you know, times two bucks, 72 bucks in the year just for the breakfast increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4644.116s">So</a>  it's certainly with multiple kids adds up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4646.612s">if</a>  your student is having breakfast at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4651.255s">I</a>  think at this point, it's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4654.358s">You're</a>  not asking us to take any action tonight, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4656.94s">You</a>  can if you want.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4660.382s">I</a>  mean, we're not against you taking action tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4662.123s">We</a>  think it's real. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4663.624s">But</a>  if you need more time to think about it.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4665.186s">Do</a>  you want to lay it on the table? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4667.429s">If</a>  I may follow up with just a little more data, in terms of the breakfast participation, it is half of what our lunch program is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4675.335s">So</a>  our families are not taking advantage of the breakfast program as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4680.76s">It</a>  would be a great opportunity to encourage that so that we could offer some hot meal options and really engage in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4691.308s">Additionally,</a>  with the SUP program, the Community Eligibility Program, which our <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4697.531s">community</a>  towns that are able to take advantage of that, that is upwards of over 70% low-income, free and reduced capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4707.053s">So</a>  where it seems beneficial, it's almost a double-edged sword because you really have a true significant disadvantaged group where it's beneficial for all in one capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4723.557s">However,</a>  there's a lot to get to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4727.102s">My</a>  hope is to continue to encourage and educate families on the services that are out there available, whereby it automatically qualifies them for a free lunch, and there's not the need to fill out an additional application. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4742.711s">So</a>  that is my push as school nutrition advisor over the food service department, and that's something that I advocate, and I'm very strong about feeding our kids.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4756.822s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4799.27s">We</a>  can certainly do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4800.411s">I</a>  mean, you know, I think it's, it's always informative to learn about all the things going on, but from a financial standpoint, this report was developed in conjunction with them.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5197.321s">So</a>  the parent, I can put the telephone number on this definitely.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5200.644s">I</a>  think that would help.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5210.669s">There</a>  is a letter that goes with this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5212.79s">I'll</a>  make sure it's on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5214.37s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5331.154s">Good</a>  point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5331.755s">Mr.</a>  Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5332.756s">Well,</a>  how did they agree with you? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5335.678s">There's</a>  a motion to receive the committee report during that committee, the whole second seconded by all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5345.946s">All</a>  those opposed.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5436.483s">Is</a>  the motion to accept the report and place it on file?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5456.783s">Just</a>  to give you a little quick update on this because the governor will be speaking tomorrow night And there will be releases of the state budget His proposed budget and then the process will begin and so just to keep you informed as to what goes on because this is a <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5472.96s">What</a>  happens at the state level obviously impacts us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5476.501s">So</a>  the governor is going to be speaking tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5481.083s">Somewhere</a>  in the next little while, you will get some more details on that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5488.365s">But</a>  on January 13th, the Senate, the House, and the governor agreed on a revenue distribution, which is 3.9%, or approximately $1.02 billion more into next year from <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5503.163s">taxation</a>  and other revenues from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5507.287s">This</a>  is what we call a consensus budget guideline to help them produce budgets in each chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5514.813s">The</a>  thing you have to understand is that you can project 3.9% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5520.077s">Last</a>  year they projected 4.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5522.82s">But</a>  to get to that number, they probably have to increase the revenue by even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5527.444s">And</a>  we'll guess that to about 5.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5530.906s">something</a>  along that kind of line, because there are tax cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5534.249s">There</a>  are other things that are one-time revenues that we used that won't be used again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5539.913s">So</a>  even though they project that, they're now going to have to resolve what they've lost from revenue from the previous year or what they will lose with programs that maybe need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5550.582s">So</a>  in our budget, for example, as salaries go up, you know, that factors into the increase in what we need to come up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5560.215s">It's</a>  not just revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5561.136s">So</a>  there are at least six major factors you need to pay attention to going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5565.76s">One</a>  is how much money the FY 2017 budget was dependent upon as temporary and one-time revenues that won't be available in fiscal 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5573.966s">How</a>  much temporary money did they use? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5577.429s">Two,</a>  what accounts were underfunded in 2017? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5580.831s">Things</a>  that they short-funded and they have to provide a supplemental to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5585.915s">And</a>  they may need more money in 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5588.967s">What</a>  is the actual cost of providing current service levels in fiscal 18? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5594.151s">Not</a>  more, current service levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5597.253s">What</a>  will be the actual growth in revenues for fiscal 2018? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5599.914s">Will</a>  there be new sources of sustainable revenue, not just one-time revenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5604.678s">You</a>  know, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5607.724s">And</a>  if marijuana or other things like that were out there, there's money coming in, there's gambling issues, there's things like that that may generate hotel revenues, meal tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5615.731s">As</a>  things come in, we have to watch all of that stuff to see exactly what goes into the state coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5621.916s">What</a>  new initiatives, projects will be approved? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5625.219s">They</a>  want to do something they've never done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5628.041s">All</a>  of a sudden, that's a new program that has to be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5630.583s">Or</a>  maybe it won't be funded, and it'll be sent down to us to fund, placing new demands on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5636.777s">What</a>  previously funded items will be dropped or diminished? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5642.183s">What</a>  will be the impact of a new administration in Washington? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5645.987s">What</a>  states will gain or lose resource or policy changes? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5649.071s">Medicaid,</a>  Medicare. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5651.278s">the</a>  way it's funded, the way it's done, health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5654.559s">All</a>  these things are going to have to be phased in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5656.88s">The</a>  governor's already talking about making some serious changes in health care, you were probably there, which could alter it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5662.522s">The</a>  GIC numbers are coming to us now, and they're looking for more deductibles and other factors, premium increases that will affect teachers and possibly affect, and other employees, and possibly affect what we have to budget for our percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5678.542s">So</a>  all those things have to come into from a state budget, so we're looking at this stuff now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5683.083s">It'll</a>  be at the center of our concerns, but any adverse state effect on the municipal budget as well, things that affect the municipal side of the budget, has an impact on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5694.447s">The</a>  mayor's got one whole budget to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5698.348s">We</a>  want what we want, he's gonna look at the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5701.832s">And</a>  that could be something that impacts us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5705.213s">Chapter</a>  70 allocations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5707.174s">The</a>  governor was talking about $95 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5710.915s">He</a>  thinks that's new money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5712.895s">That,</a>  to us, is no new money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5715.216s">That's</a>  like $20. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5716.136s">Last</a>  year, we got $55. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5718.477s">And</a>  it's well below what the foundation-level budget review committees were proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5722.798s">So</a>  that's not doing us much good unless it gets better on the foundation level. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5728.059s">We</a>  are a hold-harmless district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5731.29s">Because</a>  of where we are, we're going to get a certain amount of money that we got last year, plus minimum aid, which could be anywhere from $20 to $55. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5739.816s">That's</a>  the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5742.257s">There</a>  may be some other pockets, but, for example, last year, you know, you were concerned about the kindergarten money not coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5750.186s">Other</a>  things that may not come in, other budgets that could get sliced, we have to pay attention to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5754.129s">The</a>  sped circuit breaker is now being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5757.03s">There's</a>  a legislative briefing on February 2nd or 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5760.313s">I</a>  forget which date it is exactly right now that I'll attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5763.334s">I'm</a>  part of that coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5765.296s">We</a>  typically get 75% above the threshold of four times foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5769.819s">But</a>  four times foundation goes up every year, so that means our eligibility gets shortchanged a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5776.023s">If</a>  they don't give us 75%, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5778.817s">That</a>  affects what we can put into the pie for special needs, extraordinary tuitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5784.4s">So</a>  all those things are, you know, part of our calculus. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5788.142s">Charter</a>  school reimbursements have been underfunded for a number of years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5792.705s">They</a>  didn't increase last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5794.566s">There</a>  won't be any major increase in the number of charter schools, but there will be some more charter schools because the state board is going to be discussing them in the next couple of weeks at their board meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5804.651s">And</a>  the more you have, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5806.671s">The</a>  more pupils that you have statewide, the more the distribution takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5810.753s">And</a>  if you only have the same pot of money, it gets spread out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5814.474s">So</a>  we'll have to see where that takes that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5816.035s">We</a>  brought youngsters back to Medford last year, and we paid more. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5821.598s">So</a>  it's a tricky formula. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5823.398s">It's</a>  got to be what? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5824.259s">Out-of-district</a>  transportation costs for non-resident students to Minutemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5830.4s">The</a>  reimbursement level came down again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5833.302s">Hopefully</a>  it'll be sustained, but if that gets knocked out of the budget, it could be $20,000, $30,000 out of our pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5838.966s">Homeless</a>  funding has always been underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5842.188s">The</a>  various grant programs, including early childhood, kindergarten, academic support, vocational education, and substance abuse prevention, the new opiate bill, it's not funded as far as I can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5852.335s">I</a>  don't know who's funding that, but we all have responsibilities on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5856.778s">And</a>  will there be any new mandated programs that emerge from legislative deliberations? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5862.459s">So</a>  this is a snapshot of some of the challenges ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5866.64s">I</a>  want you to be aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5869.361s">We</a>  don't know, you know, all the facts right now, but this is the stuff that we'll process every week, every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5875.322s">I</a>  get newsletters and materials, speak to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5878.863s">It's</a>  the kind of stuff I have to do on a regular basis to see what's likely to happen or not likely to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5884.761s">superintendents,</a>  teachers, unions, all kinds of people will be in there lobbying to keep money at a certain level or to get more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5892.782s">But</a>  they'll all be clashing with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5895.323s">And</a>  the hard question is, is that what can happen that's new if the revenue growth is only at a certain level and one time revenues are either not available. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5906.385s">We</a>  always hear about the rainy day fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5907.925s">No</a>  one likes to dip into that unless they absolutely have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5911.286s">Um,</a>  we don't know what capital gains will do for, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5914.367s">you</a>  know, revenue into the city, I mean into state rather, all that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5917.691s">And</a>  we also don't know what Washington will change in the next year and what it might affect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5923.237s">Although</a>  I think they're on a one year delay, it doesn't seem much change in some things through this year, but the year after it could have some impact on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5932.98s">So</a>  there's a lot of factors for us to pay attention to, but I want to get you in the water and start you talking about it as we move forward.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5939.562s">The</a>  numbers should start to circulate out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5941.363s">We're</a>  expecting the cherry shoots, possibly midweek, and that kind of spells out the governor's idea of what we'll be getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5947.305s">And</a>  then we wait for the house ways and means, really, is what we use for the budget to set our budget numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5952.867s">So</a>  they'll all be coming in stride.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5956.322s">And</a>  there are other funds, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5957.483s">Now,</a>  we've talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5958.424s">There</a>  are funds that come from special sources, bond bills and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5962.126s">So,</a>  for example, in our vocational, you've seen money come to us from certain grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5966.37s">Some</a>  of those things are independent of this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5969.132s">Some</a>  of the things will be dependent on this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5971.594s">So...</a>  Very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5972.654s">Thank</a>  you for the report.</p>
