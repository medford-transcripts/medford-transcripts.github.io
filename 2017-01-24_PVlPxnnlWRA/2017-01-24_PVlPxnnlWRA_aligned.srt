1
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:12,297
which is there for all students.

2
00:00:12,777 --> 00:00:20,102
So if there was a situation that any of the students experienced, she would be the resource for all of the students.

3
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:23,164
Um, not just that one.

4
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:23,784
Okay.

5
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:38,593
Because I know that when the BN director was here last week or two weeks ago, uh, she was saying that the rules have changed and it's very delicate because if it's the teacher who's giving out, let's say the medication, even though,

6
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:43,460
In this, it says that it's almost approved that a teacher could give out the medication.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,981
I'll clarify this.

8
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:55,168
We have a certificate from the Department of Public Health that nurses can train teachers to, we delegate the medication administration.

9
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:59,591
At the high school level, most students are able to self-administer.

10
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:06,715
So we back up the delegation certification with a doctor's order and a parent consent saying,

11
00:01:07,028 --> 00:01:10,269
that student is mature enough to self-administer a medication.

12
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:17,071
So it's sort of a two-fold protection that we use in those instances.

13
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:26,513
Where we get concerned is who holds on to the medication, because we all know that there can be issues with that.

14
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:33,895
Another piece to that is that by contract, teachers may decline to administer certain medications.

15
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:37,374
So they don't have to accept that responsibility if they don't want to.

16
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,537
And there are certain medications that they cannot administer by law.

17
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:45,821
And that would be insulin is one of the best examples of that.

18
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:55,691
And I guess the other concern for me would be is that I know that one of the options you had stated was that you could have a nurse contracted from where you're going.

19
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:56,011
Right.

20
00:01:56,497 --> 00:02:10,809
But the thing is if you're talking about let's say we've had students that have gone across to Europe and they're taking different flights, it doesn't mean necessarily that the nurse will be with them from when they leave here until they get to where their destination is.

21
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:18,215
So that's something I think that we also need to take in consideration and make sure that we do have coverage when we're thinking about this.

22
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:23,800
And the international flights pose an even more restrictive circumstance because

23
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:27,872
Nobody from the United States can practice out of the country.

24
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:32,954
So we cannot send anybody on one of those trips.

25
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:38,656
So then could I just ask, I know that you are still in the middle of trying to get all the information for us.

26
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:48,280
If we could find out from other districts how they're doing it, because I mean, they're sending their students away, not away, but they're going on their trips.

27
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,362
And I have reached out to my Northeast regional consultant.

28
00:02:53,718 --> 00:03:00,502
We'll see what information we gather from all the school systems that are in our northeast region for Department of Public Health.

29
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:03,063
And this is something that's changing now, right?

30
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:06,425
We didn't have this implemented years ago or even up until last year.

31
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:10,507
And student need, I think that really speaks to student need that has changed.

32
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:20,912
Because in years past, you know, many parents decided not to send their children on those type of field trips if they had a health care issue.

33
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:26,569
But now, you know, more and more students are able to go and parents want them to go.

34
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:36,231
And I guess my last question is that if there is a child who does need special services, let's say the parent turns around and says that they want to be the chaperone.

35
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:39,872
By all means, the parent can be the chaperone for the student.

36
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:41,613
And then we wouldn't have to worry about the nurse?

37
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:42,093
Exactly.

38
00:03:44,666 --> 00:04:05,937
I'd like to make a motion at this point to have the superintendent do a policy and protocol and outline this so that way we have one on for the whole district K through 12 for both out-of-state and in-state travel

39
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:11,107
that extends over the school day, like if it's an overnight trip.

40
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,267
Because we also have to think about in-state.

41
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:18,069
So this is a major issue, and I really believe that it needs your time and attention.

42
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:25,452
So I just would like to make that motion that you provide the school committee with the detailed policy procedure and protocol.

43
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,773
May I add something here?

44
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:36,377
Last year at the high school, we set up a task force that looked at and actually edited a lot of our field trip forms and the procedure for that.

45
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:52,475
And it really revolves a lot around communication so that the nurse's office is aware of the list of students going, they can review the list, and they can get all the proper medical forms into, you know, all organized.

46
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:59,280
And that has worked well this year at the high school in making sure that we're meeting the needs of our students.

47
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:05,264
And similar processes are followed at the elementary and middle school level.

48
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,880
That's why we need it in writing district-wide.

49
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,321
We need it on our website, so if there's any question, that parents can look at it, and even teachers can look at it.

50
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:22,443
If they're planning an event or travel with our students, that they can check the policy procedures and guidelines that they need to follow in here too.

51
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:27,024
And I also think then we're very clear, who are the decision makers?

52
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:30,304
Who actually decides whether a nurse is necessary or not?

53
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:31,444
Is it the teacher?

54
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:32,345
Is it the principal?

55
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:33,785
Is it the nurse at that building?

56
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:34,785
Or is it the head nurse?

57
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:36,019
throughout the district.

58
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,384
It tends to be a combination of a lot of team members.

59
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:42,287
A lot of people don't know that and that's why we need this.

60
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:45,251
So I'm looking for one of my colleagues to second my motion.

61
00:05:50,550 --> 00:06:06,161
Yes, I would urge the superintendent as he considers this not to choose the third option all students proportionately share in the cost which was what was originally presented to us last week in reference to when the band trip.

62
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:16,248
To me it just felt like that by doing it that way it could make students feel like their trip was more expensive because one of their

63
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:19,030
fellow students needed a nurse.

64
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:32,860
Instead I think that it would be much better for either us for us to decide that on whatever field trip there was a uniform every student puts 25 bucks into the kitty or whatever I mean just so that it was a uniform

65
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:50,747
a cost to help offset the district's cost because option number one is the school system pays for the cost outright and that of course would be my choice but I'm also understanding that it is there's an expense and it could so by having some

66
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:54,951
amount of money, but it would be uniform.

67
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:58,815
So it wouldn't be for just one field trip or the other would be across the board.

68
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:04,723
Every time there's a field trip, every student would have as part of the cost, a small charge.

69
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:08,490
The only thing I would say is field trips differ in length and time.

70
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:14,614
So if you had a person for an entire week, the cost would be much more extensive than if it were for two days.

71
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:20,058
If the person had some severe issues, the cost of other things might be more substantial.

72
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:26,222
So the idea of having the kitty, if you would, would be so that money would be thrown into that.

73
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:29,864
to help offset the costs.

74
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:36,649
And it would be proportionate to, let's say it's a, if a, you know, $5 a day or something like that.

75
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,291
I'm just speaking off the top of my head.

76
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:43,535
So if it was a five-day field trip to Florida, the kids might put in 25 bucks.

77
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:51,241
You know, I mean, I just, I think that you do, there's going to be a recognition that you're paying for something.

78
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:52,742
And quite frankly,

79
00:07:53,846 --> 00:08:03,754
if you don't have some kind of distributive cost sharing, you're going to have to start denying certain field trips, because you have 10, 15 field trips, and you're going to be paying $2,000 for every one of those.

80
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:08,637
You're going to have a budget line item that you're going to have to fund, or you may have to fund.

81
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:09,538
Right.

82
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:10,859
So exactly.

83
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:14,442
I'm recognizing that, and I'm also proposing a way to help offset it.

84
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:18,165
And I certainly think that we're smart enough to come up with a way to do that.

85
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:20,955
Well, you know, I take your guidance on, you know, as a group.

86
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:30,507
You know, I personally don't think the third one is a bad one, but that's my opinion, because I think that, you know, the cost of a field trip, you never know when someone's going to need medical help.

87
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:32,089
It could be anybody at any given time.

88
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:36,875
And if you're paying for a professional nurse to accompany a field trip,

89
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:40,608
then her services would be available to all, not just to Ronnie.

90
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:44,088
That's a personal opinion, but certainly the committee can make that decision in all honor.

91
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:52,490
If I could follow up, are you saying that if there's a field trip, let's suppose we're having two field trips as we are this year going to, or next year, Disney.

92
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:59,572
So on one there's a student who has medical needs and needs a nurse, but on the other one there are no students.

93
00:09:00,432 --> 00:09:10,438
So, in that case, what you're saying is that group of kids where the parent is having, where there's medical needs for one student have to share that cost.

94
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:14,741
But that other group of students, just because they happen to have none.

95
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:20,545
So, in my mind, I would rather say, hey, let's develop a policy where everybody kicks something in.

96
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:21,605
Okay?

97
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:24,007
Everybody would benefit if there was a nurse.

98
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:33,915
Everybody would, I mean, I just think it's more equitable and I think it takes away the onus or the burden of a student feeling that they were costing their peers more.

99
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,739
Again, we can take guidance from you and you can tell us what you prefer.

100
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,202
You know, I think that, you know, different field trips are going to cost different things anyway.

101
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:50,267
The cost of Disney for the band is going to be one cost and the cost of Disney for the science trip is going to be another cost regardless.

102
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:58,102
But, you know, again, it's your call and, you know, whatever wisdom you want to have us follow, we will.

103
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,264
And so much is dependent on the students attending the trip.

104
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:07,750
I mean, there are instances where students are very, especially at the high school level, are able to manage themselves.

105
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:15,317
And we promote those self-responsibility and self-advocacy with parent and doctor permission.

106
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:16,328
Ms.

107
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:16,728
Cuneo.

108
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:18,410
Just for a couple of things.

109
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:26,357
I agree with, you know, making sure that we have the protocol, but my concern is that as we're speaking tonight, it doesn't seem like anything is really concrete.

110
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:33,083
So I don't want to just rush into this and put something on our website or have parents know about it if we're not a hundred percent sure.

111
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:36,486
The motion was for the superintendent to draft a policy that we could.

112
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:36,807
Okay.

113
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:38,268
So that was my clarification there.

114
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:42,612
And as far as I think for us to discuss tonight, how to figure this out,

115
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:57,196
is really, there's a lot going on because there are a lot of trips that go on and first of all, whoever is planning it at that moment in time does not have to go out and advertise that there's gonna be a child who's going to be a nurse.

116
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,836
It's just like everything else.

117
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:10,159
I mean, if there's a particular trip that this particular trip is now going to have three meals included, it's not dissected because this person here needs a little bit extra, this one here.

118
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,279
I think it's really up

119
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:22,570
to the group that's planning it, they don't have to go out and advertise and say, well, gee, we're going to be paying $2,000 more because we need a nurse for X child because it's not fair.

120
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,170
Point of information.

121
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,930
Point of information.

122
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:33,677
But I just, the point of information is that we just had a field trip presented to us at our last meeting where this issue was brought up.

123
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:38,540
And so, uh, one, maybe it was a general,

124
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:41,049
It was a general idea.

125
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:41,789
OK, I don't know.

126
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,209
Yes.

127
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:43,771
I mean, again, I don't know.

128
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:48,514
But I just, you know, the superintendent, I think that the motion is a good one.

129
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:49,815
We've asked him to develop something.

130
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:54,519
I personally have feelings that I wish to express tonight and have done so.

131
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,061
No, and I just want to finish it off.

132
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,242
But that's what I'm saying.

133
00:11:58,262 --> 00:12:02,025
I think it's a little bit more involved than just us sitting here tonight.

134
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:06,868
So I definitely agree with the superintendent doing that and making sure that we look at it.

135
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:08,850
Another factor is that

136
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:19,254
We generally don't know the enrollment of the trip until we get pretty close to the event, because youngsters may change their mind, may not make the commitment.

137
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:28,837
And depending on when the trip is coming and when the cutoff date is, it may be a month before, a couple of months before, whatever it is, or it may be six months before.

138
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:37,639
So we may not know who's on the trip until we actually put the final enrollment on it.

139
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,299
Mr. Benedetto.

140
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,347
Thank you.

141
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:44,133
I really, I have great respect and understanding of what you're trying to do.

142
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:48,117
I just don't agree that that's the best way to move forward.

143
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:53,984
I understand you just really don't want to have any child singled out or

144
00:12:54,568 --> 00:13:03,894
one who's to have to pay more for one child, so that becomes an issue for some people to be able to attend or not attend, which I have great respect for.

145
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:08,516
But I think administratively, it's really difficult to administer.

146
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,539
And I really believe that we should take it as it arises.

147
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:18,182
And if this trip has a child that increases the cost, then it affects that trip.

148
00:13:18,622 --> 00:13:21,944
I don't want to make every trip more expensive so less people go.

149
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:23,425
So I don't agree.

150
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:28,609
So I just wanted to put my opinion out to the superintendent as he's developing this.

151
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:33,614
I think that the way that he had planned is what I agree with.

152
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:42,162
So I think the important line is the ADA and the OCR make it clear for equal access.

153
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:47,441
So I would think the ownership is on Medford Public Schools to pay the bill.

154
00:13:47,882 --> 00:13:50,744
I don't think it should be on the one child who needs a nurse or all the kids going.

155
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:54,627
I think it's we can find the money to have a nurse on every trip that needs a nurse.

156
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,532
It's a choice you make when you budget as to which things you'll fund.

157
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:03,593
Right.

158
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:04,874
That's a priority.

159
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:08,536
When you fund certain student activities and not others, you've made a choice.

160
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,598
So this is a choice you can make.

161
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,445
It's in your court.

162
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,466
I mean, we'll do whatever we're asked to do.

163
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,789
We're just giving you the options that we think are the most practical.

164
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:24,812
And Mrs. Vandekoot's raised another one, and, you know, we can add that to the mix of possible alternatives.

165
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:25,292
Ms.

166
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:25,732
Vandekoot?

167
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:31,615
I should hasten to add, though, that if my colleagues were in agreement, I agree 100% with you, Ms.

168
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:31,995
Mistone.

169
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:32,716
Great.

170
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:33,316
Thank you.

171
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:38,779
So, you know, I'm just going to throw one more thing out, if I can, you know, which is, you know, insurance.

172
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,200
You know, we had this discussion last year.

173
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,491
You know, some people will take the insurance, and some people will not take the insurance.

174
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:57,674
Individually, all of us have flown on an airplane, and sometimes we've taken insurance, and sometimes we've not taken insurance to cover the cost of a trip that might have to change because of circumstances.

175
00:14:58,194 --> 00:15:02,155
So as another example, there are variables built into all of these things.

176
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:07,637
Some trips, you know, individuals will ask for other things that others don't need.

177
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:08,531
Right.

178
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:12,473
And insurance is optional, but as a nurse of a child needs a nurse, that's not optional.

179
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:13,474
The child needs a nurse.

180
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:17,896
Well, again, mandatory in some cases, we've already made it.

181
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:19,097
Mr. Scary.

182
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:28,342
I would advise the superintendent to prepare a line item for the 2017, 2018 school budget to cover this in the future.

183
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:30,123
We can do that.

184
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:40,380
There's a motion on the floor by Mr. Benedetto that the superintendent draft a policy in and out of state and it was seconded by Ms.

185
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,242
Van de Kloot and also a line item by Mr. Scarry.

186
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,683
On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

187
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:46,184
Aye.

188
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:47,325
All those opposed?

189
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:48,705
Motion passes.

190
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:49,286
Thank you.

191
00:15:54,156 --> 00:16:08,593
Motion to revert to the regular order of business we have before us community participation Miss Judy Lonigan of the Jingle Bell road race would like to discuss the funds raised and the funds to be distributed miss Lonigan And members of the Jingle Bell

192
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,956
First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you who are here tonight, who participated in the road race.

193
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:48,816
And I'm here to collect your checks.

194
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:51,877
I want to introduce John Murphy.

195
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:55,317
John Murphy is president of the Members Plus Credit Union.

196
00:16:55,878 --> 00:17:01,259
The first three races are Lonergan Insurance and Real Estate Agency sponsored it by ourselves.

197
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:05,139
And this year, Members Plus wanted to come on board with us.

198
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,680
So they have participated in the road race.

199
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:20,146
John is really here for the eye candy tonight, because he's going to hand out the checks, and I'm going to call the names.

200
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:21,886
Checks are the candy.

201
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,968
Right, that's right.

202
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:28,549
Oh, I have a list here.

203
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:30,630
I mean, Elaine Rocha gave me a list.

204
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,851
When we started out, this is our fourth race.

205
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:36,853
When we first started out, we had about 160 runners, and we gave away $12,000.

206
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:45,529
And in four years, we had over 700 runners this year, and we're giving you $32,229.05.

207
00:17:46,249 --> 00:18:02,816
This is really due to the hard work that all of you kids did with your parents, your coaches, whatever.

208
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:08,018
And I say to them all the time, we're giving you the fundraiser, it's up to you.

209
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:12,192
to jump on board, sell the raffles, get the sponsors and get the runners.

210
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:18,455
The more that you make on your own, the more money you get out of the pot.

211
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:31,721
I hate that word, but that's how it works is if somebody runs or walks or is a sponsor and does not designate that it's going to a certain team or a school, it goes into a common pot.

212
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,102
And then from there, we break it down.

213
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:37,123
The more that the first year we did it, everyone got the same amount.

214
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:44,325
And we realized that one team raised $1,800 and one team raised $50, and they were all getting the same amount.

215
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:51,832
So now we do it on a proportional basis so that it's an incentive to you to raise more money.

216
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,294
Let me see.

217
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:59,420
Over the past four years, including this year, we will have given from this race over $82,000 to the school.

218
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:20,577
My last official statement is that once your picture is taken, when you go outside afterwards, we'd like to have the whole group of all your kids in the school committee and the mayor and Mr. Bellson have a group picture so that we can put it in the newspaper.

219
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:27,222
But after you're finished, if you would go outside the quality, um, Mr. Thurberge is going to take everyone's name.

220
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:28,623
So we have them for the newspapers.

221
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:29,103
Okay.

222
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:30,885
Pat's stand up.

223
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:47,170
To expedite this as fast as we can, if you would, all of you that are here to collect checks, if you would kind of go over to the side, and then I'll call the clubs, and then rather than everybody get up.

224
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:51,316
So if we all have an en masse, over to the side.

225
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:57,785
I have a t-shirt

226
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:23,405
Members of the Asian Club, Asian Club, come on forward.

227
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:38,013
Representing the Asian Club is Jodi Lu, who's been a wonderful committee member, and she is in charge of it.

228
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:39,734
Kaylee Thuong,

229
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:44,545
Justin Tsang and Kelly Lamb.

230
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:46,707
Thank you very much.

231
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:15,998
I know, Jody, how much did you get for the checkbook?

232
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:17,618
We have raised almost $1,200.

233
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:19,760
Asian Club's amount is almost $1,200 for that.

234
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,040
The next one is the national honor.

235
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,043
So Jody, you can stand here again.

236
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:44,667
National Honor Society.

237
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:54,393
Where's Jody?

238
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:56,154
She's in charge of National Honor.

239
00:21:57,135 --> 00:22:00,357
The amount of the National Honor Society is $1,776.

240
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:22,179
It goes to prove that the National Honor Society and the Asian Club are small organizations in the school.

241
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:30,665
So it doesn't make any difference how many people belong to a club or a team or whatever, you can make as much money as you want if you just put some effort into it.

242
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:38,490
All right, our next one is the Brooks School.

243
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,812
Kara Ahmed, Kara Ahmed.

244
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:50,107
The Brooks School is receiving $1,886.

245
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:52,349
Columbus School, Bob Russo.

246
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:04,717
The Columbus School has raised $1,768.

247
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,540
St.

248
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,641
Rayfield School, Jackie Gatto and Mark Bedrosian, who's the principal.

249
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:42,943
St.

250
00:23:42,983 --> 00:23:44,104
Rayfields will receive $2,624.

251
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:20,941
foreign language, Nelida Lepore is the counselor, Carlo DeStefani, Mia McGillicuddy, and Jasmine DeMalanga.

252
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,861
I know I pronounced that wrong, but best I could do.

253
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:24,982
And they are getting $461.00.

254
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:49,155
Next we have gymnastics.

255
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:52,998
Nicole Fortino, Olivia Ross, and Abby Kline.

256
00:24:59,903 --> 00:25:00,704
They are receiving $128.

257
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:17,172
The Andrew School is next, Susan Antwine and Jen Overbrook, and they have their sons with them.

258
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:44,209
Andrew's school is receiving $625.

259
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,175
Jump all over me because we're giving them the wrong amount of money.

260
00:26:17,195 --> 00:26:20,037
Step down here for a minute.

261
00:26:36,524 --> 00:26:47,632
We're gonna step down and then we'll go to the next one and then I'll come back up again.

262
00:26:47,913 --> 00:26:49,394
Oh, I'm sorry, back up again.

263
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:50,755
Your check is $2,148.

264
00:26:50,855 --> 00:26:51,375
Wrong year.

265
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,782
The check's in the mail.

266
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:06,583
Or somewhere.

267
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:07,423
Andrews.

268
00:27:07,763 --> 00:27:12,267
All right.

269
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:12,567
Crew.

270
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:14,508
This is a crew that's coming up now.

271
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:34,585
All right, I have to give credit to Lisa McFarland, who really has worked on the committee and has done a wonderful job.

272
00:27:40,268 --> 00:27:51,894
The representatives of the crew are Louisa Barbosa, Lisa McKillop, Tommy Vano, Noville Lambert, Anthony, Anthony, what's your last name?

273
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:53,715
McKillop, okay, I'm sorry.

274
00:27:54,426 --> 00:28:08,924
Mike Finn, Emma Swackiel, however you pronounce that, Edson Silveira, Maya Gomez Coltriss, Haley Duff, Cuff, I'm sorry, and Lucas Feldman, and the amount they're getting is $3,383.

275
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:22,188
Their goal was to buy a new boat, so they were almost there with this check.

276
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:26,130
Why don't you girls get in front of that?

277
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,891
Bend down.

278
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:28,572
You could get in.

279
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:02,074
Our last two, is there somebody over there that we missed?

280
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:02,695
St.

281
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:03,575
Joseph's has one.

282
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:28,147
St.

283
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:29,588
Joseph's is receiving, shh.

284
00:29:29,608 --> 00:29:29,668
St.

285
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:30,148
Joseph's is receiving $4,475.

286
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:30,508
Congratulations.

287
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:31,689
Oh, and they are.

288
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:53,206
St.

289
00:29:53,246 --> 00:30:02,248
Joseph already, where's my list here, they also won the award for the most participants in the race, and they had 138 people won awards.

290
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:02,528
Oh, thank you.

291
00:30:28,005 --> 00:30:34,607
And our last one is our second year winning, the most amount of money raised, and that's the Roberts.

292
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:54,332
And the Roberts is, the Roberts, the mothers are Catherine Anderson, Erin Sharon, Carter Sharon, and I don't have the other names, but they all, and the amount that they have raised is, drumroll, drumroll, $6,200.

293
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:05,600
$204.99.

294
00:31:01,757 --> 00:31:05,600
I don't know how we got these odd little fives and ninety-nines.

295
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,721
We need the trophy.

296
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:07,241
Keep pushing.

297
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:08,382
We need the trophy.

298
00:31:08,522 --> 00:31:09,723
Okay, everybody, this way.

299
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,222
I just wanted, I just wanted to say on behalf.

300
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:05,049
I just want to say on behalf of members plus credit union and two of my staff, Lana Battles and Justin Lasco.

301
00:32:11,784 --> 00:32:20,850
It was our honor to be a part of this great event and we look forward to future years sponsoring this event and helping raise money for the schools.

302
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:26,613
So thank you.

303
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:34,498
Thank you again to everyone and we hope that those that are watching this school committee meeting will run, walk, participate,

304
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,388
and help support the kids next year.

305
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:37,991
Thank you.

306
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:51,088
Well, at this time, we just want to thank the Jingle Bell Run committee.

307
00:32:51,148 --> 00:32:52,128
I know there's many of you.

308
00:32:52,168 --> 00:32:54,089
It takes a village to put this race on.

309
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:58,409
So I thank you all for participating, sponsoring, walking, running.

310
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,950
It was a great day.

311
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,270
A lot of Medford people and beyond turned out.

312
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,091
So I was really proud that day.

313
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:08,171
And thanks to our DPWI police who kept everybody safe.

314
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:10,372
And I look forward to next year.

315
00:33:17,577 --> 00:33:20,924
are we going to take a are we going out for a photo yeah

316
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:45,521
You might want to leave your coats up here.

317
00:33:56,057 --> 00:33:57,678
We're now going to take a two minute recess.

318
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:24,107
th th th

319
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:50,343
One of those days, I'll call you up.

320
00:34:50,363 --> 00:34:51,383
Yeah, come on down, definitely.

321
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:52,863
I'm actually not on the right way tonight.

322
00:34:52,943 --> 00:34:54,264
But normally, I can control my speech.

323
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:55,004
And I can sit down with you.

324
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:55,184
Uh-huh.

325
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:55,804

We stand in a line.

00:34:57,705 --> 00:34:58,285
We stand in a line.

00:34:59,846 --> 00:35:00,586
We stand in a line.

We stand in a line.

340
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:08,589
We stand in a line.

341
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:09,509
We stand in a line.

342
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:10,449
We stand in a line.

343
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:11,269
We stand in a line.

344
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:11,890
We stand in a line.

00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,510
We stand in a line.

00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,370
We stand in a line.

We stand in a line.

00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,051
We stand in a line.

00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:15,551
We stand in a line.

350
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:16,331
We stand in a line.

351
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:17,171
We stand in a line.

352
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:18,032
We stand in a line.

353
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:18,652
We stand in a line.

354
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:20,092
Okay, everybody.

355
00:35:20,212 --> 00:35:21,313
Okay, everybody stay.

356
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:47,715
Thank you.

357
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:48,356
Thank you.

358
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:48,876
Thank you.

359
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:08,064
Good night, everyone.

360
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:09,626
Thanks for coming down.

361
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,086
Bye, guys.

362
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:55,238
Mr. Benedetto, I'd like to move the suspension to take the financial report next.

363
00:36:55,258 --> 00:37:00,539
There's a motion on the floor to take the financial report out of order.

364
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,699
All those in favor?

365
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:01,779
Aye.

366
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,320
All those opposed?

367
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,160
Motion passes.

368
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:07,433
We'll just give them a couple minutes.

369
00:37:07,613 --> 00:37:09,855
Let's clear the hall.

370
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:11,016
OK.

371
00:37:11,056 --> 00:37:11,296
Kirsten.

372
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:16,820
We're going to get you out of here before it snows.

373
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,442
And I'm sorry about last time.

374
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,024
I'm sorry about last time.

375
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:24,265
I'm going to do that.

376
00:37:26,186 --> 00:37:30,710
If he doesn't give it to me before I can read it, if he gives it to me that night, I'm always going to.

377
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,672
Yeah, but we'll do it at the beginning of the meeting.

378
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:34,452
Yeah, I just didn't think.

379
00:37:41,115 --> 00:37:41,655
Thank you.

380
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:46,579
Item number five, the financial report for the Medford Public School System.

381
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,222
Yes, good evening, mayor, members of the school committee.

382
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:56,728
The financial report as reported for January 9th, 2017.

383
00:37:56,868 --> 00:37:59,090
Can you speak up a little bit more?

384
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,351
Okay, sorry.

385
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:02,392
I'll take care of it.

386
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:16,710
Thank you.

387
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:42,623
So as provided in a summary status, uh, we have reported out again that our, uh, general fund operating budget for FY 17 is 54,333,000 of which to date we have spent approximately 46.93% checks, uh, since August 29th, the start of school for calendar year, all 12 month employees have received 14 paychecks since July 1st.

388
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:51,276
All major positions and replacements have been filled and efforts continue for onboarding district-wide floating substitutes.

389
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:58,278
As previously reported, many of our subaccounts are listed in the general fund without a budget appropriation.

390
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:09,740
Some of this is due to the Department of Ed's specific specified reporting by school, by function, category, and district-wide expenses as they continue to

391
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:14,168
revisit that report and further expand their reporting criteria.

392
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:21,923
We try to stay compliant with that as well as being able to monitor our budget in a timely fashion.

393
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:37,130
I am also the school business officials participating in some roundtable efforts that will be reviewing some of these additional reports so that hopefully we will have a heads up on any changes that will be occurring in upcoming fiscal years.

394
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:50,738
In general we have some conservative projections for encumbrances included in our large area expenditure categories which would include our natural gas, energy, electricity, transportation, special education.

395
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:57,966
Reflected in the summary are updates on some program areas of interest, including our online payments.

396
00:39:58,686 --> 00:40:13,570
The FACTS product is our online payment plan for households that encourages online payments for the before and after school programs, our MEAP programs, our preschool, Make Way for Kids, and Kids Corner.

397
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:27,674
Currently Medford Public Schools has 441 active payment plans that are making ongoing payments with fiscal to date collections of $888,548 and the total anticipated collection for fiscal year 17 of $1,000,926,937 across all of our program areas.

398
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:47,920
We continue to look for cashless payment options to further streamline the process and make available systems for families and their tracking purposes.

399
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:51,761
Mr. Skerry, point of information.

400
00:40:51,781 --> 00:41:00,983
Any progress made, Kristen, with getting the vocational school and the high school general store online?

401
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:03,765
that they can accept visa or master charge?

402
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:14,448
We have looked into that process, working with City Hall and the Treasury Department, because that would be an entirely new, different bank account system.

403
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:20,449
And monitoring those charges, we are looking at that process moving forward.

404
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:22,290
So our hope is for fiscal year 18.

405
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,210
Thank you.

406
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:28,915
Are there any other questions?

407
00:41:29,796 --> 00:41:30,757
Okay, thank you.

408
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:37,241
Continuing on the overview, we have our building maintenance and repairs.

409
00:41:37,802 --> 00:41:51,752
The high school has sustained some extraordinary urgent repairs this winter due to pipe leaks and bursts that required some major plumbing with the underground lines within our A building.

410
00:41:52,512 --> 00:42:06,162
Additional to those were routine maintenance and repairs during the course of the start of school, including at the high school, we had the nurses' suite painted, as well as stairwells, lecture halls, and corridors near the pool.

411
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:12,687
Curtis Tufts, we had painted classrooms on upper level, floor refinishing, and recreation room.

412
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:23,317
At the McGlynn Middle and Elementaries, we had stairwells and common areas painted, as well as filter cartridges replaced in sinks and faucet repairs throughout.

413
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:30,004
At the Columbus, Roberts, and Brooks Elementary, we had the library carpet shampooed and gym floors refinished.

414
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:37,994
Moving on to transportation, we have contracted 18 main bus routes with Eastern Bus Company.

415
00:42:39,195 --> 00:42:44,657
We have routes running morning and afternoon, serving all of our public schools, as well as St.

416
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:45,777
Joseph Catholic, St.

417
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,278
Raphael, and St.

418
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:50,699
Clement's, as well as Minuteman Vocational.

419
00:42:51,259 --> 00:43:00,283
And all of our routes continue to be reviewed for overcrowding, time efficiencies, and making the best and safe stops available for all of our students.

420
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:15,227
Homeless transportation continues to be an unknown expense going through any fiscal year as that group is not known on an annual basis.

421
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:16,708
So we have students that

422
00:43:18,148 --> 00:43:22,129
happen to have that situation throughout the year, so we continue to monitor.

423
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:29,411
We do receive reimbursements from the state, but those do not cover all the expenses typically in a fiscal year.

424
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:42,955
So we continue to watch that as well as monitoring the Department of Ed's reimbursement, which approximately has been running about 60% on their homeless transportation.

425
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:50,089
Our utilities, the invoices received as of this reporting date were through November.

426
00:43:50,990 --> 00:44:07,694
Obviously, our more expensive heating months have not been incurred or materialized as of yet, but we have a comparison that we did from prior fiscal year, FY 15 and 16, and we did have our natural gas expense was $61,730 for that same time frame.

427
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,538
currently we have $68,888.

428
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,645
So the amount of therms used was similar in quantity.

429
00:44:20,006 --> 00:44:23,670
The cost was slightly elevated, roughly $7,158 over the prior year.

430
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:40,206
Some increases would come from changes within a supply and distribution fees, and that is on an annual basis as energy is a commodity and those different costs are ever-changing.

431
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:46,548
Our electric charges from comparative year FY16, July through November.

432
00:44:47,308 --> 00:44:53,289
was $468,562, and currently that same time frame was $468,012.

433
00:44:54,329 --> 00:45:14,393
So we have been notified that the Great Eastern Electric Supply Agreement has been in effect starting January 1st, and both city and school departments will see a slight increase in per kilowatt fees, which is based on an energy

434
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:17,136
compliance that they have implemented.

435
00:45:17,776 --> 00:45:33,895
So as invoices are paid, we will be reviewing and monitoring those line items, liquidating where we can, but being conservative in our estimate through the next few months, which typically are the highest heating months of a fiscal year.

436
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:47,570
The next category we have covered is special education, and the FY17 out-of-district tuition is projected to be $3.4 million, which is slightly lower than budgeted.

437
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:54,794
However, this category is another volatile area, as statuses can change at any point during the school year.

438
00:45:55,034 --> 00:46:00,297
So we continue to monitor those and keep up to date as much as possible.

439
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:04,579
The three components to the funding of the out-of-district tuition were

440
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:13,028
$1.2 million from the general fund appropriations, $1 million from the IDEA grant, and $1.2 million in circuit breaker reimbursement.

441
00:46:13,988 --> 00:46:25,050
So the overall, the special ed transportation is currently encumbered at $1,030,000, which is higher than budgeted at $950,000 across multiple vendors.

442
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:29,231
However, this, again, is a volatile and unknown component.

443
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:31,452
So we continue to monitor those expenses.

444
00:46:31,532 --> 00:46:32,932
And as we can, we liquidate.

445
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:33,909
Mr. Skerry.

446
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:35,471
Point of information through you to Kristen.

447
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:36,172
Point of information.

448
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:36,252
Yes.

449
00:46:36,433 --> 00:46:41,720
The special ed transportation count roughly is $80,000 over budget.

450
00:46:42,642 --> 00:46:46,467
Have there been any transfers made into that to cover the costs?

451
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,494
There have not been any transfers requested or made at this time.

452
00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:53,838
Again, we encumber based on what we anticipate.

453
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:58,743
However, that may not materialize, so we could be liquidating orders.

454
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:03,229
So we haven't yet requested a formal budget transfer.

455
00:47:03,249 --> 00:47:05,771
I just want to make sure there's enough money in that account to pay our vendors.

456
00:47:06,152 --> 00:47:06,332
Yes.

457
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:15,423
Yes, I think this actually is for the superintendent.

458
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:24,205
As a school committee member, I was not aware that we had sustained urgent repairs due to pipe leaks at the high school and bursts.

459
00:47:24,605 --> 00:47:30,946
Was that over the holiday break or was that in December when we, on that one cold snap we had?

460
00:47:32,827 --> 00:47:37,488
The A building area has had ongoing issues for a long period of time.

461
00:47:38,212 --> 00:47:46,116
And we went in there to diagnostically try to fix a few things, and we found that every time we fixed something, it got a little worse and a little bit worse.

462
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:50,859
So we decided to go in there and really just do a good job and try to clean it up.

463
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:56,201
So, you know, it isn't a big urgency thing, but it's an expense.

464
00:47:56,862 --> 00:47:58,182
It's the kind of thing we can fix.

465
00:47:58,322 --> 00:48:00,203
It requires things, I think, going forward.

466
00:48:00,403 --> 00:48:04,866
It should be part of the capital plan thinking as we go, but it's definitely an item that

467
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:08,959
you know, taking a few dollars out of our repair budget this year.

468
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,362
So at this point, is that area repaired?

469
00:48:13,303 --> 00:48:17,026
Well, it's repaired at this point in time, but you know, I think we may spring another leap.

470
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:24,792
Who knows, as the winter season's coming, it's very hard to know, you know, whether that's going to happen, but we've repaired it to the point that we need to right now.

471
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:28,034
Has any section had to be closed down?

472
00:48:28,455 --> 00:48:28,555
No.

473
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:41,813
If I may follow up with that, just in terms of the phrasing, extraordinary repairs, that is a Department of Ed category classification.

474
00:48:41,893 --> 00:48:46,056
So it's not necessarily something that was identified in your normal budget process.

475
00:48:46,417 --> 00:48:50,600
This was something that occurred that needed to be repaired.

476
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,904
So in that terminology, that's where I use that extraordinary repair.

477
00:48:56,084 --> 00:48:57,445
Does that mean it's a $10,000 job?

478
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:00,878
could be higher than $10,000.

479
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:00,878
$20,000?

480
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:05,301
Extraordinary Maintenance has a cap of $150,000 per fiscal year.

481
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:07,382
Where does it start?

482
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,263
Where does it start?

483
00:49:09,343 --> 00:49:09,563
Yeah.

484
00:49:09,623 --> 00:49:10,763
In terms of dollars?

485
00:49:10,883 --> 00:49:11,344
Dollars.

486
00:49:13,525 --> 00:49:15,686
Whatever's needed for the project.

487
00:49:15,906 --> 00:49:19,808
Yeah, I'm just thinking what's a minor versus an extraordinary repair.

488
00:49:19,868 --> 00:49:22,029
So that's what I was asking.

489
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:23,329
OK, thank you.

490
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:24,630
Thank you.

491
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:25,631
Mr. Benedetto.

492
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:26,091
Thank you.

493
00:49:29,223 --> 00:49:35,047
the piping, it says here that we had sustained extra repairs.

494
00:49:35,607 --> 00:49:40,911
So if we've already had them, how much do we spend on those repairs and how much more do we need to spend?

495
00:49:41,091 --> 00:49:41,831
Let's be clear.

496
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:43,332
Let's put the dollar amounts out here.

497
00:49:43,973 --> 00:49:51,738
Well, I'm not sure, you know, everything has an exact dollar amount yet because there's still some work going on, but I think we're in excess of $25,000 at this point in time.

498
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:55,380
And that how much more we have to spend will depend on what actually takes place.

499
00:49:56,509 --> 00:50:04,152
What I said a few moments ago, I think is accurate, is that we're now doing an assessment to determine, you know, how much of this needs to go into a full capital plan.

500
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:15,336
We think that a building is an area that probably is going to need a lot of attention because, I don't know if you know the piping structure, but you know the flooring is terrazzo tile?

501
00:50:16,036 --> 00:50:16,276
Okay.

502
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:20,789
You've got to go into the terrazzo tile and go down under into the tunnel.

503
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:27,632
That alone is an expense, and that alone is a major activity, and then go down and in.

504
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:33,575
To replace that piping is almost like ripping up a straight Winthrop street, taking out the thing, and then putting a pipe in.

505
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:41,839
So I think in the long run, going into the capital plan, we're going to want to replace those pipes, because I think they're going to keep happening from now on.

506
00:50:42,259 --> 00:50:43,860
And you'll be providing us a report?

507
00:50:44,723 --> 00:50:46,847
I think that's the way we're going to look at it.

508
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:48,950
I think we're making this as more of a capital look.

509
00:50:49,211 --> 00:50:53,758
Do you have a time frame on providing us a report of future expenses regarding?

510
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:56,423
Well, I think the capital plan will start to roll out in the next couple of months.

511
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:01,935
Okay, and will there be any other expenses in the interim, other than the $25,000 we just spent?

512
00:51:01,955 --> 00:51:02,996
Well, there could be.

513
00:51:03,236 --> 00:51:03,656
There could be.

514
00:51:03,697 --> 00:51:04,838
We're in January.

515
00:51:04,858 --> 00:51:05,298
Okay.

516
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:08,321
And on a given day, you could walk in and, you know, we could have another pipeline.

517
00:51:08,661 --> 00:51:08,921
Okay.

518
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:15,027
We did last year, for example, you remember up in B building, in the second floor, there were several pipes that broke.

519
00:51:15,227 --> 00:51:15,388
Right.

520
00:51:15,788 --> 00:51:16,749
This is going to happen.

521
00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:19,772
I mean, this is part of, you know, the cold winter and also

522
00:51:20,363 --> 00:51:23,844
part of the structure of that building where some of the stuff is a little bit older.

523
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:29,907
So part of our capital planning will be to look at these weak areas and try to strengthen them.

524
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:44,753
So just for clarification, if there is an item that costs a lot of money, if you could put the dollar amount in this report, like the piping, the unexpected piping was approximately $25,000 to repair.

525
00:51:44,793 --> 00:51:49,255
That's just general information that I'd like it more detailed.

526
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,370
That would be great.

527
00:51:51,811 --> 00:52:08,876
Also, as we're talking about schools and maintenance, we had the pleasure of going to an event at the Andrews School, and we noticed that in their gymnasium, their bleachers were broken, and they look somewhat unsafe, and they don't pull them out because of that.

528
00:52:09,636 --> 00:52:12,017
And there were a few other issues in that building as well.

529
00:52:12,037 --> 00:52:13,077
My colleague was with me.

530
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:16,478
Him and I walked through since we were there for a meeting.

531
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:23,755
There was some light out in one of the gyms, music room or something, right?

532
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:30,717
That had been recently replaced and they still can't seem to get it working and I'm sure we spent a lot of money on it.

533
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:33,758
So these are some maintenance items I'd like you to look at.

534
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:36,659
I'll refer that to Mr. DeLaver and get a report.

535
00:52:36,879 --> 00:52:43,242
Also, while we're speaking to that, we did start our tours of the buildings and I would like to, at some point, continue those.

536
00:52:44,382 --> 00:52:48,023
and make time in that a priority with budget time coming up.

537
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:56,245
We need to see as a committee where we want to focus our maintenance funding, and having our eyes and walking the grounds really makes a difference.

538
00:52:56,325 --> 00:52:59,026
So I'm requesting that that continue.

539
00:53:00,186 --> 00:53:01,967
And as far as, oh, I'm sorry.

540
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:05,748
One of the classrooms, Roy, that faces the river,

541
00:53:06,335 --> 00:53:14,480
They get the sun, and it's so bad in the afternoon that the teacher had to put up a temporary, yeah, a temporary top to be able to work off the blue board.

542
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,362
They have a rounded window.

543
00:53:16,382 --> 00:53:19,664
I wonder if we could get a shade for that window and figure out somehow how to cut the sun.

544
00:53:19,684 --> 00:53:21,085
Which room is it, do you know?

545
00:53:21,605 --> 00:53:22,646
It's on the third floor.

546
00:53:22,906 --> 00:53:24,087
Someone with a nice window.

547
00:53:24,207 --> 00:53:25,507
It's a circular window.

548
00:53:26,844 --> 00:53:29,885
And the clock in the gymnasium hasn't worked for several months.

549
00:53:30,025 --> 00:53:34,087
I think throughout the district, the clocks need to be synced at some point or somehow.

550
00:53:34,647 --> 00:53:36,528
Oh yeah, and the school board doesn't work.

551
00:53:37,969 --> 00:53:39,489
The school board doesn't work at all.

552
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:47,052
Just a few things that while we were there, we just happened to notice, and that's why it's important for us to continue that, sorry.

553
00:53:47,993 --> 00:53:55,456
My other question regarding the budget was on page two of 13, under permanent part-time

554
00:53:55,977 --> 00:53:57,597
Meffitt High School mentors.

555
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,538
We budgeted an appropriated $2,500.

556
00:54:00,618 --> 00:54:06,159
The expenditures have been $34,663.

557
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:12,881
Yes, that's not an accurate statement of what the mentor expense is.

558
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:20,442
We have identified some job codes through the payroll system that have not matched up to the actual general ledger codes.

559
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:22,923
So those will be corrected moving forward.

560
00:54:23,383 --> 00:54:23,463
OK.

561
00:54:24,998 --> 00:54:28,902
So there isn't, like, this job created that was spending all this money on.

562
00:54:28,922 --> 00:54:28,982
No.

563
00:54:29,002 --> 00:54:29,843
No.

564
00:54:30,243 --> 00:54:30,523
Okay.

565
00:54:31,764 --> 00:54:32,045
All right.

566
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:41,153
Also, you know, as staffing needs change, if there's any need, any additional staff

567
00:54:42,021 --> 00:54:44,062
added throughout the school district.

568
00:54:45,343 --> 00:54:50,846
I'd like a list of that in a report with the financial report on the quarterly basis.

569
00:54:50,926 --> 00:54:56,389
Just a list of new people added in their salaries and when they were added and the reasoning for it.

570
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,792
So that's a request to go along with this financial report.

571
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:04,914
Now, I know this has nothing to do with our new director.

572
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,176
It's directly to you.

573
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:11,118
I requested and actually,

574
00:55:12,788 --> 00:55:17,471
The whole school committee voted to have the community schools budget presented.

575
00:55:19,072 --> 00:55:23,034
We haven't seen one in over seven months, maybe eight or nine.

576
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:31,719
I know I requested it, and it was supposed to be here today, and I know there have been a lot of changes both on the city side and the school side, so I have patience.

577
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:37,963
I'm trying to be patient, but I'm reminding you I'm expecting it soon, and when it comes,

578
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:39,800
Well, so let me just answer it.

579
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,420
Okay.

580
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,082
Reconciliation at the City Hall has to take place.

581
00:55:43,662 --> 00:55:45,443
We don't have the full reconciliation yet.

582
00:55:45,463 --> 00:55:48,285
I'm not going to give you a report that I don't have a reconciliation yet.

583
00:55:48,305 --> 00:55:51,747
We think from our internal documents that we're fine.

584
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:58,791
But until, what do you call it, the money is moved properly, you know, I can't give you a reconciliation against the city's chart of accounts.

585
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:05,675
So, we'll do that, and if necessary, we'll provide you our report, you know, with a disclaimer at the end of it.

586
00:56:06,055 --> 00:56:06,956
For the iSchools?

587
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:09,832
for basically all the revolving.

588
00:56:10,012 --> 00:56:13,395
So we're currently in the audit process as well.

589
00:56:25,943 --> 00:56:29,007
So this school committee requested it done on a quarterly basis.

590
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:36,216
So what I would suggest in the future, and this is a suggestion, is that you provide the school part with that disclosure.

591
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:41,843
And then when we get the state, so we're not waiting eight months before we get a quarterly report.

592
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:48,028
I think going forward it will be easier simply because we've got a new operation down the hall and up here.

593
00:56:48,548 --> 00:56:56,114
Once that's cleaned up one time and set, then we can do that with more confidence going forward every quarter.

594
00:56:56,154 --> 00:56:58,516
Right now, you know, there's stuff that's still moving.

595
00:56:58,963 --> 00:57:04,426
So the last time I requested it, we shot for January, and that was November, early November.

596
00:57:04,867 --> 00:57:08,729
So could I have an approximate date so that way I follow up with you again?

597
00:57:08,749 --> 00:57:10,390
When the auditors are done, I'll be happy to give you a date.

598
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:11,811
In the next few meetings?

599
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:13,892
As soon as the auditors are done, I'll be happy to give you a date.

600
00:57:14,073 --> 00:57:15,133
OK, thank you very much.

601
00:57:15,153 --> 00:57:16,674
You want to see it roll over the account, correct?

602
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:18,295
Were you waiting for her to roll it over?

603
00:57:19,016 --> 00:57:20,196
That was one piece of it.

604
00:57:20,297 --> 00:57:24,119
There were some additional pieces in terms of revenue.

605
00:57:24,139 --> 00:57:25,120
Can you call me tomorrow and let me know?

606
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:25,260
Yes.

607
00:57:26,671 --> 00:57:27,031
Thank you.

608
00:57:27,432 --> 00:57:31,437
Also, I just had one more question about the community schools.

609
00:57:31,737 --> 00:57:42,392
I just had a question, are all registrations going through the online programming that we have currently set up, similar to the after school program and all that?

610
00:57:42,812 --> 00:57:46,934
We're not collecting checks up in a hallway for people to use our building, right?

611
00:57:47,014 --> 00:57:52,236
We're actually having people sign up online, and we're renting the facility.

612
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:56,438
Or they're registering, even if it's free or voluntary.

613
00:57:57,398 --> 00:58:05,901
If they're using our building, they're doing the online registration, and we can track who's in and out of our building at all times, because that program was set up last July.

614
00:58:06,762 --> 00:58:09,843
That's a question both to you and the superintendent.

615
00:58:10,705 --> 00:58:15,027
So there are still some people who do not go online and give us checks.

616
00:58:15,107 --> 00:58:19,109
I mean, they walk in the door and they want to go swimming, and they give us a check or something like that.

617
00:58:19,189 --> 00:58:23,531
But for the most part, most people are using the online system.

618
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:27,433
But there are some, as far as vendors go, they're using an online system with us.

619
00:58:27,473 --> 00:58:32,535
But the reality is that some people still walk in the door and hand us a check.

620
00:58:33,196 --> 00:58:35,477
No, no, I'm not even talking about the payment piece.

621
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:42,442
I want them to register, even if it's a contribution or it's a charity and we're letting them in our building.

622
00:58:42,802 --> 00:58:48,866
I want it so we can say at the end of the year, okay, these are how many hours of charity time we've given.

623
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:54,264
the McGlynn School Gym or the auditorium up at the high school.

624
00:58:54,565 --> 00:59:00,149
I want data and be able to ask you and say, OK, how much is the community using this school?

625
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:01,730
What are we doing with it?

626
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,311
How much are we making from it?

627
00:59:03,391 --> 00:59:08,255
How much money is going back to the maintenance and repair and upgrades or an after school program?

628
00:59:08,515 --> 00:59:11,958
So we did it mostly to track who's in our building.

629
00:59:11,998 --> 00:59:17,422
And then it's for our own good, too, to know who's in there, because we're responsible for them while they're there.

630
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:26,229
If I may, so that's a two part answer in terms of identifying and streamlining the process.

631
00:59:26,289 --> 00:59:36,731
We have an online calendar that is maintained by our community services and they document every activity that is happening and occurring within our building.

632
00:59:37,251 --> 00:59:44,752
Subsequently, the entities are then invoiced and or they are active through the MCC payment online.

633
00:59:45,172 --> 00:59:48,133
So there's two pieces to that response in that

634
00:59:48,537 --> 00:59:51,098
Yes, we are tracking it within a new system.

635
00:59:51,658 --> 00:59:59,261
The calendars are being updated as the service and the entities are requesting participation.

636
00:59:59,342 --> 01:00:14,688
So it is key that all of that is documented so that we know on any given time when the pool is being used, when the different locations are being utilized so that there's not a double booking situation.

637
01:00:15,057 --> 01:00:23,218
So those are taking place, and we are able to pull a report on a calendar basis and identify the charges, so forth.

638
01:00:23,438 --> 01:00:38,641
So I'm really happy to hear that, and I encourage even community members that request to use the building and it's donated to them for that time, that it go through the system and we can put a zero payment, so that way we can track who we're donating to as well.

639
01:00:38,681 --> 01:00:41,122
That's internal for the community schools, not through the user.

640
01:00:41,462 --> 01:00:42,902
Right, no, and I understand that.

641
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:44,230
Thank you.

642
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:44,650
OK.

643
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:45,150
Ms.

644
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:45,610
Van de Kloot.

645
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,731
I wanted to go back to the discussion about the Andrews.

646
01:00:49,531 --> 01:00:57,692
At the time we were doing the walkthroughs, Kathy Kretz, my fellow school committee member and I, went to the Andrews.

647
01:00:57,812 --> 01:01:05,534
And we submitted to the superintendent a list, including the bleachers, the clock, the things that you guys mentioned.

648
01:01:05,974 --> 01:01:12,495
And also at that point, because I don't remember, I'd gone to some other schools too, some of those very same things, the bleachers,

649
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:13,856
were on multiple.

650
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:22,943
So I'm thinking that that's part of the capital plan, because that's when we already talked about some of those things.

651
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:30,508
I think we sort of got to the point where we were going together, and then the superintendent said, because it was difficult to bring us all together, go.

652
01:01:30,909 --> 01:01:34,771
And Kathy and I just both happened to do that school.

653
01:01:35,952 --> 01:01:36,233
Great.

654
01:01:37,934 --> 01:01:39,435
OK, is there a motion on the floor?

655
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:39,715
Oh, Ms.

656
01:01:39,835 --> 01:01:40,436
Preston.

657
01:01:40,516 --> 01:01:41,857
I have just a couple of questions.

658
01:01:43,008 --> 01:01:46,370
Christine, I just wanted to thank you for getting back to me about the bus and the overcrowding.

659
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:55,193
Can you let me know, is it still, is there still a lot of overcrowding on bus 14 departing to high school in the afternoon?

660
01:01:56,514 --> 01:02:05,478
What we have seen is on bad weather days that there seems to be an influx of students attempting to ride that bus that don't

661
01:02:05,965 --> 01:02:07,286
normally ride.

662
01:02:07,946 --> 01:02:17,031
So we have worked with faculty to monitor that bus in the afternoons to ensure that it's just the routine riders that are getting on.

663
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:17,551
OK.

664
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:18,271
All right.

665
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:18,731
Thanks.

666
01:02:19,212 --> 01:02:33,759
And also, we were looking, me and I were looking at this report, and on page 3, could you let us know what is the after school pupil transportation encumbrance, the 26,040?

667
01:02:36,684 --> 01:02:37,925
What does that relate to?

668
01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:38,885
We were just curious.

669
01:02:38,905 --> 01:02:40,066
I don't know if you know what that is.

670
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:47,388
So that would be some transportation costs that are associated with an open PO currently.

671
01:02:47,788 --> 01:02:49,349
So I would need to take a look.

672
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:51,950
It's a contract service account.

673
01:02:52,490 --> 01:03:05,075
So it would be any type of additional transportation could be programming that they have ongoing, but the encumbrance for that would be through a purchase order.

674
01:03:05,502 --> 01:03:10,143
Primarily, that's the middle school bus in the afternoon.

675
01:03:10,363 --> 01:03:13,744
No, the two or three days that you've asked for.

676
01:03:13,784 --> 01:03:13,964
Right.

677
01:03:14,464 --> 01:03:15,544
The after school.

678
01:03:15,564 --> 01:03:18,305
But then why is it not budgeted?

679
01:03:18,605 --> 01:03:21,745
You encumber when you know what the amount is for the contract.

680
01:03:21,785 --> 01:03:24,966
And then as you build, you take away from the encumbrance.

681
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:30,367
So if you look next month, that number should go down maybe $3,000 or something.

682
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:34,768
You encumber it through the end of the year because you have a contract in place for that bus.

683
01:03:35,303 --> 01:03:40,746
you anticipate a cost, you put that amount in there to say that that money is pretty much committed.

684
01:03:41,787 --> 01:03:47,531
And as you pay it down, you liquidate the amount that's been paid out so that the encumbrance decreases.

685
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:52,654
But sometimes the liquidation is slower than the actual expenditure.

686
01:03:52,714 --> 01:03:55,396
Expenditure comes mostly everything else under encumbrance zero.

687
01:03:55,576 --> 01:03:57,837
If things don't get liquidated, all the other line items.

688
01:03:58,698 --> 01:04:01,139
So why does this one, they set up a purchase?

689
01:04:01,159 --> 01:04:03,941
The other lines are salary accounts and those hit

690
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:08,236
based on actual payroll processing, and they're automatically charged up.

691
01:04:08,317 --> 01:04:16,320
This is actually a contract with Eastern Bus, and so the total between the expenditure and the encumbrance is close to the $40,000.

692
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,762
So the bills arrive usually a month and a half in arrears.

693
01:04:22,162 --> 01:04:28,525
So at this point of reporting, it would have included up through the November billing cycle.

694
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:34,649
Motion to accept the report, place on file, seconded by Ms.

695
01:04:34,669 --> 01:04:35,189
Vander Kloot.

696
01:04:35,249 --> 01:04:36,050
All those in favor?

697
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:36,591
Aye.

698
01:04:36,711 --> 01:04:37,471
All those opposed?

699
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:38,712
The motion passes.

700
01:04:38,732 --> 01:04:39,673
Thank you so much.

701
01:04:39,893 --> 01:04:44,137
Also, just a quick note, it does look like it's getting very, um, really bad outside.

702
01:04:44,197 --> 01:04:47,880
So I know there's some people in the audience that may travel some lengths to get home.

703
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,823
So if we could just try to exercise.

704
01:04:51,443 --> 01:04:51,623
Okay.

705
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:52,444
I'm sorry.

706
01:04:57,675 --> 01:04:58,256
item out of order.

707
01:04:58,696 --> 01:05:03,559
On the motion to take item number four report on school food service program out of order.

708
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:03,719
Ms.

709
01:05:03,759 --> 01:05:04,300
Patterson.

710
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:04,820
Thank you.

711
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:18,129
So again it was requested for a review and reports of the food service program for the upcoming year and any anticipation for

712
01:05:19,532 --> 01:05:20,653
meal price changes.

713
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:32,781
After we had conducted the review year-to-date and the district-wide fiscal expenses and revenues, we did identify that it is a very tight operating budget.

714
01:05:33,922 --> 01:05:37,204
The food service program is specific, unique.

715
01:05:37,244 --> 01:05:44,289
It falls under the federal guidelines by the USDA and the National School Lunch Program, also under CFR 7, Section 210.

716
01:05:49,242 --> 01:05:56,424
With regard to this particular account, we really cannot operate anything but a positive balance.

717
01:05:56,924 --> 01:06:14,970
So as we look and identify what we're currently charging for meals, what the pricing of the actual food costs, labor, just for example, our average meal cost for a breakfast without the labor is upward of $1.25 per meal.

718
01:06:17,272 --> 01:06:21,013
We are charging $1.10 at all schools.

719
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:44,278
For the lunch programs, as the food service and lunch preparation guidelines have changed, there are much more restrictive nutritional components that have to be met, ensuring that fruits and vegetables are offered every day, substantially increasing offerings of the whole grain foods,

720
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:57,944
only fat-free or low-fat milk varieties, limiting the calories and serving sizes, as well as reducing the amounts of saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium within all of the menu items.

721
01:06:58,024 --> 01:07:05,766
So those do incur additional food costs in terms of what vendors are preparing, what they're charging.

722
01:07:06,986 --> 01:07:11,728
We try to do bulk ordering and do cost savings where we can.

723
01:07:13,365 --> 01:07:17,768
the drive continues to be escalated food costs.

724
01:07:17,788 --> 01:07:29,614
An average lunch cost per meal is upward of $2.45, and currently we are charging $2.75 at elementary and $3 at the middle high.

725
01:07:30,415 --> 01:07:35,498
Additionally, part of the requirements for the National School Lunch Program is

726
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:44,424
a mandatory professional development and ongoing service training for all of the food service staff.

727
01:07:44,785 --> 01:07:49,967
So no longer are we able to just send those folks home on a half day.

728
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:58,512
They need to stay on site and have their own training, their own PD, which also is additional costs, but it's required.

729
01:07:58,572 --> 01:08:00,673
It's a mandatory requirement under the law.

730
01:08:03,357 --> 01:08:15,802
As of the December 2016 month and reporting, we did share a synopsis of our enrollment, which we had identified as 4,496 students with a free and reduced count of 2,103, averaging 46.77 district wide.

731
01:08:15,822 --> 01:08:19,203
So again, included with the summary was the breakdown by each school.

732
01:08:30,223 --> 01:08:31,724
and overall district-wide.

733
01:08:31,784 --> 01:08:42,689
Now the importance of these figures not only for food service but also for e-rate reimbursement for all of the components that we're eligible for funding.

734
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:52,955
So it really is important that we continue to educate our families and inform them of the services available and as they are utilizing those that are

735
01:08:53,949 --> 01:08:58,610
available through the state, they automatically become eligible for free lunch.

736
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:11,513
And with that, we increase our enrollment, we increase our reimbursement, we increase the participation, which is a win-win for the school departments and for the families as well.

737
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:19,615
So currently the 2017 reimbursement rate for a free lunch that the federal government issues back is $3.24.

738
01:09:21,843 --> 01:09:30,926
A reduced lunch is $2.84, and the state reimburses .06, the six-cent rule, for each meal.

739
01:09:31,647 --> 01:09:34,668
For the breakfast, we do qualify for severe needs, so we get $2.04.

740
01:09:34,728 --> 01:09:35,988
For the reduced breakfast, we get $1.74.

741
01:09:36,628 --> 01:09:39,109
For the paid breakfast, we get .29 cents.

742
01:09:39,129 --> 01:09:39,830
So for the December

743
01:09:47,886 --> 01:09:53,912
2016 claim, our gross amount for reimbursement was $77,753.

744
01:09:54,352 --> 01:10:00,238
Now from that, the state will reduce any commodity invoices that they send out to the district.

745
01:10:00,678 --> 01:10:11,869
So each schools are eligible for getting commodity, meat items, different available items that the state provides a list for, and we're able to

746
01:10:12,347 --> 01:10:15,028
take advantage of it at the lowest cost possible.

747
01:10:15,448 --> 01:10:19,268
And they will automatically dock our reimbursement claim.

748
01:10:19,728 --> 01:10:26,950
So even though it looks as though we get just straight reimbursement, they do come back and they charge off for commodity invoices.

749
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:38,052
So in terms of our school lunch reimbursement program, those amounts have increased coming back to the district.

750
01:10:38,936 --> 01:10:43,000
The cost for paid students must at least mirror the federal guidelines.

751
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:57,573
So it is necessary and we're requesting to increase the prices for two reasons in fiscal year 18, which is to remain compliant and consistent with federal guidelines so that we don't jeopardize our reimbursement.

752
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:01,557
And two, for the anticipated increase in food

753
01:11:02,017 --> 01:11:05,939
food costs and pending labor contract negotiation impacts.

754
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:23,870
So it's also important to note that any changes affect the paid portion of our student population and the district will continue to educate and inform families at various opportunities that service plans are available that could qualify them for

755
01:11:24,482 --> 01:11:26,062
those free and reduced meals.

756
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:31,323
So that's one really important factor that we continue to look at.

757
01:11:31,784 --> 01:11:49,087
And I think it was important to provide this information early in the school year so that we have the discussion and it's identified that, you know, we're going to maintain the costs in this fiscal year, but we really do need to look at the changes for fiscal year 18.

758
01:11:50,107 --> 01:11:53,128
And the recommendation that we have provided is

759
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:59,171
for the breakfast opportunity of $1.50 per breakfast at each location.

760
01:12:00,051 --> 01:12:06,172
For the elementary lunches, increasing that to $3 per meal, and at the middle and high to $3.25.

761
01:12:07,213 --> 01:12:20,215
This will get us closer in line with our reimbursement rate, and it will also provide new opportunities to engage and have potentials for some hot meal options at the breakfast

762
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:26,616
and getting, uh, taking advantage of additional resources as, as we're able to serve more meals.

763
01:12:28,057 --> 01:12:28,838
Mr. Benedetto.

764
01:12:28,918 --> 01:12:29,378
Thank you.

765
01:12:29,418 --> 01:12:30,219
Thank you for the report.

766
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:30,800
It's great.

767
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:37,526
Um, so if we didn't raise our prices, would we still meet the minimum?

768
01:12:38,807 --> 01:12:44,253
We will be operating very close to a breakeven scenario and that's without any

769
01:12:46,705 --> 01:12:47,025
labor.

770
01:12:47,605 --> 01:12:47,865
OK.

771
01:12:49,326 --> 01:12:56,750
My only question reason for that question is I know that we're regulated to charge a certain amount and bring in a certain amount.

772
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,671
And that's why I asked for this report.

773
01:12:59,151 --> 01:13:02,533
But also I checked online.

774
01:13:02,573 --> 01:13:11,077
I saw the pricing and I really like that you kept it only 25 cents for breakfast increase 25 cents for lunch and 25 cents for the high school.

775
01:13:11,577 --> 01:13:13,818
Like just just 25 cents increase.

776
01:13:13,878 --> 01:13:14,879
It's not a huge amount.

777
01:13:15,501 --> 01:13:21,025
and it's not three years from now and we're way behind and we have to raise it $2 a meal.

778
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:28,051
But I did look on a few of our neighboring communities and how much they're charging.

779
01:13:28,511 --> 01:13:36,938
So Malden currently is charging $1 for breakfast, $2.55 for lunch and $2.78 for the middle high school.

780
01:13:37,639 --> 01:13:42,142
Somerville has all free breakfast throughout their community and they charge $2.75 for lunch.

781
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:48,554
Everett is now, there's two prices for breakfast.

782
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:53,715
It's either 125, I think, for the very young grades, and then 150 for the rest of the community.

783
01:13:54,155 --> 01:13:58,976
They're currently at 275 for lunch, same as us, and $3.

784
01:13:59,816 --> 01:14:05,217
So they're exactly where we are right now, and we're in line with a neighboring.

785
01:14:06,777 --> 01:14:09,657
Some of them, these are their prices for next year as well.

786
01:14:09,717 --> 01:14:10,818
It's on their websites.

787
01:14:11,298 --> 01:14:12,898
I did a quick query.

788
01:14:13,755 --> 01:14:17,617
this afternoon to just really compare where we are and where not.

789
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:30,225
You know, it's always really difficult to raise prices on families because every day when you're packing up $3 for lunch and an extra buck 50 for breakfast, it's a lot to pull out of your wallet every morning.

790
01:14:30,565 --> 01:14:42,852
And I'm very cautious about doing this, but I want to make sure that, you know, we stay within the federal guidelines and get as much money back to the community to feed all of our students in an appropriate, and we're required to do that as well.

791
01:14:44,152 --> 01:14:46,553
So, you know, it's a hard call.

792
01:14:46,673 --> 01:14:49,614
I mean, $0.25, I think, is very reasonable.

793
01:14:50,094 --> 01:14:53,575
But at the same time, it's always difficult to raise this.

794
01:14:53,635 --> 01:14:54,636
I don't think it is.

795
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,016
So there are a couple of things we've just got to keep in mind.

796
01:14:57,637 --> 01:15:05,959
First of all, we have to stay compliant with the fact the federal government will give us a certain amount of money per student on free and reduced.

797
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:08,260
If we ask our paid students to pay less,

798
01:15:08,908 --> 01:15:15,631
federal government's comeback is that we are subsidizing students who are not eligible for a free or reduced meal.

799
01:15:16,051 --> 01:15:23,835
So we have to at least meet that in order to stay in compliance, because otherwise the government's saying, well, we're paying you for students who can afford to pay for it.

800
01:15:24,455 --> 01:15:25,276
That's one piece.

801
01:15:25,316 --> 01:15:29,598
The second piece that we've got to keep in mind is that the U.S.

802
01:15:29,618 --> 01:15:33,360
Department of Agriculture has got a new administration in Washington.

803
01:15:35,045 --> 01:15:38,846
Recent signals are they're looking to make cuts in agencies like USDA.

804
01:15:39,486 --> 01:15:51,010
If they're making cuts in USDA, that could reduce the subsidies coming back to states, could reduce the commodities and the like, and we could get through the back door for less availabilities to us.

805
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:52,730
So we've got to keep that in mind too.

806
01:15:53,270 --> 01:16:01,773
And three, we are in the process, we've had some discussions about negotiating with our cafeteria workers and what we've planned for them.

807
01:16:03,763 --> 01:16:06,864
modest as it is, will impact this as well.

808
01:16:06,884 --> 01:16:12,465
And if we don't plan for that, we will drive our program off the, you know, off the balance sheet.

809
01:16:12,525 --> 01:16:18,887
So there's several things going on and you know, no one likes to see price increases, but on the other hand, we're trying to be realistic.

810
01:16:19,527 --> 01:16:26,749
And, um, the reason I requested it specifically is cause we don't want to pit people very hard, like with a large increase.

811
01:16:26,789 --> 01:16:28,309
And that's what happened a few years ago.

812
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:31,932
when we hadn't been addressed in a few years.

813
01:16:32,332 --> 01:16:41,719
And I'd rather see a consistent review of this program to make sure we're in compliance and to make sure that we're not hitting people's pockets too deeply.

814
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:48,344
I mean, no matter what you do, I mean, 50 cents a day is still 250 a week.

815
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:56,649
And if you have multiple children, it's expensive and it's just not easy today to keep up with everything.

816
01:16:59,098 --> 01:17:04,622
Yeah, I just wanted to, I think the breakfast actually would be going up 40 cents per day.

817
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:05,182
Is that correct?

818
01:17:05,222 --> 01:17:06,823
Is it $1.10 to $1.50?

819
01:17:07,804 --> 01:17:11,406
So $2 a week times how many weeks are there in a school year?

820
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:14,969
30, 36, 36 times five is 180 days.

821
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:16,270
Yeah.

822
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:24,076
So 30, 40 weeks, general 36, you know, times two bucks, 72 bucks in the year just for the breakfast increase.

823
01:17:24,116 --> 01:17:26,097
So it's certainly with multiple kids adds up.

824
01:17:26,612 --> 01:17:28,513
if your student is having breakfast at school.

825
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:34,258
I think at this point, it's appropriate.

826
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,920
You're not asking us to take any action tonight, is that correct?

827
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,461
You can if you want.

828
01:17:40,382 --> 01:17:42,103
I mean, we're not against you taking action tonight.

829
01:17:42,123 --> 01:17:42,904
We think it's real.

830
01:17:43,624 --> 01:17:45,166
But if you need more time to think about it.

831
01:17:45,186 --> 01:17:46,487
Do you want to lay it on the table?

832
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:55,195
If I may follow up with just a little more data, in terms of the breakfast participation, it is half of what our lunch program is.

833
01:17:55,335 --> 01:17:59,659
So our families are not taking advantage of the breakfast program as much.

834
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:10,708
It would be a great opportunity to encourage that so that we could offer some hot meal options and really engage in that.

835
01:18:11,308 --> 01:18:15,572
Additionally, with the SUP program, the Community Eligibility Program, which our

836
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:26,953
community towns that are able to take advantage of that, that is upwards of over 70% low-income, free and reduced capacity.

837
01:18:27,053 --> 01:18:43,497
So where it seems beneficial, it's almost a double-edged sword because you really have a true significant disadvantaged group where it's beneficial for all in one capacity.

838
01:18:43,557 --> 01:18:45,618
However, there's a lot to get to that.

839
01:18:47,102 --> 01:19:02,351
My hope is to continue to encourage and educate families on the services that are out there available, whereby it automatically qualifies them for a free lunch, and there's not the need to fill out an additional application.

840
01:19:02,711 --> 01:19:13,798
So that is my push as school nutrition advisor over the food service department, and that's something that I advocate, and I'm very strong about feeding our kids.

841
01:19:16,822 --> 01:19:18,023
Is there a motion on the floor?

842
01:19:18,043 --> 01:19:19,504
I'll move the paper.

843
01:19:20,164 --> 01:19:21,445
Motion for approval of the paper.

844
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:22,226
Is there a second?

845
01:19:22,806 --> 01:19:25,348
A motion for approval of the right structure.

846
01:19:25,368 --> 01:19:26,749
Is there a second on the floor?

847
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:28,130
Second.

848
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:29,931
Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

849
01:19:31,092 --> 01:19:31,232
Ms.

850
01:19:31,272 --> 01:19:32,513
Van de Kloot, did you wish to speak?

851
01:19:32,773 --> 01:19:34,114
I do.

852
01:19:34,515 --> 01:19:37,777
I'm not asking for a subcommittee meeting

853
01:19:38,452 --> 01:19:39,293
on the rate hike.

854
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:50,444
However, I am asking, it was traditional that we met somewhere along the line during the school year with the school lunch people, and it seems like it's been a long time since we've done that.

855
01:19:52,646 --> 01:19:56,590
I don't know whether at some point or another there used to be an advisory committee or whatever.

856
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:58,732
Does any of that exist anymore?

857
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,311
We can certainly do it.

858
01:20:00,411 --> 01:20:09,378
I mean, you know, I think it's, it's always informative to learn about all the things going on, but from a financial standpoint, this report was developed in conjunction with them.

859
01:20:09,878 --> 01:20:12,060
Again, I'm not asking on it from a financial level.

860
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:16,523
I'm just learning about nutrition and learning about what's going on.

861
01:20:16,543 --> 01:20:16,743
Sure.

862
01:20:16,763 --> 01:20:17,363
We can always send it.

863
01:20:17,443 --> 01:20:18,264
It's been a long time.

864
01:20:18,284 --> 01:20:20,866
There's a motion on the floor.

865
01:20:20,886 --> 01:20:22,587
Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

866
01:20:22,687 --> 01:20:23,548
Roll call vote.

867
01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:25,549
Mrs. Cunha.

868
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:26,090
Yes.

869
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:27,641
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

870
01:20:27,761 --> 01:20:28,001
Yes.

871
01:20:28,601 --> 01:20:29,181
Mrs. Kretsch?

872
01:20:29,622 --> 01:20:29,822
Yes.

873
01:20:30,102 --> 01:20:30,802
Mrs. McStone?

874
01:20:31,022 --> 01:20:31,243
Yes.

875
01:20:31,643 --> 01:20:32,243
Mr. Skerry?

876
01:20:32,323 --> 01:20:32,543
Yes.

877
01:20:32,904 --> 01:20:33,584
Mrs. Vander Kloot?

878
01:20:33,624 --> 01:20:33,844
Yes.

879
01:20:33,944 --> 01:20:34,404
Mayor Burke?

880
01:20:34,564 --> 01:20:34,785
Yes.

881
01:20:34,845 --> 01:20:36,386
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

882
01:20:36,426 --> 01:20:37,186
Motion passes.

883
01:20:37,206 --> 01:20:39,387
The grade structure is adopted for fiscal 18.

884
01:20:40,148 --> 01:20:40,508
Thank you.

885
01:20:41,408 --> 01:20:50,354
Thank you.

886
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:51,634
OK.

887
01:20:51,734 --> 01:20:56,357
Also, while we're in suspension, item six, recommendation to approve science department enrichment trip.

888
01:20:56,848 --> 01:20:57,549
Mr. Seery.

889
01:20:57,569 --> 01:21:08,616
Good evening.

890
01:21:09,076 --> 01:21:09,637
Good evening.

891
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:20,664
I'm here this evening to request approval for the science sponsored field trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida in February 2018.

892
01:21:21,105 --> 01:21:22,966
This trip was taken last year.

893
01:21:26,326 --> 01:21:32,615
With the great success, we're hoping to run a similar program in February.

894
01:21:34,057 --> 01:21:41,087
Obviously there are other outside pending concerns that the committee will decide upon, but the application.

895
01:21:41,935 --> 01:21:51,978
And the breakdown of the cost and sort of a summary of what the proposal is for the next year has been provided in the packet.

896
01:21:52,438 --> 01:21:54,899
And I'm simply here to answer questions if you have any.

897
01:21:55,339 --> 01:21:56,059
Motion to approve.

898
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:59,640
The health policy that will be drafted, obviously, fiscally.

899
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,921
This is for 18, February of 18.

900
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:04,181
Yes, February of 2018.

901
01:22:04,241 --> 01:22:04,902
Motion to approve.

902
01:22:04,922 --> 01:22:05,982
Motion to approve by Ms.

903
01:22:06,002 --> 01:22:07,782
Vanden Heuvel, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

904
01:22:09,003 --> 01:22:09,543
Roll call.

905
01:22:12,313 --> 01:22:12,993
I had one question.

906
01:22:14,153 --> 01:22:14,974
Can I be a chaperone?

907
01:22:15,994 --> 01:22:18,254
That's a great verb.

908
01:22:18,274 --> 01:22:19,255
Mrs. Cunha?

909
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:21,675
I'm sure she'll need some help there.

910
01:22:22,095 --> 01:22:22,475
Yes.

911
01:22:23,656 --> 01:22:24,476
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

912
01:22:25,296 --> 01:22:25,516
Yes.

913
01:22:26,156 --> 01:22:26,676
Mrs. Kratz?

914
01:22:26,896 --> 01:22:27,076
Yes.

915
01:22:27,336 --> 01:22:27,997
Mrs. McStone?

916
01:22:28,137 --> 01:22:28,337
Yes.

917
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:29,237
Mr. Skerry?

918
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:29,577
Yes.

919
01:22:29,837 --> 01:22:30,437
Mrs. Vanderquist?

920
01:22:30,457 --> 01:22:30,657
Yes.

921
01:22:30,717 --> 01:22:31,057
Mayor Burke?

922
01:22:31,357 --> 01:22:31,597
Yes.

923
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:33,878
Abiding in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

924
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:35,982
Thank you and have a great night.

925
01:22:36,043 --> 01:22:37,044
You too.

926
01:22:37,444 --> 01:22:41,710
Be safe on item one report on building bridges to kindergarten.

927
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:46,335
Mr. Superintendent calling upon our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.

928
01:22:47,657 --> 01:22:49,840
Good evening everyone.

929
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:58,441
I'm trying to be responsive to your request to have our Bridges to Kindergarten earlier than we've had it in the past few years.

930
01:22:59,161 --> 01:23:03,602
So we have backed it up almost two months to March.

931
01:23:04,102 --> 01:23:10,424
So Medford Public Schools would like to invite parents to our Building Bridges to Kindergarten information nights.

932
01:23:11,204 --> 01:23:17,710
Children who will be five years old by August 31st can register at the Parent Information Center at Medford High School.

933
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:26,537
Registration begins on Monday, March 6th, and the Parent Information Center is open Monday through Friday from 7.30 a.m.

934
01:23:27,017 --> 01:23:29,299
until 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

935
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:34,964
There will be extended hours on two evenings this year instead of just one until 6.30 p.m.

936
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,361
So we're going to have three informational nights.

937
01:23:39,461 --> 01:23:50,484
Usually we have two, but because we're starting early, I'm thinking we'll have two at Medford High School, and then I rotate through the elementary schools, and this year, it's going to be at the Columbus Elementary School.

938
01:23:52,324 --> 01:24:04,628
It will be in the Medford High School Library from seven to eight on March 7th and on April 12th, and then on Thursday, May 4th, from seven to eight, at the Columbus Elementary School cafeteria.

939
01:24:05,898 --> 01:24:11,563
We always have requests for childcare, and if people need some interpreters, they're available as well.

940
01:24:12,604 --> 01:24:20,791
At the high school, you would contact Marie Cassidy, and the request should be submitted at least a week beforehand.

941
01:24:22,012 --> 01:24:27,177
These letters, or something similar to this letter, will be going out to all of our parents shortly.

942
01:24:28,345 --> 01:24:31,767
These meetings will provide families with an overview of kindergarten.

943
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:32,667
Ms.

944
01:24:32,707 --> 01:24:46,775
Maria Marcelli, who is a Brooks School kindergarten teacher for almost 20 years, shows a PowerPoint demonstration of our little kiddos in school, in kindergarten classrooms, and it shows what the centers look like.

945
01:24:47,535 --> 01:24:54,302
She discusses the various content areas and we assist parents in navigating through their first year.

946
01:24:54,322 --> 01:25:07,514
You can always tell the very nervous parents because they have a multitude of questions and usually it revolves around how do they go to the bathroom and how do they get snack and is there somebody there to help them with that.

947
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:14,679
So parents will be able to register their children at any time after March 6th.

948
01:25:14,759 --> 01:25:20,730
I know we give specific dates and specific weeks, but we're open all through the summer as well.

949
01:25:22,436 --> 01:25:30,764
You can go during April vacation on Tuesday and Wednesday, April 18th and 19th from 8 o'clock to 12 o'clock.

950
01:25:31,525 --> 01:25:33,067
Parents can also call Ms.

951
01:25:33,207 --> 01:25:35,869
Ibrahim to make an appointment or email her.

952
01:25:35,909 --> 01:25:39,053
Sometimes it's easier to set up an appointment with Ms.

953
01:25:39,153 --> 01:25:40,754
Ibrahim at the Parent Information Center.

954
01:25:42,058 --> 01:25:54,342
Shelly Gross will be there from our early childhood to inform parents about the before and after school programming that we have, busing, and any early childhood development questions.

955
01:25:55,502 --> 01:26:00,484
We always leave at least a half an hour to 45 minutes for questions for our parents.

956
01:26:01,764 --> 01:26:06,326
And the parents will be receiving letters and more information following.

957
01:26:07,106 --> 01:26:10,007
Attached to your information is a flyer that's going to go out.

958
01:26:10,928 --> 01:26:12,149
to all of our families.

959
01:26:12,829 --> 01:26:19,833
We're in the process now of putting together packets for our kindergarten families and hopefully we get them started with early registration.

960
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:21,087
Very good.

961
01:26:21,207 --> 01:26:22,028
Thank you very much.

962
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:27,413
Is there a motion?

963
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:29,354
Can I just make one suggestion?

964
01:26:29,454 --> 01:26:32,257
Could the parent information sent to phone number be on this?

965
01:26:32,377 --> 01:26:33,077
Absolutely.

966
01:26:33,298 --> 01:26:34,559
So this paper is what we get.

967
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:36,640
Declan will be going to kindergarten.

968
01:26:37,321 --> 01:26:40,624
So the parent, I can put the telephone number on this definitely.

969
01:26:40,644 --> 01:26:41,264
I think that would help.

970
01:26:41,585 --> 01:26:45,288
The letter that goes out will also have contact information.

971
01:26:45,348 --> 01:26:46,669
I didn't know if they just got this fire.

972
01:26:47,608 --> 01:26:48,668
The parents, right?

973
01:26:48,768 --> 01:26:50,649
So there is a letter that goes with this file?

974
01:26:50,669 --> 01:26:52,370
There is a letter that goes with this as well.

975
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,350
I'll make sure it's on this.

976
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:54,550
Sure.

977
01:26:55,091 --> 01:26:55,531
Very good.

978
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:57,972
On the motion to receive and place on file by Ms.

979
01:26:58,012 --> 01:26:59,352
Mustone, seconded by Ms.

980
01:26:59,412 --> 01:26:59,872
Cuno.

981
01:26:59,992 --> 01:27:00,733
All those in favor?

982
01:27:01,073 --> 01:27:01,353
Aye.

983
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:02,353
All those opposed?

984
01:27:03,354 --> 01:27:04,194
Motion passes.

985
01:27:06,475 --> 01:27:06,955
Okay.

986
01:27:08,422 --> 01:27:16,806
We have a report of committees which correlate to our item for old business, which was on our last school committee agenda.

987
01:27:17,286 --> 01:27:30,332
We had a recommendation to formally approve the Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School merger into one local education state code, LEA code, as you said during our meetings.

988
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:34,414
And if we could also take the committee of the whole report from last week.

989
01:27:34,914 --> 01:27:56,430
We had Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio did a presentation last week describing the fundamental reasons for merging this LEA number and it has a host of benefits to us including some efficiencies, the ability to have one database for all students so that grading and scheduling can be done

990
01:27:56,943 --> 01:28:02,105
in one spot as opposed to people having to shift from one program into another.

991
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:10,169
So there was a motion at our committee, the whole, that we adopt the merger of the two into the one LE number.

992
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:14,191
And is there a motion to accept the committee report as presented?

993
01:28:14,671 --> 01:28:16,452
Motion to accept the committee report.

994
01:28:16,752 --> 01:28:18,253
And I just have one caveat.

995
01:28:20,185 --> 01:28:21,526
It's the third time we've received this.

996
01:28:22,407 --> 01:28:31,253
And just, you know, I don't like to tell stories out of school, but every year there's always a complaint that there's never enough paper to go around at the end of the year.

997
01:28:32,054 --> 01:28:38,698
Yeah, but we start printing on two sides.

998
01:28:38,778 --> 01:28:47,545
I offered a motion some years ago, Mr. Superintendent, once in a while it's done, but I think in the nature of efficiency and transparency, a lot of these,

999
01:28:48,392 --> 01:28:51,094
This information we received could be printed on both sides.

1000
01:28:51,154 --> 01:28:51,715
Good point.

1001
01:28:51,755 --> 01:28:52,535
Mr. Scary.

1002
01:28:52,756 --> 01:28:55,598
Well, how did they agree with you?

1003
01:28:55,678 --> 01:29:05,205
There's a motion to receive the committee report during that committee, the whole second seconded by all those in favor.

1004
01:29:05,946 --> 01:29:06,667
All those opposed.

1005
01:29:06,747 --> 01:29:07,287
Roll call.

1006
01:29:08,088 --> 01:29:08,468
Roll call.

1007
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:15,040
Mrs. Cuneo.

1008
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,061
Yes.

1009
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:17,542
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

1010
01:29:17,722 --> 01:29:17,982
Yes.

1011
01:29:18,342 --> 01:29:18,943
Mrs. Kretz.

1012
01:29:19,163 --> 01:29:19,363
Yes.

1013
01:29:19,783 --> 01:29:20,584
Mrs. McStone.

1014
01:29:20,784 --> 01:29:20,984
Yes.

1015
01:29:21,304 --> 01:29:21,905
Mr. Skerry.

1016
01:29:21,965 --> 01:29:22,225
Yes.

1017
01:29:22,505 --> 01:29:23,246
Mrs. Vander Vliet.

1018
01:29:23,286 --> 01:29:23,546
Yes.

1019
01:29:23,626 --> 01:29:24,046
Mayor Burke.

1020
01:29:24,367 --> 01:29:24,627
Yes.

1021
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:26,388
I'm in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1022
01:29:26,828 --> 01:29:31,091
The motion to accept the committee report as filed is so adopted.

1023
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:38,257
I'm now on the recommendation to formally approve the merger into one local education state code by Mr. Skerry.

1024
01:29:38,657 --> 01:29:42,700
Mayor, just before we take that vote, just through you to the superintendent,

1025
01:29:43,622 --> 01:29:54,491
Before the end of the school year and the budget hits us, could we please have a overview of what's going to happen and if there's going to be any shift in personnel or what it's going to cost?

1026
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:55,932
Cost analysis.

1027
01:29:55,952 --> 01:29:57,394
We'll put that as part of the budget.

1028
01:29:57,534 --> 01:29:59,095
It should be efficiencies gained from it.

1029
01:29:59,115 --> 01:30:00,576
It could be some efficiencies.

1030
01:30:00,596 --> 01:30:03,238
But I hope we would see something long before the budget.

1031
01:30:03,799 --> 01:30:04,019
Okay.

1032
01:30:04,459 --> 01:30:04,780
Thank you.

1033
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:09,644
Very good roll call vote on the formal acceptance of the combined LEA number for both schools.

1034
01:30:11,799 --> 01:30:12,439
Mrs. Cuneo?

1035
01:30:12,759 --> 01:30:13,019
Yes.

1036
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,139
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

1037
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:14,419
Yes.

1038
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:15,340
Mrs. Kratz?

1039
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:15,660
Yes.

1040
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:16,860
Mrs. McStone?

1041
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:17,260
Yes.

1042
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,340
Mr. Scurry?

1043
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:18,780
Yes.

1044
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:19,640
Mrs. Vander Kloot?

1045
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:19,940
Yes.

1046
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:20,721
Mayor Burke?

1047
01:30:20,861 --> 01:30:21,081
Yes.

1048
01:30:21,121 --> 01:30:22,721
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1049
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:23,721
The motion passes.

1050
01:30:24,521 --> 01:30:29,002
And thank you to Dr. Riccio and Perella for that informative session last week.

1051
01:30:29,742 --> 01:30:34,623
Lastly, on reports, is the report on state fiscal year 2018 budget challenges.

1052
01:30:34,683 --> 01:30:35,043
Mr. Superintendent?

1053
01:30:35,063 --> 01:30:36,363
Accept the report and place it on file.

1054
01:30:36,483 --> 01:30:39,224
Is the motion to accept the report and place it on file?

1055
01:30:56,783 --> 01:31:12,070
Just to give you a little quick update on this because the governor will be speaking tomorrow night And there will be releases of the state budget His proposed budget and then the process will begin and so just to keep you informed as to what goes on because this is a

1056
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,561
What happens at the state level obviously impacts us.

1057
01:31:16,501 --> 01:31:19,122
So the governor is going to be speaking tomorrow night.

1058
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:28,325
Somewhere in the next little while, you will get some more details on that presentation.

1059
01:31:28,365 --> 01:31:38,489
But on January 13th, the Senate, the House, and the governor agreed on a revenue distribution, which is 3.9%, or approximately $1.02 billion more into next year from

1060
01:31:43,163 --> 01:31:46,086
taxation and other revenues from the state.

1061
01:31:47,287 --> 01:31:53,131
This is what we call a consensus budget guideline to help them produce budgets in each chamber.

1062
01:31:54,813 --> 01:31:59,877
The thing you have to understand is that you can project 3.9% increase.

1063
01:32:00,077 --> 01:32:02,059
Last year they projected 4.3.

1064
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:06,963
But to get to that number, they probably have to increase the revenue by even more.

1065
01:32:07,444 --> 01:32:09,045
And we'll guess that to about 5.5%.

1066
01:32:10,906 --> 01:32:13,508
something along that kind of line, because there are tax cuts.

1067
01:32:14,249 --> 01:32:19,153
There are other things that are one-time revenues that we used that won't be used again.

1068
01:32:19,913 --> 01:32:30,542
So even though they project that, they're now going to have to resolve what they've lost from revenue from the previous year or what they will lose with programs that maybe need more money.

1069
01:32:30,582 --> 01:32:38,849
So in our budget, for example, as salaries go up, you know, that factors into the increase in what we need to come up with.

1070
01:32:40,215 --> 01:32:41,116
It's not just revenue.

1071
01:32:41,136 --> 01:32:45,139
So there are at least six major factors you need to pay attention to going through.

1072
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:53,746
One is how much money the FY 2017 budget was dependent upon as temporary and one-time revenues that won't be available in fiscal 2018.

1073
01:32:53,966 --> 01:32:56,828
How much temporary money did they use?

1074
01:32:57,429 --> 01:32:59,751
Two, what accounts were underfunded in 2017?

1075
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:05,215
Things that they short-funded and they have to provide a supplemental to.

1076
01:33:05,915 --> 01:33:07,216
And they may need more money in 2018.

1077
01:33:08,967 --> 01:33:14,110
What is the actual cost of providing current service levels in fiscal 18?

1078
01:33:14,151 --> 01:33:16,572
Not more, current service levels.

1079
01:33:17,253 --> 01:33:19,874
What will be the actual growth in revenues for fiscal 2018?

1080
01:33:19,914 --> 01:33:24,658
Will there be new sources of sustainable revenue, not just one-time revenue?

1081
01:33:24,678 --> 01:33:26,419
You know, for example,

1082
01:33:27,724 --> 01:33:35,270
And if marijuana or other things like that were out there, there's money coming in, there's gambling issues, there's things like that that may generate hotel revenues, meal tax.

1083
01:33:35,731 --> 01:33:41,015
As things come in, we have to watch all of that stuff to see exactly what goes into the state coffers.

1084
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:44,538
What new initiatives, projects will be approved?

1085
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:47,040
They want to do something they've never done before.

1086
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:50,303
All of a sudden, that's a new program that has to be funded.

1087
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:55,668
Or maybe it won't be funded, and it'll be sent down to us to fund, placing new demands on the budget.

1088
01:33:56,777 --> 01:34:00,681
What previously funded items will be dropped or diminished?

1089
01:34:02,183 --> 01:34:05,126
What will be the impact of a new administration in Washington?

1090
01:34:05,987 --> 01:34:08,830
What states will gain or lose resource or policy changes?

1091
01:34:09,071 --> 01:34:10,092
Medicaid, Medicare.

1092
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:13,859
the way it's funded, the way it's done, health care.

1093
01:34:14,559 --> 01:34:16,560
All these things are going to have to be phased in.

1094
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:22,482
The governor's already talking about making some serious changes in health care, you were probably there, which could alter it.

1095
01:34:22,522 --> 01:34:38,028
The GIC numbers are coming to us now, and they're looking for more deductibles and other factors, premium increases that will affect teachers and possibly affect, and other employees, and possibly affect what we have to budget for our percentage.

1096
01:34:38,542 --> 01:34:42,043
So all those things have to come into from a state budget, so we're looking at this stuff now.

1097
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:53,287
It'll be at the center of our concerns, but any adverse state effect on the municipal budget as well, things that affect the municipal side of the budget, has an impact on us.

1098
01:34:54,447 --> 01:34:57,568
The mayor's got one whole budget to look at.

1099
01:34:58,348 --> 01:35:01,009
We want what we want, he's gonna look at the whole city.

1100
01:35:01,832 --> 01:35:04,533
And that could be something that impacts us as well.

1101
01:35:05,213 --> 01:35:06,713
Chapter 70 allocations.

1102
01:35:07,174 --> 01:35:10,294
The governor was talking about $95 million.

1103
01:35:10,915 --> 01:35:12,835
He thinks that's new money.

1104
01:35:12,895 --> 01:35:14,576
That, to us, is no new money.

1105
01:35:15,216 --> 01:35:16,036
That's like $20.

1106
01:35:16,136 --> 01:35:17,616
Last year, we got $55.

1107
01:35:18,477 --> 01:35:22,738
And it's well below what the foundation-level budget review committees were proposing.

1108
01:35:22,798 --> 01:35:27,539
So that's not doing us much good unless it gets better on the foundation level.

1109
01:35:28,059 --> 01:35:30,340
We are a hold-harmless district.

1110
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:39,575
Because of where we are, we're going to get a certain amount of money that we got last year, plus minimum aid, which could be anywhere from $20 to $55.

1111
01:35:39,816 --> 01:35:41,917
That's the way it works.

1112
01:35:42,257 --> 01:35:48,722
There may be some other pockets, but, for example, last year, you know, you were concerned about the kindergarten money not coming in.

1113
01:35:50,186 --> 01:35:54,109
Other things that may not come in, other budgets that could get sliced, we have to pay attention to.

1114
01:35:54,129 --> 01:35:57,010
The sped circuit breaker is now being discussed.

1115
01:35:57,030 --> 01:36:00,252
There's a legislative briefing on February 2nd or 3rd.

1116
01:36:00,313 --> 01:36:02,594
I forget which date it is exactly right now that I'll attend.

1117
01:36:03,334 --> 01:36:04,575
I'm part of that coalition.

1118
01:36:05,296 --> 01:36:09,378
We typically get 75% above the threshold of four times foundation.

1119
01:36:09,819 --> 01:36:15,562
But four times foundation goes up every year, so that means our eligibility gets shortchanged a little bit.

1120
01:36:16,023 --> 01:36:16,643
If they don't give us 75%,

1121
01:36:18,817 --> 01:36:24,000
That affects what we can put into the pie for special needs, extraordinary tuitions.

1122
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,482
So all those things are, you know, part of our calculus.

1123
01:36:28,142 --> 01:36:32,044
Charter school reimbursements have been underfunded for a number of years now.

1124
01:36:32,705 --> 01:36:33,945
They didn't increase last year.

1125
01:36:34,566 --> 01:36:43,991
There won't be any major increase in the number of charter schools, but there will be some more charter schools because the state board is going to be discussing them in the next couple of weeks at their board meeting.

1126
01:36:44,651 --> 01:36:46,172
And the more you have,

1127
01:36:46,671 --> 01:36:50,433
The more pupils that you have statewide, the more the distribution takes place.

1128
01:36:50,753 --> 01:36:53,614
And if you only have the same pot of money, it gets spread out.

1129
01:36:54,474 --> 01:36:55,995
So we'll have to see where that takes that.

1130
01:36:56,035 --> 01:37:00,817
We brought youngsters back to Medford last year, and we paid more.

1131
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:03,338
So it's a tricky formula.

1132
01:37:03,398 --> 01:37:04,079
It's got to be what?

1133
01:37:04,259 --> 01:37:08,100
Out-of-district transportation costs for non-resident students to Minutemen.

1134
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,642
The reimbursement level came down again this year.

1135
01:37:13,302 --> 01:37:18,886
Hopefully it'll be sustained, but if that gets knocked out of the budget, it could be $20,000, $30,000 out of our pocket.

1136
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:21,328
Homeless funding has always been underfunded.

1137
01:37:22,188 --> 01:37:32,315
The various grant programs, including early childhood, kindergarten, academic support, vocational education, and substance abuse prevention, the new opiate bill, it's not funded as far as I can see.

1138
01:37:32,335 --> 01:37:35,838
I don't know who's funding that, but we all have responsibilities on it.

1139
01:37:36,778 --> 01:37:41,479
And will there be any new mandated programs that emerge from legislative deliberations?

1140
01:37:42,459 --> 01:37:45,740
So this is a snapshot of some of the challenges ahead.

1141
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,680
I want you to be aware of it.

1142
01:37:49,361 --> 01:37:55,302
We don't know, you know, all the facts right now, but this is the stuff that we'll process every week, every day.

1143
01:37:55,322 --> 01:37:58,283
I get newsletters and materials, speak to people.

1144
01:37:58,863 --> 01:38:04,044
It's the kind of stuff I have to do on a regular basis to see what's likely to happen or not likely to happen.

1145
01:38:04,761 --> 01:38:12,102
superintendents, teachers, unions, all kinds of people will be in there lobbying to keep money at a certain level or to get more money.

1146
01:38:12,782 --> 01:38:14,863
But they'll all be clashing with each other.

1147
01:38:15,323 --> 01:38:25,705
And the hard question is, is that what can happen that's new if the revenue growth is only at a certain level and one time revenues are either not available.

1148
01:38:26,385 --> 01:38:27,905
We always hear about the rainy day fund.

1149
01:38:27,925 --> 01:38:30,305
No one likes to dip into that unless they absolutely have to.

1150
01:38:31,286 --> 01:38:33,486
Um, we don't know what capital gains will do for,

1151
01:38:34,367 --> 01:38:37,611
you know, revenue into the city, I mean into state rather, all that's there.

1152
01:38:37,691 --> 01:38:43,197
And we also don't know what Washington will change in the next year and what it might affect.

1153
01:38:43,237 --> 01:38:52,628
Although I think they're on a one year delay, it doesn't seem much change in some things through this year, but the year after it could have some impact on us.

1154
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:59,382
So there's a lot of factors for us to pay attention to, but I want to get you in the water and start you talking about it as we move forward.

1155
01:38:59,562 --> 01:39:01,283
The numbers should start to circulate out.

1156
01:39:01,363 --> 01:39:07,265
We're expecting the cherry shoots, possibly midweek, and that kind of spells out the governor's idea of what we'll be getting.

1157
01:39:07,305 --> 01:39:12,287
And then we wait for the house ways and means, really, is what we use for the budget to set our budget numbers.

1158
01:39:12,867 --> 01:39:14,928
So they'll all be coming in stride.

1159
01:39:16,322 --> 01:39:17,443
And there are other funds, too.

1160
01:39:17,483 --> 01:39:18,384
Now, we've talked about it.

1161
01:39:18,424 --> 01:39:21,486
There are funds that come from special sources, bond bills and the like.

1162
01:39:22,126 --> 01:39:26,009
So, for example, in our vocational, you've seen money come to us from certain grants.

1163
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:28,351
Some of those things are independent of this budget.

1164
01:39:29,132 --> 01:39:31,053
Some of the things will be dependent on this budget.

1165
01:39:31,594 --> 01:39:32,454
So... Very good.

1166
01:39:32,654 --> 01:39:33,595
Thank you for the report.

1167
01:39:33,615 --> 01:39:37,738
Is the motion to receive in place on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1168
01:39:37,838 --> 01:39:38,679

The motion carries.

We do have...

1173
01:39:44,755 --> 01:39:45,936
We have some new business.

1174
01:39:47,498 --> 01:39:49,120
New business, school committee resolution.

1175
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:56,427
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee send its best wishes to former Medford High School headmaster, Salvatore Todaro, on the occasion of its 80th birthday.

1176
01:39:56,447 --> 01:39:58,529
Happy birthday, Mr. Todaro.

1177
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:01,072
School committee resolution.

1178
01:40:01,691 --> 01:40:02,232
Oh, I'm sorry.

1179
01:40:02,752 --> 01:40:04,834

Motion carries.

Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Charles Driscoll.

1186

Mr. Driscoll was a Medford High School boys hockey coach for many years.

1187
01:40:17,565 --> 01:40:22,970
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Camille Lucci.

1188
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:27,277
Mrs. Lucci was the wife of the late Tony Lucci, owner of Medford Sporting Goods.

1189
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:31,445
The Luccis were generous supporters of the students in Medford for many years.

1190
01:40:31,465 --> 01:40:35,192
Mrs. Lucci was the mother of former elementary teacher Debbie Ryan.

1191
01:40:36,303 --> 01:40:41,744
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Katina Tina Houlihan.

1192
01:40:41,864 --> 01:40:48,445
Mrs. Houlihan was the former secretary to Fire Chief McCabe and also the secretary of the Davenport Elementary School for many years.

1193
01:40:49,386 --> 01:40:53,726
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Mary Gabrelas.

1194
01:40:53,906 --> 01:40:57,467

1195
01:40:57,947 --> 01:41:01,328

1196

And lastly, offered by Mr. Scarry, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Dominic Vincenzo.

01:41:10,235 --> 01:41:17,342

1198
01:41:17,882 --> 01:41:21,806
All please rise and take a moment of silence on the passing of these Medford residents.

1199
01:41:36,516 --> 01:41:37,917
We have one announcement.

1200
01:41:37,957 --> 01:41:41,980
I just want to make sure that we get this clear.

1201
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,683
The committee of the whole meeting is Wednesday evening.

1202
01:41:45,743 --> 01:41:48,085
Unfortunately, on the notice, we put Tuesday the 25th.

1203
01:41:48,205 --> 01:41:48,966
It's Wednesday.

1204
01:41:49,006 --> 01:41:49,566
Wednesday.

1205
01:41:50,427 --> 01:41:52,748
Tuesday the 25th, but we have the proper date.

1206
01:41:52,808 --> 01:41:53,149
Wednesday.

1207
01:41:54,896 --> 01:42:05,466
The committee of the whole to discuss inclusion with Medford's special education path will be 6.30 in the superintendent's conference room at Medford High School on Wednesday, January 25, 2017, 6.30.

1208
01:42:08,829 --> 01:42:13,713
And lastly, as you may be aware, this is public school week.

1209
01:42:14,534 --> 01:42:17,917
So we have a proclamation we'd like to circulate to the members of the school committee.

1210
01:42:18,137 --> 01:42:20,980
I could read it really quickly if you so choose.

1211
01:42:24,298 --> 01:42:28,379
Whereas all children in the City of Medford should have access to the highest quality education possible.

1212
01:42:28,419 --> 01:42:35,441
And whereas the City of Medford recognizes the important role that an effective education plays in preparing all students in Medford to be successful adults.

1213
01:42:35,942 --> 01:42:40,503
And whereas quality education is critically important to the economic vitality of the City of Medford.

1214
01:42:40,963 --> 01:42:44,244
And whereas the City of Medford is home to quality public schools for our children.

1215
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:50,246
Whereas public education not only helps to diversify our economy but also enhances the vibrancy of our community.

1216
01:42:50,826 --> 01:43:05,275
Whereas the City of Medford has many high-quality teaching professionals who are committed to educating our children, and whereas public schools are celebrated across the country by millions of students, parents, educators, schools, and organizations to raise awareness of the need for effective public schools.

1217
01:43:05,775 --> 01:43:18,903
Now, therefore, we, the Medford School Committee, Medford, Massachusetts, do hereby recognize January 22nd to the 28th, 2017, as the City of Medford Public Schools Week and call this observance to the attention of all our citizens.

1218
01:43:19,783 --> 01:43:21,084
Is there a motion for approval?

1219
01:43:21,124 --> 01:43:22,464
Motion for approval.

1220
01:43:22,484 --> 01:43:24,646
By the whole school committee, motion for approval.

1221
01:43:24,666 --> 01:43:25,926
All those in favor?

1222
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:26,447
Aye.

1223
01:43:26,507 --> 01:43:27,167
All those opposed?

1224
01:43:27,187 --> 01:43:29,068
The motion passes and we'll pass this around.

1225
01:43:29,488 --> 01:43:30,108
One more announcement.

1226
01:43:30,749 --> 01:43:32,230
One more announcement, Mr. Superintendent.

1227
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:40,554
OK, so on Sunday, the 27th, there's community conversations in the afternoon in front of Caron Theater, right?

1228
01:43:40,634 --> 01:43:40,894
The 29th.

1229
01:43:40,934 --> 01:43:41,154
29th.

1230
01:43:41,394 --> 01:43:41,454
29th.

1231
01:43:41,494 --> 01:43:41,574
29th?

1232
01:43:41,594 --> 01:43:44,536
Yes, Sunday afternoon.

1233
01:43:44,576 --> 01:43:45,276
Sunday afternoon.

1234
01:43:45,296 --> 01:43:46,397
I'll get the dates.

1235
01:43:47,014 --> 01:43:49,135
29th on Sunday afternoon, so it's from 2 to 4.

1236
01:43:50,276 --> 01:43:54,258
So it's an important activity.

1237
01:43:54,278 --> 01:44:03,644
I also want to tell you that we'll put on the web, the students created a beautiful video on Martin Luther King Day.

1238
01:44:04,264 --> 01:44:06,305
And I want to put that up there so you can look for that.

1239
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:12,469
It's a great tribute to them and their work and the way they express themselves.

1240
01:44:13,503 --> 01:44:18,267
And also tomorrow night, we are starting forums to meet your city hall.

1241
01:44:18,287 --> 01:44:20,769
It'll be at the library tomorrow night at 6 o'clock.

1242
01:44:21,449 --> 01:44:24,451
And the finance group will be leading the discussion.

1243
01:44:24,471 --> 01:44:29,975
And that includes the assessor, the auditor, the treasurer, as well as procurement officer.

1244
01:44:29,995 --> 01:44:32,837
So if you have some time tomorrow night, Wednesday night, I'm sorry.

1245
01:44:33,098 --> 01:44:34,799
