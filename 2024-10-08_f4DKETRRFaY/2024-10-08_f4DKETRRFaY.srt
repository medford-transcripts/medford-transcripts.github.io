[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everyone.

16
02:21:25,929 --> 02:21:27,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to tonight's school committee meeting.

17
02:21:29,258 --> 02:21:37,083
[SPEAKER_01]: As the leaves have begun to change color, today's rain put a slight halt to what was a beautiful stretch of fall weather here in Medford.

18
02:21:38,124 --> 02:21:53,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you have participated in New England fall classics, such as apple picking, scarecrow designing, or escaping a challenging corn maze, I hope you and your families are able to enjoy the autumn beauties of what Middlesex County has to offer.

19
02:21:55,355 --> 02:22:06,579
[SPEAKER_01]: October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time to honor those affected by breast cancer and to spread awareness about early detection and treatment options.

20
02:22:07,499 --> 02:22:19,663
[SPEAKER_01]: The American Cancer Society held their annual Boston Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk this weekend, and it was terrific to see so many members of New England come together for this important cause.

21
02:22:21,351 --> 02:22:26,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, regular screenings and self-exams can make a vital difference.

22
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:37,574
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, when caught in its earliest localized stages, the five-year relative survival rate of breast cancer is 99%.

23
02:22:37,834 --> 02:22:47,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to visit their website and other resources for further information about breast cancer awareness.

24
02:22:48,968 --> 02:22:54,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, October is Down Syndrome Awareness and Dyslexia Awareness Month.

25
02:22:55,370 --> 02:23:02,233
[SPEAKER_01]: This month, let's come together to raise awareness and celebrate the unique strengths of our diverse community.

26
02:23:03,313 --> 02:23:11,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford Public Schools staff members are here to support all of our students and families working to reach their educational goals.

27
02:23:16,351 --> 02:23:35,301
[SPEAKER_01]: While there are lots of exciting developments across Mustang Nation since we all last gathered, this weekend was another busy one across Mustang Nation, with students, families, and staff members coming together to achieve goals and create long-lasting memories.

28
02:23:36,281 --> 02:23:52,427
[SPEAKER_01]: On a very high note, our Medford High School football team scored a big victory over our next-door neighbors, Somerville High School, on Friday night, where captain Justin Marino broke a 52-year-old school record.

29
02:23:54,688 --> 02:24:05,855
[SPEAKER_01]: the senior scored six touchdowns, eclipsing Babe Colonna's record of five set on Thanksgiving in 1972.

30
02:24:07,036 --> 02:24:21,786
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to his six touchdowns, Marino finished the game with 200 rushing yards, an interception, a blocked field goal, and a fumble recovery in a 48 to 12 victory for our Mustangs.

31
02:24:22,686 --> 02:24:31,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to thank Tufts University for hosting and to our supporters for their sportsmanship displayed throughout the game.

32
02:24:32,691 --> 02:24:49,419
[SPEAKER_01]: After performing alongside our football team on Friday, our Medford High School marching band spent Saturday afternoon and evening at the New England Scholastic Band Association's fall event at Westford Academy.

33
02:24:50,579 --> 02:24:55,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I am happy to share that our band finished in first place in their division.

34
02:24:56,701 --> 02:25:09,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps even more impressively, the band also took home overall competition awards in both Best Visual Performance and Best General Effect.

35
02:25:10,885 --> 02:25:23,637
[SPEAKER_01]: The Best Visual Performance Award showcases the stunning visual elements of our Mustang performance, which were brought to life by our talented guard and precise choreography.

36
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:42,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, the Best General Effect Award reflects the overall impact of the performance, from the music to the visuals, and how well the bands came together to create a cohesive and engaging experience for the audience and judges alike.

37
02:25:43,437 --> 02:25:51,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations to our new band director, Michael Dampier, and all of our students for their amazing performances this weekend.

38
02:25:52,380 --> 02:25:56,862
[SPEAKER_01]: We look forward to continuing to hear you shine throughout the school year.

39
02:25:58,303 --> 02:26:06,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Among many other exciting events, yesterday, our Brooks Elementary School hosted their annual fall festival.

40
02:26:06,770 --> 02:26:14,377
[SPEAKER_01]: This beloved event was a fantastic way to embrace the spirit of the season and support our school community.

41
02:26:15,057 --> 02:26:23,525
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a wide variety of exciting games, food, rides, crafts, and vendors for kids and families of all ages to enjoy.

42
02:26:24,305 --> 02:26:35,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to give a special thank you to the Brooks PTO and Principal Shannon Deimos and her school community for hosting this welcoming event.

43
02:26:36,659 --> 02:26:45,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow, Medford Public Schools and the City of Medford will be hosting the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the McGlynn Elementary School.

46
02:26:57,661 --> 02:27:05,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Members of the public are invited to celebrate and most importantly, play on the new playground following the ceremony.

47
02:27:06,502 --> 02:27:15,451
[SPEAKER_01]: The new playground has already been used by our school and surrounding community and the early enjoyment has been so heartwarming to witnesses.

48
02:27:16,432 --> 02:27:20,015
[SPEAKER_01]: There are countless types of play opportunities for all children.

49
02:27:20,696 --> 02:27:28,924
[SPEAKER_01]: The new and inclusive Gaga pit has especially been a roaring success amongst all the new playground equipment.

50
02:27:30,561 --> 02:27:41,688
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need a reasonable accommodation to attend or participate in tomorrow's ribbon-cutting ceremony, please contact the City of Medford ADA coordinator, Ms.

[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the committee.

68
02:29:16,553 --> 02:29:22,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for this opportunity to present as we do every two years on the Community Cares Youth Survey.

69
02:29:23,158 --> 02:29:29,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight's presentation looks a little bit different, just also because Catherine is new to the team and really want to welcome her.

70
02:29:29,762 --> 02:29:32,545
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been a really great help to us as we've been moving through.

71
02:29:33,105 --> 02:29:35,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And Director Perry is online.

72
02:29:35,607 --> 02:29:38,129
[SPEAKER_06]: If you'll just give me a second while I share my screen.

73
02:29:39,173 --> 02:29:41,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, two slides were added.

74
02:29:41,155 --> 02:29:42,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are at your place.

75
02:29:43,157 --> 02:29:46,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, those will be updated to the, uh, report as well.

76
02:29:47,441 --> 02:29:52,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, when it's posted online and

77
02:29:53,667 --> 02:30:07,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Communities that Care Youth Survey has been administered to Medford High School and middle school students in 2017, 19, 21, and 23 using bivariate chi-square analyses.

78
02:30:08,481 --> 02:30:09,982
[SPEAKER_06]: The results have been examined.

79
02:30:11,824 --> 02:30:16,145
[SPEAKER_06]: on whether student outcomes differed from the year of the survey administration.

80
02:30:16,465 --> 02:30:30,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And 2023, we added personal characteristics, gender identity, sexual race identity, and otherwise noted finding was deemed significant where there was a standard deviation of approximately 0.5.

81
02:30:31,390 --> 02:30:37,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll now hand it over to the team and see you in a few minutes.

82
02:30:41,117 --> 02:30:42,078
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hi everyone.

83
02:30:42,158 --> 02:30:46,320
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Catherine Dingra and I am pleased to be part of this team.

84
02:30:46,340 --> 02:30:56,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I started in the city of Medford back in June and coming from about 20 years experience doing surveys like this and other communities including Wakefield and Lynn.

85
02:30:57,847 --> 02:31:01,269
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's great about coming into Medford is seeing the

86
02:31:03,877 --> 02:31:11,979
[SPEAKER_02]: wide variety of programming that you all are doing already here to address the protective factors and risk factors.

87
02:31:12,059 --> 02:31:24,643
[SPEAKER_02]: So this survey gave us a nice overview of what the Medford students, their gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, along with protective factors and risk factors that we're going to get into.

88
02:31:24,743 --> 02:31:26,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really wanted to look at

89
02:31:27,073 --> 02:31:38,457
[SPEAKER_02]: behavioral health, substance use rates, bullying, and some of the other factors that impact students' health and well-being, that impact their ability to learn in the school environment.

90
02:31:38,477 --> 02:31:45,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna take a look at that tonight and take a look at how the personal characteristics impact those stats.

91
02:31:46,099 --> 02:31:47,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll move to the next slide.

92
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:51,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'm gonna turn it over to Stacey for mental health.

93
02:31:53,697 --> 02:31:56,038
[SPEAKER_13]: So these are some of the factors that the survey asks.

94
02:31:56,278 --> 02:32:04,042
[SPEAKER_13]: As you can notice, they talk about four groupings of questions that lead to potential depressive symptoms by year.

95
02:32:04,082 --> 02:32:08,644
[SPEAKER_13]: This is all four of the survey distributions from 2017 to 2013.

96
02:32:09,405 --> 02:32:17,008
[SPEAKER_13]: And you'll notice, we're very happy to see that depressive symptoms are trending downward from the 2019-2021 peaks.

97
02:32:21,018 --> 02:32:24,963
[SPEAKER_13]: This is middle school students' depressive symptoms by sexual orientation.

98
02:32:25,003 --> 02:32:32,934
[SPEAKER_13]: So you'll notice that our LGBTQ plus population are more likely to endorse depressive symptoms in our middle schools.

99
02:32:34,872 --> 02:32:36,413
[SPEAKER_13]: This is by race and ethnicity.

100
02:32:37,174 --> 02:32:38,315
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a trend here.

101
02:32:38,435 --> 02:32:51,525
[SPEAKER_13]: So on this trend, we wanna note that the P value is less than 0.10, which is not statistically significant, but middle school students who identified as Latino were more likely to endorse depressive symptoms.

102
02:32:52,505 --> 02:32:59,731
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, that it is statistically significant than students who identify as white on three of the four items.

103
02:33:02,145 --> 02:33:07,028
[SPEAKER_13]: For high school students, this is the same four questions we're looking at again, depressive symptoms.

104
02:33:07,468 --> 02:33:14,192
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll once again notice that the 2023, there was a drop in students endorsing depressive symptoms.

105
02:33:14,212 --> 02:33:17,274
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the trend that we wanna see continue on.

106
02:33:19,135 --> 02:33:30,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Depressive symptoms by gender at the high school, you'll notice that our genderqueer, non-binary, unsure students are noting more depressive symptoms than other categories.

107
02:33:33,208 --> 02:33:34,609
[SPEAKER_13]: Substance use, back to Catherine.

108
02:33:36,090 --> 02:33:40,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can, yeah, I'm just gonna show a picture back on.

109
02:33:40,552 --> 02:33:45,534
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, substance use trends have changed dramatically over the years.

110
02:33:46,035 --> 02:33:56,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And here are kind of some of the more recent substance use trends of things that we've had to take a look at what our students are encountering and what the trends are.

111
02:33:56,980 --> 02:34:02,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see that pen down on the corner is actually a THC vape pen found in a,

112
02:34:03,014 --> 02:34:04,355
[SPEAKER_02]: neighboring district schools.

113
02:34:04,415 --> 02:34:06,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So the devices are different.

114
02:34:06,256 --> 02:34:11,618
[SPEAKER_02]: The Zen pouches are a way that students are utilizing nicotine now.

115
02:34:12,399 --> 02:34:20,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know alcohol continues to be the number one substance that students are using.

116
02:34:21,243 --> 02:34:25,985
[SPEAKER_02]: We were happy to see middle school substance use rates trending down.

117
02:34:26,005 --> 02:34:32,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a national trend and a statewide trend that overall substance use rates are trending down

118
02:34:33,482 --> 02:34:39,187
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're glad to see that and sometimes we did see an increase in vaping in the middle school.

119
02:34:39,328 --> 02:34:56,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So That's something that we are looking at The high school we had because of the survey intake of juniors and seniors we decide not to present those CTC data because it was lower amongst our juniors and seniors and it didn't

120
02:34:56,753 --> 02:35:00,115
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't prove valid to show the trend data.

121
02:35:00,215 --> 02:35:11,662
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to show the high school substance use rates across the state, which typically I looked at some comparison tended to trend with Medford year over year.

122
02:35:11,762 --> 02:35:23,449
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see statistically that substance rates are coming down with both alcohol, marijuana, and vaping across the state have come down, but it's still

123
02:35:23,908 --> 02:35:37,292
[SPEAKER_02]: something that we're concerned about, but one thing that we'll talk about when we talk about strategies in a little bit is you see the higher numbers, but we really like to say that most students aren't using substances, so.

124
02:35:37,932 --> 02:35:38,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor?

125
02:35:41,033 --> 02:35:41,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo?

126
02:35:42,353 --> 02:35:43,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these percentages on this slide?

127
02:35:44,114 --> 02:35:45,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, those are percentages.

128
02:35:45,374 --> 02:35:51,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I tried to insert percentages, but that's percentage of students ninth through 12th grade.

129
02:35:53,915 --> 02:36:18,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And Peter is going to talk about some we did we talk about quantitative data and we talked about qualitative data and this is some interesting data So, thanks to some funds coming in from the opera grant that the city has We have installed four vape sensors at Medford High School two in two girls bathroom one in two girls bathrooms and

130
02:36:20,563 --> 02:36:21,984
[SPEAKER_06]: in boys' bathrooms as well.

131
02:36:23,224 --> 02:36:25,865
[SPEAKER_06]: We are watching this data.

132
02:36:26,825 --> 02:36:39,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It is worth its weight, I think, in gold because it is showing, I think, how vast the problem is and the challenge to really educate our youth as to the challenges of vape.

133
02:36:39,968 --> 02:36:42,829
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are some screen captures that came in.

134
02:36:43,945 --> 02:36:49,130
[SPEAKER_06]: that give you a sense of the health index, the air quality index.

135
02:36:50,071 --> 02:36:54,436
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see that air quality index broken out in the next slide.

136
02:36:54,857 --> 02:36:56,599
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a slide that I gave you today.

137
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:00,263
[SPEAKER_06]: You also see the number of instances

138
02:37:00,623 --> 02:37:03,886
[SPEAKER_06]: This data was from last Friday when I inserted it.

139
02:37:04,387 --> 02:37:06,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So week to date on the bathrooms.

140
02:37:08,291 --> 02:37:15,598
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the sensors was not properly connected so it wasn't collecting data, which is why it's low.

141
02:37:16,558 --> 02:37:17,900
[SPEAKER_06]: but we rectified that issue.

142
02:37:17,940 --> 02:37:21,142
[SPEAKER_06]: They were installed on the last Thursday in September.

143
02:37:21,162 --> 02:37:24,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was September 27th.

144
02:37:25,025 --> 02:37:36,875
[SPEAKER_06]: And you see the week forward data for last week, 104, 92, 68, and 45 over the various bathrooms.

145
02:37:37,396 --> 02:37:40,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It also picks up, the sensors pick up acts of aggression.

146
02:37:41,859 --> 02:37:59,919
[SPEAKER_06]: words of aggression, they don't record or anything along those lines but if somebody says help if somebody here if it does seem like a commotion, it will register as aggression, it will register if the device is being tampered with it will register, and I'll move to the next slide.

147
02:38:00,379 --> 02:38:12,824
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see here the air quality indexes as well as noise levels in the bathrooms for the highest points of noise.

148
02:38:13,865 --> 02:38:18,987
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives you the temperature, the CO, the CO2, and those types of things.

149
02:38:19,107 --> 02:38:23,189
[SPEAKER_06]: These also are things that we haven't had the professional development yet to really dive into.

150
02:38:23,669 --> 02:38:25,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a question, Madam Mayor.

151
02:38:28,884 --> 02:38:33,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we see a copy of what the baseline numbers look like?

152
02:38:34,869 --> 02:38:35,649
[SPEAKER_12]: What is elevated?

153
02:38:35,909 --> 02:38:37,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Is zero the baseline on everything?

154
02:38:38,431 --> 02:38:39,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get you those.

155
02:38:39,212 --> 02:38:39,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

156
02:38:39,572 --> 02:38:41,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

157
02:38:44,035 --> 02:38:44,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Bramley?

158
02:38:45,416 --> 02:38:50,300
[SPEAKER_08]: So acts of words of aggression if device is tampered with, have we seen that devices have been tampered with?

159
02:38:52,179 --> 02:38:56,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, one device was removed from the ceiling by students on the second day.

160
02:38:58,282 --> 02:39:08,007
[SPEAKER_06]: But we were able to respond, myself and Principal Cabral, just because we were the only two people at that point receiving the data, as they had literally been set up the day before.

161
02:39:08,607 --> 02:39:15,170
[SPEAKER_06]: We both responded to the bathroom and addressed the students in question.

162
02:39:15,591 --> 02:39:18,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Principal Cabral took over and dealt with the situation.

163
02:39:20,473 --> 02:39:23,815
[SPEAKER_06]: The device has been restored to its place on the ceiling.

164
02:39:25,036 --> 02:39:30,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Students were shocked to think that they might be responsible for a $2,500 device if they were to destroy it.

165
02:39:32,241 --> 02:39:36,204
[SPEAKER_06]: And that helped with the identification of individuals involved.

166
02:39:37,305 --> 02:39:40,707
[SPEAKER_08]: And then with the acts of words or aggression, how are we following up with that?

167
02:39:42,180 --> 02:40:03,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to the we actually just had the first one this morning, so I would have to follow up with the principle of that but right now just so that everyone's aware we're purchasing iPads, so that not only our cameras, but also the sensors can be monitored by our building monitors the system principles, while they move throughout the building.

168
02:40:04,250 --> 02:40:04,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And so,

169
02:40:06,031 --> 02:40:14,176
[SPEAKER_06]: While the results come to their email, once the app is loaded on your phone, you can set up for notifications as well.

170
02:40:16,357 --> 02:40:21,720
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can tell from the levels of data, which, hold on, I just got to remember what the next slide is.

171
02:40:22,380 --> 02:40:23,481
[SPEAKER_06]: This is another slide.

172
02:40:23,621 --> 02:40:28,303
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see, it's a frequent occurrence.

173
02:40:29,024 --> 02:40:32,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And please remember, these are four locations.

174
02:40:33,896 --> 02:40:45,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to be able to see us eventually move to a point where these are more ubiquitous in the district and also in our middle school bathrooms as well.

175
02:40:45,784 --> 02:41:00,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the data, and I think Catherine might be able to speak to this far better than I can, but the data that we're seeing is that the usage of these vape devices is happening at sometimes fifth and sixth grade.

176
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:02,881
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a follow-up question on that.

177
02:41:03,101 --> 02:41:09,765
[SPEAKER_08]: With the amount that the device is going off, say 104 times for the second floor boys bathroom, is that bathroom being monitored?

178
02:41:09,965 --> 02:41:15,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm assuming no one's running to the bathroom 104 times during a day to see the device went off, so what's happening?

179
02:41:15,988 --> 02:41:24,293
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's also monitoring a bathroom while students are expecting a certain level of privacy.

180
02:41:25,233 --> 02:41:28,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we're doing is we're marrying this data with our camera system.

181
02:41:28,755 --> 02:41:55,148
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to have those conversations, use the I Decide program for diversion, and to really try to not see this as a disciplinary issue, but to see this as a public health crisis for our students, and to be able to really understand how, as a society, we had beaten back tobacco, but have now widely opened the doors on vaping.

182
02:41:56,289 --> 02:41:56,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

183
02:41:58,106 --> 02:42:08,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And if Catherine or Stacey or Rachel, who's on the call, have anything else to add, I welcome it because I know Stacey is intimately involved with the I Decide program.

184
02:42:12,938 --> 02:42:15,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving forward to bullying.

185
02:42:21,037 --> 02:42:31,503
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Medford middle schoolers endorsed experiencing both physical and cyber bullying from 2017 to 2023 at a very similar frequency.

186
02:42:33,124 --> 02:42:36,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you can see the results when the surveys were done.

187
02:42:37,146 --> 02:42:40,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Experienced physical bullying in the past 30 days.

188
02:42:40,568 --> 02:42:44,791
[SPEAKER_06]: The percentages are here, so you can see of respondents, that's percentage.

189
02:42:45,891 --> 02:42:47,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Experienced verbal bullying in the past 30 days.

190
02:42:50,132 --> 02:42:58,020
[SPEAKER_06]: and experienced cyberbullying in the past 30 days at pretty consistent rates across the years.

191
02:43:01,391 --> 02:43:05,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Middle school bullying experiences by race and ethnicity.

192
02:43:05,434 --> 02:43:12,999
[SPEAKER_06]: So middle schools identified as black were more likely to endorse experiencing physical bullying than those who identified as white.

193
02:43:13,620 --> 02:43:21,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Middle schoolers who identified as black were more likely to endorse experiencing cyberbullying than those who identified as Latino or white.

194
02:43:25,846 --> 02:43:41,858
[SPEAKER_06]: High schoolers who identified as LGBTQ plus were more likely than those who identified as heterosexual to endorse experiencing bullying and high school bullying experiences, verbal bullying, 2017 to 2023 in a similar frequency.

195
02:43:47,412 --> 02:43:52,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And just so you know, these are things that the district is continually working on.

196
02:43:52,418 --> 02:43:57,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we'll be talking about the strategies being put into play and protective factors.

197
02:43:59,482 --> 02:43:59,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Peter.

198
02:44:00,842 --> 02:44:14,807
[SPEAKER_13]: So in terms of our strategies and protective factors that we have at Medford Public Schools, helpful adults, as we've talked about before, are one of the key strategies in order to both connect with our students and get students connected to care if they need it.

199
02:44:15,547 --> 02:44:21,209
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're pleased to see here that high school students increased their

200
02:44:23,107 --> 02:44:31,112
[SPEAKER_13]: naming someone who is a helpful adult at the high school and middle schoolers, there was really not much change from the past few years.

201
02:44:31,373 --> 02:44:36,616
[SPEAKER_13]: High schoolers who primarily spoke English at home were more likely to endorse experiencing a helpful adult at school.

202
02:44:36,656 --> 02:44:39,318
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's an important data point for us to consider moving forward.

203
02:44:41,059 --> 02:44:51,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, here is our MTSS system of support in terms of counseling and supportive services to address students who are in need of care.

204
02:44:54,471 --> 02:45:06,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Social-emotional strategies that we have across the district include restorative practices, our wind blocks, our advisory classes, health and wellness classes, Nexus, and EL class push-ins from counselors.

205
02:45:08,344 --> 02:45:19,254
[SPEAKER_13]: School culture and support systems district-wide include our Start with Hello programming, which is under Sandy Hook Promise, our GSA programming, both at the middle school and high school,

206
02:45:19,904 --> 02:45:29,226
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, our say something reporting service, the Mustang All Stars at the high school level, Mustang Way at the middle school, we're running circles.

207
02:45:30,246 --> 02:45:34,967
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the high school level is running PD on equity, highlighting a sense of belonging.

208
02:45:35,107 --> 02:45:46,350
[SPEAKER_13]: The city is also running a campaign to reach out to our community members to get them connected to care who are part of our Latino population.

209
02:45:49,525 --> 02:45:57,129
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of substance use prevention and intervention strategies, we have a lot of new programs that we're lucky to have this year.

210
02:45:57,169 --> 02:46:01,191
[SPEAKER_13]: We're running an I Decide Diversion program for students who are caught vaping.

211
02:46:01,652 --> 02:46:02,812
[SPEAKER_13]: That is about four hours.

212
02:46:04,714 --> 02:46:06,556
[SPEAKER_13]: of education around substances.

213
02:46:06,636 --> 02:46:09,239
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an alternative to punitive response for students.

214
02:46:09,860 --> 02:46:14,586
[SPEAKER_13]: We are lucky to have a youth wellness coach with us two days a week, who is running Project AMP.

215
02:46:14,906 --> 02:46:16,928
[SPEAKER_13]: That's students one-on-one coaching.

216
02:46:17,509 --> 02:46:22,655
[SPEAKER_13]: And it really is a youth-driven substance use prevention and early intervention program for students.

217
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:28,522
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we will be starting, we just identified our advisor, a Medford Youth Action Team.

218
02:46:28,862 --> 02:46:37,326
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll be connecting with the help of Catherine, our Youth Action Team lead, and students to other neighborhood schools who are running similar programs.

219
02:46:38,886 --> 02:46:42,088
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Katie Kobe, our Youth Wellness Coach.

220
02:46:42,268 --> 02:46:52,212
[SPEAKER_13]: She is mentored and supported by C4 Initiatives, and we were able to have a Youth Wellness Coach through the support of our partnership with MGH, so we're really pleased.

221
02:46:54,367 --> 02:46:57,049
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll let Rachel talk to the evidence-based health education.

222
02:46:58,969 --> 02:47:00,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everybody.

223
02:47:00,610 --> 02:47:01,891
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize for not being there.

224
02:47:01,911 --> 02:47:05,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I just finished up a volleyball game, so I'm online.

225
02:47:05,933 --> 02:47:12,436
[SPEAKER_11]: So some of the things we've been doing in health education, we're using the Michigan model for health for K to 12.

226
02:47:12,957 --> 02:47:23,262
[SPEAKER_11]: We conducted a HECAT evaluation of the Michigan model and decided to stay with it, but to make some changes and to look at a new sex education curriculum

227
02:47:24,370 --> 02:47:27,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Desi just came out with their recommendation, so that's something we'll be working on.

228
02:47:28,754 --> 02:47:35,222
[SPEAKER_11]: For K-5, we have our Nexus curriculum, which now includes health education lessons that started last year.

229
02:47:35,242 --> 02:47:40,087
[SPEAKER_11]: So now our elementary students will be getting more health education lessons.

230
02:47:40,996 --> 02:47:57,063
[SPEAKER_11]: We also updated our puberty lessons for we're using puberty happens lessons added for our fifth graders that also happened last year, and we are also combining everyone together in those lessons on this year we're adding vaping.

231
02:47:58,784 --> 02:48:07,811
[SPEAKER_11]: lessons to the fifth grade nexus curriculum, because what we have seen in the past year is we're seeing more students in the sixth grade starting to vape.

232
02:48:07,871 --> 02:48:13,474
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're trying to pull those lessons in a little bit earlier to help educate our students.

233
02:48:15,116 --> 02:48:20,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Guidance counselors are doing introduction days at the high school in our phys ed and health classes.

234
02:48:20,519 --> 02:48:25,503
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's for ninth graders so that when they come to the high school, they get to meet that guidance counselor.

235
02:48:26,149 --> 02:48:36,016
[SPEAKER_11]: as part of their health and phys ed class, they go to their office, they talk about what their guidance counselor can help them with so that they have that relationship early on in their freshman year.

236
02:48:37,196 --> 02:48:47,683
[SPEAKER_11]: We also, with our new wellness coach, she's gonna be coming into our phys ed and health classes to introduce herself and to talk a little bit to our students about what she can support them with.

237
02:48:49,344 --> 02:48:53,487
[SPEAKER_11]: We have our suicide prevention presentations, our SOS and NAN project,

238
02:48:53,769 --> 02:48:56,190
[SPEAKER_11]: That happens throughout our health classes from nine to 12.

239
02:48:57,290 --> 02:49:01,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Mentors and violence prevention lessons in our portal to hope presentation.

240
02:49:02,252 --> 02:49:04,713
[SPEAKER_11]: That's been happening for the past few years as well.

241
02:49:05,954 --> 02:49:10,556
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been increasing our professional development for our teachers and for myself.

242
02:49:10,916 --> 02:49:17,698
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had our teachers go last year out to Mayford and get some training in health education there.

243
02:49:18,038 --> 02:49:21,740
[SPEAKER_11]: We had our nexus teachers actually train in puberty education.

244
02:49:22,589 --> 02:49:26,291
[SPEAKER_11]: We had our high school teachers go out and train in sex education as well.

245
02:49:27,111 --> 02:49:30,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Staff will be going on November 5th again to Mayford to get some more training.

246
02:49:30,973 --> 02:49:38,936
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're really trying to increase our training for our staff to make sure that we're supporting and supplying the needs of our students.

247
02:49:40,317 --> 02:49:45,059
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to continue to make KiCat and Frameworks changes to our curriculum this year.

248
02:49:45,159 --> 02:49:49,541
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully by the end of the year, we will have everything mapped out and ready to go.

249
02:49:50,396 --> 02:49:56,740
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will be continuing to review the DESE recommended curriculums to make that decision.

250
02:49:59,402 --> 02:50:00,723
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's all I have.

251
02:50:05,526 --> 02:50:10,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll speak to a little bit of the caregiver and parent university.

252
02:50:11,368 --> 02:50:13,330
[SPEAKER_11]: which we have started this year.

253
02:50:13,990 --> 02:50:20,235
[SPEAKER_11]: We did an athletic orientation, which Catherine did some presenting as well, which was great.

254
02:50:20,295 --> 02:50:24,699
[SPEAKER_11]: We had 200 parents that attended that presentation.

255
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:30,504
[SPEAKER_11]: We did a training back in April on drug, alcohol, and addictive

256
02:50:32,254 --> 02:50:40,600
[SPEAKER_11]: education and the doctors that spoke talked about curriculums and presenting the education to our students.

257
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:45,263
[SPEAKER_11]: But the biggest piece was to make sure that we're adding parents into that mix.

258
02:50:45,283 --> 02:50:47,165
[SPEAKER_11]: The parents need this education as well.

259
02:50:47,205 --> 02:50:52,929
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was one of the big things that we wanted to add was a parent caregiver university.

260
02:50:53,009 --> 02:50:55,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, you know, starting this year.

261
02:50:55,070 --> 02:51:01,015
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know, Catherine, if you want to talk about the navigating the caregiver's guide that you put together.

262
02:51:02,679 --> 02:51:02,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

263
02:51:03,339 --> 02:51:09,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter's just getting our new, um, hot off the press, hot off the press caregiver university.

264
02:51:09,122 --> 02:51:13,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an initiative I did in my previous district and it was widely successful.

265
02:51:13,884 --> 02:51:20,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing that we're excited as the health department to partner with the schools and leverage resources.

266
02:51:20,906 --> 02:51:27,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can, we know that children are well when their families are well, so we can provide that education and partner with the schools.

267
02:51:28,392 --> 02:51:32,834
[SPEAKER_02]: and hear what some of the concerns are and bring those resources in.

268
02:51:32,874 --> 02:51:39,577
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're excited to launch the Medford Caregiver University, which will have a flagship experience.

269
02:51:39,597 --> 02:51:47,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And then throughout the year, we'll have a lot of different variety of topics based on what we're hearing from both parents and educators.

270
02:51:47,341 --> 02:51:49,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be doing that.

271
02:51:49,122 --> 02:51:52,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing we created was navigating the teen year guides.

272
02:51:52,623 --> 02:51:56,345
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were at one of our back to school nights, you got your guide.

273
02:51:56,872 --> 02:52:04,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something, again, we partnered with the schools hearing about the different topics that they knew caregivers wanted to learn about.

274
02:52:04,715 --> 02:52:07,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the city, we put that together.

275
02:52:07,176 --> 02:52:20,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just really thrilled to be partnering with the schools and helping our children be well and helping our parents stay educated and our caregivers stay educated on supporting their young people.

276
02:52:23,142 --> 02:52:23,282
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

277
02:52:23,963 --> 02:52:24,723
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

278
02:52:26,112 --> 02:52:27,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeldt and Member Graham.

279
02:52:29,916 --> 02:52:33,420
[SPEAKER_12]: I have three questions, two of them for Director Perry.

280
02:52:33,860 --> 02:52:36,983
[SPEAKER_12]: You said HECAT framework changes to curriculum end of year.

281
02:52:37,043 --> 02:52:39,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that end of calendar year or end of school year?

282
02:52:42,209 --> 02:52:44,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I am hoping to get it done by the end of calendar year.

283
02:52:45,401 --> 02:52:45,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

284
02:52:46,081 --> 02:52:53,622
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I was wondering at the middle school level, how the reduction in guidance counselors has affected the delivery of health education.

285
02:52:53,662 --> 02:52:59,403
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that was a big question during budget season about the teaching responsibilities with that position.

286
02:53:02,204 --> 02:53:06,565
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll be, I don't know if Stacy wants to take that with the guidance counselor.

287
02:53:08,945 --> 02:53:09,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

288
02:53:11,006 --> 02:53:13,586
[SPEAKER_13]: All of the classes are covered by the one counselor in the building.

289
02:53:18,553 --> 02:53:22,234
[SPEAKER_12]: have other, do they have room in their schedule for other activities?

290
02:53:22,294 --> 02:53:26,436
[SPEAKER_12]: That was one of the things that concerns were expressed about.

291
02:53:26,936 --> 02:53:27,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

292
02:53:27,356 --> 02:53:37,699
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that, um, as we expected, it's challenging, um, for one person and, um, they're doing the best they can with the support of their, um, school adjustment counselor, school social workers.

293
02:53:38,520 --> 02:53:38,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

294
02:53:39,060 --> 02:53:44,322
[SPEAKER_12]: And then my third question was just to confirm that the caregiver university is an a la carte model.

295
02:53:44,462 --> 02:53:46,783
[SPEAKER_12]: People can tune in and out to different sessions.

296
02:53:46,863 --> 02:53:48,083
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not an enrollment based.

297
02:53:49,292 --> 02:53:49,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

298
02:53:50,973 --> 02:53:51,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.

299
02:53:51,994 --> 02:53:52,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

300
02:53:53,796 --> 02:53:54,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

301
02:53:54,836 --> 02:53:59,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me a little bit about where the content for Caregiver University comes from?

302
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:01,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, are we creating content?

303
02:54:01,862 --> 02:54:03,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we buying content?

304
02:54:04,924 --> 02:54:17,294
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually, it's a partnership between the city and the schools, and the content is usually both in-district expertise,

305
02:54:18,207 --> 02:54:23,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So we might, and then academically and then social emotional topics.

306
02:54:23,608 --> 02:54:33,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So we might bring in partners from the community or we might leverage, you know, somebody at Tufts University who is an expert on children and play or something like that.

307
02:54:33,451 --> 02:54:42,013
[SPEAKER_02]: So the topics range and usually we'll try to bring in a keynote on a topic that would cover, you know, that's more general.

308
02:54:43,413 --> 02:54:47,354
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, someone like Lynn Lyons on anxiety where a lot of, you know,

309
02:54:47,947 --> 02:54:50,068
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a hot topic that a lot of people want to learn about.

310
02:54:50,308 --> 02:54:58,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And then breakout sessions on college planning to the new math standards or something like that.

311
02:54:59,510 --> 02:55:01,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And is it videos?

312
02:55:01,671 --> 02:55:04,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it actual e-learning?

313
02:55:04,672 --> 02:55:07,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it seminars?

314
02:55:07,493 --> 02:55:09,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I watch this stuff any time?

315
02:55:10,053 --> 02:55:12,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Or how do I consume it?

316
02:55:13,325 --> 02:55:26,149
[SPEAKER_06]: So, ultimately, we want to make sure that we're able to, as best we can, save presentations and have them available either through the district YouTube channel or other media to be able to do.

317
02:55:27,309 --> 02:55:35,572
[SPEAKER_06]: But there'll be some as, you know, we've now implemented mandatory back to athletics nights for each of the seasons.

318
02:55:36,292 --> 02:55:51,031
[SPEAKER_06]: So those will be more challenging to record to present those types of things, but our hope is that a good example of an outside partner coming in last fall, if I remember correctly we had Dr Englander.

319
02:55:52,132 --> 02:56:07,262
[SPEAKER_06]: present on zoom, that would be an example of a future or past event that would fall under the caregiver parent and caregiver university logo as well as those athletic nights and really trying to make sure that

320
02:56:07,962 --> 02:56:16,725
[SPEAKER_06]: we're presenting to parents the things that are gonna really help them to work with their children to make their children be successful and be successful as parents.

321
02:56:17,205 --> 02:56:20,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So we haven't really gone into an e-learning model on it yet.

322
02:56:21,627 --> 02:56:29,169
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more being able to produce the content and quality that really attracts parents and caregivers.

323
02:56:29,689 --> 02:56:36,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think one of the things that we've all seen is when we put these efforts on, they're not sometimes the best attended.

324
02:56:37,672 --> 02:56:41,273
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to make sure that they do remain available for people throughout.

325
02:56:41,393 --> 02:56:45,354
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to also, if the other three members of the team have anything to add.

326
02:56:47,054 --> 02:56:55,076
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess what I would like to see is that there's like a central place where all of this content can live.

327
02:56:55,176 --> 02:56:57,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the athletics night is a great example.

328
02:56:57,316 --> 02:56:58,217
[SPEAKER_07]: It was mandatory.

329
02:56:58,237 --> 02:57:01,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I was unable to attend.

330
02:57:02,918 --> 02:57:03,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how I,

331
02:57:04,955 --> 02:57:06,336
[SPEAKER_07]: address that as a parent.

332
02:57:06,596 --> 02:57:08,037
[SPEAKER_07]: But no one's followed up with me either.

333
02:57:08,138 --> 02:57:12,821
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be like an example of, yes, it's in person.

334
02:57:12,901 --> 02:57:14,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you want people to come in person.

335
02:57:15,303 --> 02:57:25,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But what, like, what can this platform do for us to make sure that actually the parents who couldn't, I think there might have been a school committee, something at the same time.

336
02:57:25,851 --> 02:57:33,037
[SPEAKER_07]: So who can't come for whatever the reason might be still get the content that is happening in those

337
02:57:33,806 --> 02:57:40,809
[SPEAKER_07]: important meetings, because like you said, people are busy, they people need to be able to consume content, sort of when it's convenient for them.

338
02:57:40,829 --> 02:57:57,116
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think in some cases, we also need to know that they consumed content, like, every time I register Lucas for sports, there's like 100 pages of waivers, and 100 things I'm supposed to like, view and watch.

339
02:57:57,716 --> 02:57:59,777
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually make an effort to do that.

340
02:58:00,137 --> 02:58:02,758
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is extremely easy to just

341
02:58:03,587 --> 02:58:07,730
[SPEAKER_07]: scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, and click that I have done it.

342
02:58:08,491 --> 02:58:13,234
[SPEAKER_07]: But if what the district is seeking is like cover, that's fine.

343
02:58:14,035 --> 02:58:29,927
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so if Lucas gets a concussion, like I, you have my signature that I've done something, but there's no evidence that you can point to that I actually did or didn't scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, click, sign my name and I'm done.

344
02:58:30,027 --> 02:58:30,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

345
02:58:30,368 --> 02:58:33,170
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there's like compliance and

346
02:58:33,703 --> 02:58:46,592
[SPEAKER_07]: what we want, you know, from a requirements perspective as we think about all of this going forward, but then there's actually like, did it sink in or did it stick in any way, shape or form?

347
02:58:46,752 --> 02:58:51,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And was the thing that was really important actually delivered?

348
02:58:52,356 --> 02:58:56,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would argue that when you sign your kids up for sports, that is not true.

349
02:58:56,318 --> 02:59:02,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the thing you needed parents to know when they like rolled out of that sign up, it's,

350
02:59:03,553 --> 02:59:05,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the takeaway.

351
02:59:05,975 --> 02:59:08,016
[SPEAKER_07]: The takeaway is, wow, this system is bad.

352
02:59:08,276 --> 02:59:11,599
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is really tedious and time consuming.

353
02:59:11,619 --> 02:59:12,439
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm glad that's over.

354
02:59:13,240 --> 02:59:16,883
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to see parents be educated about these things.

355
02:59:16,923 --> 02:59:18,584
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think parents genuinely want to be.

356
02:59:19,224 --> 02:59:23,727
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we have to do a better job of delivering that content for parents to do that.

357
02:59:23,767 --> 02:59:31,433
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm hoping that we can address some of that when we are thinking about the build out of this parent and caregiver university, because I think it's

358
02:59:31,795 --> 02:59:34,576
[SPEAKER_07]: it's very needed for all kinds of reasons.

359
02:59:35,556 --> 02:59:42,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and because a lot of this will be funded under grants, evaluation is a key part of that.

360
02:59:42,538 --> 02:59:45,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we evaluate indefinitely.

361
02:59:45,939 --> 02:59:53,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And having parents and caregivers on the committee that help determine and provide feedback like that is crucial.

362
02:59:53,621 --> 02:59:56,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

363
02:59:56,341 --> 02:59:57,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did...

364
02:59:58,951 --> 03:00:08,179
[SPEAKER_02]: We just did want to follow up with our next steps on where we'll go with health and wellness and our students' well-being.

365
03:00:09,080 --> 03:00:19,648
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as school data goes, we, as a team, are looking at exploring moving from the CTC to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey.

366
03:00:19,728 --> 03:00:23,672
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what a lot of the communities around us do.

367
03:00:23,752 --> 03:00:26,254
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the state does, so it's easier to compare

368
03:00:26,758 --> 03:00:29,480
[SPEAKER_02]: to similar communities and to the state.

369
03:00:29,560 --> 03:00:31,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Youth Risk Behavior Survey.

370
03:00:31,301 --> 03:00:33,463
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll add in more protective factor questions.

371
03:00:34,644 --> 03:00:42,930
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the IDECIDE and MGH school-wide assessment as part of being partners with MGH.

372
03:00:42,990 --> 03:00:44,611
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a key component.

373
03:00:44,631 --> 03:00:49,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have some more quantitative data in the years to come.

374
03:00:49,815 --> 03:00:52,817
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be launching the Parent and Caregiver University.

375
03:00:52,837 --> 03:00:53,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look forward to

376
03:00:54,911 --> 03:00:58,432
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to provide data and insight from that.

377
03:00:58,452 --> 03:01:07,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Rachel's been doing more with the professional development, including health educators and looking at the statewide standards.

378
03:01:08,236 --> 03:01:16,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, partnering with the health department, we can help leverage some professional development training and bring in outside experts for the school staff.

379
03:01:17,479 --> 03:01:22,661
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a task force that's gotten together to really start to address some of these strategies.

380
03:01:22,701 --> 03:01:23,981
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the last four months,

381
03:01:24,520 --> 03:01:33,465
[SPEAKER_02]: We have incorporated a lot of new strategies to address these behavioral health substance use.

382
03:01:35,066 --> 03:01:38,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking forward to continuing to make changes.

383
03:01:41,270 --> 03:01:41,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

384
03:01:43,511 --> 03:01:44,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate the presentation.

385
03:01:49,984 --> 03:01:59,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, next we have report on elementary literacy update Dr. Suzanne Galluzzi, Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction and Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities.

386
03:02:00,117 --> 03:02:00,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

387
03:02:21,018 --> 03:02:21,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

388
03:02:21,519 --> 03:02:23,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Would help if I turn the microphone on.

389
03:02:24,624 --> 03:02:28,550
[SPEAKER_03]: As Dr. Cushing puts the presentation up, I just want to say good evening.

390
03:02:29,271 --> 03:02:36,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for the opportunity for us to talk to you tonight and provide an elementary literacy update.

391
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:51,252
[SPEAKER_03]: So the structure of this presentation tonight is gonna highlight the work of our elementary literacy plan for school year 24-25, as we continue to advance and strengthen our literacy instruction across the district.

392
03:02:51,672 --> 03:03:01,080
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a plan that is co-constructed with administration and the district leadership literacy team, as well as our consultant Hill for Literacy.

393
03:03:03,743 --> 03:03:05,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Our agenda for this evening

394
03:03:05,956 --> 03:03:12,801
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to highlight the elementary district literacy plan.

395
03:03:15,339 --> 03:03:19,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to speak to about the role of the elementary literacy coaches.

396
03:03:20,242 --> 03:03:29,386
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to speak about the district literacy leadership team, the training, the coaching, the professional development we have done and we continue to do throughout the year.

397
03:03:30,547 --> 03:03:34,789
[SPEAKER_03]: How the inter-reading program implementation has gone and will continue to go.

398
03:03:35,670 --> 03:03:43,574
[SPEAKER_03]: The data meetings that we have, the structure and the format that we've set up in the district, what we have done thus far and what we will continue to do throughout the year.

399
03:03:44,392 --> 03:03:55,757
[SPEAKER_03]: We will talk a little bit about the student supports as a result of the gathered data and highlight some key family communication events and outreach opportunities.

400
03:03:57,678 --> 03:04:10,363
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, just because this is the frame for our work this year, as well as the presentation for this evening, these are our four key levers of our elementary district literacy plan for the year.

401
03:04:10,939 --> 03:04:35,596
[SPEAKER_03]: So first is to install systems and processes to support the implementation of a multi-tiered assessment and instructional framework, which we have been building for a number of years now, but we're really at the stage this year where we're starting to put a lot of those teams in place and data cycles and training so that we actually can create a process moving forward across the district from school to school.

402
03:04:36,919 --> 03:04:46,063
[SPEAKER_03]: use core supplemental and intervention literacy curricula in a multi-tiered instructional model at each grade level effectively and strategically.

403
03:04:46,483 --> 03:05:04,151
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the piece that is really guiding a lot of our instruction so that teachers are really able to get an understanding of what to do with all of the data that we are collecting so that they can make those instructional decisions to target what students specifically need.

404
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:13,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Collaborate through shared knowledge, skills, language, and collaboration among teachers based on the essential components of literacy and evidence-based instructional practices.

405
03:05:14,191 --> 03:05:16,253
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the key piece of that collaboration.

406
03:05:16,974 --> 03:05:18,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Teachers coming together to share their

407
03:05:20,049 --> 03:05:33,965
[SPEAKER_03]: their knowledge, their skillset, that is done through common planning times, that is done through some training activities, and that is also done for the teachers that participate in the district literacy leadership team.

408
03:05:34,025 --> 03:05:35,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna say DLLT for short.

409
03:05:36,886 --> 03:05:46,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, construct an assessment system and process for using measures of student performance to inform decisions at the district, school, grade, classroom, and individual student levels.

410
03:05:47,294 --> 03:05:50,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of the fruition of all of our work here.

411
03:05:53,238 --> 03:05:54,239
[SPEAKER_03]: We are so excited.

412
03:05:54,639 --> 03:05:56,841
[SPEAKER_03]: We're growing very, excuse me, yeah, I know.

413
03:05:57,021 --> 03:05:59,022
[SPEAKER_03]: We're growing very slowly here.

414
03:06:00,683 --> 03:06:04,006
[SPEAKER_03]: But this body so graciously made sure that

415
03:06:04,730 --> 03:06:09,573
[SPEAKER_03]: literacy coaches were a priority in the budget, which we are very grateful for, and thank you for that.

416
03:06:10,974 --> 03:06:18,238
[SPEAKER_03]: We did start the year with three coaches, and unfortunately we are down to two, so we've had to do a little restructuring district-wide.

417
03:06:18,678 --> 03:06:26,862
[SPEAKER_03]: The position is still posted, and Dr. Chiesa and I, with the two literacy coaches that are on staff and fully working, are still vetting

418
03:06:29,400 --> 03:06:30,981
[SPEAKER_03]: resumes and going through that process.

419
03:06:31,401 --> 03:06:34,423
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are so happy and very pleased.

420
03:06:34,463 --> 03:06:40,566
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Kristen Howell, who has been a very long devoted Medford Public Schools employee.

421
03:06:41,066 --> 03:06:51,311
[SPEAKER_03]: She was in a classroom for several years and also most recently has been a reading, a title one reading teacher at the Missittuck Elementary School.

422
03:06:52,512 --> 03:06:53,352
[SPEAKER_03]: She's phenomenal.

423
03:06:53,433 --> 03:06:56,054
[SPEAKER_03]: She will be servicing grades K through two.

424
03:06:56,818 --> 03:07:04,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And she also does work for the Hill for Literacy as a coach and an instruction specialist.

425
03:07:05,945 --> 03:07:10,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of our literacy coaches are reading licensed and fully accredited.

426
03:07:11,028 --> 03:07:14,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And new to Medford Public Schools is Julie Terwitz.

427
03:07:14,671 --> 03:07:23,958
[SPEAKER_03]: She has come to us, she has taught in primary grades in Dedham Public Schools, and most recently in Needham Public Schools

428
03:07:24,426 --> 03:07:27,907
[SPEAKER_03]: as both a classroom teacher and then also as a literacy coach.

429
03:07:29,288 --> 03:07:36,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Julie is also highly accredited, but she will be servicing grades three through five for Metropolitan Public Schools.

430
03:07:36,891 --> 03:07:38,972
[SPEAKER_03]: They work in tandem.

431
03:07:39,652 --> 03:07:46,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when they are creating their schedules, they are going to schools together so that they are working with teachers.

432
03:07:47,776 --> 03:07:51,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Their role this year, they're going to get some direct coaching from Hill for Literacy.

433
03:07:51,527 --> 03:07:54,909
[SPEAKER_03]: but they are here to support teachers and to support principals.

434
03:07:55,590 --> 03:08:04,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So in their support for teachers district-wide, they are working with them to model lessons for the newly implemented inter-reading program.

435
03:08:05,660 --> 03:08:06,861
[SPEAKER_03]: They are helping troubleshoot.

436
03:08:07,422 --> 03:08:17,853
[SPEAKER_03]: They are also helping to, when teachers have identified what an instructional focus is for students, they're going to help model some of what that small group instruction could look like.

437
03:08:18,373 --> 03:08:26,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also have an active hand in the data cycles that we are running five times this year, which Dr. Chiesa will highlight a little later.

438
03:08:27,591 --> 03:08:30,113
[SPEAKER_03]: They also are helping to support the elementary principals.

439
03:08:30,373 --> 03:08:46,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, with data cycles and data analysis and what principals can help support their teachers with, but also to help identify any need for professional development and keep Dr. Keyes and I in the loop.

440
03:08:47,383 --> 03:08:47,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year,

441
03:08:49,073 --> 03:08:58,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Kristen Howell was in the same role as a literacy coach, and she did provide a caregiver Dibbles presentation.

442
03:08:59,270 --> 03:09:03,577
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to continue that this year, and both Kristen and Julie

443
03:09:04,228 --> 03:09:16,091
[SPEAKER_03]: the dates are here, we'll be providing one in person in the evening and also virtually during the school day to hopefully accommodate varying schedules for caregivers.

444
03:09:17,672 --> 03:09:29,575
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an overview of what DIBLS-8 is, what it looks like, why we're collecting the data, and it will also be, we are also nearing the end of our data

445
03:09:30,368 --> 03:09:33,069
[SPEAKER_03]: on the recent DIBLS assessment.

446
03:09:33,229 --> 03:09:35,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we will highlight a little bit of that.

447
03:09:35,790 --> 03:09:41,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So some parents will also get this specifically in Letters Home, just to highlight the dates.

448
03:09:43,612 --> 03:09:49,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Chiesa to talk a little bit about DLLT and our data cycles.

449
03:09:52,483 --> 03:09:53,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

450
03:09:53,224 --> 03:09:54,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everybody.

451
03:09:54,205 --> 03:10:11,361
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk a little bit about our district literacy leadership team DLLT, which is an opportunity for us to have educators, administrators, multiple people involved in making some strong literacy choices.

452
03:10:11,874 --> 03:10:15,656
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can all own the choices together and hear multiple voices.

453
03:10:16,457 --> 03:10:18,758
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our third year of the DLLT.

454
03:10:19,339 --> 03:10:22,641
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two years were co-facilitated with Hill for Literacy.

455
03:10:23,561 --> 03:10:31,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Year one was our core program review where we were looking at the different options in terms of which program we would purchase and adopt as a district.

456
03:10:32,687 --> 03:10:40,492
[SPEAKER_00]: The second year was taking that program and really going through all the nuances in terms of program implementation.

457
03:10:40,916 --> 03:10:41,796
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we need?

458
03:10:42,116 --> 03:10:43,777
[SPEAKER_00]: How did teachers need to be supported?

459
03:10:44,217 --> 03:10:45,177
[SPEAKER_00]: What was working?

460
03:10:45,337 --> 03:10:45,937
[SPEAKER_00]: What isn't?

461
03:10:46,057 --> 03:10:48,798
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, it's quite a comprehensive program.

462
03:10:49,278 --> 03:10:56,860
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot to digest and working together with the teachers, we were able to really lead the pathway for that.

463
03:10:57,820 --> 03:11:03,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Participants served on that committee for two years, and now we move into year three.

464
03:11:04,121 --> 03:11:06,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So year three will also be a two-year commitment.

465
03:11:07,929 --> 03:11:19,899
[SPEAKER_00]: This year participants will include Assistant Superintendent Galussi, myself, we will have special education coordinators on this committee just like we did the last cycle.

466
03:11:20,679 --> 03:11:30,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Our English learner director will be on the team, both literacy coaches, and then we've offered it up to teachers to see who will participate.

467
03:11:30,327 --> 03:11:34,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are getting a range of teachers, kindergarten through fifth grade,

468
03:11:35,174 --> 03:11:39,056
[SPEAKER_00]: special education teachers, EL teachers, and our reading teachers.

469
03:11:39,396 --> 03:11:50,641
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to ensure that each school is represented and as much as possible, and we want to ensure that each grade is represented as well, as much as possible, each grade, each school, if we can get there.

470
03:11:51,501 --> 03:11:58,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the topics that we will look at over the next two years are looking at our foundational reading needs.

471
03:11:58,764 --> 03:12:01,125
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to constantly look at that with the data.

472
03:12:02,110 --> 03:12:09,473
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at how the program can support or what other tools we may need, what other groupings we may need, schedules and such.

473
03:12:10,053 --> 03:12:11,673
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at comprehension needs.

474
03:12:12,514 --> 03:12:22,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Once students have been able to decode, their comprehension is a significant initiative that we need to make sure we're understanding what we're reading.

475
03:12:22,977 --> 03:12:30,300
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at writing sequences, small group instruction, how grammar plays into our instruction,

476
03:12:31,673 --> 03:12:40,417
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue in this group to look at assessment and notification cycles, and then continue to vet and inform report card alignment.

477
03:12:40,557 --> 03:12:48,421
[SPEAKER_00]: That alone is a huge initiative, but we want to make sure we have it on that list because it is a big need.

478
03:12:52,643 --> 03:12:57,386
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite a bit that we hope to accomplish in the DLLT over the next two years.

479
03:12:58,428 --> 03:13:07,613
[SPEAKER_00]: As we go on, the next slide is going to share with you some of the literacy training that's been accomplished over the past year.

480
03:13:08,093 --> 03:13:14,316
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, well, actually two years, we have the science of reading series offered through the Hill for literacy.

481
03:13:14,917 --> 03:13:19,359
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was where we had multiple teachers and administrators trained.

482
03:13:19,419 --> 03:13:26,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see from the slides, we had our elementary teachers, reading teachers, all engaged in the science of reading series through the Hill.

483
03:13:27,694 --> 03:13:37,320
[SPEAKER_00]: We then had multiple elementary teachers, K through two and three through five, begin the training in 2023, and that will carry into 2025.

484
03:13:38,161 --> 03:13:42,863
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've had our administrators engage in the training as well.

485
03:13:43,024 --> 03:13:54,871
[SPEAKER_00]: So we began last year, principals, assistant principals, special ed coordinators, EL director, we began last year, and we will continue with the modules this year.

486
03:13:55,956 --> 03:14:00,398
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in learning more about our module series, it's a wonderful course.

487
03:14:00,778 --> 03:14:02,278
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the brain in reading.

488
03:14:02,398 --> 03:14:04,719
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the power of phonemic awareness.

489
03:14:04,739 --> 03:14:05,880
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the list there.

490
03:14:06,600 --> 03:14:23,486
[SPEAKER_00]: But each module, as you can imagine, is quite intense and really helps us see from an administrator what we should be seeing in the classroom for the science of reading and for the teachers how they can continue to use their instruction to support this.

491
03:14:27,976 --> 03:14:30,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional trainings have included DIBLS.

492
03:14:31,398 --> 03:14:41,344
[SPEAKER_00]: We have with our Medford, with a partnership with Medford Public Schools and The Hill, we have trained all elementary reading teachers in administering DIBLS.

493
03:14:42,124 --> 03:14:49,468
[SPEAKER_00]: We have begun the process of training, planning the training for the elementary educators.

494
03:14:49,568 --> 03:14:55,912
[SPEAKER_00]: So on March 4th, our PD day, we will ensure that all our elementary educators are trained

495
03:14:56,385 --> 03:15:01,628
[SPEAKER_00]: and our special education program teachers will begin that initial training in the winter.

496
03:15:03,368 --> 03:15:05,990
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we have another diagnostic.

497
03:15:06,570 --> 03:15:07,510
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the dibbles.

498
03:15:07,851 --> 03:15:15,414
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we need to dig deeper, we have what we call the letter name, letter sound inventories, as well as the quick phonics screener.

499
03:15:15,915 --> 03:15:25,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we train teachers, the literacy coaches did a wonderful job providing a strong overview of these inventories and these diagnostics.

500
03:15:25,435 --> 03:15:32,058
[SPEAKER_00]: for our teachers so that they could be equipped to administer them correctly and get the information that they needed.

501
03:15:32,918 --> 03:15:43,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Another training that we just had in September was on Lexia Core 5, which was offered through Lexia Learning and Medford Public Schools.

502
03:15:44,303 --> 03:15:54,927
[SPEAKER_00]: So really ensuring that the teachers understand how to capitalize on Lexia Core 5 and personalize instruction for students, particularly during small groups.

503
03:15:57,369 --> 03:15:58,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've taken that training.

504
03:16:00,630 --> 03:16:01,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.

505
03:16:02,091 --> 03:16:02,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Rousseau.

506
03:16:03,051 --> 03:16:03,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

507
03:16:04,391 --> 03:16:15,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I know the answer, but I just want you to confirm the English learners are not the letter name, letter sound inventories is they're not there because of they have a very different.

508
03:16:15,835 --> 03:16:16,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

509
03:16:17,356 --> 03:16:17,896
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not.

510
03:16:18,496 --> 03:16:20,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're looking at is the true

511
03:16:20,956 --> 03:16:21,876
[SPEAKER_00]: the training for them.

512
03:16:23,357 --> 03:16:33,400
[SPEAKER_00]: For the QPS, the quick phonics screener, we are training, we are providing an overview to all EL teachers because the newcomer teachers do use that.

513
03:16:33,460 --> 03:16:38,622
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually use a... We're all using our district version now, so they do use the quick phonics screener.

514
03:16:39,562 --> 03:16:45,784
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've decided that we will give an overview to the newcomer teachers again on the district version of our QPS.

515
03:16:46,371 --> 03:16:56,979
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, even though the EL pull-out teachers won't use it, won't administer it, we do want to ensure that they are aware of it so that we can continue those lines of communications.

516
03:16:56,999 --> 03:16:59,040
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to operate in silos, obviously.

517
03:16:59,280 --> 03:17:00,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question?

518
03:17:00,281 --> 03:17:00,881
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, yes.

519
03:17:00,942 --> 03:17:01,542
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you.

520
03:17:04,224 --> 03:17:04,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone else?

521
03:17:05,125 --> 03:17:05,905
OK, good.

522
03:17:06,526 --> 03:17:07,266
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep going.

523
03:17:07,366 --> 03:17:12,390
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take our training, and we move on to our data cycle and meeting format.

524
03:17:16,204 --> 03:17:26,090
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly intensive process where we now take all the data that you've seen us review just now and look at it as a team.

525
03:17:26,690 --> 03:17:39,618
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a wonderful two days where we had all our classroom teachers as well as our EL newcomer teachers take this data and really begin to analyze it.

526
03:17:40,259 --> 03:17:44,141
[SPEAKER_00]: We will and I'm going to talk a little bit more about that in a moment but

527
03:17:44,608 --> 03:17:46,569
[SPEAKER_00]: just so you can get an overview of this.

528
03:17:46,689 --> 03:17:54,654
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have three data meetings for our beginning of year benchmarks, our middle of year benchmark, and our end of year benchmark.

529
03:17:55,014 --> 03:18:03,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So those three trainings will occur and all students engage in those, take those assessments.

530
03:18:03,960 --> 03:18:07,722
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have, well, we have the progress monitoring.

531
03:18:08,183 --> 03:18:10,224
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our second data meeting

532
03:18:11,249 --> 03:18:12,730
[SPEAKER_00]: is our fall progress monitoring.

533
03:18:12,890 --> 03:18:17,974
[SPEAKER_00]: All teachers are involved in that, but not all students take progress monitoring.

534
03:18:18,054 --> 03:18:21,836
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the outcome of the initial benchmark.

535
03:18:22,357 --> 03:18:36,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take a benchmark and we determine based on looking at the data from data meeting one, as well as other information, if we determine that those students will be progress monitored, we will then be looking at their data at that second meeting and then the fourth.

536
03:18:37,127 --> 03:18:40,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we have five data meetings with Hill for Literacy,

537
03:18:41,313 --> 03:18:53,320
[SPEAKER_00]: very informative, making sure that data is not sitting there, making sure it's used for instruction, that it's not just testing for the sake of testing, it's testing to inform instruction.

538
03:18:54,781 --> 03:19:03,846
[SPEAKER_00]: The next slide, which is slide nine, just gives you an overview of the specificities of the benchmarks that we do administer.

539
03:19:04,427 --> 03:19:10,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the beginning of the year, we are administering, depending on the grade and depending on the need,

540
03:19:10,560 --> 03:19:16,884
[SPEAKER_00]: We have DIBELS, NWEA MAP, LNI, LSI, or QPS as needed.

541
03:19:17,785 --> 03:19:19,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have those Hill data meetings.

542
03:19:20,587 --> 03:19:31,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Our progress monitoring, we'll look at DIBELS, the letter name sound inventories, and the quick phonics screener, and then so on and so forth.

543
03:19:31,354 --> 03:19:38,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want me to go through each one, but you can get a sense of the different assessments as we move through these meetings.

544
03:19:41,773 --> 03:19:48,634
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already alluded to this, but essentially what we do with the data is we're going to make data informed decisions.

545
03:19:49,375 --> 03:19:57,056
[SPEAKER_00]: So some things that the teachers have already done after the first data meeting were to identify the skills students needed to master.

546
03:19:57,976 --> 03:20:05,278
[SPEAKER_00]: At the first data meeting, which occurred just last week, for each child, they implemented what we call an instructional focus.

547
03:20:05,338 --> 03:20:10,079
[SPEAKER_00]: So they looked at each child, the different assessments that were available for the child,

548
03:20:10,612 --> 03:20:19,634
[SPEAKER_00]: and working with Hill and the elementary reading department, we're able to choose an instructional focus for each student.

549
03:20:20,674 --> 03:20:27,536
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, they're now working on constructing small groups based on data points and any additional instructional needs.

550
03:20:28,336 --> 03:20:31,937
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're reviewing the literacy materials as needed to support these students.

551
03:20:31,977 --> 03:20:36,758
[SPEAKER_00]: So which materials from our very comprehensive program will be most beneficial to the student.

552
03:20:37,258 --> 03:20:39,399
[SPEAKER_00]: They're collaborating with supporting staff

553
03:20:40,350 --> 03:20:55,841
[SPEAKER_00]: as needed, and then we begin to activate the progress monitoring for specific students once we have engaged in instruction to make sure that the instruction we've selected is correct and is making gains for the child.

554
03:20:56,381 --> 03:20:59,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we provide additional support for students as needed.

555
03:20:59,604 --> 03:21:09,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So that first data meeting, quite a lot of this was covered, and teachers left with an instructional focus for their students to continue throughout

556
03:21:10,800 --> 03:21:11,420
[SPEAKER_00]: next few weeks.

557
03:21:12,401 --> 03:21:15,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I will turn it back to Dr. Galussi.

558
03:21:17,042 --> 03:21:23,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing I would just quickly highlight, just so if we're wondering about the icon in the middle, I probably should have had you focus on that.

559
03:21:24,884 --> 03:21:25,304
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

560
03:21:25,404 --> 03:21:31,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of this work in the data meetings that we're creating the structure for is this continuum

561
03:21:31,636 --> 03:21:44,963
[SPEAKER_03]: platform and this is a literacy-based platform where all of the student data, the assessments, go onto this platform and it helps educators generate that instructional focus.

562
03:21:45,403 --> 03:22:00,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with each progress monitoring and with each new assessment, that data will go in and we'll be able to keep track of the progress and how the students are doing because instructional, some students may have more than one instructional focus and we'll be able to

563
03:22:01,636 --> 03:22:03,597
[SPEAKER_03]: target specifically what the need is.

564
03:22:03,797 --> 03:22:06,277
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as they're progressing, move on to what's next.

565
03:22:06,758 --> 03:22:12,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to draw to that, that attention, um, to the platform that's being used during a lot of these data meetings.

566
03:22:14,460 --> 03:22:24,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So the, the last little piece here, as we're taking all of this data, um, there is another level in terms of like the implementation.

567
03:22:24,423 --> 03:22:30,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are the meetings that happen that are, uh, literacy and action we're calling it.

568
03:22:30,305 --> 03:22:30,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And so,

569
03:22:31,049 --> 03:22:52,232
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several administrative meetings monthly and throughout the year with Dr. Kieser and myself, the literacy coaches, and some of them are also with Hill for Literacy where we are constantly reviewing the data and setting goals and agendas for our meetings and any training or professional development or support that's needed.

570
03:22:53,089 --> 03:22:56,531
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also making sure that we have monthly meetings with principals.

571
03:22:56,771 --> 03:22:59,994
[SPEAKER_03]: So this, principals have a lot on their plates.

572
03:23:00,494 --> 03:23:11,061
[SPEAKER_03]: They are getting training in science of reading, but they are also meeting with Hill for Literacy around data, and they are also meeting with myself and Dr. Chiesa around this same piece.

573
03:23:12,302 --> 03:23:18,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And also that, how they can support teachers during literacy instruction in their classrooms.

574
03:23:20,151 --> 03:23:24,133
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have meetings with the literacy coaches on quite a regular basis.

575
03:23:24,554 --> 03:23:38,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Monthly, they have training with Hill for Literacy so that they are going on guided observations so that they are also learning firsthand and growing their skill as literacy coaches within our district.

576
03:23:39,972 --> 03:23:52,447
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some teachers that have been wonderful and have volunteered to work directly with hill for literacy during those in person coaching sessions, which are happening once a month at every single elementary school.

577
03:23:54,750 --> 03:24:10,045
[SPEAKER_03]: identify teachers at every building at every grade that will get the direct coaching from Hill, that our literacy coaches will also be there to observe, grow their skill set, and be able to also model that for other teachers.

578
03:24:11,308 --> 03:24:22,737
[SPEAKER_03]: They are involved in direct co-planning and modeling with educators, as previously mentioned, and work with Dr. Chiesa and I to drive our literacy plan for the year.

579
03:24:23,377 --> 03:24:26,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've already kind of highlighted a lot of the principles.

580
03:24:26,440 --> 03:24:40,471
[SPEAKER_03]: The only piece that hasn't been discussed is that they have dedicated common planning time with their staff to also move this work within their building based on specific building and grade level needs.

581
03:24:41,611 --> 03:24:49,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last piece is there are various ways that we try to, we are always looking to improve, but that we try to communicate with caregivers.

582
03:24:50,535 --> 03:24:58,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So as previously mentioned, the literacy coaches will be doing a DIBLS 8 overview again in two different ways.

583
03:24:59,440 --> 03:25:06,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Chiesa and I, as we did last year, will send out the DIBLS screening letter globally this week.

584
03:25:07,284 --> 03:25:26,976
[SPEAKER_03]: that just explains to parents, again, about the DIBLS assessment and that what the regulations are around the early literacy screening per the Department of Education and Mass Literacy, and that they will hear from us if their child has been flagged for at-risk.

585
03:25:28,276 --> 03:25:31,078
[SPEAKER_03]: We also sent home the NWEA map

586
03:25:31,360 --> 03:25:47,820
[SPEAKER_03]: growth reports, we do that at the first report card so that teachers, there's that opportunity for conversation so that educators are able to explain to the caregiver how these are being used to target their students' specific need.

587
03:25:48,921 --> 03:25:50,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Because just as a reminder,

588
03:25:52,190 --> 03:26:04,555
[SPEAKER_03]: All of this data is really for the educators to meet the student needs, and for school based and district wide administrators to to support teachers, so they can meet the students needs.

589
03:26:06,363 --> 03:26:08,544
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have the report card conference opportunities.

590
03:26:08,904 --> 03:26:19,329
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the elementary reading department provides three to four family events for students and the caregivers of those students that receive reading services.

591
03:26:20,430 --> 03:26:23,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are in the process of being created right now.

592
03:26:23,752 --> 03:26:25,693
[SPEAKER_03]: There's usually three to four a year.

593
03:26:25,713 --> 03:26:30,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Dr. Chiesa and I are also in the process of finalizing.

594
03:26:30,735 --> 03:26:34,257
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a caregiver evening that kind of

595
03:26:35,077 --> 03:26:39,260
[SPEAKER_03]: shows the inter-reading program in action for caregivers.

596
03:26:39,480 --> 03:26:41,641
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be sometime this fall.

597
03:26:42,922 --> 03:26:46,584
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to be very ambitious just so that we can set the stage for that.

598
03:26:47,965 --> 03:26:51,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And we welcome any questions or suggestions that you may have.

599
03:26:52,588 --> 03:26:52,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

600
03:26:54,149 --> 03:26:55,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham, then Member Reinfeld.

601
03:26:55,550 --> 03:26:56,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

602
03:26:59,488 --> 03:27:10,316
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some commentary on social media in the last week or so about whether or not the district provides DIBLS results.

603
03:27:10,917 --> 03:27:17,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And the general consensus of the parents was you had to ask for those results.

604
03:27:18,102 --> 03:27:20,764
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't sound like that based on what you just said.

605
03:27:20,824 --> 03:27:25,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just trying to understand clearly, like, who gets results?

606
03:27:25,908 --> 03:27:27,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Does everyone get results?

607
03:27:28,164 --> 03:27:29,404
[SPEAKER_07]: and if not, why not?

608
03:27:30,985 --> 03:27:36,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we rolled this out last year, we were following the guidelines for mass literacy.

609
03:27:38,046 --> 03:27:47,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as we presented last year, DIBLS is approved through the Department of Education, checks all the boxes, which is why we've navigated towards that.

610
03:27:48,107 --> 03:27:56,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So their recommendation is for grades one through five, you use the first year benchmark and that you are informing parents

611
03:27:57,250 --> 03:27:59,411
[SPEAKER_03]: that whose students were at risk.

612
03:28:01,813 --> 03:28:06,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And kindergarten parents are informed at the middle of year benchmark.

613
03:28:08,477 --> 03:28:11,159
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what does it mean to be at risk?

614
03:28:11,619 --> 03:28:14,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, is there like a threshold?

615
03:28:17,303 --> 03:28:19,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And is there a reason why we would not

616
03:28:19,505 --> 03:28:21,406
[SPEAKER_07]: just give everybody their results.

617
03:28:21,886 --> 03:28:30,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Because basically what's happening on social media is sort of a push to go everybody as individuals to the principal to request the results.

618
03:28:30,450 --> 03:28:39,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And that seems like it is going to be far more complicated than if we just gave parents the results that we have.

619
03:28:42,972 --> 03:28:47,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when we, I think I understand that piece of it.

620
03:28:47,735 --> 03:28:53,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of it is, I think we can have that conversation that I think that's fine.

621
03:28:55,460 --> 03:28:59,602
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that we have, first I'll answer your first question.

622
03:28:59,702 --> 03:29:01,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to remember your first question.

623
03:29:01,503 --> 03:29:06,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first question was about, so for each grade level, there is a threshold.

624
03:29:06,706 --> 03:29:12,410
[SPEAKER_03]: So for K and one, we're using what's called the composite number, which is kind of like a summary of all the subtests.

625
03:29:13,382 --> 03:29:18,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for students that were flagged, it could mean several reasons.

626
03:29:18,923 --> 03:29:28,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times it just, some of it is readiness, but they, it's for students that are performing below grade level.

627
03:29:29,426 --> 03:29:35,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for students in grades two through five, we use a predominant measure because we have the NWEA map.

628
03:29:37,208 --> 03:29:41,869
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not using the comprehension component of the DIBLS program.

629
03:29:42,409 --> 03:29:42,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's,

630
03:29:43,610 --> 03:29:53,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Students are flagged, unless you wanted to add on, students are flagged for being below grade level in the reading skill at risk.

631
03:29:53,937 --> 03:29:54,497
[SPEAKER_07]: For two to five?

632
03:29:55,298 --> 03:29:55,618
[SPEAKER_03]: For all.

633
03:29:55,638 --> 03:29:56,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

634
03:29:56,699 --> 03:29:57,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Through K through five.

635
03:30:00,061 --> 03:30:02,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that level shifts depending on the grade.

636
03:30:04,163 --> 03:30:05,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it, got it.

637
03:30:06,165 --> 03:30:11,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And on this chart where we have in our packet the

638
03:30:11,636 --> 03:30:19,400
[SPEAKER_07]: whether schools are title one, how many total students there are, how many reading teachers there are in the grades that the reading teachers are servicing.

639
03:30:20,060 --> 03:30:23,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a way to add to that chart, like the number of students who are at risk?

640
03:30:23,882 --> 03:30:31,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you just look at the numbers, there's a huge distribution of how much support is happening in buildings.

641
03:30:31,705 --> 03:30:39,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's really perfectly aligned with like the number of students who need support, and then there's like even out caseloads, that makes some sense.

642
03:30:40,904 --> 03:30:55,529
[SPEAKER_07]: but if you just look strictly at like total population it's hard to understand like are we doing are there enough reading teachers in our district and are they deployed in the right places?

643
03:30:57,889 --> 03:30:59,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would I would say

644
03:31:02,605 --> 03:31:02,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

645
03:31:03,405 --> 03:31:20,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we always are looking at need, which is why we added an additional person to the McGlynn school based on the level of need, especially in last year's data, um, around our EL population and just how that population has shifted in the school.

646
03:31:21,316 --> 03:31:25,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I also want, we can absolutely get you those numbers.

647
03:31:25,639 --> 03:31:31,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I just also want to make note that the way that the reading services are also structured is a tiered approach.

648
03:31:31,866 --> 03:31:47,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it is, we can give you the students that have been identified, but the reading teachers are servicing, I will break it down so that you can see that there are some students that are receiving reading services that are just receiving reading services.

649
03:31:47,852 --> 03:31:50,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are some students that are duly identified.

650
03:31:50,253 --> 03:31:52,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're EL and they're also special education.

651
03:31:52,413 --> 03:31:58,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could always use more support, but I will say that, especially for fiscal year 25,

652
03:32:02,674 --> 03:32:09,339
[SPEAKER_03]: The I exhausted every penny I could on reading teachers.

653
03:32:10,659 --> 03:32:18,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I think I think that breakdown would be helpful and it would be helpful next year.

654
03:32:19,517 --> 03:32:25,041
[SPEAKER_07]: for us, like, or, and I'm not even sure that this is the right, like, exact time of year to look at that.

655
03:32:25,542 --> 03:32:25,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

656
03:32:25,982 --> 03:32:27,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, maybe it's like a look back for last year.

657
03:32:28,004 --> 03:32:28,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

658
03:32:28,945 --> 03:32:33,949
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, whatever the thing is that we land on is like, this is when we're going to look at this.

659
03:32:34,869 --> 03:32:41,575
[SPEAKER_07]: What you would ideally see over time as this curriculum takes hold, right, and matures in the district.

660
03:32:42,315 --> 03:32:48,160
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we are being successful in our efforts to keep, to do more,

661
03:32:50,276 --> 03:32:57,762
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of holistic instruction at tier one, there should be fewer students over time who need these services.

662
03:32:57,942 --> 03:33:02,826
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would be ideal to be able to see that in this chart somehow.

663
03:33:02,926 --> 03:33:06,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So like last year we had a hundred students at risk.

664
03:33:06,790 --> 03:33:07,570
[SPEAKER_07]: This year we have 90.

665
03:33:08,331 --> 03:33:19,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so because, and I know it gets like very wild and complicated when you're talking about all the grades and all the things, but there has to, I feel like one of the things we don't do that well as a district is,

666
03:33:20,663 --> 03:33:24,505
[SPEAKER_07]: give people a concise way to say, are we making progress?

667
03:33:25,025 --> 03:33:29,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that we have talked a lot about moving the need to where the need is.

668
03:33:29,667 --> 03:33:33,329
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm making an assumption that that's why these numbers look so strange.

669
03:33:33,769 --> 03:33:41,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you really calculate the math, it intuitively makes sense to me based on what I know about each of those school buildings.

670
03:33:41,593 --> 03:33:49,397
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want the data to actually just make that clear for everybody who just may not tune into these meetings every

671
03:33:50,165 --> 03:34:00,441
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, for four or five hours every other Monday night so, so I think there's like a couple of things there from like a historical and data perspective that would be helpful to see.

672
03:34:01,983 --> 03:34:05,309
[SPEAKER_07]: As we think about like this work and are we making progress.

673
03:34:06,229 --> 03:34:11,871
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to add, we did have another row in that table, which was exactly what students served actually.

674
03:34:11,911 --> 03:34:26,936
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's funny that, and then we took, we got rid of it because right now we were still grappling with the data and didn't feel like that number was the true number quite yet, but absolutely we can get that number.

675
03:34:26,996 --> 03:34:28,737
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, today we were just looking at

676
03:34:29,346 --> 03:34:30,647
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the results.

677
03:34:30,827 --> 03:34:37,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we were cross comparing like the two of the grades at one of the schools to look and see, was that going down?

678
03:34:37,673 --> 03:34:38,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, where were the trends?

679
03:34:39,574 --> 03:34:40,815
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can absolutely get the number.

680
03:34:40,915 --> 03:34:44,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's quite ready yet, but will be in the next week or so.

681
03:34:44,718 --> 03:34:45,419
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was there.

682
03:34:45,519 --> 03:34:53,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we know, well, I think that's a good, that's a good question, which is like, when is the right time to have some of these conversations?

683
03:34:53,245 --> 03:34:54,726
[SPEAKER_07]: This maybe is too early.

684
03:34:55,504 --> 03:35:00,387
[SPEAKER_07]: if you want to look at what's happening, like from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, if you don't yet have the data.

685
03:35:01,447 --> 03:35:18,677
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that's interesting, we were looking at cohort survival models for MSBA enrollment purposes, and it was easy to see a cohort move through the ranks, right?

686
03:35:18,737 --> 03:35:23,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could see in this year, there were 100 kindergartners, and next year there were

687
03:35:24,871 --> 03:35:25,651
[SPEAKER_07]: 99 first graders.

688
03:35:25,691 --> 03:35:28,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the year after that, there were 102 second graders.

689
03:35:28,654 --> 03:35:31,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could sort of see that progression.

690
03:35:32,356 --> 03:35:35,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like that is like a really complicated data view.

691
03:35:35,939 --> 03:35:45,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if the tools that you're using can provide something like that, but to be able to see a cohort improve over time, I think would actually tell the story that like this all works, right?

692
03:35:46,327 --> 03:35:48,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had X number of kids in kindergarten.

693
03:35:48,929 --> 03:35:50,630
[SPEAKER_07]: We had fewer kids in first grade.

694
03:35:50,670 --> 03:35:52,252
[SPEAKER_07]: We had fewer kids in second grade.

695
03:35:52,772 --> 03:35:53,773
[SPEAKER_07]: And by third grade,

696
03:35:54,278 --> 03:35:55,299
[SPEAKER_07]: we had even fewer.

697
03:35:55,359 --> 03:35:58,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, I think what I would want to see from this.

698
03:35:58,701 --> 03:36:09,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that means that this is not the right time of year to get this presentation, it's also not my personal goal to make you come to as many school committee meetings as possible to talk about literacy.

699
03:36:09,248 --> 03:36:19,936
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there's a better time of year for you to come where like a better story is available, like I am all ears for that because this group, this,

700
03:36:20,734 --> 03:36:22,715
[SPEAKER_07]: meeting has no shortage of topics.

701
03:36:22,775 --> 03:36:27,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just want to make good use of your time and the data that's available.

702
03:36:28,858 --> 03:36:33,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to echo what Dr. Keyes was saying, we literally have had these conversations ongoing.

703
03:36:34,541 --> 03:36:47,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think where last year was the first year for DIBLS, and it was also the first year for the science of reading training for teachers, which that really is a huge priority for us to just keep pushing that.

704
03:36:48,068 --> 03:36:50,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single teacher needs to have that science of reading training.

705
03:36:51,075 --> 03:36:52,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not an easy feat.

706
03:36:53,196 --> 03:37:06,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think in partnership with just continuing to have that, because in order to improve, as you so wonderfully said, that tier one instruction, we have to make sure that all the teachers have the science of reading training.

707
03:37:06,760 --> 03:37:19,784
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think because this is the second year of DEVILS, we are starting to have those conversations around, because we're even seeing the need across classrooms and the teachers that are going to need some additional support.

708
03:37:21,397 --> 03:37:24,198
[SPEAKER_03]: because of where the numbers are falling.

709
03:37:24,458 --> 03:37:38,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think for us to be, and because the real key for kindergarten is not to the middle of the year, I think that for us to be looking at those five cycles of data, but to maybe come at the end of the year would be great.

710
03:37:38,204 --> 03:37:40,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

711
03:37:40,025 --> 03:37:40,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

712
03:37:40,965 --> 03:37:41,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

713
03:37:42,046 --> 03:37:42,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Reinfeld?

714
03:37:42,846 --> 03:37:48,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I was just wondering what opportunities there are for teachers to give feedback or share

715
03:37:49,892 --> 03:37:51,373
[SPEAKER_12]: how well it is working for them.

716
03:37:51,413 --> 03:37:59,557
[SPEAKER_12]: I realize there's still a lot of training going on, but that formative assessment of, is this curriculum working for us and for the people who are delivering it?

717
03:37:59,577 --> 03:38:16,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I can see a lot of these meetings coming, we're looking at the student data and we're really focused on the students, which is absolutely important, but I, where the teacher voice and their experience, is that happening in the PD sessions?

718
03:38:16,305 --> 03:38:17,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that happening in the weekly meetings?

719
03:38:18,260 --> 03:38:20,561
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to the, can I speak?

720
03:38:20,621 --> 03:38:21,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, go ahead.

721
03:38:22,181 --> 03:38:29,323
[SPEAKER_00]: The DLLT really also, there's multiple opportunities for teachers to express themselves, and we want that.

722
03:38:30,143 --> 03:38:39,405
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that those that can join the DLLT team, or if they can't join but then a representative is reaching out to their colleagues,

723
03:38:40,071 --> 03:38:52,721
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where we're doing a lot of looking at the program, especially last year when we were implementing and seeing, okay, the writing isn't, you know, we need to work a little bit more on nailing our sequencing down.

724
03:38:52,741 --> 03:38:57,585
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like the DLLT was very productive in doing that.

725
03:38:57,665 --> 03:39:06,953
[SPEAKER_00]: It offered a safe space to share concerns and to share, you know, positive and negative, you know, different pieces.

726
03:39:07,113 --> 03:39:09,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel, to be fair, that the teachers are probably,

727
03:39:10,327 --> 03:39:13,868
[SPEAKER_00]: still digesting the program because it is very comprehensive.

728
03:39:14,348 --> 03:39:15,489
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all still learning.

729
03:39:16,489 --> 03:39:19,510
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we need to have that DLLT team continue.

730
03:39:19,830 --> 03:39:27,772
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually going to be more in-person with the team too, which I don't think I mentioned, so that we can get some of those things done.

731
03:39:28,892 --> 03:39:37,755
[SPEAKER_00]: One other example is, you know, one thing that the DLLT team did was it looked at the program and it came up with some common assessments.

732
03:39:38,547 --> 03:39:44,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came up with, you know, what is an assessment that we know from the program that all second graders are going to take?

733
03:39:45,857 --> 03:39:50,463
[SPEAKER_00]: And we very clearly said, this is something that we will circle back to.

734
03:39:50,764 --> 03:39:51,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it work?

735
03:39:51,665 --> 03:39:52,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this informative?

736
03:39:53,227 --> 03:39:56,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where that DLLT team will be very productive.

737
03:39:56,451 --> 03:40:00,574
[SPEAKER_12]: And participation on the DLT is volunteer basis?

738
03:40:00,635 --> 03:40:00,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

739
03:40:01,455 --> 03:40:04,298
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't turn anybody away.

740
03:40:05,358 --> 03:40:06,640
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's no stipend?

741
03:40:06,860 --> 03:40:08,601
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't a stipend on that one.

742
03:40:08,641 --> 03:40:17,569
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do feel like the energy and the willingness to participate in it is quite high, because we're making some real decisions.

743
03:40:18,601 --> 03:40:20,082
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboratively, which is what I want.

744
03:40:20,182 --> 03:40:21,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that.

745
03:40:21,302 --> 03:40:21,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.

746
03:40:22,462 --> 03:40:35,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And to that point, the only thing that I would highlight is, I'm so glad you mentioned that work, because that work to build our scope and sequence, our pacing, our assessment, it was key for the DLL team members.

747
03:40:35,427 --> 03:40:40,689
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we also sent out several surveys throughout the year so that we got all teacher perspectives.

748
03:40:41,069 --> 03:40:47,491
[SPEAKER_03]: It was brought up as part of common planning times to also have those discussions within those smaller groups.

749
03:40:47,984 --> 03:40:59,551
[SPEAKER_03]: and the DLLT members in each school were having some of those conversations in the building so that when we were making those decisions, we tried to get as much cross representation and voice as possible.

750
03:41:00,731 --> 03:41:06,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're gonna still need to do that this year as we move, because it is massive and overwhelming.

751
03:41:07,075 --> 03:41:14,199
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to shout out to our literacy coaches as well, you know, they're working on the ground every day with the teachers.

752
03:41:14,279 --> 03:41:15,620
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're able to,

753
03:41:18,238 --> 03:41:25,560
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking to teachers, obviously, of course, as well, but they're really able to give us that live experience and that feedback, too.

754
03:41:25,820 --> 03:41:26,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thank you.

755
03:41:26,601 --> 03:41:26,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

756
03:41:28,521 --> 03:41:29,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

757
03:41:29,161 --> 03:41:32,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

758
03:41:32,862 --> 03:41:41,705
[SPEAKER_10]: 8.48 p.m., report number four on Metro Public Schools rate card, Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of enrichment, innovation, and operations.

759
03:41:48,370 --> 03:41:49,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening again, everybody.

760
03:41:49,831 --> 03:41:52,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Quickly, this is one part of the rate card.

761
03:41:53,454 --> 03:41:57,998
[SPEAKER_06]: As we have settled collective bargaining agreements, we need to increase the rates that we charge our renters.

762
03:41:58,979 --> 03:42:04,663
[SPEAKER_06]: After talking with Mr. Gerald McHugh over the summer, he made calculations.

763
03:42:05,064 --> 03:42:10,608
[SPEAKER_06]: $70 should be enough to cover our expenses based on this.

764
03:42:11,008 --> 03:42:15,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand also that there are other parts of the rate card that were still open from last spring.

765
03:42:17,013 --> 03:42:22,097
[SPEAKER_06]: but I am not here to discuss those at this point, just this one aspect.

766
03:42:22,638 --> 03:42:23,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve the rate card.

767
03:42:24,439 --> 03:42:24,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

768
03:42:25,139 --> 03:42:25,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve.

769
03:42:25,800 --> 03:42:26,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

770
03:42:26,500 --> 03:42:28,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

771
03:42:28,862 --> 03:42:29,603
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

772
03:42:29,623 --> 03:42:30,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

773
03:42:30,243 --> 03:42:30,844
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

774
03:42:30,904 --> 03:42:31,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Rate card's approved.

775
03:42:32,265 --> 03:42:35,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Recommendation to approve construction of Brooks Hot Water Heater at $267,000.

776
03:42:35,307 --> 03:42:35,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, Dr. Peter Cushing.

777
03:42:39,854 --> 03:42:41,856
[SPEAKER_06]: This includes a 10% contingency.

778
03:42:42,416 --> 03:42:55,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to the administration and chief of staff, Nina Nazarian, for putting this on for the committee of the whole last week for the capital stabilization fund that was established by the city, I believe last June 30th or thereabouts.

779
03:42:57,127 --> 03:43:01,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will be covered by that stabilization fund.

780
03:43:01,571 --> 03:43:03,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave you two of the quotes that we have.

781
03:43:03,832 --> 03:43:05,754
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing our best to examine a third quote.

782
03:43:05,794 --> 03:43:07,856
[SPEAKER_06]: However, this is an extremely time sensitive

783
03:43:08,836 --> 03:43:16,978
[SPEAKER_06]: project, and the cost vastly exceeded what our initial expectations were and what I presented on.

784
03:43:17,758 --> 03:43:18,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

785
03:43:19,159 --> 03:43:22,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I am Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

786
03:43:22,880 --> 03:43:23,540
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

787
03:43:23,560 --> 03:43:24,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

788
03:43:24,260 --> 03:43:24,980
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

789
03:43:25,540 --> 03:43:26,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the work.

790
03:43:26,241 --> 03:43:26,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor?

791
03:43:26,821 --> 03:43:27,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushing.

792
03:43:28,121 --> 03:43:32,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just say thank you to the Council for moving quickly on this ask.

793
03:43:33,483 --> 03:43:34,643
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really important

794
03:43:35,703 --> 03:43:37,284
[SPEAKER_07]: that schools have hot water.

795
03:43:37,304 --> 03:43:50,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that goes without saying, but also when you need to spend $267,000, like you need the cooperation of the Council and the Stabilization Fund to do that.

796
03:43:50,691 --> 03:43:51,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to say thank you.

797
03:43:52,612 --> 03:43:59,035

822
03:45:47,284 --> 03:45:48,325
[SPEAKER_10]: The request should include

823
03:45:51,072 --> 03:45:57,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one, current wait lists for this school year by building in comparison of the prior three years at a comparable point in time.

824
03:45:58,577 --> 03:46:06,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Two, enrollment information at outside programs and a summary of the offerings MPS is supporting via transportation or other activities.

825
03:46:07,622 --> 03:46:14,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Three, for each wait list, the percent of students on our wait list that are enrolled elsewhere versus entirely unenrolled.

826
03:46:15,347 --> 03:46:16,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Four, description of efforts pursued

827
03:46:17,892 --> 03:46:21,814
[SPEAKER_10]: create programming at Andrews Middle School and or with Medford Recreation.

828
03:46:23,115 --> 03:46:27,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Five, summary of other initiatives to expand programming citywide and or within MPS.

829
03:46:29,827 --> 03:46:30,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

830
03:46:30,748 --> 03:46:31,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

831
03:46:32,730 --> 03:46:46,565
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a meeting back in March where we discussed a whole series of questions and those questions never quite came like back around to us so I just want to make sure that they do and I also

832
03:46:48,847 --> 03:46:58,134
[SPEAKER_07]: would like to be clear about some of these questions and where we are versus where we've been because I've had a number of parents in the last couple weeks tell me we've made no progress.

833
03:46:59,355 --> 03:47:07,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't actually think that's true, but I believe that that is what it looks like because we don't provide data in a way that allows people to understand what progress looks like.

834
03:47:08,385 --> 03:47:20,837
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to, I'm totally open to when between now and the end of December, you need to be able to provide this report, which is why I didn't put a date, a requested date on it.

835
03:47:20,937 --> 03:47:24,220
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do think it's important for us to have this conversation.

836
03:47:24,240 --> 03:47:26,081
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a continuing issue.

837
03:47:26,201 --> 03:47:31,827
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of these questions are really trying to get at what does solving this problem look like?

838
03:47:32,808 --> 03:47:33,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I think

839
03:47:33,621 --> 03:47:43,212
[SPEAKER_07]: that looks different depending on who you talk to, but I think this will help us maybe have a conversation and help the community be part of that conversation as well.

840
03:47:44,313 --> 03:47:45,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

841
03:47:46,296 --> 03:47:54,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham, my clarifying question in regards to number three regarding the waitlist

842
03:47:55,945 --> 03:48:14,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that question saying if there were students that are currently on the Medford public schools waitlist and they're currently enrolled in the YMCA or RSK or Sigma, is it to say, remove those students from the list to see who's actually still left over?

843
03:48:15,327 --> 03:48:19,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what I want to be able to see is if there's 100 kids on the waitlist.

844
03:48:19,589 --> 03:48:25,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's 100, but if there's 100, are 99 of them enrolled elsewhere in the city?

845
03:48:25,893 --> 03:48:33,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think as a community, we have always thought of solving the afterschool problem as a thing that Medford Public Schools has to do on its own.

846
03:48:34,418 --> 03:48:39,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to lots of advocacy from lots of parents, there actually are other programs now.

847
03:48:40,344 --> 03:48:46,290
[SPEAKER_07]: They have created other problems for us to solve, which is why I want to know, what is the size and context of the problem?

848
03:48:46,310 --> 03:48:48,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to know, if there's 100 kids,

849
03:48:55,539 --> 03:48:57,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they all enrolled somewhere else?

850
03:48:57,944 --> 03:48:59,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they half enrolled somewhere else?

851
03:48:59,728 --> 03:49:02,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that we have that data because we bused them, right?

852
03:49:02,734 --> 03:49:05,420
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just trying to understand clearly what

853
03:49:07,469 --> 03:49:10,370
[SPEAKER_07]: it is that we are trying to solve for.

854
03:49:10,550 --> 03:49:24,097
[SPEAKER_07]: And if what we're trying to solve for is transportation so that we can continue to promote other programs in our community, like everybody else has for like decades and decades, where we're just sort of starting that process, right?

855
03:49:25,017 --> 03:49:31,700
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a different solution than continuing to sort of bump up against, is it 80 or 100 kids in a building?

856
03:49:32,480 --> 03:49:37,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And we keep hearing 100 is too many, but we keep saying, but we do it in one building.

857
03:49:37,523 --> 03:49:48,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're like around and around the circle, which is fine if what we haven't done is agree on like what the problems are that we're trying to solve.

858
03:49:48,248 --> 03:49:50,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we're just trying to make it better.

859
03:49:51,569 --> 03:49:59,293
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think we've been very targeted in our like solutions and maybe that's okay because it means we're trying like every which way that we can.

860
03:49:59,847 --> 03:50:07,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I just would like us to be clear and to be able to see the data over time, which I don't think we've really ever been able to do all that well.

861
03:50:08,092 --> 03:50:08,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

862
03:50:08,692 --> 03:50:09,753
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be able to work on that.

863
03:50:09,853 --> 03:50:10,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

864
03:50:10,413 --> 03:50:19,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to work with whoever, as they create the report, if there's help I can provide or I'm totally happy to help.

865
03:50:20,659 --> 03:50:21,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

866
03:50:22,781 --> 03:50:23,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
