    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8484.507s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8485.929s">Welcome</a>  to tonight's school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8489.258s">As</a>  the leaves have begun to change color, today's rain put a slight halt to what was a beautiful stretch of fall weather here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8498.124s">Whether</a>  you have participated in New England fall classics, such as apple picking, scarecrow designing, or escaping a challenging corn maze, I hope you and your families are able to enjoy the autumn beauties of what Middlesex County has to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8515.355s">October</a>  is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time to honor those affected by breast cancer and to spread awareness about early detection and treatment options. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8527.499s">The</a>  American Cancer Society held their annual Boston Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk this weekend, and it was terrific to see so many members of New England come together for this important cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8541.351s">Remember,</a>  regular screenings and self-exams can make a vital difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8547.072s">According</a>  to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, when caught in its earliest localized stages, the five-year relative survival rate of breast cancer is 99%. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8557.834s">I</a>  encourage you to visit their website and other resources for further information about breast cancer awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8568.968s">Also,</a>  October is Down Syndrome Awareness and Dyslexia Awareness Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8575.37s">This</a>  month, let's come together to raise awareness and celebrate the unique strengths of our diverse community. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8583.313s">Medford</a>  Public Schools staff members are here to support all of our students and families working to reach their educational goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8596.351s">While</a>  there are lots of exciting developments across Mustang Nation since we all last gathered, this weekend was another busy one across Mustang Nation, with students, families, and staff members coming together to achieve goals and create long-lasting memories. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8616.281s">On</a>  a very high note, our Medford High School football team scored a big victory over our next-door neighbors, Somerville High School, on Friday night, where captain Justin Marino broke a 52-year-old school record. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8634.688s">the</a>  senior scored six touchdowns, eclipsing Babe Colonna's record of five set on Thanksgiving in 1972. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8647.036s">In</a>  addition to his six touchdowns, Marino finished the game with 200 rushing yards, an interception, a blocked field goal, and a fumble recovery in a 48 to 12 victory for our Mustangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8662.686s">I'd</a>  also like to thank Tufts University for hosting and to our supporters for their sportsmanship displayed throughout the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8672.691s">After</a>  performing alongside our football team on Friday, our Medford High School marching band spent Saturday afternoon and evening at the New England Scholastic Band Association's fall event at Westford Academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8690.579s">I</a>  am happy to share that our band finished in first place in their division. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8696.701s">Perhaps</a>  even more impressively, the band also took home overall competition awards in both Best Visual Performance and Best General Effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8710.885s">The</a>  Best Visual Performance Award showcases the stunning visual elements of our Mustang performance, which were brought to life by our talented guard and precise choreography. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8725.248s">Similarly,</a>  the Best General Effect Award reflects the overall impact of the performance, from the music to the visuals, and how well the bands came together to create a cohesive and engaging experience for the audience and judges alike. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8743.437s">Congratulations</a>  to our new band director, Michael Dampier, and all of our students for their amazing performances this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8752.38s">We</a>  look forward to continuing to hear you shine throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8758.303s">Among</a>  many other exciting events, yesterday, our Brooks Elementary School hosted their annual fall festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8766.77s">This</a>  beloved event was a fantastic way to embrace the spirit of the season and support our school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8775.057s">They</a>  had a wide variety of exciting games, food, rides, crafts, and vendors for kids and families of all ages to enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8784.305s">I'd</a>  like to give a special thank you to the Brooks PTO and Principal Shannon Deimos and her school community for hosting this welcoming event. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8796.659s">Tomorrow,</a>  Medford Public Schools and the City of Medford will be hosting the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8807.136s">Tuesday,</a>  October 8th, beginning at 3.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8811.018s">to</a>  celebrate the official opening of our new universally accessible playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8817.661s">Members</a>  of the public are invited to celebrate and most importantly, play on the new playground following the ceremony. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8826.502s">The</a>  new playground has already been used by our school and surrounding community and the early enjoyment has been so heartwarming to witnesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8836.432s">There</a>  are countless types of play opportunities for all children. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8840.696s">The</a>  new and inclusive Gaga pit has especially been a roaring success amongst all the new playground equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8850.561s">If</a>  you need a reasonable accommodation to attend or participate in tomorrow's ribbon-cutting ceremony, please contact the City of Medford ADA coordinator, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8861.728s">Frances</a>  Nwaje. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8864.83s">As</a>  a reminder to our community, next Monday, there will be no school in observance of Indigenous Peoples Day and Columbus Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8875.734s">Tonight,</a>  you will hear a report on the Communities That Care Youth Survey from Assistant Superintendent, Dr. Peter Cushing, Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health, Stacey Shulman, Director of Physical Education and Health, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8892.841s">Perry,</a>  Rachel Perry, joining us online, and the Medford Manager of the Office of Prevention and Outreach, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8901.824s">Catherine</a>  Dhingra. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8904.385s">Later</a>  on, you will hear an elementary literacy update from Assistant Superintendent, Dr. Galluzzi, and Director of Humanities, Dr. Chiesa. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8913.707s">And</a>  finally, Dr. Cushing will present on Medford Public Schools rate cards

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8926.169s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8928.39s">We</a>  have number two, Communities That Care Youth Survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8931.11s">Dr.</a>  Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8934.366s">Innovation</a>  and Operations, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8935.968s">Stacey</a>  Shulman, Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8939.571s">Rachel</a>  Perry, Director of Physical Education and Health, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8942.715s">Catherine</a>  Dhingra, Manager of our Office of Prevention and Outreach for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8947.359s">Welcome,</a>  everybody.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8953.951s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor and members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8956.553s">Thank</a>  you for this opportunity to present as we do every two years on the Community Cares Youth Survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8963.158s">Tonight's</a>  presentation looks a little bit different, just also because Catherine is new to the team and really want to welcome her. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8969.762s">She's</a>  been a really great help to us as we've been moving through. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8973.105s">And</a>  Director Perry is online. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8975.607s">If</a>  you'll just give me a second while I share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8979.173s">Um,</a>  two slides were added. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8981.155s">Those</a>  are at your place. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8983.157s">Um,</a>  those will be updated to the, uh, report as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8987.441s">Uh,</a>  when it's posted online and <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=8993.667s">So</a>  the Communities that Care Youth Survey has been administered to Medford High School and middle school students in 2017, 19, 21, and 23 using bivariate chi-square analyses. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9008.481s">The</a>  results have been examined. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9011.824s">on</a>  whether student outcomes differed from the year of the survey administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9016.465s">And</a>  2023, we added personal characteristics, gender identity, sexual race identity, and otherwise noted finding was deemed significant where there was a standard deviation of approximately 0.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9031.39s">I'll</a>  now hand it over to the team and see you in a few minutes.</p>

    <p>[Dhingra]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9041.117s">So,</a>  hi everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9042.158s">My</a>  name is Catherine Dingra and I am pleased to be part of this team. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9046.34s">I</a>  started in the city of Medford back in June and coming from about 20 years experience doing surveys like this and other communities including Wakefield and Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9057.847s">And</a>  what's great about coming into Medford is seeing the <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9063.877s">wide</a>  variety of programming that you all are doing already here to address the protective factors and risk factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9072.059s">So</a>  this survey gave us a nice overview of what the Medford students, their gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, along with protective factors and risk factors that we're going to get into. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9084.743s">So</a>  we really wanted to look at <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9087.073s">behavioral</a>  health, substance use rates, bullying, and some of the other factors that impact students' health and well-being, that impact their ability to learn in the school environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9098.477s">So</a>  we're gonna take a look at that tonight and take a look at how the personal characteristics impact those stats. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9106.099s">So</a>  we'll move to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9109.04s">Okay,</a>  so I'm gonna turn it over to Stacey for mental health.</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9113.697s">So</a>  these are some of the factors that the survey asks. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9116.278s">As</a>  you can notice, they talk about four groupings of questions that lead to potential depressive symptoms by year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9124.082s">This</a>  is all four of the survey distributions from 2017 to 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9129.405s">And</a>  you'll notice, we're very happy to see that depressive symptoms are trending downward from the 2019-2021 peaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9141.018s">This</a>  is middle school students' depressive symptoms by sexual orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9145.003s">So</a>  you'll notice that our LGBTQ plus population are more likely to endorse depressive symptoms in our middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9154.872s">This</a>  is by race and ethnicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9157.174s">There</a>  was a trend here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9158.435s">So</a>  on this trend, we wanna note that the P value is less than 0.10, which is not statistically significant, but middle school students who identified as Latino were more likely to endorse depressive symptoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9172.505s">I'm</a>  sorry, that it is statistically significant than students who identify as white on three of the four items. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9182.145s">For</a>  high school students, this is the same four questions we're looking at again, depressive symptoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9187.468s">You'll</a>  once again notice that the 2023, there was a drop in students endorsing depressive symptoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9194.212s">So</a>  that's the trend that we wanna see continue on. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9199.135s">Depressive</a>  symptoms by gender at the high school, you'll notice that our genderqueer, non-binary, unsure students are noting more depressive symptoms than other categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9213.208s">Substance</a>  use, back to Catherine.</p>

    <p>[Dhingra]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9216.09s">So</a>  as you can, yeah, I'm just gonna show a picture back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9220.552s">As</a>  you can see, substance use trends have changed dramatically over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9226.035s">And</a>  here are kind of some of the more recent substance use trends of things that we've had to take a look at what our students are encountering and what the trends are. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9236.98s">So</a>  you can see that pen down on the corner is actually a THC vape pen found in a, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9243.014s">neighboring</a>  district schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9244.415s">So</a>  the devices are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9246.256s">The</a>  Zen pouches are a way that students are utilizing nicotine now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9252.399s">And</a>  we know alcohol continues to be the number one substance that students are using. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9261.243s">We</a>  were happy to see middle school substance use rates trending down. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9266.005s">And</a>  this is a national trend and a statewide trend that overall substance use rates are trending down <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9273.482s">And</a>  we're glad to see that and sometimes we did see an increase in vaping in the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9279.328s">So</a>  That's something that we are looking at The high school we had because of the survey intake of juniors and seniors we decide not to present those CTC data because it was lower amongst our juniors and seniors and it didn't <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9296.753s">it</a>  didn't prove valid to show the trend data. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9300.215s">So</a>  I wanted to show the high school substance use rates across the state, which typically I looked at some comparison tended to trend with Medford year over year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9311.762s">So</a>  you can see statistically that substance rates are coming down with both alcohol, marijuana, and vaping across the state have come down, but it's still <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9323.908s">something</a>  that we're concerned about, but one thing that we'll talk about when we talk about strategies in a little bit is you see the higher numbers, but we really like to say that most students aren't using substances, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9337.932s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9341.033s">Member</a>  Russo?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9342.353s">Are</a>  these percentages on this slide?</p>

    <p>[Dhingra]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9344.114s">Yes,</a>  those are percentages. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9345.374s">I'm</a>  sorry, I tried to insert percentages, but that's percentage of students ninth through 12th grade.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9353.915s">And</a>  Peter is going to talk about some we did we talk about quantitative data and we talked about qualitative data and this is some interesting data So, thanks to some funds coming in from the opera grant that the city has We have installed four vape sensors at Medford High School two in two girls bathroom one in two girls bathrooms and <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9380.563s">in</a>  boys' bathrooms as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9383.224s">We</a>  are watching this data. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9386.825s">It</a>  is worth its weight, I think, in gold because it is showing, I think, how vast the problem is and the challenge to really educate our youth as to the challenges of vape. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9399.968s">So</a>  these are some screen captures that came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9403.945s">that</a>  give you a sense of the health index, the air quality index. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9410.071s">You'll</a>  see that air quality index broken out in the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9414.857s">That</a>  was a slide that I gave you today. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9417.84s">You</a>  also see the number of instances <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9420.623s">This</a>  data was from last Friday when I inserted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9424.387s">So</a>  week to date on the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9428.291s">One</a>  of the sensors was not properly connected so it wasn't collecting data, which is why it's low. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9436.558s">but</a>  we rectified that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9437.94s">They</a>  were installed on the last Thursday in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9441.162s">I</a>  think that was September 27th. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9445.025s">And</a>  you see the week forward data for last week, 104, 92, 68, and 45 over the various bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9457.396s">It</a>  also picks up, the sensors pick up acts of aggression. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9461.859s">words</a>  of aggression, they don't record or anything along those lines but if somebody says help if somebody here if it does seem like a commotion, it will register as aggression, it will register if the device is being tampered with it will register, and I'll move to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9480.379s">You</a>  can see here the air quality indexes as well as noise levels in the bathrooms for the highest points of noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9493.865s">It</a>  gives you the temperature, the CO, the CO2, and those types of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9499.107s">These</a>  also are things that we haven't had the professional development yet to really dive into. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9503.669s">I</a>  see a question, Madam Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9508.884s">Can</a>  we see a copy of what the baseline numbers look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9514.869s">What</a>  is elevated? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9515.909s">Is</a>  zero the baseline on everything?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9518.431s">I</a>  can get you those. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9519.212s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9519.572s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9524.035s">Member</a>  Bramley? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9525.416s">So</a>  acts of words of aggression if device is tampered with, have we seen that devices have been tampered with?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9532.179s">Unfortunately,</a>  one device was removed from the ceiling by students on the second day. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9538.282s">But</a>  we were able to respond, myself and Principal Cabral, just because we were the only two people at that point receiving the data, as they had literally been set up the day before. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9548.607s">We</a>  both responded to the bathroom and addressed the students in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9555.591s">Principal</a>  Cabral took over and dealt with the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9560.473s">The</a>  device has been restored to its place on the ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9565.036s">Students</a>  were shocked to think that they might be responsible for a $2,500 device if they were to destroy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9572.241s">And</a>  that helped with the identification of individuals involved.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9577.305s">And</a>  then with the acts of words or aggression, how are we following up with that?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9582.18s">I</a>  would have to the we actually just had the first one this morning, so I would have to follow up with the principle of that but right now just so that everyone's aware we're purchasing iPads, so that not only our cameras, but also the sensors can be monitored by our building monitors the system principles, while they move throughout the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9604.25s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9606.031s">While</a>  the results come to their email, once the app is loaded on your phone, you can set up for notifications as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9616.357s">As</a>  you can tell from the levels of data, which, hold on, I just got to remember what the next slide is. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9622.38s">This</a>  is another slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9623.621s">As</a>  you can see, it's a frequent occurrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9629.024s">And</a>  please remember, these are four locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9633.896s">I</a>  would love to be able to see us eventually move to a point where these are more ubiquitous in the district and also in our middle school bathrooms as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9645.784s">Because</a>  the data, and I think Catherine might be able to speak to this far better than I can, but the data that we're seeing is that the usage of these vape devices is happening at sometimes fifth and sixth grade.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9661.4s">So</a>  just a follow-up question on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9663.101s">With</a>  the amount that the device is going off, say 104 times for the second floor boys bathroom, is that bathroom being monitored? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9669.965s">I</a>  mean, I'm assuming no one's running to the bathroom 104 times during a day to see the device went off, so what's happening?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9675.988s">But</a>  it's also monitoring a bathroom while students are expecting a certain level of privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9685.233s">So</a>  what we're doing is we're marrying this data with our camera system. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9688.755s">to</a>  be able to have those conversations, use the I Decide program for diversion, and to really try to not see this as a disciplinary issue, but to see this as a public health crisis for our students, and to be able to really understand how, as a society, we had beaten back tobacco, but have now widely opened the doors on vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9716.289s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9718.106s">And</a>  if Catherine or Stacey or Rachel, who's on the call, have anything else to add, I welcome it because I know Stacey is intimately involved with the I Decide program. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9732.938s">Moving</a>  forward to bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9741.037s">So,</a>  Medford middle schoolers endorsed experiencing both physical and cyber bullying from 2017 to 2023 at a very similar frequency. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9753.124s">So,</a>  you can see the results when the surveys were done. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9757.146s">Experienced</a>  physical bullying in the past 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9760.568s">The</a>  percentages are here, so you can see of respondents, that's percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9765.891s">Experienced</a>  verbal bullying in the past 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9770.132s">and</a>  experienced cyberbullying in the past 30 days at pretty consistent rates across the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9781.391s">Middle</a>  school bullying experiences by race and ethnicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9785.434s">So</a>  middle schools identified as black were more likely to endorse experiencing physical bullying than those who identified as white. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9793.62s">Middle</a>  schoolers who identified as black were more likely to endorse experiencing cyberbullying than those who identified as Latino or white. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9805.846s">High</a>  schoolers who identified as LGBTQ plus were more likely than those who identified as heterosexual to endorse experiencing bullying and high school bullying experiences, verbal bullying, 2017 to 2023 in a similar frequency. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9827.412s">And</a>  just so you know, these are things that the district is continually working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9832.418s">And</a>  now we'll be talking about the strategies being put into play and protective factors.</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9839.482s">Thank</a>  you, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9840.842s">So</a>  in terms of our strategies and protective factors that we have at Medford Public Schools, helpful adults, as we've talked about before, are one of the key strategies in order to both connect with our students and get students connected to care if they need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9855.547s">So</a>  we're pleased to see here that high school students increased their <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9863.107s">naming</a>  someone who is a helpful adult at the high school and middle schoolers, there was really not much change from the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9871.373s">High</a>  schoolers who primarily spoke English at home were more likely to endorse experiencing a helpful adult at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9876.656s">So</a>  that's an important data point for us to consider moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9881.059s">Once</a>  again, here is our MTSS system of support in terms of counseling and supportive services to address students who are in need of care. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9894.471s">Social-emotional</a>  strategies that we have across the district include restorative practices, our wind blocks, our advisory classes, health and wellness classes, Nexus, and EL class push-ins from counselors. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9908.344s">School</a>  culture and support systems district-wide include our Start with Hello programming, which is under Sandy Hook Promise, our GSA programming, both at the middle school and high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9919.904s">And</a>  of course, our say something reporting service, the Mustang All Stars at the high school level, Mustang Way at the middle school, we're running circles. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9930.246s">And</a>  then the high school level is running PD on equity, highlighting a sense of belonging. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9935.107s">The</a>  city is also running a campaign to reach out to our community members to get them connected to care who are part of our Latino population. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9949.525s">In</a>  terms of substance use prevention and intervention strategies, we have a lot of new programs that we're lucky to have this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9957.169s">We're</a>  running an I Decide Diversion program for students who are caught vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9961.652s">That</a>  is about four hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9964.714s">of</a>  education around substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9966.636s">It's</a>  an alternative to punitive response for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9969.86s">We</a>  are lucky to have a youth wellness coach with us two days a week, who is running Project AMP. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9974.906s">That's</a>  students one-on-one coaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9977.509s">And</a>  it really is a youth-driven substance use prevention and early intervention program for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9983.14s">And</a>  then we will be starting, we just identified our advisor, a Medford Youth Action Team. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9988.862s">And</a>  we'll be connecting with the help of Catherine, our Youth Action Team lead, and students to other neighborhood schools who are running similar programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9998.886s">This</a>  is Katie Kobe, our Youth Wellness Coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10002.268s">She</a>  is mentored and supported by C4 Initiatives, and we were able to have a Youth Wellness Coach through the support of our partnership with MGH, so we're really pleased. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10014.367s">I'll</a>  let Rachel talk to the evidence-based health education.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10018.969s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10020.61s">I</a>  apologize for not being there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10021.911s">I</a>  just finished up a volleyball game, so I'm online. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10025.933s">So</a>  some of the things we've been doing in health education, we're using the Michigan model for health for K to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10032.957s">We</a>  conducted a HECAT evaluation of the Michigan model and decided to stay with it, but to make some changes and to look at a new sex education curriculum <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10044.37s">Desi</a>  just came out with their recommendation, so that's something we'll be working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10048.754s">For</a>  K-5, we have our Nexus curriculum, which now includes health education lessons that started last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10055.242s">So</a>  now our elementary students will be getting more health education lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10060.996s">We</a>  also updated our puberty lessons for we're using puberty happens lessons added for our fifth graders that also happened last year, and we are also combining everyone together in those lessons on this year we're adding vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10078.784s">lessons</a>  to the fifth grade nexus curriculum, because what we have seen in the past year is we're seeing more students in the sixth grade starting to vape. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10087.871s">So</a>  we're trying to pull those lessons in a little bit earlier to help educate our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10095.116s">Guidance</a>  counselors are doing introduction days at the high school in our phys ed and health classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10100.519s">So</a>  that's for ninth graders so that when they come to the high school, they get to meet that guidance counselor. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10106.149s">as</a>  part of their health and phys ed class, they go to their office, they talk about what their guidance counselor can help them with so that they have that relationship early on in their freshman year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10117.196s">We</a>  also, with our new wellness coach, she's gonna be coming into our phys ed and health classes to introduce herself and to talk a little bit to our students about what she can support them with. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10129.344s">We</a>  have our suicide prevention presentations, our SOS and NAN project, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10133.769s">That</a>  happens throughout our health classes from nine to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10137.29s">Mentors</a>  and violence prevention lessons in our portal to hope presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10142.252s">That's</a>  been happening for the past few years as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10145.954s">We've</a>  been increasing our professional development for our teachers and for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10150.916s">We've</a>  had our teachers go last year out to Mayford and get some training in health education there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10158.038s">We</a>  had our nexus teachers actually train in puberty education. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10162.589s">We</a>  had our high school teachers go out and train in sex education as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10167.111s">Staff</a>  will be going on November 5th again to Mayford to get some more training. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10170.973s">So</a>  we're really trying to increase our training for our staff to make sure that we're supporting and supplying the needs of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10180.317s">We're</a>  going to continue to make KiCat and Frameworks changes to our curriculum this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10185.159s">So</a>  hopefully by the end of the year, we will have everything mapped out and ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10190.396s">And</a>  we will be continuing to review the DESE recommended curriculums to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10199.402s">And</a>  I think that's all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10205.526s">I'll</a>  speak to a little bit of the caregiver and parent university. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10211.368s">which</a>  we have started this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10213.99s">We</a>  did an athletic orientation, which Catherine did some presenting as well, which was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10220.295s">We</a>  had 200 parents that attended that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10226.32s">We</a>  did a training back in April on drug, alcohol, and addictive <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10232.254s">education</a>  and the doctors that spoke talked about curriculums and presenting the education to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10240.64s">But</a>  the biggest piece was to make sure that we're adding parents into that mix. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10245.283s">The</a>  parents need this education as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10247.205s">So</a>  that was one of the big things that we wanted to add was a parent caregiver university. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10253.009s">And</a>  that's, you know, starting this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10255.07s">And</a>  I know, Catherine, if you want to talk about the navigating the caregiver's guide that you put together.</p>

    <p>[Dhingra]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10262.679s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10263.339s">Peter's</a>  just getting our new, um, hot off the press, hot off the press caregiver university. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10269.122s">And</a>  this is an initiative I did in my previous district and it was widely successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10273.884s">And</a>  that's the thing that we're excited as the health department to partner with the schools and leverage resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10280.906s">So</a>  we can, we know that children are well when their families are well, so we can provide that education and partner with the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10288.392s">and</a>  hear what some of the concerns are and bring those resources in. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10292.874s">So</a>  we're excited to launch the Medford Caregiver University, which will have a flagship experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10299.597s">And</a>  then throughout the year, we'll have a lot of different variety of topics based on what we're hearing from both parents and educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10307.341s">So</a>  we'll be doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10309.122s">Another</a>  thing we created was navigating the teen year guides. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10312.623s">If</a>  you were at one of our back to school nights, you got your guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10316.872s">And</a>  that's something, again, we partnered with the schools hearing about the different topics that they knew caregivers wanted to learn about. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10324.715s">And</a>  from the city, we put that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10327.176s">So</a>  we're just really thrilled to be partnering with the schools and helping our children be well and helping our parents stay educated and our caregivers stay educated on supporting their young people.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10343.142s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10343.963s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10346.112s">Member</a>  Reinfeldt and Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10349.916s">I</a>  have three questions, two of them for Director Perry. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10353.86s">You</a>  said HECAT framework changes to curriculum end of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10357.043s">Is</a>  that end of calendar year or end of school year?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10362.209s">I</a>  am hoping to get it done by the end of calendar year.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10365.401s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10366.081s">And</a>  then I was wondering at the middle school level, how the reduction in guidance counselors has affected the delivery of health education. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10373.662s">I</a>  know that was a big question during budget season about the teaching responsibilities with that position.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10382.204s">So</a>  I'll be, I don't know if Stacy wants to take that with the guidance counselor.</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10388.945s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10391.006s">All</a>  of the classes are covered by the one counselor in the building.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10398.553s">have</a>  other, do they have room in their schedule for other activities? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10402.294s">That</a>  was one of the things that concerns were expressed about.</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10406.936s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10407.356s">I</a>  think that, um, as we expected, it's challenging, um, for one person and, um, they're doing the best they can with the support of their, um, school adjustment counselor, school social workers.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10418.52s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10419.06s">And</a>  then my third question was just to confirm that the caregiver university is an a la carte model. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10424.462s">People</a>  can tune in and out to different sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10426.863s">It's</a>  not an enrollment based. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10429.292s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10430.973s">Thank</a>  you, Member Reinfeldt. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10431.994s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10433.796s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10434.836s">Can</a>  you tell me a little bit about where the content for Caregiver University comes from? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10440.16s">Like,</a>  are we creating content? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10441.862s">Are</a>  we buying content?</p>

    <p>[Dhingra]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10444.924s">So</a>  usually, it's a partnership between the city and the schools, and the content is usually both in-district expertise, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10458.207s">So</a>  we might, and then academically and then social emotional topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10463.608s">So</a>  we might bring in partners from the community or we might leverage, you know, somebody at Tufts University who is an expert on children and play or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10473.451s">So</a>  the topics range and usually we'll try to bring in a keynote on a topic that would cover, you know, that's more general. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10483.413s">For</a>  example, someone like Lynn Lyons on anxiety where a lot of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10487.947s">That's</a>  a hot topic that a lot of people want to learn about. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10490.308s">And</a>  then breakout sessions on college planning to the new math standards or something like that.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10499.51s">And</a>  is it videos? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10501.671s">Is</a>  it actual e-learning? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10504.672s">Is</a>  it seminars? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10507.493s">Can</a>  I watch this stuff any time? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10510.053s">Or</a>  how do I consume it?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10513.325s">So,</a>  ultimately, we want to make sure that we're able to, as best we can, save presentations and have them available either through the district YouTube channel or other media to be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10527.309s">But</a>  there'll be some as, you know, we've now implemented mandatory back to athletics nights for each of the seasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10536.292s">So</a>  those will be more challenging to record to present those types of things, but our hope is that a good example of an outside partner coming in last fall, if I remember correctly we had Dr Englander. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10552.132s">present</a>  on zoom, that would be an example of a future or past event that would fall under the caregiver parent and caregiver university logo as well as those athletic nights and really trying to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10567.962s">we're</a>  presenting to parents the things that are gonna really help them to work with their children to make their children be successful and be successful as parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10577.205s">So</a>  we haven't really gone into an e-learning model on it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10581.627s">It's</a>  more being able to produce the content and quality that really attracts parents and caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10589.689s">Because</a>  I think one of the things that we've all seen is when we put these efforts on, they're not sometimes the best attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10597.672s">So</a>  we want to make sure that they do remain available for people throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10601.393s">But</a>  I want to also, if the other three members of the team have anything to add.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10607.054s">So</a>  I guess what I would like to see is that there's like a central place where all of this content can live. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10615.176s">Like</a>  the athletics night is a great example. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10617.316s">It</a>  was mandatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10618.237s">I</a>  was unable to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10622.918s">I</a>  don't know how I, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10624.955s">address</a>  that as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10626.596s">But</a>  no one's followed up with me either. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10628.138s">So</a>  that would be like an example of, yes, it's in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10632.901s">Yes,</a>  you want people to come in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10635.303s">But</a>  what, like, what can this platform do for us to make sure that actually the parents who couldn't, I think there might have been a school committee, something at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10645.851s">So</a>  who can't come for whatever the reason might be still get the content that is happening in those <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10653.806s">important</a>  meetings, because like you said, people are busy, they people need to be able to consume content, sort of when it's convenient for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10660.829s">But</a>  I think in some cases, we also need to know that they consumed content, like, every time I register Lucas for sports, there's like 100 pages of waivers, and 100 things I'm supposed to like, view and watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10677.716s">And</a>  I actually make an effort to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10680.137s">But</a>  it is extremely easy to just <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10683.587s">scroll,</a>  scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, and click that I have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10688.491s">But</a>  if what the district is seeking is like cover, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10694.035s">You</a>  know, so if Lucas gets a concussion, like I, you have my signature that I've done something, but there's no evidence that you can point to that I actually did or didn't scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, click, sign my name and I'm done. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10710.027s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10710.368s">So</a>  I think there's like compliance and <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10713.703s">what</a>  we want, you know, from a requirements perspective as we think about all of this going forward, but then there's actually like, did it sink in or did it stick in any way, shape or form? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10726.752s">And</a>  was the thing that was really important actually delivered? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10732.356s">And</a>  I would argue that when you sign your kids up for sports, that is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10736.318s">Like</a>  the thing you needed parents to know when they like rolled out of that sign up, it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10743.553s">It's</a>  not the takeaway. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10745.975s">The</a>  takeaway is, wow, this system is bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10748.276s">And</a>  it is really tedious and time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10751.619s">And</a>  I'm glad that's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10753.24s">So</a>  I want to see parents be educated about these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10756.923s">And</a>  I think parents genuinely want to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10759.224s">But</a>  I think we have to do a better job of delivering that content for parents to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10763.767s">So</a>  I'm hoping that we can address some of that when we are thinking about the build out of this parent and caregiver university, because I think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10771.795s">it's</a>  very needed for all kinds of reasons.</p>

    <p>[Dhingra]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10775.556s">Yeah,</a>  and because a lot of this will be funded under grants, evaluation is a key part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10782.538s">So</a>  that's where we evaluate indefinitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10785.939s">And</a>  having parents and caregivers on the committee that help determine and provide feedback like that is crucial. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10793.621s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10796.341s">So</a>  we did... <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10798.951s">We</a>  just did want to follow up with our next steps on where we'll go with health and wellness and our students' well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10809.08s">As</a>  far as school data goes, we, as a team, are looking at exploring moving from the CTC to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10819.728s">This</a>  is what a lot of the communities around us do. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10823.752s">This</a>  is what the state does, so it's easier to compare <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10826.758s">to</a>  similar communities and to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10829.56s">So</a>  the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10831.301s">We'll</a>  add in more protective factor questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10834.644s">And</a>  then also the IDECIDE and MGH school-wide assessment as part of being partners with MGH. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10842.99s">That</a>  is a key component. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10844.631s">So</a>  we'll have some more quantitative data in the years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10849.815s">We'll</a>  be launching the Parent and Caregiver University. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10852.837s">So</a>  we look forward to <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10854.911s">being</a>  able to provide data and insight from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10858.452s">I</a>  know Rachel's been doing more with the professional development, including health educators and looking at the statewide standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10868.236s">And</a>  again, partnering with the health department, we can help leverage some professional development training and bring in outside experts for the school staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10877.479s">We</a>  have a task force that's gotten together to really start to address some of these strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10882.701s">So</a>  in the last four months, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10884.52s">We</a>  have incorporated a lot of new strategies to address these behavioral health substance use. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10895.066s">And</a>  we're looking forward to continuing to make changes.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10901.27s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10903.511s">Appreciate</a>  the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10909.984s">Yes,</a>  next we have report on elementary literacy update Dr. Suzanne Galluzzi, Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction and Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10920.117s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10941.018s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10941.519s">Would</a>  help if I turn the microphone on. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10944.624s">As</a>  Dr. Cushing puts the presentation up, I just want to say good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10949.271s">Thank</a>  you very much for the opportunity for us to talk to you tonight and provide an elementary literacy update. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10956.96s">So</a>  the structure of this presentation tonight is gonna highlight the work of our elementary literacy plan for school year 24-25, as we continue to advance and strengthen our literacy instruction across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10971.672s">This</a>  is a plan that is co-constructed with administration and the district leadership literacy team, as well as our consultant Hill for Literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10983.743s">Our</a>  agenda for this evening <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10985.956s">We</a>  are going to highlight the elementary district literacy plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10995.339s">I'm</a>  going to speak to about the role of the elementary literacy coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11000.242s">We</a>  are going to speak about the district literacy leadership team, the training, the coaching, the professional development we have done and we continue to do throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11010.547s">How</a>  the inter-reading program implementation has gone and will continue to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11015.67s">The</a>  data meetings that we have, the structure and the format that we've set up in the district, what we have done thus far and what we will continue to do throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11024.392s">We</a>  will talk a little bit about the student supports as a result of the gathered data and highlight some key family communication events and outreach opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11037.678s">So</a>  first, just because this is the frame for our work this year, as well as the presentation for this evening, these are our four key levers of our elementary district literacy plan for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11050.939s">So</a>  first is to install systems and processes to support the implementation of a multi-tiered assessment and instructional framework, which we have been building for a number of years now, but we're really at the stage this year where we're starting to put a lot of those teams in place and data cycles and training so that we actually can create a process moving forward across the district from school to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11076.919s">use</a>  core supplemental and intervention literacy curricula in a multi-tiered instructional model at each grade level effectively and strategically. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11086.483s">This</a>  is the piece that is really guiding a lot of our instruction so that teachers are really able to get an understanding of what to do with all of the data that we are collecting so that they can make those instructional decisions to target what students specifically need. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11105.0s">Collaborate</a>  through shared knowledge, skills, language, and collaboration among teachers based on the essential components of literacy and evidence-based instructional practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11114.191s">This</a>  is the key piece of that collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11116.974s">Teachers</a>  coming together to share their <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11120.049s">their</a>  knowledge, their skillset, that is done through common planning times, that is done through some training activities, and that is also done for the teachers that participate in the district literacy leadership team. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11134.025s">I'm</a>  gonna say DLLT for short. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11136.886s">And</a>  then finally, construct an assessment system and process for using measures of student performance to inform decisions at the district, school, grade, classroom, and individual student levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11147.294s">And</a>  that's kind of the fruition of all of our work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11153.238s">We</a>  are so excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11154.639s">We're</a>  growing very, excuse me, yeah, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11157.021s">We're</a>  growing very slowly here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11160.683s">But</a>  this body so graciously made sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11164.73s">literacy</a>  coaches were a priority in the budget, which we are very grateful for, and thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11170.974s">We</a>  did start the year with three coaches, and unfortunately we are down to two, so we've had to do a little restructuring district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11178.678s">The</a>  position is still posted, and Dr. Chiesa and I, with the two literacy coaches that are on staff and fully working, are still vetting <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11189.4s">resumes</a>  and going through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11191.401s">But</a>  we are so happy and very pleased. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11194.463s">We</a>  have Kristen Howell, who has been a very long devoted Medford Public Schools employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11201.066s">She</a>  was in a classroom for several years and also most recently has been a reading, a title one reading teacher at the Missittuck Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11212.512s">She's</a>  phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11213.433s">She</a>  will be servicing grades K through two. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11216.818s">And</a>  she also does work for the Hill for Literacy as a coach and an instruction specialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11225.945s">Both</a>  of our literacy coaches are reading licensed and fully accredited. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11231.028s">And</a>  new to Medford Public Schools is Julie Terwitz. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11234.671s">She</a>  has come to us, she has taught in primary grades in Dedham Public Schools, and most recently in Needham Public Schools <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11244.426s">as</a>  both a classroom teacher and then also as a literacy coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11249.288s">Julie</a>  is also highly accredited, but she will be servicing grades three through five for Metropolitan Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11256.891s">They</a>  work in tandem. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11259.652s">And</a>  so when they are creating their schedules, they are going to schools together so that they are working with teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11267.776s">Their</a>  role this year, they're going to get some direct coaching from Hill for Literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11271.527s">but</a>  they are here to support teachers and to support principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11275.59s">So</a>  in their support for teachers district-wide, they are working with them to model lessons for the newly implemented inter-reading program. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11285.66s">They</a>  are helping troubleshoot. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11287.422s">They</a>  are also helping to, when teachers have identified what an instructional focus is for students, they're going to help model some of what that small group instruction could look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11298.373s">And</a>  they also have an active hand in the data cycles that we are running five times this year, which Dr. Chiesa will highlight a little later. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11307.591s">They</a>  also are helping to support the elementary principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11310.373s">So</a>  again, with data cycles and data analysis and what principals can help support their teachers with, but also to help identify any need for professional development and keep Dr. Keyes and I in the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11327.383s">Last</a>  year, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11329.073s">Kristen</a>  Howell was in the same role as a literacy coach, and she did provide a caregiver Dibbles presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11339.27s">We</a>  are going to continue that this year, and both Kristen and Julie <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11344.228s">the</a>  dates are here, we'll be providing one in person in the evening and also virtually during the school day to hopefully accommodate varying schedules for caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11357.672s">This</a>  is an overview of what DIBLS-8 is, what it looks like, why we're collecting the data, and it will also be, we are also nearing the end of our data <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11370.368s">on</a>  the recent DIBLS assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11373.229s">And</a>  so we will highlight a little bit of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11375.79s">So</a>  some parents will also get this specifically in Letters Home, just to highlight the dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11383.612s">And</a>  so now I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Chiesa to talk a little bit about DLLT and our data cycles.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11392.483s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11393.224s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11394.205s">We're</a>  going to talk a little bit about our district literacy leadership team DLLT, which is an opportunity for us to have educators, administrators, multiple people involved in making some strong literacy choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11411.874s">so</a>  that we can all own the choices together and hear multiple voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11416.457s">This</a>  is our third year of the DLLT. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11419.339s">The</a>  first two years were co-facilitated with Hill for Literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11423.561s">Year</a>  one was our core program review where we were looking at the different options in terms of which program we would purchase and adopt as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11432.687s">The</a>  second year was taking that program and really going through all the nuances in terms of program implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11440.916s">What</a>  did we need? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11442.116s">How</a>  did teachers need to be supported? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11444.217s">What</a>  was working? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11445.337s">What</a>  isn't? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11446.057s">As</a>  you can imagine, it's quite a comprehensive program. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11449.278s">So</a>  there was a lot to digest and working together with the teachers, we were able to really lead the pathway for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11457.82s">Participants</a>  served on that committee for two years, and now we move into year three. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11464.121s">So</a>  year three will also be a two-year commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11467.929s">This</a>  year participants will include Assistant Superintendent Galussi, myself, we will have special education coordinators on this committee just like we did the last cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11480.679s">Our</a>  English learner director will be on the team, both literacy coaches, and then we've offered it up to teachers to see who will participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11490.327s">So</a>  we are getting a range of teachers, kindergarten through fifth grade, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11495.174s">special</a>  education teachers, EL teachers, and our reading teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11499.396s">We</a>  want to ensure that each school is represented and as much as possible, and we want to ensure that each grade is represented as well, as much as possible, each grade, each school, if we can get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11511.501s">Some</a>  of the topics that we will look at over the next two years are looking at our foundational reading needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11518.764s">We</a>  continue to constantly look at that with the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11522.11s">And</a>  then looking at how the program can support or what other tools we may need, what other groupings we may need, schedules and such. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11530.053s">We'll</a>  look at comprehension needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11532.514s">Once</a>  students have been able to decode, their comprehension is a significant initiative that we need to make sure we're understanding what we're reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11542.977s">We're</a>  looking at writing sequences, small group instruction, how grammar plays into our instruction, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11551.673s">We'll</a>  continue in this group to look at assessment and notification cycles, and then continue to vet and inform report card alignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11560.557s">That</a>  alone is a huge initiative, but we want to make sure we have it on that list because it is a big need. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11572.643s">So</a>  quite a bit that we hope to accomplish in the DLLT over the next two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11578.428s">As</a>  we go on, the next slide is going to share with you some of the literacy training that's been accomplished over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11588.093s">So</a>  we have, well, actually two years, we have the science of reading series offered through the Hill for literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11594.917s">And</a>  that was where we had multiple teachers and administrators trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11599.419s">So</a>  if you see from the slides, we had our elementary teachers, reading teachers, all engaged in the science of reading series through the Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11607.694s">We</a>  then had multiple elementary teachers, K through two and three through five, begin the training in 2023, and that will carry into 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11618.161s">And</a>  then we've had our administrators engage in the training as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11623.024s">So</a>  we began last year, principals, assistant principals, special ed coordinators, EL director, we began last year, and we will continue with the modules this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11635.956s">If</a>  you're interested in learning more about our module series, it's a wonderful course. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11640.778s">We</a>  look at the brain in reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11642.398s">We</a>  look at the power of phonemic awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11644.739s">You</a>  have the list there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11646.6s">But</a>  each module, as you can imagine, is quite intense and really helps us see from an administrator what we should be seeing in the classroom for the science of reading and for the teachers how they can continue to use their instruction to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11667.976s">Additional</a>  trainings have included DIBLS. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11671.398s">We</a>  have with our Medford, with a partnership with Medford Public Schools and The Hill, we have trained all elementary reading teachers in administering DIBLS. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11682.124s">We</a>  have begun the process of training, planning the training for the elementary educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11689.568s">So</a>  on March 4th, our PD day, we will ensure that all our elementary educators are trained <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11696.385s">and</a>  our special education program teachers will begin that initial training in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11703.368s">In</a>  addition, we have another diagnostic. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11706.57s">So</a>  we have the dibbles. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11707.851s">And</a>  then when we need to dig deeper, we have what we call the letter name, letter sound inventories, as well as the quick phonics screener. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11715.915s">And</a>  so we train teachers, the literacy coaches did a wonderful job providing a strong overview of these inventories and these diagnostics. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11725.435s">for</a>  our teachers so that they could be equipped to administer them correctly and get the information that they needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11732.918s">Another</a>  training that we just had in September was on Lexia Core 5, which was offered through Lexia Learning and Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11744.303s">So</a>  really ensuring that the teachers understand how to capitalize on Lexia Core 5 and personalize instruction for students, particularly during small groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11757.369s">So</a>  we've taken that training. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11760.63s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11762.091s">Member</a>  Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11763.051s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11764.391s">I</a>  think I know the answer, but I just want you to confirm the English learners are not the letter name, letter sound inventories is they're not there because of they have a very different.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11775.835s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11777.356s">They</a>  did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11778.496s">And</a>  what you're looking at is the true <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11780.956s">the</a>  training for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11783.357s">For</a>  the QPS, the quick phonics screener, we are training, we are providing an overview to all EL teachers because the newcomer teachers do use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11793.46s">They</a>  actually use a... We're all using our district version now, so they do use the quick phonics screener. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11799.562s">So</a>  we've decided that we will give an overview to the newcomer teachers again on the district version of our QPS. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11806.371s">And</a>  also, even though the EL pull-out teachers won't use it, won't administer it, we do want to ensure that they are aware of it so that we can continue those lines of communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11816.999s">We</a>  don't want to operate in silos, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11819.28s">Does</a>  that answer your question? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11820.281s">It</a>  does, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11820.942s">OK,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11824.224s">Anyone</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11826.526s">I</a>  will keep going. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11827.366s">So</a>  we take our training, and we move on to our data cycle and meeting format. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11836.204s">fairly</a>  intensive process where we now take all the data that you've seen us review just now and look at it as a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11846.69s">We</a>  had a wonderful two days where we had all our classroom teachers as well as our EL newcomer teachers take this data and really begin to analyze it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11860.259s">We</a>  will and I'm going to talk a little bit more about that in a moment but <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11864.608s">just</a>  so you can get an overview of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11866.689s">We</a>  will have three data meetings for our beginning of year benchmarks, our middle of year benchmark, and our end of year benchmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11875.014s">So</a>  those three trainings will occur and all students engage in those, take those assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11883.96s">We</a>  also have, well, we have the progress monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11888.183s">So</a>  we have our second data meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11891.249s">is</a>  our fall progress monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11892.89s">All</a>  teachers are involved in that, but not all students take progress monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11898.054s">It</a>  depends on the outcome of the initial benchmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11902.357s">So</a>  if we take a benchmark and we determine based on looking at the data from data meeting one, as well as other information, if we determine that those students will be progress monitored, we will then be looking at their data at that second meeting and then the fourth. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11917.127s">Okay,</a>  so we have five data meetings with Hill for Literacy, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11921.313s">very</a>  informative, making sure that data is not sitting there, making sure it's used for instruction, that it's not just testing for the sake of testing, it's testing to inform instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11934.781s">The</a>  next slide, which is slide nine, just gives you an overview of the specificities of the benchmarks that we do administer. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11944.427s">So</a>  at the beginning of the year, we are administering, depending on the grade and depending on the need, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11950.56s">We</a>  have DIBELS, NWEA MAP, LNI, LSI, or QPS as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11957.785s">And</a>  then we also have those Hill data meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11960.587s">Our</a>  progress monitoring, we'll look at DIBELS, the letter name sound inventories, and the quick phonics screener, and then so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11971.354s">I</a>  don't know if you want me to go through each one, but you can get a sense of the different assessments as we move through these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11981.773s">And</a>  I already alluded to this, but essentially what we do with the data is we're going to make data informed decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11989.375s">So</a>  some things that the teachers have already done after the first data meeting were to identify the skills students needed to master. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11997.976s">At</a>  the first data meeting, which occurred just last week, for each child, they implemented what we call an instructional focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12005.338s">So</a>  they looked at each child, the different assessments that were available for the child, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12010.612s">and</a>  working with Hill and the elementary reading department, we're able to choose an instructional focus for each student. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12020.674s">From</a>  there, they're now working on constructing small groups based on data points and any additional instructional needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12028.336s">And</a>  then we're reviewing the literacy materials as needed to support these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12031.977s">So</a>  which materials from our very comprehensive program will be most beneficial to the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12037.258s">They're</a>  collaborating with supporting staff <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12040.35s">as</a>  needed, and then we begin to activate the progress monitoring for specific students once we have engaged in instruction to make sure that the instruction we've selected is correct and is making gains for the child. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12056.381s">And</a>  then we provide additional support for students as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12059.604s">So</a>  that first data meeting, quite a lot of this was covered, and teachers left with an instructional focus for their students to continue throughout <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12070.8s">next</a>  few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12072.401s">And</a>  with that, I will turn it back to Dr. Galussi.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12077.042s">And</a>  the only thing I would just quickly highlight, just so if we're wondering about the icon in the middle, I probably should have had you focus on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12084.884s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12085.404s">Part</a>  of this work in the data meetings that we're creating the structure for is this continuum <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12091.636s">platform</a>  and this is a literacy-based platform where all of the student data, the assessments, go onto this platform and it helps educators generate that instructional focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12105.403s">And</a>  so with each progress monitoring and with each new assessment, that data will go in and we'll be able to keep track of the progress and how the students are doing because instructional, some students may have more than one instructional focus and we'll be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12121.636s">target</a>  specifically what the need is. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12123.797s">And</a>  then as they're progressing, move on to what's next. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12126.758s">I</a>  just wanted to draw to that, that attention, um, to the platform that's being used during a lot of these data meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12134.46s">So</a>  the, the last little piece here, as we're taking all of this data, um, there is another level in terms of like the implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12144.423s">And</a>  these are the meetings that happen that are, uh, literacy and action we're calling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12150.305s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12151.049s">There</a>  are several administrative meetings monthly and throughout the year with Dr. Kieser and myself, the literacy coaches, and some of them are also with Hill for Literacy where we are constantly reviewing the data and setting goals and agendas for our meetings and any training or professional development or support that's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12173.089s">We're</a>  also making sure that we have monthly meetings with principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12176.771s">So</a>  this, principals have a lot on their plates. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12180.494s">They</a>  are getting training in science of reading, but they are also meeting with Hill for Literacy around data, and they are also meeting with myself and Dr. Chiesa around this same piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12192.302s">And</a>  also that, how they can support teachers during literacy instruction in their classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12200.151s">We</a>  also have meetings with the literacy coaches on quite a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12204.554s">Monthly,</a>  they have training with Hill for Literacy so that they are going on guided observations so that they are also learning firsthand and growing their skill as literacy coaches within our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12219.972s">We</a>  have some teachers that have been wonderful and have volunteered to work directly with hill for literacy during those in person coaching sessions, which are happening once a month at every single elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12234.75s">identify</a>  teachers at every building at every grade that will get the direct coaching from Hill, that our literacy coaches will also be there to observe, grow their skill set, and be able to also model that for other teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12251.308s">They</a>  are involved in direct co-planning and modeling with educators, as previously mentioned, and work with Dr. Chiesa and I to drive our literacy plan for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12263.377s">And</a>  then I've already kind of highlighted a lot of the principles. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12266.44s">The</a>  only piece that hasn't been discussed is that they have dedicated common planning time with their staff to also move this work within their building based on specific building and grade level needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12281.611s">And</a>  then the last piece is there are various ways that we try to, we are always looking to improve, but that we try to communicate with caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12290.535s">So</a>  as previously mentioned, the literacy coaches will be doing a DIBLS 8 overview again in two different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12299.44s">Dr.</a>  Chiesa and I, as we did last year, will send out the DIBLS screening letter globally this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12307.284s">that</a>  just explains to parents, again, about the DIBLS assessment and that what the regulations are around the early literacy screening per the Department of Education and Mass Literacy, and that they will hear from us if their child has been flagged for at-risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12328.276s">We</a>  also sent home the NWEA map <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12331.36s">growth</a>  reports, we do that at the first report card so that teachers, there's that opportunity for conversation so that educators are able to explain to the caregiver how these are being used to target their students' specific need. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12348.921s">Because</a>  just as a reminder, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12352.19s">All</a>  of this data is really for the educators to meet the student needs, and for school based and district wide administrators to to support teachers, so they can meet the students needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12366.363s">We</a>  also have the report card conference opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12368.904s">And</a>  then the elementary reading department provides three to four family events for students and the caregivers of those students that receive reading services. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12380.43s">Those</a>  are in the process of being created right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12383.752s">There's</a>  usually three to four a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12385.713s">And</a>  then Dr. Chiesa and I are also in the process of finalizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12390.735s">We're</a>  going to have a caregiver evening that kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12395.077s">shows</a>  the inter-reading program in action for caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12399.48s">That</a>  will be sometime this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12402.922s">We're</a>  trying to be very ambitious just so that we can set the stage for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12407.965s">And</a>  we welcome any questions or suggestions that you may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12412.588s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12414.149s">Member</a>  Graham, then Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12415.55s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12419.488s">There</a>  was some commentary on social media in the last week or so about whether or not the district provides DIBLS results. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12430.917s">And</a>  the general consensus of the parents was you had to ask for those results. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12438.102s">But</a>  it doesn't sound like that based on what you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12440.824s">So</a>  I'm just trying to understand clearly, like, who gets results? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12445.908s">Does</a>  everyone get results? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12448.164s">and</a>  if not, why not?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12450.985s">So</a>  when we rolled this out last year, we were following the guidelines for mass literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12458.046s">And</a>  so as we presented last year, DIBLS is approved through the Department of Education, checks all the boxes, which is why we've navigated towards that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12468.107s">So</a>  their recommendation is for grades one through five, you use the first year benchmark and that you are informing parents <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12477.25s">that</a>  whose students were at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12481.813s">And</a>  kindergarten parents are informed at the middle of year benchmark.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12488.477s">And</a>  so what does it mean to be at risk? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12491.619s">Like,</a>  is there like a threshold? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12497.303s">And</a>  is there a reason why we would not <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12499.505s">just</a>  give everybody their results. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12501.886s">Because</a>  basically what's happening on social media is sort of a push to go everybody as individuals to the principal to request the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12510.45s">And</a>  that seems like it is going to be far more complicated than if we just gave parents the results that we have.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12522.972s">I</a>  think when we, I think I understand that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12527.735s">So</a>  part of it is, I think we can have that conversation that I think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12535.46s">The</a>  way that we have, first I'll answer your first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12539.702s">I</a>  was trying to remember your first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12541.503s">So</a>  the first question was about, so for each grade level, there is a threshold. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12546.706s">So</a>  for K and one, we're using what's called the composite number, which is kind of like a summary of all the subtests. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12553.382s">And</a>  so for students that were flagged, it could mean several reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12558.923s">And</a>  a lot of times it just, some of it is readiness, but they, it's for students that are performing below grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12569.426s">And</a>  so for students in grades two through five, we use a predominant measure because we have the NWEA map. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12577.208s">So</a>  we're not using the comprehension component of the DIBLS program. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12582.409s">So</a>  it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12583.61s">Students</a>  are flagged, unless you wanted to add on, students are flagged for being below grade level in the reading skill at risk.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12593.937s">For</a>  two to five?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12595.298s">For</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12595.638s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12596.699s">Through</a>  K through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12600.061s">It's</a>  just that level shifts depending on the grade.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12604.163s">Got</a>  it, got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12606.165s">And</a>  on this chart where we have in our packet the <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12611.636s">whether</a>  schools are title one, how many total students there are, how many reading teachers there are in the grades that the reading teachers are servicing. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12620.06s">Is</a>  there a way to add to that chart, like the number of students who are at risk? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12623.882s">Because</a>  if you just look at the numbers, there's a huge distribution of how much support is happening in buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12631.705s">And</a>  if that's really perfectly aligned with like the number of students who need support, and then there's like even out caseloads, that makes some sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12640.904s">but</a>  if you just look strictly at like total population it's hard to understand like are we doing are there enough reading teachers in our district and are they deployed in the right places?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12657.889s">So</a>  I would I would say <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12662.605s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12663.405s">And</a>  so we always are looking at need, which is why we added an additional person to the McGlynn school based on the level of need, especially in last year's data, um, around our EL population and just how that population has shifted in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12681.316s">Um,</a>  but I also want, we can absolutely get you those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12685.639s">I</a>  just also want to make note that the way that the reading services are also structured is a tiered approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12691.866s">And</a>  so it is, we can give you the students that have been identified, but the reading teachers are servicing, I will break it down so that you can see that there are some students that are receiving reading services that are just receiving reading services. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12707.852s">And</a>  then there are some students that are duly identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12710.253s">So</a>  they're EL and they're also special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12712.413s">So</a>  we could always use more support, but I will say that, especially for fiscal year 25, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12722.674s">The</a>  I exhausted every penny I could on reading teachers.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12730.659s">Yeah,</a>  and I think I think that breakdown would be helpful and it would be helpful next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12739.517s">for</a>  us, like, or, and I'm not even sure that this is the right, like, exact time of year to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12745.542s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12745.982s">Maybe,</a>  maybe it's like a look back for last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12748.004s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12748.945s">But</a>  like, whatever the thing is that we land on is like, this is when we're going to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12754.869s">What</a>  you would ideally see over time as this curriculum takes hold, right, and matures in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12762.315s">And</a>  if we are being successful in our efforts to keep, to do more, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12770.276s">sort</a>  of holistic instruction at tier one, there should be fewer students over time who need these services. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12777.942s">And</a>  it would be ideal to be able to see that in this chart somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12782.926s">So</a>  like last year we had a hundred students at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12786.79s">This</a>  year we have 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12788.331s">Like,</a>  so because, and I know it gets like very wild and complicated when you're talking about all the grades and all the things, but there has to, I feel like one of the things we don't do that well as a district is, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12800.663s">give</a>  people a concise way to say, are we making progress? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12805.025s">So</a>  I know that we have talked a lot about moving the need to where the need is. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12809.667s">And</a>  so I'm making an assumption that that's why these numbers look so strange. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12813.769s">Like</a>  if you really calculate the math, it intuitively makes sense to me based on what I know about each of those school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12821.593s">But</a>  I want the data to actually just make that clear for everybody who just may not tune into these meetings every <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12830.165s">You</a>  know, for four or five hours every other Monday night so, so I think there's like a couple of things there from like a historical and data perspective that would be helpful to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12841.983s">As</a>  we think about like this work and are we making progress.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12846.229s">So</a>  I just want to add, we did have another row in that table, which was exactly what students served actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12851.911s">So</a>  it's funny that, and then we took, we got rid of it because right now we were still grappling with the data and didn't feel like that number was the true number quite yet, but absolutely we can get that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12866.996s">In</a>  fact, today we were just looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12869.346s">you</a>  know, the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12870.827s">And</a>  actually, we were cross comparing like the two of the grades at one of the schools to look and see, was that going down? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12877.673s">Yeah,</a>  where were the trends? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12879.574s">So</a>  we can absolutely get the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12880.915s">I</a>  don't think it's quite ready yet, but will be in the next week or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12884.718s">So</a>  it was there.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12885.519s">And</a>  then we know, well, I think that's a good, that's a good question, which is like, when is the right time to have some of these conversations? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12893.245s">This</a>  maybe is too early. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12895.504s">if</a>  you want to look at what's happening, like from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, if you don't yet have the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12901.447s">The</a>  other thing that's interesting, we were looking at cohort survival models for MSBA enrollment purposes, and it was easy to see a cohort move through the ranks, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12918.737s">So</a>  you could see in this year, there were 100 kindergartners, and next year there were <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12924.871s">99</a>  first graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12925.691s">And</a>  then the year after that, there were 102 second graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12928.654s">So</a>  you could sort of see that progression. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12932.356s">And</a>  I feel like that is like a really complicated data view. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12935.939s">I</a>  don't know if the tools that you're using can provide something like that, but to be able to see a cohort improve over time, I think would actually tell the story that like this all works, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12946.327s">So</a>  we had X number of kids in kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12948.929s">We</a>  had fewer kids in first grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12950.67s">We</a>  had fewer kids in second grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12952.772s">And</a>  by third grade, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12954.278s">we</a>  had even fewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12955.359s">So</a>  that's, I think what I would want to see from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12958.701s">And</a>  if that means that this is not the right time of year to get this presentation, it's also not my personal goal to make you come to as many school committee meetings as possible to talk about literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12969.248s">So</a>  if there's a better time of year for you to come where like a better story is available, like I am all ears for that because this group, this, <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12980.734s">meeting</a>  has no shortage of topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=12982.775s">So</a>  we just want to make good use of your time and the data that's available.</p>
