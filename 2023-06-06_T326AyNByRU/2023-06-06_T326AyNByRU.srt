[SPEAKER_02]: If you could all, any student representatives on the call, Dr. Cushing?

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we know of.

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so if we could all rise to salute the flag.

12
00:00:30,772 --> 00:00:40,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

13
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:45,644

[SPEAKER_08]: 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 on that order, Superintendent.

16
00:00:58,219 --> 00:00:58,719

[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Member Graham for suspension of the rules, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,501

[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

20
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:06,261
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_02]: We have number 272, photography contest winners recognition and a short slideshow of photos by Ms.

22
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:19,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne Fee, Coordinator of Fine Arts, followed by a presentation of certificates to the winners.

23
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:24,267
[SPEAKER_02]: and a prize, a film camera for the top three winners of the photography competition.

24
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:24,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

25
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:25,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Fee, welcome.

26
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:28,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just a little person with a voice.

27
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:30,179
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just press that button.

28
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:32,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

29
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:34,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, everybody.

30
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:35,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for having us.

31
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:36,909
[SPEAKER_07]: We're really excited.

32
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:40,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Our photo contest came back after a brief hiatus.

33
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:43,375
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have the winners here tonight.

34
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:45,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm happy to present the winning photos as well.

35
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,862
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the students' names are called, I'll have them come up and get their certificate.

36
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:55,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And our first, second, and third place winners will be receiving a film camera.

37
00:01:55,086 --> 00:01:56,427
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're really excited about that.

38
00:01:56,967 --> 00:02:05,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Just really quickly a little bit about the contest miss van Aiken, one of our visual arts teachers organized the contest and we have an exhibit at the high school.

39
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:11,796
[SPEAKER_07]: It's open to all students and we were lucky enough to have two professional photographers serve as guest judges this year.

40
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:15,139
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no preferred topic or theme for the contest.

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,886
[SPEAKER_07]: The judges considered all entries for their impact, originality or creativity, technique and composition.

42
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:27,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Entries were scored in those categories and tallied and the winners received the highest total scores.

43
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:35,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And then lastly, we just want to thank the Medford Educational Fund because they approved our grant request for a

44
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:46,676
[SPEAKER_07]: a photo printer for the photography club, and that was instrumental in getting so many kids to be able to participate, otherwise they wouldn't have access to photo printing.

45
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:52,080
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was really nice to see the effects of that grant in such a nice way.

46
00:02:53,121 --> 00:03:01,567
[SPEAKER_07]: So without further ado, Daryl Mendoza is receiving an honorable mention for his photo, Golden Mountain.

47
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:03,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if Daryl, if you're here, come on up.

48
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:15,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Another honorable mention is Julia.

49
00:03:15,055 --> 00:03:16,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you can go right through here, Dario.

50
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:23,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Julia Hanready for her photo, Morning Dew, which was also a Scholastic Art Award winner this year.

51
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Violet Veruso for her photo, A New Perspective, also received an honorable mention.

52
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Third place, Connor O'Leary for steaming through time.

53
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:03,573
[SPEAKER_07]: She's coming.

54
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

55
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:11,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Second place is Nate Tacey for his photo after hours.

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And Nate.

57
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:24,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Nate, your certificate got lost somewhere between here and Medford High, so I'll get it to you tomorrow, but go shake hands with your camera.

58
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:32,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And our first place winner also received an honorable mention for her other photo.

59
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:37,719
[SPEAKER_07]: So first place was for Calm Before the Storm by Hannah Sophia McLaughlin.

60
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And she also received an honorable mention for, let me see if I remember the name,

61
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:54,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And she received an honorable mention for her photo, Safaree Sawyer.

62
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:03,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the end, if you guys, if you wanna just scroll through Dr. Cushing, some more high scoring entries from our competition.

63
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:06,125
[SPEAKER_07]: We're really excited about this contest.

64
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:11,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it sets a nice tone for our photo class that we're starting next fall and our photography club.

65
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So congratulations to everybody and thank you for having us tonight.

66
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Can the students all come back up for one group photo?

67
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:48,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Great job, Ms.

68
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:49,733
[SPEAKER_06]: V and students.

69
00:06:53,355 --> 00:07:00,237
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 7-3 presentation on EGAL, feminine hygiene products on a roll by Ms.

70
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:03,678
[SPEAKER_02]: North and CCSR students at the Andrews Middle School.

71
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:04,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

72
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:05,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

73
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,439
[SPEAKER_02]: North, good to see you again.

74
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,660
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so involved, we love it.

75
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:16,503
[SPEAKER_02]: The little person.

76
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:46,657
[SPEAKER_15]: I first wanna take the time to thank you to meet with us today.

77
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:53,903
[SPEAKER_15]: This is obviously from the CCSR in Middlesex, Andrews Middle School.

78
00:07:54,443 --> 00:08:00,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Our students have been asking for a program to place menstrual products inside the bathrooms.

79
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:04,030
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's taken some time to be creative.

80
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:08,454
[SPEAKER_15]: As we know, middle school can get a little dicey and sometimes we can,

81
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,422
[SPEAKER_15]: go through a little bit of misuse.

82
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:35,203
[SPEAKER_15]: On October 1, 2020, Bill H.565 Chapter 71 of the Massachusetts General Laws added Section 68A and Section 3 that all elementary and secondary public schools in the Commonwealth serving any grade from grade 6 through grade 12 shall provide feminine hygiene products in the restrooms

83
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:37,504
[SPEAKER_15]: of such school building or buildings.

84
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:40,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Such products shall be provided at no charge to the students.

85
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:45,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Such amount may be adjusted from time to time based on utilizations.

86
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:56,190
[SPEAKER_15]: School districts shall work to ensure such products should be available in a convenient manner matter that does not stigmatize any students seeking such product.

87
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, our Meltrick Public Schools does in fact honor this bill where we provide

88
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:10,456
[SPEAKER_15]: feminine products to our students at the nurse's office, but we currently don't have them placed inside the bathrooms.

89
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:20,361
[SPEAKER_15]: So we need to find a better way to have these students feel less embarrassed and make the process of getting products less time consuming.

90
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:27,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Many of our sixth grade students, they are embarrassed to ask to go down to the nurse.

91
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:36,213
[SPEAKER_15]: And what generally happens is students will now go to the bathroom and find out that they need product.

92
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:38,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Now they have to go back to their classrooms.

93
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:43,438
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to ask their teacher for an actual hall pass to go down to the nurse's office.

94
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:50,704
[SPEAKER_15]: That sometimes brings up questions of, well, why now do you need to leave the room again to go to the nurse?

95
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:58,169
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they don't really know who it is or it is a male teacher, questions will arise, especially if they're in the middle of a lesson.

96
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:06,795
[SPEAKER_15]: So now they have to leave class again, go to the nurse's office, get product, go back to the bathroom, and then get back to class.

97
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:20,564
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've calculated through data for the last 45 days that it takes approximately 15 minutes for a student to go to the bathroom, back to class, to the nurse, to the bathroom, then back again to class.

98
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:27,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Students are, they really are losing important class time due to this.

99
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:38,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Based on that type of data, I decided to reach out to a company called EGAL, and I just happened to find it by chance.

100
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:51,230
[SPEAKER_15]: just going through and researching certain things and it's a startup company in Somerville, and I decided that once I found out that Cambridge brought in a pilot program for the high school.

101
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,252
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to see if we could possibly have a pilot program brought into the city of Medford.

102
00:10:56,932 --> 00:11:05,479
[SPEAKER_15]: When I called I asked to meet with Jeff, he is the co founder and CEO his business card is placed inside of these folders.

103
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:21,072
[SPEAKER_15]: And he agreed that he would provide us with 10 free dispensers which I have here, and we can pass around with the product and a case of product, which is 12 rolls, and they come in packs of 40.

104
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:35,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Over April vacation, I was able to have our, I was able to have our maintenance department, install these and the Andrews, and they are there's 10 of them.

105
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:45,126
[SPEAKER_15]: When you if you're not familiar with the Andrews we have one in the gym, on the first floor we have one of the nurses office, and there is one on each side A and B of six seventh and eighth.

106
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:54,731
[SPEAKER_15]: We then talked about how we were going to keep data and what was gonna happen and how are we really gonna present this.

107
00:11:54,951 --> 00:12:06,178
[SPEAKER_15]: I had an assembly right before April vacation with all our female students about what was gonna happen and that we were in fact gonna be a pilot program.

108
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:11,661
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had to make sure that there was no misuse of products.

109
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:14,503
[SPEAKER_15]: And if there were, it was going to hinder

110
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:17,884
[SPEAKER_15]: as possibly bringing this to Medford Public Schools.

111
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:24,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I have to say that most, every student has been respectful.

112
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:32,409
[SPEAKER_15]: We've only had one misuse, reported misuse in the gym bathroom, and that's it.

113
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:38,171
[SPEAKER_15]: They have used these respectfully, and I've heard many positive comments on them.

114
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:42,713
[SPEAKER_15]: And right now they're only placed in one stall.

115
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:45,502
[SPEAKER_15]: So we don't even have them in every stall.

116
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:56,666
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that students definitely feel more comfortable not having to go to the nurse and that products are there.

117
00:12:56,686 --> 00:13:07,710
[SPEAKER_15]: I do, however, know that the school committee did agree to provide tampons and they will still be available to our students.

118
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:25,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Cambridge and Boston Public Schools have already brought this program in, and they currently are spending, and it's about an estimate right now because it hasn't been the full year yet, but it's going to be about $5,000 or under, and that's for all middle schools and high school.

119
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:32,822
[SPEAKER_15]: So you figure that and calculate possibly what our budget is now to provide products into the nurse's office.

120
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:42,191
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like this is not only a better product, but it is, it's lighter, it's thinner, and it's provided for them directly in.

121
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:44,633
[SPEAKER_15]: their bathrooms.

122
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:57,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Boston has now brought in a pilot program that's starting this summer for all Boston public buildings that they're going to bring this product and to provide it for the entire public.

123
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:03,817
[SPEAKER_15]: In the blue folders, you'll find all the information and selling points for this.

124
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:15,319
[SPEAKER_15]: And if this is something that we would approve, or if it can be approved, I'll be happy to facilitate the process moving forward.

125
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:24,001
[SPEAKER_15]: I do know that you can purchase this product now from WB Mason and any other places, and it's actually pretty inexpensive.

126
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:27,422
[SPEAKER_15]: In the long run, it'll save us money where we're not

127
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:41,244
[SPEAKER_15]: sending students to the nurse's office, taking, you know, 567, and then going back to class it's going to save them time for in the classroom and also, I think, produce more.

128
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:52,999
[SPEAKER_15]: education in the back end, because they're not missing so much class time, and we can pass this around, and I have some comments from Rowan Mastoni.

129
00:14:53,119 --> 00:15:01,183
[SPEAKER_15]: She is our eighth grade point person and the person that has worked diligent with me to get this kind of on board.

130
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:07,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

131
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:08,687
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Rowan Mistone.

132
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:14,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm currently in eighth grade at the Andrews Middle School and will be attending Medford High next year.

133
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:22,319
[SPEAKER_11]: I am in CCSR that is run by Miss North, who was able to get the Andrews a part of the EGALP pilot program.

134
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:26,883
[SPEAKER_11]: This gave us the opportunity to put free pads in all girls' bathroom.

135
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:28,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Sadly, the program has ended.

136
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:34,247
[SPEAKER_11]: We received great reviews and are here to ask you to continue it.

137
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:43,673
[SPEAKER_11]: The hassle of having to make multiple trips between the nurse's office and the bathroom causes missing important time in class and a whole lot of embarrassment.

138
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:54,102
[SPEAKER_11]: With EGAL and pads on rolls, it has become so much easier at the Andrews for students, but we want to spread this to all the schools.

139
00:15:54,863 --> 00:16:00,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Please support adding it to the high school, Curtis Tufts, Andrews Middle School, and the McGlynn Middle School.

140
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:01,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

141
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:03,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Great job.

142
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:08,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

143
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:10,655
[SPEAKER_02]: North and team, that was a wonderful presentation.

144
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:12,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much and great work.

145
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you have a photography winner behind you.

146
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:20,896
[SPEAKER_02]: She was photographing the whole time, so she'll be the next winner.

147
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

148
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:28,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

149
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:30,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

150
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:33,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

151
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:42,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to say thank you in particular to all the students coming out tonight to talk about this really awesome product.

152
00:16:42,708 --> 00:17:01,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I had never heard of that product before, and I think it's a really great solution to the reasons why we haven't followed through on the multiple ways that we've asked for these products to be available to you all since before I was on the school committee.

153
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:07,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I was on the school committee I worked with a student at the high school to come forward and present just like you all did.

154
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:15,230
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that time, the school committee was unanimous in their support we've seen at least two other presentations.

155
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:16,343
[SPEAKER_08]: since then.

156
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:23,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So my apologies that we haven't gotten this right, but thank you to all of you for bringing this forward.

157
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:32,389
[SPEAKER_08]: This makes compliance with all the past school committee resolutions that were unanimous and the law that much easier.

158
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:33,810
[SPEAKER_08]: This seems very straightforward.

159
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in full support.

160
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:41,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would like to make a motion to ask the administration to implement these immediately.

161
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:48,033
[SPEAKER_08]: and at maximum by the start of next school year in our high schools and our middle school complexes.

162
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:50,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Graham.

163
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:51,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin?

164
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:52,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

165
00:17:52,845 --> 00:18:04,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, first of all, I also want to say to the students how particularly proud I am for you moving this forward in a very practical way and to the CCSR and to Ms.

166
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:15,917
[SPEAKER_03]: North for really just taking the initiative and really creating a pilot project because that is how things get done, usually by piloting, demonstrating that they work, having a price point,

167
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:21,860
[SPEAKER_03]: making sure that people know what that is, what things look like, having something tangible that people can see and look at.

168
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:34,706
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I hope that this is a real opportunity for people to be thinking about policy as well, because as member Graham said, you know, actually the students that first brought this to the school committee were in my daughter's graduating class.

169
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So they actually just graduated from college this year.

170
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:41,349
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're very proud of all of them for having brought this forward as well.

171
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:43,670
[SPEAKER_03]: But policy is iterations of,

172
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

173
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:50,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's evolutions of people, you know, there are leaders who start things, there are people that come along and actually practically implement it.

174
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:54,412
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people that come along and have another iteration of that a version of that that's even better.

175
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:58,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just always building on other people as well and working together.

176
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:02,414
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is a really great example of how policy can be played out with folks.

177
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:08,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't even think it's necessarily a bad thing that this wasn't right at the front, I think it wasn't even available right at the front four years ago.

178
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:10,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the evolution piece of it.

179
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I also very highly recommend this.

180
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:24,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also respectfully ask that member Graham consider amendment to the motion to include, and I would ask that you young women and Ms.

181
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:30,710
[SPEAKER_03]: North and the CCR consider including these for fifth graders in our elementary school.

182
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I know certainly some of our young women have

183
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:39,135
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that experience much earlier, so making sure that they're available.

184
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:48,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And also there are class, there are bathrooms in particular classrooms, specifically classrooms that might be subseparate, where those would be included as well.

185
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,181
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just ask that we expand on that motion.

186
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:52,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

187
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:56,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I'm gonna press the button.

188
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:58,044
[SPEAKER_03]: The face.

189
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little face with a voice coming out.

190
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:02,686
[SPEAKER_03]: On the front, on the front.

191
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:03,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Second from the right.

192
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:19,216
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually was able to talk to the CEO and make a deal with him that if Medford does bring in EGAL that he will provide all the dispensers for free.

193
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:22,538
[SPEAKER_15]: So we do not have to pay for the dispensers.

194
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:28,722
[SPEAKER_15]: So he'll be able to provide all of those to any place really that we want them.

195
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:30,283
[SPEAKER_15]: It would just depend on

196
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:34,987
[SPEAKER_15]: how maintenance installs them, but he'll be able to provide that.

197
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:39,250
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't necessarily think that we need to provide it for every stall.

198
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:45,936
[SPEAKER_15]: In the middle school, I think having it in the big stalls right now is great.

199
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:47,837
[SPEAKER_15]: We probably need a couple more.

200
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:53,662
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have one in the nurse's office and even put them in the teacher's bathrooms, but definitely for fifth graders too.

201
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:58,066
[SPEAKER_15]: We just kind of focus more on the middle school aspect because they're middle school students.

202
00:20:58,286 --> 00:20:58,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Understandably.

203
00:20:58,946 --> 00:20:59,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor, may I respond?

204
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McLaughlin.

205
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:02,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just want to say thank you.

206
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:03,288
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

207
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:07,431
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's also another great example and an important example just for the policy piece of it as well.

208
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:19,079
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're talking about having our maintenance folks install, having our nurses collaborate, having people know where in which bathrooms, that's all practical application of how you implement policy.

209
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:26,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So really being able to think those things through ahead of time makes it much more effective, bringing things to the table so that policy actually gets passed.

210
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:28,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think it's a real learning opportunity

211
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,254
[SPEAKER_03]: again, for our students and for folks who are watching that that's a really great example of how it gets done.

212
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:33,874
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

213
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:36,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

214
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:46,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that you had an assembly to teach the students how to, you know, how to treat the machines with respect and not overuse and misuse.

215
00:21:46,364 --> 00:21:47,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's wonderful.

216
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:48,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that went a long way.

217
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:49,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

218
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:50,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

219
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the presentation.

220
00:21:53,404 --> 00:22:04,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I do apologize that this has to be a focus for the fifth straight year since I've been on school committee where we've had a CCSR project to do this.

221
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:12,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Last March, we did approve the free products in any quantity that a student desires from our nurse's office.

222
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:17,176
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we did that, we did say like, this is step one.

223
00:22:17,196 --> 00:22:19,157
[SPEAKER_10]: The next step is to get them into the buildings.

224
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:22,821
[SPEAKER_10]: into the actual bathrooms.

225
00:22:23,923 --> 00:22:35,337
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think that the Senate has passed the I am bill I believe this is the eighth year, and the House of Representatives is apparently too stodgy to consider talking about menstruation.

226
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:37,918
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is never come up for a vote.

227
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:51,822
[SPEAKER_10]: There are more people sponsoring the I am bill in the House of Representatives, then a majority, a majority of the members actually sponsor it so there is zero question it would pass by if leadership is

228
00:22:53,429 --> 00:23:00,076
[SPEAKER_10]: out of touch with reality or just can't talk about the topic, then, then it won't ever come up for a vote and become law.

229
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:02,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully that doesn't last forever.

230
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:15,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think that, you know, in the last number of times we've talked about this, I think we have, we have broached the topic of, you know, there's there's a moral panic around tampons.

231
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:29,879
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that it is a disservice for us to implement policy that either sidesteps that issue by only offering pads or just keeps us from having to take a stand.

232
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:37,663
[SPEAKER_10]: That is not the appropriate way is to simply add pads and say, that's what menstruating students must do.

233
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:42,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't menstruate, but I know an awful lot of people who do.

234
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:45,327
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those that like tampons,

235
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:53,212
[SPEAKER_10]: It is life changing and it is a non starter that's like the differences are not, it's it.

236
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:58,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't personally experience it but it's it's not even an apples and oranges kind of conversation.

237
00:23:58,616 --> 00:24:06,922
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do think that when we talk about putting stuff into bathrooms I think we need to set aside, just like with our other health education related things.

238
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:17,133
[SPEAKER_10]: How I feel about something is how I feel about it, but that's not policy and that's not how we should be using science and best practice and all that other stuff.

239
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:19,133
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm very happy to see this.

240
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:23,535
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sad that you all have to spend your energy on this.

241
00:24:23,635 --> 00:24:28,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sad that the public schools still to this day do not have this stuff in the bathroom.

242
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:30,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I understand it is not cheap.

243
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:36,366
[SPEAKER_10]: If we had two bathrooms we probably would have done it but we probably have 100 bathrooms in the district.

244
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:51,702
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I recognize that it costs money but getting back to the meeting that was just before that, you know, when we last talked about this last March, if, if bathrooms didn't have toilet paper, we would burn this place down.

245
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:53,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

246
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:58,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if every one of us went to the bathroom every day, we are expected to bring our own toilet paper.

247
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:01,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it wasn't there, we're expected to go to the nurse's office.

248
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:06,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I just can't even imagine it would become violent, frankly.

249
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:14,917
[SPEAKER_10]: And somehow we are perfectly fine with the majority of the world, the majority of our population being in exactly that situation.

250
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:19,220
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, so that's just outrageous.

251
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:42,534
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we focus purely on the number one goal job of a school committee, and that is student performance, 15 minutes of class time, like we should be doing compensatory services for every girl, for every menstruating student, we should do compensatory services and hire tutors to fill in for the gap in their education they didn't get.

252
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:45,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we didn't do this.

253
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:46,864
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of absurd.

254
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:53,249
[SPEAKER_10]: And I continue to be disappointed that we are not making this happen.

255
00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:01,276
[SPEAKER_10]: We just did the budget, we can literally I don't think we can make a motion to add to the budget because we just had that hearing an hour ago.

256
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:09,603
[SPEAKER_10]: If we had done this in the other order, I probably would have added another whatever $100,000 to do all the bathrooms.

257
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,506
[SPEAKER_10]: So, keep at it.

258
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:22,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I keep hoping that the house will finally do this because it is tiring to have the same conversation.

259
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:31,427
[SPEAKER_10]: around something that actually isn't changing like I think menstruation is fairly much been the same thing for as long as the House of Representatives has been around.

260
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:38,972
[SPEAKER_10]: And yet we got to spend all of our time advocating year after year after year on this topic and it's.

261
00:26:40,253 --> 00:26:46,916
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also infuriating because all that energy spent on those things is energy not spent on other things we could be advocating for.

262
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:54,980
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just feels a bit like we're being like, you know, dragged around by this at the state house.

263
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:03,644
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am super happy that you all have kept it in the, kept the light on on this topic because the school committee has a lot to do.

264
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:08,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And sometimes it feels like we're turning our heads a thousand different ways every day.

265
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:15,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I appreciate that every year this keeps coming back until we can make it happen and make it happen right, so thank you.

266
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:17,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Russo.

267
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:20,007
[SPEAKER_02]: To wrap us up, Member McLaughlin?

268
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:30,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I also, I just wanted to say, focusing on the positive, you know, in terms of, you know, what has or hasn't happened in the past, I just want to say, that's how things change.

269
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:35,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And you, you know, you get stuff done, and you guys are getting stuff done, and you keep getting stuff done.

270
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't have to be the way things were before because you can change it.

271
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:42,001
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how you do make the change that you made today.

272
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:52,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, when member Ruseau was talking and he was saying how, you know, things have been or whatever, it was all I could do to hold myself back and not, you know, yell out, not anymore, right?

273
00:27:52,944 --> 00:27:54,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So not anymore here, right?

274
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,224
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys did that.

275
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,085
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really great.

276
00:27:56,325 --> 00:28:02,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also just want to add to member Ruseau's comments that, you know, not to get too specific,

277
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:17,435
[SPEAKER_03]: but regarding tampons and pads, you know, there are obviously as women, we know there are preferences for different reasons that we don't need to get into, but we want to have both, you know, whenever possible for all choices for individuals.

278
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you guys again, and I want to second the motion.

279
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

280
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:25,537
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

281
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:26,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

282
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,898
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

283
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:28,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

284
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:30,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any language of a motion, so.

285
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:46,492
[SPEAKER_02]: just that we place them all, I think, which would be free placement in all our middle schools and high schools and I think member McLaughlin wants to explore something, the fifth grade, although I think that.

286
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:56,898
[SPEAKER_08]: So the motion is to implement these devices in all of our high school, middle school and upper elementary bathrooms.

287
00:28:59,995 --> 00:29:05,938
[SPEAKER_08]: and review the possibility of putting them in some of the individual classroom bathrooms as appropriate.

288
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

289
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:13,602
[SPEAKER_10]: May I, I know we've already voted on it, but if this could violate procurement law, depending on the pricing, so we may.

290
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:16,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call.

291
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:18,984
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the roll call and what?

292
00:29:19,505 --> 00:29:21,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we roll, are you asking, should we roll call?

293
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:25,047
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was just saying like, if this is over $10,000, we literally cannot

294
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:35,211
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was came in Cambridge, it was 5000 so eventually have to do procurement if you do multiple year purchasing but okay.

295
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:41,010
[SPEAKER_15]: They do offer bulk pricing as well.

296
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:48,232
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's something that I can speak to Jeff about when I I'm going to call him tomorrow and get the bulk pricing rate.

297
00:29:48,712 --> 00:29:56,795
[SPEAKER_15]: So, obviously, you know, taking $5,000 at the moment, out of the budget that you've already approved is not

298
00:29:57,615 --> 00:29:58,617
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to be able to do that.

299
00:29:59,057 --> 00:30:02,782
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I know that money is used to purchase the products now.

300
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:09,811
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm hoping that you can, or you can allocate that money for these.

301
00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:17,479
[SPEAKER_15]: And Cambridge has them in all of their, and they're bigger, obviously they're bigger schools than we are.

302
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:25,062
[SPEAKER_15]: So all of their high schools and middle schools, they don't have them in the elementary, but we can certainly find out if we can bring those in.

303
00:30:25,482 --> 00:30:27,643
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's probably going to be less than that.

304
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:30,404
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, you can buy them in bulk, buy them quarterly.

305
00:30:30,724 --> 00:30:35,746
[SPEAKER_15]: I still, so we've been doing this for about 45 days and I still have three roles left.

306
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:42,889
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're not using them where they're taking them every single day, that they're using them appropriately.

307
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:51,734
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're going to have some bathrooms that are highly used, that they're going to go through maybe one rule every month and a half.

308
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:58,057
[SPEAKER_15]: But you're going to have other bathrooms that, I mean, it could be two or three months before you need to replace them.

309
00:30:58,477 --> 00:31:04,940
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, each school will have to have that point person, because you don't want to put that on the custodians or maintenance department.

310
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:10,664
[SPEAKER_15]: So for Andrews, I would take that responsibility and I would go around and I would still have my students take data.

311
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:15,712
[SPEAKER_15]: We have sheets of data for the last 45 days of how much usage and there's a key.

312
00:31:16,192 --> 00:31:21,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody can open these except somebody that has that key that can go in and open them.

313
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,242
[SPEAKER_15]: and that prevents theft and damage.

314
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,264
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll be able to handle it on that end as well.

315
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:35,392
[SPEAKER_15]: And the same for the high school assembly, like we did maybe for the middle school, what's going in and look for damages and to keep that cost down.

316
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:44,459
[SPEAKER_15]: If they, I mean, high school level, I'm assuming many bring their own and won't need it all the time, but some may.

317
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,321
[SPEAKER_15]: The same with middle school.

318
00:31:46,401 --> 00:31:55,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Some bring their own, but when you're in, you know, a bind and you need that, it's creating loss of class, loss of educational time.

319
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,531
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's tough.

320
00:31:56,611 --> 00:32:00,274
[SPEAKER_15]: And I see it with our classes where kids are gone for 15 minutes.

321
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:04,638
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a large chunk of time to miss from a 40 minute period.

322
00:32:04,658 --> 00:32:07,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Then they walk back to class and the teacher's like, where were you?

323
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,845
[SPEAKER_15]: And we do, you know, where were you?

324
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:10,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Why were you there?

325
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:16,173
[SPEAKER_15]: And they have to come up with an explanation and that's embarrassing for kids that are just learning about their bodies.

326
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:18,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

327
00:32:19,817 --> 00:32:20,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

328
00:32:20,478 --> 00:32:21,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate y'all being here.

329
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

330
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,023
[SPEAKER_10]: We vote yes.

331
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:27,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we do the vote?

332
00:32:28,464 --> 00:32:29,384
[SPEAKER_16]: We took a vote.

333
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:34,186
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to take a vote that we follow procurement, then I think that's self-explanatory.

334
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:34,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think we're good.

335
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:36,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

336
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:43,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I did motion for approval seconded by all in favor, all opposed motion passes.

337
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:43,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

338
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

339
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:52,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Announcement of new principals to Medford public schools by Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, our superintendent.

340

349
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:05,914
[SPEAKER_13]: We warmly welcome you, and I know you're already calling the Andrews your new home.

350

354
00:34:32,482 --> 00:34:38,686
[SPEAKER_12]: I also learned that they did all that fundraising themselves through CCSR so I was proud of them for that.

355
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:41,789
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just look forward to working with all of you.

356

484
01:34:44,908 --> 01:34:52,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we agreed to have a meeting in the month of September as a whole,

485
01:34:53,717 --> 01:35:05,403
[SPEAKER_03]: to discuss, not as a subcommittee, but the superintendent would bring back information to the committee at large or the entire committee with data around some of the things that were asked for in the subcommittee.

486
01:35:05,463 --> 01:35:13,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So in September, folks can expect data on some of the DEI material that was discussed in this subcommittee meeting.

487
01:35:13,888 --> 01:35:21,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So just again, a reminder that we would have a meeting in the first month in the September on the DEI topic to

[SPEAKER_03]: include data that the superintendent is collecting, superintendent team is collecting regarding impact of safety policy and procedure.

[SPEAKER_02]: What did I miss?

538
01:38:37,725 --> 01:38:39,786
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we didn't because we didn't do the good of the order.

539
01:38:41,767 --> 01:38:42,427
[SPEAKER_02]: The good of the order.

540
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:53,317

541
01:38:53,657 --> 01:38:54,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

542
01:38:54,178 --> 01:39:07,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to under the good of the order I was going to ask that the committee consider a process for onboarding school committee members and a way in which we can make that happen, whether it's through one of our subcommittees or

543
01:39:07,529 --> 01:39:14,574
[SPEAKER_03]: some other plan, but I think we really need to think about preparing onboarding materials for incoming school committee members.

544
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:20,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to put that out to our committee for suggestions.

545
01:39:20,498 --> 01:39:23,120
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great idea.

546
01:39:27,644 --> 01:39:29,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe member Kreatz and member Mustone could.

547
01:39:33,939 --> 01:39:34,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor.

548
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:35,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

549
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:56,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think we have some rules in our rules handbook around onboarding and so we should use them as a starting point but II think they're, you know, that that is a good starting point and agree that we should start thinking about that and maybe early in the fall, create a one time subcommittee to deal with that.

550
01:39:59,656 --> 01:40:09,978
[SPEAKER_03]: make a motion to send it to a sub motion to, no, actually I make a motion to create a one-time subcommittee in the fall for onboarding process of school committee members.

551
01:40:10,778 --> 01:40:19,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion on the floor to create a subcommittee in the fall for onboarding new members in January by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Graham.

552
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:20,480
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:21,200

641
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:52,535

642
01:50:52,555 --> 01:50:53,856

643
01:50:53,996 --> 01:50:55,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important across the city.

644
01:50:56,318 --> 01:51:04,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did have a resolution that we were sending out safety messages to families regarding moms demand action.

645
01:51:04,784 --> 01:51:13,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as I'm wondering if that actually occurred as an out of district parent, I did not see it, but I would like to know that we followed up on that.

646
01:51:16,272 --> 01:51:17,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

647
01:51:19,285 --> 01:51:23,449

648
01:51:23,990 --> 01:51:28,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now what we're doing is we're sending them out in June for the secondary families.

649
01:51:29,635 --> 01:51:39,224
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a cover letter from the superintendent, a copy of the brochure, and then I want to say Megan Dowd, but I'm probably blanking.

650
01:51:39,384 --> 01:51:40,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Megan and Aaron.

651
01:51:40,165 --> 01:51:40,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Megan and Aaron.

652
01:51:40,706 --> 01:51:43,048
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually wanted to say Aaron Dowd, I was confusing myself.

653
01:51:43,248 --> 01:51:43,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Twins.

654
01:51:45,285 --> 01:51:45,986

656
01:51:49,727 --> 01:51:55,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping to get orange envelopes, but that's not going to work this year for orange in June.

657
01:51:56,309 --> 01:52:04,852
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also done, I think, two Facebook posts on our district website and have pushed at least one district-wide message via school messenger.

658
01:52:05,253 --> 01:52:05,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.

659
01:52:10,503 --> 01:52:11,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondary.

[SPEAKER_01]: All secondary.

661
01:52:11,865 --> 01:52:18,630
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're going to try to do is we're going to try to pare back the just to save the families who have an elementary and a secondary.

662
01:52:21,452 --> 01:52:25,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you make sure that it reaches our out of district families as well, please?

663
01:52:25,115 --> 01:52:25,315
