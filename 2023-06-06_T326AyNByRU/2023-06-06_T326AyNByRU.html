    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=93.826s">Hi,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=94.487s">Thanks</a>  for having us. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=95.928s">We're</a>  really excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=96.969s">Our</a>  photo contest came back after a brief hiatus. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=101.273s">And</a>  we have the winners here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=103.415s">And</a>  I'm happy to present the winning photos as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=106.478s">So</a>  when the students' names are called, I'll have them come up and get their certificate. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=110.962s">And</a>  our first, second, and third place winners will be receiving a film camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=115.086s">So</a>  we're really excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=116.967s">Just</a>  really quickly a little bit about the contest miss van Aiken, one of our visual arts teachers organized the contest and we have an exhibit at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=126.193s">It's</a>  open to all students and we were lucky enough to have two professional photographers serve as guest judges this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=132.777s">There</a>  was no preferred topic or theme for the contest. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=136.08s">The</a>  judges considered all entries for their impact, originality or creativity, technique and composition. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=142.406s">Entries</a>  were scored in those categories and tallied and the winners received the highest total scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=148.613s">And</a>  then lastly, we just want to thank the Medford Educational Fund because they approved our grant request for a <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=157.589s">a</a>  photo printer for the photography club, and that was instrumental in getting so many kids to be able to participate, otherwise they wouldn't have access to photo printing. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=166.736s">So</a>  it was really nice to see the effects of that grant in such a nice way. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=173.121s">So</a>  without further ado, Daryl Mendoza is receiving an honorable mention for his photo, Golden Mountain. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=181.607s">I</a>  don't know if Daryl, if you're here, come on up. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=192.614s">Another</a>  honorable mention is Julia. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=195.055s">Oh,</a>  you can go right through here, Dario. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=197.676s">Julia</a>  Hanready for her photo, Morning Dew, which was also a Scholastic Art Award winner this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=211.92s">Violet</a>  Veruso for her photo, A New Perspective, also received an honorable mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=225.299s">Third</a>  place, Connor O'Leary for steaming through time. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=242.992s">She's</a>  coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=245.995s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=247.676s">Second</a>  place is Nate Tacey for his photo after hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=252.48s">And</a>  Nate. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=256.149s">Nate,</a>  your certificate got lost somewhere between here and Medford High, so I'll get it to you tomorrow, but go shake hands with your camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=268.315s">And</a>  our first place winner also received an honorable mention for her other photo. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=273.297s">So</a>  first place was for Calm Before the Storm by Hannah Sophia McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=279.52s">And</a>  she also received an honorable mention for, let me see if I remember the name, <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=291.798s">And</a>  she received an honorable mention for her photo, Safaree Sawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=295.96s">And</a>  at the end, if you guys, if you wanna just scroll through Dr. Cushing, some more high scoring entries from our competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=304.364s">We're</a>  really excited about this contest. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=306.185s">I</a>  think it sets a nice tone for our photo class that we're starting next fall and our photography club. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=311.687s">So</a>  congratulations to everybody and thank you for having us tonight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=320.1s">Can</a>  the students all come back up for one group photo? <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=408.353s">Great</a>  job, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=408.953s">V</a>  and students.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=413.355s">We</a>  have 7-3 presentation on EGAL, feminine hygiene products on a roll by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=420.317s">North</a>  and CCSR students at the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=423.858s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=425.059s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=425.319s">North,</a>  good to see you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=426.459s">You're</a>  so involved, we love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=435.783s">The</a>  little person.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=462.714s">I</a>  first wanna take the time to thank you to meet with us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=466.677s">This</a>  is obviously from the CCSR in Middlesex, Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=474.443s">Our</a>  students have been asking for a program to place menstrual products inside the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=480.988s">And</a>  it's taken some time to be creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=484.451s">As</a>  we know, middle school can get a little dicey and sometimes we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=489.619s">go</a>  through a little bit of misuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=492.542s">On</a>  October 1, 2020, Bill H.565 Chapter 71 of the Massachusetts General Laws added Section 68A and Section 3 that all elementary and secondary public schools in the Commonwealth serving any grade from grade 6 through grade 12 shall provide feminine hygiene products in the restrooms <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=515.623s">of</a>  such school building or buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=517.744s">Such</a>  products shall be provided at no charge to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=522.305s">Such</a>  amount may be adjusted from time to time based on utilizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=526.387s">School</a>  districts shall work to ensure such products should be available in a convenient manner matter that does not stigmatize any students seeking such product. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=536.69s">Well,</a>  our Meltrick Public Schools does in fact honor this bill where we provide <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=544.073s">feminine</a>  products to our students at the nurse's office, but we currently don't have them placed inside the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=551.076s">So</a>  we need to find a better way to have these students feel less embarrassed and make the process of getting products less time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=561.141s">Many</a>  of our sixth grade students, they are embarrassed to ask to go down to the nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=567.986s">And</a>  what generally happens is students will now go to the bathroom and find out that they need product. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=576.813s">Now</a>  they have to go back to their classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=579.235s">They</a>  have to ask their teacher for an actual hall pass to go down to the nurse's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=583.979s">That</a>  sometimes brings up questions of, well, why now do you need to leave the room again to go to the nurse? <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=591.084s">And</a>  if they don't really know who it is or it is a male teacher, questions will arise, especially if they're in the middle of a lesson. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=598.849s">So</a>  now they have to leave class again, go to the nurse's office, get product, go back to the bathroom, and then get back to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=606.875s">And</a>  I've calculated through data for the last 45 days that it takes approximately 15 minutes for a student to go to the bathroom, back to class, to the nurse, to the bathroom, then back again to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=621.525s">Students</a>  are, they really are losing important class time due to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=628.353s">Based</a>  on that type of data, I decided to reach out to a company called EGAL, and I just happened to find it by chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=638.726s">just</a>  going through and researching certain things and it's a startup company in Somerville, and I decided that once I found out that Cambridge brought in a pilot program for the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=651.69s">I</a>  wanted to see if we could possibly have a pilot program brought into the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=656.932s">When</a>  I called I asked to meet with Jeff, he is the co founder and CEO his business card is placed inside of these folders. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=666.5s">And</a>  he agreed that he would provide us with 10 free dispensers which I have here, and we can pass around with the product and a case of product, which is 12 rolls, and they come in packs of 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=682.573s">Over</a>  April vacation, I was able to have our, I was able to have our maintenance department, install these and the Andrews, and they are there's 10 of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=695.761s">When</a>  you if you're not familiar with the Andrews we have one in the gym, on the first floor we have one of the nurses office, and there is one on each side A and B of six seventh and eighth. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=705.686s">We</a>  then talked about how we were going to keep data and what was gonna happen and how are we really gonna present this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=714.951s">I</a>  had an assembly right before April vacation with all our female students about what was gonna happen and that we were in fact gonna be a pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=726.578s">So</a>  we had to make sure that there was no misuse of products. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=731.681s">And</a>  if there were, it was going to hinder <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=735.063s">as</a>  possibly bringing this to Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=739.445s">Actually,</a>  I have to say that most, every student has been respectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=744.746s">We've</a>  only had one misuse, reported misuse in the gym bathroom, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=753.009s">They</a>  have used these respectfully, and I've heard many positive comments on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=758.331s">And</a>  right now they're only placed in one stall. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=763.641s">So</a>  we don't even have them in every stall. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=768.223s">I</a>  know that students definitely feel more comfortable not having to go to the nurse and that products are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=776.686s">I</a>  do, however, know that the school committee did agree to provide tampons and they will still be available to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=788.51s">Cambridge</a>  and Boston Public Schools have already brought this program in, and they currently are spending, and it's about an estimate right now because it hasn't been the full year yet, but it's going to be about $5,000 or under, and that's for all middle schools and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=806.215s">So</a>  you figure that and calculate possibly what our budget is now to provide products into the nurse's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=813.362s">I</a>  feel like this is not only a better product, but it is, it's lighter, it's thinner, and it's provided for them directly in. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=823.732s">their</a>  bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=825.253s">Boston</a>  has now brought in a pilot program that's starting this summer for all Boston public buildings that they're going to bring this product and to provide it for the entire public. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=838.456s">In</a>  the blue folders, you'll find all the information and selling points for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=844.757s">And</a>  if this is something that we would approve, or if it can be approved, I'll be happy to facilitate the process moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=855.82s">I</a>  do know that you can purchase this product now from WB Mason and any other places, and it's actually pretty inexpensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=864.581s">In</a>  the long run, it'll save us money where we're not <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=867.882s">sending</a>  students to the nurse's office, taking, you know, 567, and then going back to class it's going to save them time for in the classroom and also, I think, produce more. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=883.214s">education</a>  in the back end, because they're not missing so much class time, and we can pass this around, and I have some comments from Rowan Mastoni. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=893.119s">She</a>  is our eighth grade point person and the person that has worked diligent with me to get this kind of on board.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=906.445s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=907.346s">My</a>  name is Rowan Mistone. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=909.127s">I'm</a>  currently in eighth grade at the Andrews Middle School and will be attending Medford High next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=914.332s">I</a>  am in CCSR that is run by Miss North, who was able to get the Andrews a part of the EGALP pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=922.979s">This</a>  gave us the opportunity to put free pads in all girls' bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=927.463s">Sadly,</a>  the program has ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=930.165s">We</a>  received great reviews and are here to ask you to continue it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=934.948s">The</a>  hassle of having to make multiple trips between the nurse's office and the bathroom causes missing important time in class and a whole lot of embarrassment. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=944.895s">With</a>  EGAL and pads on rolls, it has become so much easier at the Andrews for students, but we want to spread this to all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=954.863s">Please</a>  support adding it to the high school, Curtis Tufts, Andrews Middle School, and the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=960.647s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=963.029s">Great</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=968.233s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=968.493s">North</a>  and team, that was a wonderful presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=970.755s">Thank</a>  you so much and great work. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=974.093s">And</a>  I think you have a photography winner behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=978.195s">She</a>  was photographing the whole time, so she'll be the next winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=984.917s">Member</a>  Ruseau, then Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=988.199s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=988.499s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=992.841s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=994.062s">I</a>  just wanted to say thank you in particular to all the students coming out tonight to talk about this really awesome product. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1002.708s">I</a>  had never heard of that product before, and I think it's a really great solution to the reasons why we haven't followed through on the multiple ways that we've asked for these products to be available to you all since before I was on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1021.752s">Before</a>  I was on the school committee I worked with a student at the high school to come forward and present just like you all did. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1027.62s">And</a>  at that time, the school committee was unanimous in their support we've seen at least two other presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1035.703s">since</a>  then. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1036.503s">So</a>  my apologies that we haven't gotten this right, but thank you to all of you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1044.166s">This</a>  makes compliance with all the past school committee resolutions that were unanimous and the law that much easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1052.449s">This</a>  seems very straightforward. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1054.17s">I'm</a>  in full support. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1055.831s">And</a>  I would like to make a motion to ask the administration to implement these immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1062.228s">and</a>  at maximum by the start of next school year in our high schools and our middle school complexes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1069.895s">Thank</a>  you, Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1070.575s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1072.365s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1072.845s">I</a>  think that, first of all, I also want to say to the students how particularly proud I am for you moving this forward in a very practical way and to the CCSR and to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1084.831s">North</a>  for really just taking the initiative and really creating a pilot project because that is how things get done, usually by piloting, demonstrating that they work, having a price point, <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1096.337s">making</a>  sure that people know what that is, what things look like, having something tangible that people can see and look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1101.92s">And</a>  so I hope that this is a real opportunity for people to be thinking about policy as well, because as member Graham said, you know, actually the students that first brought this to the school committee were in my daughter's graduating class. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1114.746s">So</a>  they actually just graduated from college this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1117.747s">And</a>  we're very proud of all of them for having brought this forward as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1121.389s">But</a>  policy is iterations of, <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1124.19s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1124.43s">And</a>  so it's evolutions of people, you know, there are leaders who start things, there are people that come along and actually practically implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1130.631s">There</a>  are people that come along and have another iteration of that a version of that that's even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1134.832s">So</a>  it's just always building on other people as well and working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1138.073s">So</a>  I think this is a really great example of how policy can be played out with folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1142.434s">So</a>  I don't even think it's necessarily a bad thing that this wasn't right at the front, I think it wasn't even available right at the front four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1148.795s">I</a>  think it's the evolution piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1150.216s">I</a>  also very highly recommend this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1153.118s">I</a>  would also respectfully ask that member Graham consider amendment to the motion to include, and I would ask that you young women and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1164.806s">North</a>  and the CCR consider including these for fifth graders in our elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1170.75s">I</a>  know certainly some of our young women have <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1175.373s">you</a>  know, that experience much earlier, so making sure that they're available. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1179.175s">And</a>  also there are class, there are bathrooms in particular classrooms, specifically classrooms that might be subseparate, where those would be included as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1188.599s">So</a>  I would just ask that we expand on that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1192.261s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1192.621s">I</a>  actually, I'm gonna press the button. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1197.724s">The</a>  face. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1198.064s">It's</a>  a little face with a voice coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1201.546s">On</a>  the front, on the front.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1203.187s">Second</a>  from the right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1208.589s">I</a>  actually was able to talk to the CEO and make a deal with him that if Medford does bring in EGAL that he will provide all the dispensers for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1219.896s">So</a>  we do not have to pay for the dispensers. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1223.198s">So</a>  he'll be able to provide all of those to any place really that we want them. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1228.942s">It</a>  would just depend on <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1230.783s">how</a>  maintenance installs them, but he'll be able to provide that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1235.027s">And</a>  I don't necessarily think that we need to provide it for every stall. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1240.191s">In</a>  the middle school, I think having it in the big stalls right now is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1246.016s">We</a>  probably need a couple more. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1247.897s">We</a>  do have one in the nurse's office and even put them in the teacher's bathrooms, but definitely for fifth graders too. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1253.862s">We</a>  just kind of focus more on the middle school aspect because they're middle school students.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1258.286s">Understandably.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1258.946s">Mayor,</a>  may I respond?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1260.926s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1261.667s">Yeah,</a>  I just want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1262.767s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1263.368s">And</a>  I think it's also another great example and an important example just for the policy piece of it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1267.451s">When</a>  you're talking about having our maintenance folks install, having our nurses collaborate, having people know where in which bathrooms, that's all practical application of how you implement policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1279.439s">So</a>  really being able to think those things through ahead of time makes it much more effective, bringing things to the table so that policy actually gets passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1286.584s">And</a>  I just think it's a real learning opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1288.55s">again,</a>  for our students and for folks who are watching that that's a really great example of how it gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1293.294s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1294.915s">Thank</a>  you, Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1296.917s">And</a>  also that you had an assembly to teach the students how to, you know, how to treat the machines with respect and not overuse and misuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1306.364s">I</a>  think that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1307.465s">And</a>  I'm sure that went a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1308.886s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1310.523s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1311.243s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1313.404s">I</a>  do apologize that this has to be a focus for the fifth straight year since I've been on school committee where we've had a CCSR project to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1325.39s">Last</a>  March, we did approve the free products in any quantity that a student desires from our nurse's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1334.295s">And</a>  when we did that, we did say like, this is step one. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1337.196s">The</a>  next step is to get them into the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1339.597s">into</a>  the actual bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1343.923s">You</a>  know, I think that the Senate has passed the I am bill I believe this is the eighth year, and the House of Representatives is apparently too stodgy to consider talking about menstruation. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1355.857s">So</a>  it is never come up for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1358.918s">There</a>  are more people sponsoring the I am bill in the House of Representatives, then a majority, a majority of the members actually sponsor it so there is zero question it would pass by if leadership is <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1373.429s">out</a>  of touch with reality or just can't talk about the topic, then, then it won't ever come up for a vote and become law. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1380.196s">Hopefully</a>  that doesn't last forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1383.859s">I</a>  do think that, you know, in the last number of times we've talked about this, I think we have, we have broached the topic of, you know, there's there's a moral panic around tampons. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1396.372s">And</a>  I think that it is a disservice for us to implement policy that either sidesteps that issue by only offering pads or just keeps us from having to take a stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1409.899s">That</a>  is not the appropriate way is to simply add pads and say, that's what menstruating students must do. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1417.683s">I</a>  don't menstruate, but I know an awful lot of people who do. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1423.026s">And</a>  for those that like tampons, <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1426.087s">It</a>  is life changing and it is a non starter that's like the differences are not, it's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1433.973s">I</a>  don't personally experience it but it's it's not even an apples and oranges kind of conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1438.616s">So</a>  I do think that when we talk about putting stuff into bathrooms I think we need to set aside, just like with our other health education related things. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1448.049s">How</a>  I feel about something is how I feel about it, but that's not policy and that's not how we should be using science and best practice and all that other stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1457.653s">So</a>  I'm very happy to see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1459.734s">I'm</a>  sad that you all have to spend your energy on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1463.635s">I'm</a>  sad that the public schools still to this day do not have this stuff in the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1469.017s">Now</a>  I understand it is not cheap. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1471.661s">If</a>  we had two bathrooms we probably would have done it but we probably have 100 bathrooms in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1477.387s">So,</a>  I recognize that it costs money but getting back to the meeting that was just before that, you know, when we last talked about this last March, if, if bathrooms didn't have toilet paper, we would burn this place down. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1493.459s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1493.879s">I</a>  mean, if every one of us went to the bathroom every day, we are expected to bring our own toilet paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1498.243s">And</a>  if it wasn't there, we're expected to go to the nurse's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1502.487s">I</a>  just can't even imagine it would become violent, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1507.07s">And</a>  somehow we are perfectly fine with the majority of the world, the majority of our population being in exactly that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1516.479s">And,</a>  you know, so that's just outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1520.141s">But</a>  if we focus purely on the number one goal job of a school committee, and that is student performance, 15 minutes of class time, like we should be doing compensatory services for every girl, for every menstruating student, we should do compensatory services and hire tutors to fill in for the gap in their education they didn't get. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1543.922s">Because</a>  we didn't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1545.924s">It's</a>  kind of absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1548.266s">And</a>  I continue to be disappointed that we are not making this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1554.11s">We</a>  just did the budget, we can literally I don't think we can make a motion to add to the budget because we just had that hearing an hour ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1562.797s">If</a>  we had done this in the other order, I probably would have added another whatever $100,000 to do all the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1570.444s">So,</a>  keep at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1572.706s">I</a>  mean, I keep hoping that the house will finally do this because it is tiring to have the same conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1582.682s">around</a>  something that actually isn't changing like I think menstruation is fairly much been the same thing for as long as the House of Representatives has been around. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1592.568s">And</a>  yet we got to spend all of our time advocating year after year after year on this topic and it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1600.253s">It's</a>  also infuriating because all that energy spent on those things is energy not spent on other things we could be advocating for. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1606.936s">And</a>  it just feels a bit like we're being like, you know, dragged around by this at the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1615.06s">But</a>  I am super happy that you all have kept it in the, kept the light on on this topic because the school committee has a lot to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1623.864s">And</a>  sometimes it feels like we're turning our heads a thousand different ways every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1629.559s">And</a>  so I appreciate that every year this keeps coming back until we can make it happen and make it happen right, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1636.644s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1638.085s">To</a>  wrap us up, Member McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1640.807s">Yes,</a>  and I also, I just wanted to say, focusing on the positive, you know, in terms of, you know, what has or hasn't happened in the past, I just want to say, that's how things change. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1651.075s">And</a>  you, you know, you get stuff done, and you guys are getting stuff done, and you keep getting stuff done. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1656.34s">And</a>  it doesn't have to be the way things were before because you can change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1659.761s">And</a>  that's how you do make the change that you made today. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1662.061s">So,</a>  you know, when member Ruseau was talking and he was saying how, you know, things have been or whatever, it was all I could do to hold myself back and not, you know, yell out, not anymore, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1672.944s">So</a>  not anymore here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1674.324s">So</a>  you guys did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1675.264s">So</a>  that's really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1676.325s">And</a>  I also just want to add to member Ruseau's comments that, you know, not to get too specific, <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1682.83s">but</a>  regarding tampons and pads, you know, there are obviously as women, we know there are preferences for different reasons that we don't need to get into, but we want to have both, you know, whenever possible for all choices for individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1697.495s">So</a>  thank you guys again, and I want to second the motion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1701.376s">Motion</a>  for approval by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1704.657s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1706.137s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1706.498s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1707.938s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1709.038s">I</a>  don't have any language of a motion, so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1713.885s">just</a>  that we place them all, I think, which would be free placement in all our middle schools and high schools and I think member McLaughlin wants to explore something, the fifth grade, although I think that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1726.572s">So</a>  the motion is to implement these devices in all of our high school, middle school and upper elementary bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1739.995s">and</a>  review the possibility of putting them in some of the individual classroom bathrooms as appropriate.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1745.958s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1748.099s">May</a>  I, I know we've already voted on it, but if this could violate procurement law, depending on the pricing, so we may. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1755.022s">Roll</a>  call. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1757.884s">What</a>  was the roll call and what?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1759.505s">Should</a>  we roll, are you asking, should we roll call?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1762.306s">No,</a>  I was just saying like, if this is over $10,000, we literally cannot</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1766.676s">It</a>  was, it was came in Cambridge, it was 5000 so eventually have to do procurement if you do multiple year purchasing but okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1778.629s">They</a>  do offer bulk pricing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1781.43s">And</a>  that's something that I can speak to Jeff about when I I'm going to call him tomorrow and get the bulk pricing rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1788.712s">So,</a>  obviously, you know, taking $5,000 at the moment, out of the budget that you've already approved is not <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1797.615s">We're</a>  not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1799.057s">However,</a>  I know that money is used to purchase the products now. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1803.262s">So</a>  I'm hoping that you can, or you can allocate that money for these. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1810.536s">And</a>  Cambridge has them in all of their, and they're bigger, obviously they're bigger schools than we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1817.919s">So</a>  all of their high schools and middle schools, they don't have them in the elementary, but we can certainly find out if we can bring those in. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1825.482s">So</a>  it's probably going to be less than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1827.723s">And</a>  again, you can buy them in bulk, buy them quarterly. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1830.724s">I</a>  still, so we've been doing this for about 45 days and I still have three roles left. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1836.326s">So</a>  they're not using them where they're taking them every single day, that they're using them appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1843.269s">So</a>  you're going to have some bathrooms that are highly used, that they're going to go through maybe one rule every month and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1852.194s">But</a>  you're going to have other bathrooms that, I mean, it could be two or three months before you need to replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1858.477s">And</a>  again, each school will have to have that point person, because you don't want to put that on the custodians or maintenance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1865.396s">So</a>  for Andrews, I would take that responsibility and I would go around and I would still have my students take data. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1870.965s">We</a>  have sheets of data for the last 45 days of how much usage and there's a key. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1876.192s">Nobody</a>  can open these except somebody that has that key that can go in and open them. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1881.48s">and</a>  that prevents theft and damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1883.842s">So</a>  we'll be able to handle it on that end as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1886.585s">And</a>  the same for the high school assembly, like we did maybe for the middle school, what's going in and look for damages and to keep that cost down. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1896.112s">If</a>  they, I mean, high school level, I'm assuming many bring their own and won't need it all the time, but some may. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1905.14s">The</a>  same with middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1906.401s">Some</a>  bring their own, but when you're in, you know, a bind and you need that, it's creating loss of class, loss of educational time. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1915.75s">And</a>  that's tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1916.611s">And</a>  I see it with our classes where kids are gone for 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1920.835s">That's</a>  a large chunk of time to miss from a 40 minute period.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1924.658s">Then</a>  they walk back to class and the teacher's like, where were you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1928.343s">And</a>  we do, you know, where were you? <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1929.945s">Why</a>  were you there? <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1931.047s">And</a>  they have to come up with an explanation and that's embarrassing for kids that are just learning about their bodies.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1937.615s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1939.817s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1940.478s">Appreciate</a>  y'all being here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1942.04s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1946.403s">We</a>  vote yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1947.323s">Did</a>  we do the vote?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1948.464s">We</a>  took a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1949.444s">If</a>  you want to take a vote that we follow procurement, then I think that's self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1954.206s">Yeah,</a>  I think we're good.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1955.827s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1958.388s">I</a>  did motion for approval seconded by all in favor, all opposed motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1963.47s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1963.95s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/T326AyNByRU&t=1965.591s">Announcement</a>  of new principals to Medford public schools by Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, our superintendent.</p>
