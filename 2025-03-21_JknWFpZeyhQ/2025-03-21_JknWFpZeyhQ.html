<a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=782.421s">We're</a>  a leader in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=786.689s">Our</a>  students have put Medford on the map, and we are all very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=810.54s">The</a>  festival is designed to promote excellence in musical performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=814.802s">And</a>  at the Massachusetts Instrumental and Chorus Conductors and Associations Band and Orchestra Concert Festival, we won a gold medal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=835.887s">The</a>  festival was held in six sites across Massachusetts, with approximately 160 instrumental ensembles participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=846.65s">Method</a>  won the gold medal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=856.953s">Not</a>  only did we win the gold medal, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=859.917s">This</a>  is the fifth year Method String Ensemble brought back medals of excellence, earning four gold medals and one silver medal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=869.601s">What</a>  an accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=880.365s">Now,</a>  in addition to what you did here tonight, these are all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=887.234s">They</a>  have all the coursework that any other student would have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=891.076s">They</a>  have hours of preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=893.718s">How</a>  many hours do we spend a week on our schoolwork? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=896.92s">How</a>  many hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=899.221s">A</a>  lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=899.421s">A</a>  lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=901.382s">How</a>  many hours do we spend on our strings?

<a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=909.207s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=911.887s">A</a>  lot of hours are being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=914.189s">And</a>  it's through the hard work and dedication that we hear the sounds that we heard tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=920.714s">That</a>  doesn't just happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=922.716s">That</a>  is through dedication and hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=925.098s">That</a>  is through having an instructor that I believe has done yeoman's work to creating this program, keeping the enthusiasm. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=936.548s">And</a>  Sophia Chang, who is in the back, really deserves <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=956.067s">So</a>  if I could, I'd like to read the citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=962.668s">The</a>  Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to the Medford Middle School String Ensemble. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=970.09s">In</a>  recognition of winning a gold medal at the Massachusetts Instrumental and Chorus Conductors Association Band and Orchestra Concert Festival, the MICCA Concert Festival is designed to promote excellence in musical performance <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=984.842s">The</a>  festival was held in six sites across Massachusetts on March 27th through the 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=991.207s">Throughout</a>  the weekend, approximately 160 instrumental ensembles participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=996.191s">By</a>  participating in the festival, students and teachers strive to meet the MICCA gold medal standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1003.317s">This</a>  is the fifth year the Method String Ensemble has brought back medals of excellence. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1008.662s">So</a>  at this time, I'd like to call up Sophia Chang.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1423.111s">Council</a>  will go into recess for the dispersal of the band. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1594.984s">Medford</a>  City Council will come back to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1597.325s">Before</a>  we begin our regular agenda, we have an unannounced item here, a presentation for advocates of the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1609.049s">For</a>  the record, the library budget was discussed tonight and it received an additional infusion of $251,325. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1623.823s">under</a>  the auspices of Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1628.346s">A</a>  representative of the group wishes to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1631.348s">Please</a>  present yourself to the podium and state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Sednick]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1636.833s">Hi,</a>  my name is Samantha Sednik. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1638.715s">I</a>  am at 181 Kennedy Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1642.437s">I'm</a>  here both as your children's librarian and also a member of the Medford Community Coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1648.742s">And</a>  I wanted to start off just by thanking you, really sincerely thanking you for the work that was done today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1656.108s">That</a>  additional money that was granted into our budget was super necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1662.332s">I</a>  know we talk about accreditation, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1667.392s">The</a>  heart and soul of the library is our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1672.213s">And</a>  I think the community really did speak, and I know that you guys have been hearing from them all week, about what they really want in a library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1679.575s">And</a>  now that we have a little bit of additional funds, now that we have some additional staff, we can work on getting that vision and really make Medford Library what people want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1690.317s">Now,</a>  I know in the budget discussion earlier today, there was discussions about how circulations are down and foot traffic at the library is down, and I just want to attest that that is simply not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1703.543s">I</a>  have been here since October of 2013, and since my time here, the circulation in the children's library has only gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1712.626s">I</a>  can probably say the same for that of the young adult librarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1716.289s">She</a>  arrived in March of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1720.292s">You</a>  can see the books flying off the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1722.333s">You</a>  can see the stacks of books coming back into us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1725.075s">And</a>  you can see the kids coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1727.857s">Today,</a>  this very day, I had a conversation with a teacher from the middle school who was so excited because the kids are talking about what they're going to do after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1736.743s">And</a>  what they're excited about is coming to our library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1740.065s">And</a>  yes, the building needs some love and attention, and it has problems, as our falling tiles and leaking buckets do show. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1751.875s">But</a>  we really do want to have the best library that we can have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1756.298s">And</a>  the only way to do that is to have people in it, people that care about the library and people that care about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1763.304s">And</a>  so amending the budget as you did today, I really sincerely thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1769.462s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1775.148s">Moana,</a>  please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1778.351s">I'm</a>  Vicky Hillel from 11 Mason Street here in Medford, and I'm here also on behalf of Sharon Guzik, who's at 10 Manning Street in Medford, and she's president of Friends of the Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1793.222s">Friends</a>  of Medford Public Library, which is an all-volunteer 501c3, as you probably know. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1798.923s">It's</a>  separate from the library and the major mission is raising funds, which do not pay for any overhead or paying for any staff positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1811.426s">And</a>  the Friends of the Library feel strongly that that's the city's responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1816.687s">But</a>  these funds raised by Friends of Medford Public Library go towards supplemental programs <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1822.557s">such</a>  as lectures, sing-alongs, workshops, and museum passes, which many kids enjoy and many families. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1831.261s">So</a>  if you'll permit me, I'm going to read her statement beginning now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1838.064s">So</a>  the first version of my letter, I ask for your support to secure more funding for the library and the city's new budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1846.969s">We</a>  were at a critical stage facing possible loss of accreditation, which would preclude Medford library patrons from using other libraries and receiving state aid to libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1860.779s">Thankfully,</a>  thankfully the city has agreed to add the $251,325 needed to retain accreditation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1871.437s">I</a>  want to thank our Medford City Councilors for your support to fully fund the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1876.06s">I</a>  also want to thank Mayor McGlynn for listening to the citizens of Medford and adding the additional funds that we needed to retain accreditation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1887.125s">However,</a>  though we could be satisfied with minimally meeting the accreditation standards, we know Medford Public Library could be so much more than it already is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1897.29s">We</a>  need to be thinking long-term <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1899.642s">and</a>  increase library funding accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1906.78s">I</a>  strongly believe that Medford deserves an outstanding public library that will serve all of our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1913.604s">Modern</a>  public libraries are much more than places that lend books and movies. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1918.367s">As</a>  summarized by Dara Lipton in an online article on the role of libraries today, quote, modern libraries are community centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1926.371s">They</a>  should reflect the needs, personality, and nuance of the community they service and serve as a glue to bring disparate members of the community together. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1938.06s">The</a>  modern library creates space where patrons engage with information, process it, reflect on it, have conversations about it, and develop new ideas, conversations, and opportunities as a result of it." <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1952.724s">I</a>  would like to see the city embrace a long-term vision for our public library with a scheduled plan for fulfilling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1960.119s">This</a>  plan, this vision, should encompass the renovation and regular maintenance of the library as well as a scheduled plan updating its technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1970.127s">Ideally,</a>  such a plan will look even further into the future and consider how to lay the foundation for the rapidly evolving role that libraries play in our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1982.576s">I</a>  believe another step toward fulfilling this vision is to revitalize the board of library trustees, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1989.097s">There</a>  are currently five dedicated individuals that have served as trustees for close to two decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=1996.204s">I</a>  congratulate them for their long years of service and dedication to our library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2000.988s">However,</a>  turnover on the board is important to keep an organization energized and relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2006.254s">New</a>  blood brings new ideas and new enthusiasm to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2010.933s">I</a>  feel it is vital to appoint new people to the board as trustee positions come up for renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2020.295s">I</a>  end with the words of Andrew Carnegie, that great supporter of public libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2026.056s">Quote,</a>  a library outranks any other one thing a community can do to benefit its people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2033.277s">It</a>  is a never failing spring in the desert, unquote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2038.605s">So</a>  thank you for taking us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2041.267s">And</a>  on behalf of all the friends, thank you again.</p>

    <p>[2pAQFYhyG5g_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2062.987s">My</a>  name is Anne Frenning-Gesuth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2066.168s">I'm</a>  the president of the Medford Educational Foundation, and I live at 88 Winthrop Street in Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2075.371s">And</a>  I'd like to say that I'm very excited to see the turnout today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2079.973s">What's</a>  happened has been very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2082.734s">As</a>  you may know, there's a new group in town called the Medford Community Coalition, and they're very vocal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2088.996s">They're</a>  parents, and they care. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2090.656s">And</a>  there's a longstanding group, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2093.502s">that's</a>  called the Friends of the Medford Public Library, and they care also, and for much, much longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2099.665s">So</a>  these two groups have united in support of the Medford Public Library, and it's very thrilling, because as Andrew Carnegie once said, it is like, well, it's not just a spring, it's like an oasis. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2115.754s">It's</a>  a place to go that anyone in the community from cradle to grave can learn <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2120.964s">and</a>  benefit from the information provided there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2123.406s">And</a>  I think that I'd like to give a special shout out to Children's Reference Librarian, Sam Sednick, for the incredible work that she's done to revitalize the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2135.437s">And</a>  we used to go, most of us parents used to go to Winchester because we were part of the Minuteman Library Network, and it was very pleasant there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2144.077s">But</a>  they don't have half of the programming that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2146.798s">And</a>  the very first program she did was this fairy tale ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2152.239s">It</a>  was one hour long. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2155.899s">And</a>  all the children dressed as little fairies. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2159.44s">And</a>  the parents went. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2160.54s">And</a>  Barbara Kerr was a fortune teller. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2162.821s">And</a>  Brian Boutillier had a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2165.661s">And</a>  there were fencers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2167.162s">And</a>  there were people dressed in period costumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2170.102s">One</a>  hour outside the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2173.843s">transform</a>  the library into a space beyond our imagination, and this is what I think we can see with the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2180.647s">If</a>  we were able to get funds so quickly, it makes me think that we can keep going, and I think that the thrust of the message that President of the Friends of the Medford Public Library, Sharon Guzik, had, we do need a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2193.855s">We</a>  need citizens, and we need to work with the city, and we need to make this library something that the entire community can benefit from. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2201.72s">And</a>  I just want to close with the fact <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2204.077s">Starting</a>  at 530 this evening for this committee of the whole, I took names just by passing a clip sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2210.218s">And</a>  I'm not going to read them all off, but I can provide them to the clerk if they're interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2214.839s">There</a>  are 40 people provided voluntarily their names and their email addresses in support of the Medford Community Coalition and the Friends of the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2224.141s">And</a>  that's, I think, a true testament. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2226.982s">So</a>  thank you for all you've done to support us, and I look forward to working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2231.303s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2600.266s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2600.667s">Joe</a>  Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2605.807s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello had mentioned the library is a good spot for the public access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2612.01s">Since</a>  we have so much money in reserve, I suggest a bit of a trade maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2618.613s">If</a>  we can modernize the inner structure with peg monies, lend the monies to the library, have a van that is parked at the library with equipment that can help election 2015, because it's 164 days away, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2633.6s">You</a>  have a win-win situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2635.321s">You</a>  get additional monies to help refurbish the inside of the library, which really needs some help. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2640.525s">It's</a>  a wonderful old building. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2642.926s">I</a>  love the Medford Public Library, but it needs more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2646.769s">$251,000</a>  is not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2648.21s">We'll</a>  have close to a million dollars in the PEG fund once that contract is signed with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2653.593s">An</a>  additional $330,000, I believe, and another $32,000 from Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2658.716s">We'll</a>  have almost a million dollars in reserve and no access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2663.104s">So</a>  we work with the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2664.804s">We</a>  have a van outside of the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2666.425s">We</a>  have mobile equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2667.985s">We</a>  can transmit through the telephone, through the cell phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2672.846s">We</a>  can transmit from the mobile van right onto Channel 3 and the Verizon channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2678.368s">So</a>  that's my suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2679.428s">We</a>  have some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2680.248s">Let's</a>  really, really help out the library.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2689.07s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2690.391s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2692.683s">Last</a>  year, I had the first time working with Sam Snedek, doing my book program to the public school, the parochial school kids, for that summer reading drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2701.027s">And</a>  the real thank you came from the children of Medford, who wrote, I probably delivered to Sam at the library, over 100 letters from the kids from the schools, thanking her for all the work that she did when she came with us, going around to all the schools in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2719.417s">And</a>  next week, Sam is going to be coming around again <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2722.545s">with</a>  the Methodist and we're going to be delivering books to the schools of all the children in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2727.547s">And</a>  it gives Sam a chance to promote her summer reading program that's gotten bigger every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2735.129s">So</a>  again, I think she's one of the best additions to the library we've had in many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2746.673s">And</a>  I'm looking forward to being with her next week as we travel to all the public schools and the parochial schools in Bethlehem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2752.96s">It</a>  gives her a chance to get to every single kid that's in the first and third grade, so they know about summer reading and what it takes to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2760.904s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2761.364s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2763.985s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2765.566s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2766.707s">And</a>  I just want to thank everyone in the community that's been involved over the past... This isn't just the last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2771.509s">This</a>  has been over about a month or so, that the emails, the groundswell behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2777.432s">And</a>  I was ecstatic today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2780.95s">when</a>  I spoke with the mayor and his staff around noontime, when he committed the additional funds based upon a couple of new developments that are coming online with new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2790.458s">And</a>  it's just a financial commitment to keep the library just not only in a better financial situation than it is today, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2802.229s">But</a>  as the gentleman said a little earlier, it's going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2805.572s">And</a>  I asked a similar question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2807.273s">And</a>  you don't want to be in the same boat as we are now next year, when the new mayor has to look for additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2816.881s">And</a>  so I'm glad we were able to get to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2819.323s">But</a>  I really want to thank the people that were patient, because government doesn't work so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2825.996s">We</a>  had to wait until the additional new growth not went online, but there was the actual commitment for the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2834.142s">You</a>  know, week after week, it's easy for people to say, we want this, we want that, we want this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2838.085s">But</a>  ultimately, you have to pay for these city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2841.228s">And</a>  this council has been committed to doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2844.41s">And</a>  like I said, this wouldn't be possible without Mayor McGlynn and his top administrative staff, because we can only approve the budget or cut the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2853.357s">We</a>  cannot add to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2854.97s">So</a>  I just want to thank him for his commitment to the children and the residents of our community here in this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2863.333s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2864.193s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2865.394s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2866.374s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2868.315s">I</a>  too want to thank the mayor's office for coming up with the funds that are needed and the two new positions that are going to be hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2875.498s">It</a>  sounds like they definitely are going to be put to good use. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2880.74s">I</a>  also just want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2882.25s">It</a>  wouldn't have been possible without the community, without these two organizations and the library staff coming together and creating momentum that almost I couldn't keep up with between the emails and the phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2895.438s">I</a>  think I was still calling people back today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2898.42s">But</a>  it really goes to show, and especially with the two professional staff members here today, how much people care about the library and care about its future. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2908.16s">So</a>  I want to thank the mayor and the administration for what they've done and coming out today, rather than the city council fighting the next couple of weeks to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2918.267s">So</a>  it's very refreshing to have that come across my desk at 5 o'clock this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2924.531s">But</a>  with all the positivity, and I want to stay positive, we do have to recognize that there is a need for a maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2931.896s">There</a>  is a need for, and it was said by all the councilors tonight, and I'm sure it'll be reiterated, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2937.515s">There</a>  is a need for a maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2939.417s">And</a>  we say it all the time, whether it's this building, the schools, the library, the DPW yard that was just redone, this city needs to spend more time on maintenance, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2951.788s">Number</a>  two, I think we do need a five-year plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2954.05s">We</a>  need to, whoever the next mayor is, we need to figure out what we're going to do within the next five years, what grants we can apply for. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2961.994s">and</a>  how we can move the library forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2964.856s">And</a>  it was very good to hear that there is some sort of plan in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2968.379s">And</a>  I hope the community is involved in that and gets to give input and insight and voice their concerns and what they'd like to see within the next five, six, seven years for the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2979.347s">So</a>  just thank everybody for moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2982.549s">And</a>  I think it's a great step forward for the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2987.893s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2988.694s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2989.975s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2991.084s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2992.625s">And</a>  thank you to the Medford Community Coalition for their hard work on this very, very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=2997.91s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm very comfortable supporting this increase in the budget for the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3002.534s">And</a>  the reason I'm supportive of it is because we're not just throwing money at a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3006.597s">There's</a>  an operational plan for the use of funds that's in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3009.779s">And</a>  based upon the correspondence from the administration that we received today, we're going to have $70,000 for part-time helpers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3016.185s">We're</a>  going to have $30,000 for increased cleaning services. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3019.813s">$75,000</a>  for a new employee that would work in the technology field, $60,000 for a new employee that would work as a reference librarian, and $15,000 for new equipment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3031.64s">Because</a>  we have a plan and we have an actual dedicated use for these monies, I'm very comfortable supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3037.163s">You</a>  know, I think that the grassroots effort of the Metro Community Coalition was a driving factor behind the issuance of these funds and the increase in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3044.347s">And</a>  for that, I'm very supportive because I value our library.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3049.681s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3051.482s">Mr.</a>  President and folks who might be watching who don't have the opportunity to be here tonight and understand how we got to the position that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3059.366s">As</a>  a point of clarification, in the budget meeting that we had tonight regarding the Method Public Library, the question was asked of Mr. Boutelier, who is the librarian, why didn't this information come forward on these type of requests come forward before? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3074.774s">And</a>  he did indicate that the prior budget director through the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3078.749s">told</a>  them not to present that to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3081.471s">So</a>  the scuttlebutt as it relates to why it got to this point right here is a result of the frustration of the folks, you folks, that are here tonight and those folks that might be watching that couldn't make it here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3091.577s">This</a>  is nothing more than a reactionary plan, not actionary, reactionary, because the administration understands that the people of this community, especially the people who support the library, are completely frustrated with the inaction going six years to get waivers <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3108.024s">to</a>  get waivers to be certified absolutely makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3112.467s">You</a>  want to go for one year, two years, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3116.59s">$225,000,</a>  whatever that dollar amount might be or needs to be on an annual basis, that should have been included in the budget to keep this city abreast of where it should be rather than seeking a waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3126.337s">Because</a>  one of these days a waiver would not be made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3129.78s">And</a>  if the city did not have the finances to pick up on that waiver, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3133.266s">We've</a>  been sitting on $6.5 million of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3137.267s">$6.5</a>  million of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3139.027s">And</a>  over the last five to six years, this has been a growing from $1.5 million up to $6.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3145.289s">The</a>  Medford Library is like the stepchild to the school buildings, the public buildings in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3152.151s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, if he was here, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3154.636s">And</a>  his first term three years ago indicated with these new buildings that we have, these new school buildings, 12 years old, they're already a million dollars in need of repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3163.666s">That's</a>  absolutely unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3166.289s">And</a>  you folks out there who are supporters of the library and understand what the value of what a book can do, when a child opens that book and reads it, it's the greatest learning utensil that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3177.39s">over</a>  and beyond a teacher, making sure that the teacher teaches the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3180.631s">But</a>  when that child picks up a book and opens it and reads it and understands what's in that book and puts a smile on his face, whether it's for pleasure or entertainment or whether it's for education, that is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3192.313s">And</a>  when you have a stupid, and that's what I call it, a stupid kiosk parked in front of your public library that stops people to go in there to bring a book or to pay a book off and come out and find a ticket <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3205.495s">That's</a>  the fastest way to lose a patron to come to your Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3209.876s">I</a>  don't believe in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3210.856s">I</a>  won't accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3212.437s">To</a>  me, that is not what a public library is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3214.997s">A</a>  public library is like a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3216.698s">It's</a>  a basis of education. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3218.518s">It's</a>  a central point in this community of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3221.839s">You</a>  folks out there tonight, and those who might be watching, you folks made this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3226.68s">You</a>  were the actionary force that called the mayor's hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3230.561s">And</a>  that's how you got it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3232.201s">And</a>  I hope this doesn't have to be done in every other part of this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3235.397s">But</a>  you folks should be complimenting yourselves, knowing your kids are going to have a library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3240.178s">And</a>  if I have my way, you won't ever have to come before this podium to ask for this again, because it'll be there each and every year like it's supposed to be.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3255.881s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3257.161s">And</a>  it was mentioned at the Committee of the Whole meeting that I think when we talk about a public library, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3265.164s">The</a>  vision that many of us have, especially people that have been around for a while, is a place where you go and look up periodicals and read the newspaper and get online and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3275.312s">And</a>  I think the vision that many of us have now in our community is that we don't have to stick with the old vision of what a library used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3283.498s">We</a>  can present our own vision of having a quality gathering space <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3289.018s">Potentially,</a>  it was mentioned about having maybe an area that serves coffee and muffins or, you know, an area where people can get together and show off things that may be of interest to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3303.89s">There's</a>  so many different uses that could take place in that building that would increase the image of the building and also increase the participation at that library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3316.678s">And</a>  it was mentioned tonight, I mentioned it at the meeting about a five-year plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3321.66s">We</a>  were told by Brian Boutelier and that there is one in the works right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3327.742s">I</a>  hope that plan comes to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3330.182s">I</a>  hope it gets posted online on the city website and anywhere else that people can access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3336.244s">I</a>  hope there's going to be plenty of community involvement for suggestions and opinions on what they'd like to see the library <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3345.04s">be</a>  within the next five years and where we should be in the next five years, but make no mistake about it, that what took place today was a groundswell that I haven't seen in this community in quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3369.24s">And</a>  I'd like to see what happened today through the Medford Community Coalition, the Friends of the Medford Public Library, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3374.591s">and</a>  all the other residents not connected to any particular group that expressed their interest in the library, expressed the fact that their children has had use in the past of the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3386.438s">I</a>  remember growing up, we used to have a satellite in West Method by the fire station, a library, and over tough economic times, that was the first to be cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3397.265s">But</a>  I'd like to see this interest in our library expand throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3403.212s">because</a>  we really need the public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3405.814s">And</a>  as I stated, what happened today was, in my opinion, a miracle. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3411.417s">The</a>  new growth the mayor talks about is something that has been under construction for several months now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3418.342s">So</a>  that's new growth that we knew about eight months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3421.925s">You</a>  know, we don't just start construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3423.666s">That</a>  project has been in the work for well over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3426.787s">So</a>  the money is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3427.967s">As</a>  Councilor Penta said, we have over six million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3431.249s">The</a>  money is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3432.429s">It</a>  was a matter of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3434.33s">And</a>  I think when the administration saw that we are no longer going to sit back and just accept what's given to us, that we're going to get out there, we're going to fight for what we want as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3444.634s">I</a>  think that's when the mayor finally gave in and said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3448.633s">I</a>  can't go for a seventh year of having a waiver because, you know, we're losing residents to surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3457.836s">And</a>  I've received more emails from people, as we heard tonight, that are going to Lexington Public Library, the Winchester Public Library, and there's no reason why you should have to leave your own city to go to a place that's comfortable and safe for our children and our residents to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3474.938s">I</a>  look forward to a future that talks about capital improvement, investments in the library, expanding the second floor in the library, looking at ways of adding staff to a severely underfunded staff and underfunded budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3494.923s">And</a>  believe me, we may get the additional funding next year just to maintain what we currently have, as the speaker said. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3502.12s">But</a>  that's not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3503.02s">That</a>  maintains the status quo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3505.461s">We</a>  have to go above the status quo in our community and ask that the administration and whoever's mayor, that they fund the things that we feel are appropriate to our community and that, you know, improve the value of our homes and improve the lifestyle and a host of other things that a public library brings into a community, as well as education and community programming <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3530.298s">and</a>  the ability to meet other people in your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3534.559s">The</a>  list goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3536.12s">And</a>  Barbara, I know you're still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3537.38s">There</a>  used to be a little box in the front with a glass top that people would come in that saved old buttons, election buttons. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3547.463s">Is</a>  that still present in something? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3549.464s">I</a>  think that would be a great thing to expand on someday in a community room where people can bring things of interest and have nights where you swap things and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3559.991s">and</a>  talk about antique cars or anything that may bring some interest back into a public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3568.532s">And</a>  I like the direction we're going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3570.813s">And</a>  I say we all have to stay on top of this for the future of our library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3574.233s">And</a>  I thank all the participation.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3579.954s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3581.675s">Ma'am,</a>  you'd like to address the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3582.955s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3584.675s">Yes,</a>  Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3586.756s">First</a>  of all, I want to thank you all for showing up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3589.755s">It</a>  does feel like a dam has been broken open with the public, and I think that's a wonderful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3596.137s">I'm</a>  a proponent of the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3598.318s">I</a>  like the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3599.418s">I</a>  want to keep it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3600.579s">I</a>  love that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3601.439s">I</a>  think it was Mr. Marks that talked to me about adding a second floor, making a meeting space maybe for the arts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3607.721s">I'm</a>  for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3608.861s">I</a>  don't think we need to buy it for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3610.762s">We</a>  don't need to buy another building. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3612.022s">We</a>  need to take care of the buildings we have first. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3614.603s">But</a>  I do believe that the business community should be talking to the library community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3619.906s">I</a>  believe that the arts community should be talking to the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3623.068s">I</a>  believe that all these little groups should be talking to each other, and maybe one of those spaces could be the Medford Public Library, because we all need to come together. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3631.553s">And</a>  I am a proponent of the library more than a lot of other projects in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3636.596s">But</a>  I would like to say, and I know I'm going to bust your bubble, which is the police station has to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3643.603s">I'm</a>  glad that you paid for the $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3645.404s">I'm</a>  glad it came out of the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3647.786s">I</a>  have no idea where it came from, but I'm glad it came out of the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3651.789s">And</a>  I'm for funding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3654.551s">But</a>  we also need to be behind the police department and the fire department headquarters, because that needs to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3662.317s">But</a>  I am for the library, and I think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3664.619s">And</a>  I think the partnership with Chevalier Theater, I went to see Frankie and Ella. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3669.698s">Saturday</a>  night, it was a fantastic show. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3671.681s">I</a>  think the library and the community, if we do put on a second floor after we build the police station, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3680.358s">If</a>  we put on a second floor and we have the arts community in there with the library, I love the idea of coffee and some kind of, you know, donuts or whatever, bagels or whatever, so that you can sit down, read a book, play on your computer, your latest gadget, and make it a meeting space. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3695.374s">I'm</a>  all for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3696.095s">I</a>  think that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3697.617s">And</a>  I think that should be part of the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3700.4s">district</a>  of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3702.682s">I</a>  really think that all of these people need to sit down at the same time because you have the Rotary sits over here and they have their business meeting and arts community has their meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3713.089s">These</a>  people need to crossbreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3715.27s">We</a>  need to cross ideas and we need to see it as one big Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3720.014s">And</a>  I think that if we build it out, I see the Medford Public Library as part of that bigger plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3725.758s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3734.57s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Camuso to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3737.152s">You</a>  wish to speak on this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3738.773s">On</a>  the library? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3740.995s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3742.836s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Camuso to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3745.258s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3746.759s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3748.02s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3749.922s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Camuso for suspension of the rules to take paper on the hand of the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3755.326s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3756.627s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3758.248s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Camuso be it resolved that the Medford City Council adjourns this evening <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3763.54s">in</a>  memory of former governor, RGO Paul Cellucci, who passed away two years ago today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3769.844s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3771.405s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3773.027s">If</a>  I may, two years ago, we lost a great person, and that was Governor Cellucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3779.011s">And</a>  he was very instrumental here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3782.513s">He</a>  lost his battle with ALS, I'm sure most of us are aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3786.035s">And</a>  I'd just like to adjourn this evening in his memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3789.018s">You</a>  know, the one thing that I remember specifically about Governor Cellucci, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3792.987s">was</a>  I had the distinct honor of being sworn in by him 16 years ago at the Chevalier Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3800.729s">It</a>  was when I first got sworn in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3802.529s">And</a>  one thing that was evident was his ability to work with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3807.291s">Whether</a>  you were Mike McGlynn, the Democrat, staunch Democrat for years, or at the time, people like our senior member, staunch Republican, he worked with everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3819.094s">Worked</a>  with everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3820.247s">He</a>  was friends with Republicans, friends with Democrats, and he just was a really good guy, and he helped Medford a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3826.432s">So</a>  I'd just like to keep his memory alive by adjourning this evening in memory of him who passed away two years ago.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3846.749s">Super.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3848.03s">Councilor</a>  Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3850.285s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Camuso for bringing this up because one of my greatest feelings in government was being the chairperson for Governor Salucci here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3861.954s">And</a>  as everyone knows, this is an extremely democratic community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3866.337s">But</a>  we won the city of Medford by six votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3869.239s">And</a>  that was a great accomplishment because it was just symptomatic of his winning throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3877.646s">He</a>  definitely was a people's person. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3879.985s">He</a>  had a wonderful father, I met him, wonderful wife and two beautiful daughters. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3884.648s">He</a>  just really exemplified what a leader should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3888.211s">He</a>  never threw his weight around to say, I'm the governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3890.993s">He</a>  was just, he could walk in here right now and he would sit down and he would just be like one of the people, truly exemplifying what a leader should be all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3898.298s">And</a>  I am very fortunate to have had that pleasure and that honor to not only work on this committee, but to be his campaign manager here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3906.009s">and</a>  very proud of the fact that not only did he win here in the city of Medford, but more importantly, he won for all the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, because I think his record, upon reflection, will show that he definitely was a people's person and governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3919.073s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3920.333s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3921.113s">So</a>  on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3921.993s">And</a>  if I may, before, as Councilor Penta said, for Councilor Penta to run the campaign here as a Republican in Medford, for him to win by six votes, it's unheard of, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3932.276s">And</a>  that's why. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3932.977s">That's</a>  why they love them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3934.037s">But</a>  wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3934.882s">But</a>  that's why this November, I'm going to win and be your new mayor.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3940.465s">How's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3943.687s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3946.048s">On</a>  the motion of approval, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3948.11s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3950.271s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3952.752s">While</a>  we're under suspension, 15-527 petition by Alexander Della Pace of a Laundry Unlimited <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3962.298s">4110</a>  Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford for keno to go monitor to be installed at 4110 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3969.66s">Are</a>  you here, Mr. Della Pace? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3973.401s">And</a>  do we have, whose committee is this?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3980.202s">Hi,</a>  please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3983.623s">My</a>  name is Alex Della Pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3985.584s">I</a>  work at the Circle Laundry at 110 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3989.504s">I</a>  live in Waltham, Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3993.236s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3994.097s">And</a>  you're in favor of this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3995.758s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3996.298s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=3997.099s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4006.366s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4007.406s">Councilor</a>  Knight of the licensing committee in the absence of Chairman Caraviello, do you have a recommendation for us?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4015.753s">Mr.</a>  President, the paperwork appears in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4017.434s">I</a>  would <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4018.133s">move</a>  for approval because the paperwork is in order and it's a conforming use. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4021.814s">However,</a>  I'd like to be recorded in opposition.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4023.854s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4024.995s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4026.135s">If</a>  I may ask the clerk through the chair, how many Kino licenses do we have in laundry establishments? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4034.277s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4034.777s">Is</a>  that, is that, that's an allowable use, but.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4041.038s">This</a>  might be the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4042.799s">First</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4044.479s">Well,</a>  I mean, this particular petitioner has, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4049.352s">I</a>  believe, other lottery items, the tickets, the megabucks, and all that kind of stuff like that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4057.516s">So</a>  you have a little, can you explain your establishment a little bit more? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4063.318s">Is</a>  there like a little convenience type? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4065.779s">Or</a>  it's just lottery with a clerk?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4069.161s">It's</a>  a laundromat. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4070.021s">It's</a>  by cleaning drop off store. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4071.862s">And</a>  we sell lottery tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4073.843s">We</a>  have the machine to sell mega millions, megabucks, etc.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4153.076s">This</a>  is something that the lottery takes care of through newspaper advertising. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4159.961s">Not</a>  anything the city does. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4161.082s">This</a>  is a lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4162.243s">They're</a>  just giving the consideration to the cities if <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4164.953s">if</a>  they oppose it or don't oppose it, but it's not a hearing type deal.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4191.768s">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4193.363s">It's</a>  my understanding that you already have the ability to sell Kino and now you just want to put the screen in so that people can sit there and watch their numbers come up while they're washing their clothes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4201.649s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4202.37s">Well,</a>  is the other part of that, is the requirement that you have to have somebody in there at a desk, at a Kino desk to make sure that they're the right age?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4268.909s">John</a>  Warren Stonem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4270.61s">I</a>  work at the Medford Tax Experts, 425 High Street, West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4277.814s">I</a>  distributed an email over the weekend asking <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4283.435s">The</a>  council, for consideration of two points, there's a Park Medford program in the city and I don't see where the Park Medford program is held accountable or responsible for the enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4299.927s">The</a>  issue specific to West Medford is the parking lot where the signage says, two hour business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4308.053s">I</a>  got my hair cut today and <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4310.934s">At</a>  the salon, I didn't bring this up, but that was the discussion, it's three hours free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4318.419s">In</a>  my request for dismissal, it was stated, the lot is not a free lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4325.023s">Now</a>  when the program was put in place in January, I drove down to the Park Medford office in South Medford to find out the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4333.668s">I</a>  can't be in business if my customers are getting tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4337.03s">I</a>  was told the lot was off the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4340.838s">that</a>  it was unnecessary for me to buy a business permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4346.941s">The</a>  appeal process of this is being heard by Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4353.803s">My</a>  suggestion is that there be a citizen council or something else to review the behavior of Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4365.188s">The</a>  signage is inadequate, the communications is lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4371.503s">I</a>  get a phone call this afternoon, a customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4377.687s">Even</a>  if I pay the ticket, she won't come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4380.889s">She</a>  won't shop or dine in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4386.113s">She</a>  parked in front of the funeral home where there was no signage and there's no parking kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4393.057s">I</a>  explained to her, as I did anyone that I sat down to do business with, here are some quarters, please put something in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4400.342s">When</a>  she got down to a car, there was a ticket on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4404.044s">She</a>  appealed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4405.844s">She's</a>  from Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4407.485s">She</a>  understands we have to pay to park, but there's parking meters and signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4412.727s">So</a>  people who want to do the right thing know what they're supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4418.85s">My</a>  second point that I want to make tonight before the council is that there's a seven-day payment requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4428.691s">or</a>  my car is subject to being impounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4431.753s">Now,</a>  I could be down in the Cape for two weeks this summer or taking the kids to Disney. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4438.796s">MedFed</a>  has a student transit population. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4444.959s">Maybe</a>  they moved after the semester, and the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4448.341s">Post</a>  Office might not get that message to them in seven days. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4452.443s">There</a>  are several issues in the administration of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4456.536s">that</a>  really needs some supervision and review. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4460.438s">And</a>  I ask your help to make the program run better, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4465.52s">Thank</a>  you for your consideration.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4470.582s">You</a>  got a ticket yourself, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4472.803s">Did</a>  you get a ticket yourself?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4474.343s">Yes,</a>  I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4475.344s">And</a>  that was the first I learned that the rules had changed of the lot in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4486.425s">When</a>  I went there to ask what the rules were for the village, I was told I didn't need a business permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4493.368s">Well,</a>  after I got the ticket, I got the business permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4496.349s">Tonight,</a>  I parked here at City Hall, and it said, permit for municipal employees two hours business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4503.753s">Now,</a>  it's possible we're all gonna get tickets, because the rules have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4507.194s">I</a>  really don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4509.155s">There</a>  has to be a better way to communicate the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4512.076s">There</a>  has to be better signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4514.396s">And</a>  as a community, we really should be holding Park Medved up to the level of responsibility that we're holding the citizens to.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4524.923s">On</a>  this subject that you're talking, you're not the first person to complain, but you're saying something that rings true to all the parking lots, because that signage was supposed to be changed to three hours, and it's still at two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4539.374s">And</a>  if you notice, when you talked about the funeral home, if you look across the street in front of a two-family house, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4544.587s">There</a>  were people still packing out there and trying to put money in front of that two-family house that was supposed to come down in January when the chief of police was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4551.369s">It</a>  was one of the first nights we had this huge discussion on kiosks in the square in certain locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4560.191s">This</a>  is just symptomatic of why this whole system has to go, because it's inconsistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4565.413s">It's</a>  unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4566.853s">It</a>  doesn't truly reflect upon you as a businessperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4569.74s">If</a>  you're going to have to be worried about where your patrons go, and if they're going to get a ticket, and if they're going to express they're not coming back, like you said, if there were meters or something more easily understandable, hey, you see a meter, you know what a meter means. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4582.808s">But</a>  the city didn't go that option, and they went through this idea of kiosks, and some of the spots just don't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4589.031s">Now,</a>  you talked about in front of the funeral home where you're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4591.933s">In</a>  front of Elmont Glass, I believe, there's a kiosk, and if you go further up the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4596.062s">In</a>  front of a dentist's office, there's a kiosk, which makes absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4600.644s">You</a>  go across the street in West Medford Square in front of a shoe store on the side street by the railroad tracks, he has a kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4608.068s">But</a>  you go further down the street in West Medford to the Arlington line, where there's a block of stores there, and there's no kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4616.492s">You</a>  go on Boston Avenue, the corner of Boston Avenue and Arlington Street, I believe there's eight stores there, businesses, and there's no kiosk there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4625.268s">It's</a>  a huge inconsistency, it's absolutely totally unfair, and whatever you could come up with, a suggestion to me would be, I wouldn't want to amend it, I'd want to get rid of it, because it doesn't serve any purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4638.17s">That's</a>  not what this council was looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4640.531s">The</a>  committee that first formed to review all of this was to have a traffic enforcement, not a traffic enhancement program, revenue enhancement, especially to an out-of-towner. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4649.873s">So</a>  I thank you for coming and telling us your plight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4653.403s">You're</a>  just one of many, and since tonight, this afternoon, when I met this lady, she indicated to me not only that she put the money in the machine, the machine said it didn't take the money, and when she finally put it in a second time, she got a receipt for another car, which wasn't hers, which means that the person prior to her did not take her receipt. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4677.332s">So</a>  now, she put the money in, she has no, so that's now, she's up to 50 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4681.857s">Now</a>  she had to put a third quarter in to make it 75, so it spit out her number plate on that particular receipt. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4688.22s">So,</a>  there's just so many things, just so many problems with this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4691.962s">And</a>  I'm sorry, as a business person, because that's what my concern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4695.663s">You're</a>  the guy, the small business person that's getting hurt throughout this entire community, and I apologize on behalf of the city that you have to go through that, but I can assure you, it's gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4705.688s">It's</a>  gonna go.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4710.623s">Thank</a>  you, and I appreciate the gentleman at the podium's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4717.365s">Over</a>  the past several, three or four weeks, it's been discussed that it's gonna go, it's gotta go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4723.567s">Where</a>  are we gonna fund the $800,000 from? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4726.168s">That's</a>  the question, because it's gotta go is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4729.189s">I</a>  think this council took a vote that we'd like to see it go, but you have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4733.27s">We</a>  have a library that was looking for $250,000 this evening to just maintain <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4740.977s">status</a>  accredited and to be, not accredited, but to be part of the Minuteman Association, $800,000 of taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4749.342s">Where</a>  are we going to take it from? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4752.444s">And</a>  don't say that we'll just take them to court and get out of the contract because that's... Point of information.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4757.406s">That</a>  dollar amount is absolutely incorrect because right now nobody knows what that dollar amount might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4762.809s">If</a>  you read the contract and the contract talks within the first year, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4766.013s">And</a>  I believe the first year the stat up number is 900,000, but they've collected almost close to 300,000 so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4771.54s">But</a>  there are seven infractions in this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4774.457s">in</a>  the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4775.557s">Name</a>  the major one that you could go to court and get rid of them with.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4778.198s">Name</a>  the infraction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4780.639s">Name</a>  the infraction that you think a judge would say, you know what, Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4783.74s">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4784.2s">Get</a>  rid of them at no charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4785.601s">Name</a>  the infraction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4786.741s">You</a>  said there's seven.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4787.962s">Well,</a>  I don't have my book with me tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4789.382s">I</a>  didn't realize we were going to get into this, but one of the real main ones is when- You said seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4793.264s">Would</a>  you wait a minute? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4793.984s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4794.604s">One</a>  of the real main ones was when the gentleman, Mr. Nash, came here, they were supposed to have a public program that <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4801.423s">indoctrinated</a>  their employees to what they were supposed to do, knowing the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4805.446s">Number</a>  one, tagging people who had permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4807.748s">Number</a>  two, driving around the streets of the city of Medford without having their cars properly leaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4812.372s">Number</a>  three, giving tickets out in public parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4817.315s">Four,</a>  five, I just don't have it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4821.739s">They're</a>  there, they're there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4823.04s">I</a>  believe Councilor Camuso has the floor.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4825.481s">So</a>  the five that he just mentioned, there's not one that would, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4829.044s">put</a>  us out of the contract in a reasonable person's, um, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4834.687s">But</a>  the rhetoric saying we can just get rid of it, this and that, we have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4837.729s">I'd</a>  just like to know where, because, because bring something forward, tangible, where the dollars and cents are going to come from, and then we'll look at it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4843.792s">Well,</a>  you know something, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4845.193s">That's</a>  your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4845.894s">In</a>  my, I feel very, very comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4847.474s">You</a>  know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4848.575s">You</a>  were on this council when the vote took place a few years ago to take a million dollars from the water and sewer account to balance the budget of the mayor's budget, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4856.2s">You</a>  took it from one account because you couldn't balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4858.942s">You</a>  took over a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4860.543s">And</a>  you voted for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4861.463s">And</a>  I voted for her too.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4862.304s">And</a>  you voted for her too. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4862.964s">And</a>  I voted for her too, okay?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4864.465s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4864.685s">But</a>  this situation is entirely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4867.206s">Well,</a>  why are you bringing that up? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4868.486s">If</a>  you have to pay to get rid of it and to save the small business person, whatever it costs, that's what I would intend to do.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4874.808s">So</a>  is that going to be your answer to everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4875.928s">I</a>  would mitigate it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4876.428s">I</a>  would mitigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4877.168s">Pardon</a>  me?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4877.728s">So</a>  your answer to everything is just going to be pay to stop this, pay to stop that? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4880.609s">No,</a>  I said I would mitigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4881.629s">The</a>  city would be bankrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4882.289s">I</a>  said I would mitigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4883.01s">The</a>  city would be bankrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4883.67s">I'm</a>  not going to argue with you anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4884.77s">Well,</a>  I know, because you don't have a leg to stand on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4886.23s">It</a>  just doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4888.111s">Councilors,</a>  let's focus on the subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4891.352s">As</a>  I said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4893.045s">Back</a>  to the gentleman, I'm just sick and tired of the rhetoric saying let's get rid of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4896.433s">We</a>  need a tangible something to get rid of it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4900.703s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4902.968s">If</a>  you're sick and tired of the rhetoric, then you should, you are the one, one of the main reasons why we're in this program, because you support the mayor rank and file on every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4913.375s">So</a>  that's not sit back now because some of us want to get out of a program that you supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4918.858s">I</a>  brought the resolution forward to get rid of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4920.579s">You</a>  brought nothing forward.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4921.52s">Councilor,</a>  you brought these minutes to the city.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4923.201s">We'll</a>  go back to the minutes.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4924.742s">Mr.</a>  President, I have the floor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4925.804s">Don't</a>  be disingenuous.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4927.546s">Don't</a>  be disingenuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4930.391s">I'm</a>  glad Councilor Marks brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4932.133s">It</a>  was him and his committee that he sat on for many years that said we need to have parking enforcement number one and parking meters.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4939.845s">I</a>  have the records from the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4942.648s">First</a>  of all, he just said it was my committee, which the gentleman doesn't know what he's talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4947.012s">It</a>  was the mayor's committee, so the gentleman is just spurting out again, like he does every Tuesday night, false information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4953.879s">It</a>  was the mayor's committee that you happen to be very friendly with, and now you're trying to back away from him now because he's a lame duck mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4961.886s">You're</a>  the one that supported this program, rank and file. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4964.467s">Same</a>  vote as you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4965.147s">And</a>  we took the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4966.288s">Same</a>  vote as you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4966.948s">And</a>  we took the vote, Mr. President, with all due respect, to have this program done in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4971.59s">You</a>  were against taking it in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4973.29s">You</a>  wanted to hire the Tennessee group. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4975.311s">That</a>  was your stance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4976.671s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4976.892s">That</a>  was your stance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4978.052s">When</a>  we talked, Mr. President, about kiosk on the street, Councilor Camuso was in favor of kiosk on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4983.634s">Councilor</a>  Camuso, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4986.775s">If</a>  you want to talk issues, we'll talk issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4988.996s">We're</a>  going to talk issues.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4990.357s">Councilor</a>  Camuso was the president at the time when I made the motion to have parking meters at the final meeting and not kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=4997.62s">So</a>  if you want to just throw out stuff that's not true and inaccurate, listen, you've been doing it for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5001.842s">People</a>  are catching on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5002.582s">The</a>  numbers are going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5003.763s">But</a>  that's, but that's, we'll see if you're here November 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5007.264s">But</a>  with all due respect, Mr. President, with all due respect, this council voted unanimously for this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5013.408s">It's</a>  a valid question to ask a colleague of mine where he's going to get the money to get out of a contract.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5020.738s">Where</a>  is the point of personal privilege?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5022.34s">He</a>  said this council, look, I did not vote for this kiosk program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5025.723s">I</a>  did not vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5027.165s">I</a>  only allowed the mayor to go and to negotiate for a contract up to 10 years and then represent it back to the council and compare it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5034.433s">Check</a>  your notes, check your notes, April of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5036.395s">Then</a>  we came back in September 12th of 2014 and we had a two. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5042.401s">two</a>  rinky dink piece of paper that said confidential as if the city was to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5047.342s">And</a>  the city and the mayor and the budget director at that time would entertain it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5051.123s">Would</a>  not entertain it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5053.103s">This</a>  is getting so blown out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5055.044s">I'm</a>  sticking to my comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5056.384s">You</a>  know, I would mitigate to get rid of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5059.405s">If</a>  he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5061.465s">He</a>  doesn't support me anyway.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5062.646s">So</a>  what difference should I make? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5063.706s">Why</a>  should I think about what he said? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5065.286s">As</a>  I stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5069.419s">There</a>  are valid concerns out there, but it's thrown around. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5072.221s">This</a>  is the fourth week in a row that it's been thrown around. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5074.062s">We're</a>  just going to get rid of it and do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5075.623s">People</a>  in the community want to know where we're going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5077.465s">Are</a>  we going to take it from the library funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5078.866s">Are</a>  we going to take it from the school's funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5080.167s">Are</a>  we going to take it from the police? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5081.447s">Where</a>  are we going to come up with the $800,000 plus to have them take a walk? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5086.371s">That's</a>  a legitimate question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5088.152s">And</a>  if the Councilor feels uncomfortable getting a question asked, then guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5092.315s">I</a>  don't know what to tell him. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5093.316s">It's</a>  unfortunate, but back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5095.177s">You</a>  say you wanted to get out of it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5096.972s">Point</a>  of clarification.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5097.532s">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5099.672s">I'm</a>  just so confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5100.673s">I'm</a>  pretty sure, wasn't it you, Councilor Camuso, that brought the motion forward to vote to get rid of the parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5105.554s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5105.914s">Where</a>  did you believe we were going to get the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5107.614s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5108.534s">Where</a>  did you believe we were going to get the money when you put that forward?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5111.014s">I</a>  had an idea, and I didn't present it yet, but we'll see soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5114.475s">Because</a>  with all due respect, with all due respect, with all due respect, I brought the motion forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5122.757s">I</a>  had five members of this council support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5127.098s">But</a>  the councilor that sits across from me wants to talk about it week after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5130.921s">He</a>  hasn't made a tangible effort to bring forward a plan to get rid of it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5137.365s">Well,</a>  let's move on then, councilors.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5140.187s">As</a>  I said... Thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5144.79s">Councilor,</a>  if you remember... Councilor Camuso has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5148.012s">Councilor,</a>  please wrap it up.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5148.853s">I'll</a>  wrap it up, but the request that we had was for the mayor to get out of this and to come up with a plan <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5155.127s">Councilor</a>  Penta's throwing it out without a plan, so be it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5159.23s">Thank</a>  you, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5161.212s">Councilor</a>  Penta, let's wrap this up.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5164.554s">I</a>  am going to wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5165.615s">I</a>  am going to wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5166.395s">I'm</a>  not going to dignify the comment he just made that I don't have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5169.718s">I</a>  don't have to say anything as to what I'm going to do and how I'm going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5173.741s">I'm</a>  telling you that I would <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5176.623s">mitigate</a>  the plan to get out, and if it's gonna cost money, who cares? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5180.424s">I'm</a>  more concerned about saving the businesses that are losing business right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5184.565s">And</a>  if a guy like that has to come here and defend his position as it relates to having to pay quarters to give his patrons to put in a kiosk so he can do business, and the guy down the street with the coffee shop has to do the same thing, and other parts of the city don't have it, that's unfair, that's unjust, and as far as I'm concerned, it's got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5203.089s">And</a>  whatever it takes to get rid of it, that's what we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5205.211s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5206.972s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5208.393s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5210.175s">I</a>  think that it's important to note that the resolution that was brought forward was to listen to the concerns that this gentleman had. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5216.18s">And</a>  we've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5217.361s">And</a>  he's asked us to take some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5218.782s">So</a>  I think it would be important for us to sit down, maybe as a body, and come up with something that we can agree on, that we can present to the Traffic Commission, if, in fact, it is the wishes of this council to get out of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5229.291s">I'm</a>  a little concerned that <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5231.217s">the</a>  meetings are going to start turning into campaign commercials, and we're not going to be taking care of the business that needs to be taken care of, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5239.36s">And,</a>  you know, I'd appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5241.76s">I</a>  think that, you know, we've heard from business owners, and we'll continue to hear from business owners, because it's not a perfect program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5246.922s">The</a>  gentleman's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5247.962s">The</a>  gentleman's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5248.522s">The</a>  signage is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5249.823s">The</a>  signage is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5250.943s">The</a>  communication is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5253.064s">And</a>  the relationship that we have with Pac-Medfed could be much stronger. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5257.985s">One</a>  of the recommendations that we as a council have been giving to people would be when they feel as though there has been a violation of their rights to report it to the Consumer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5265.129s">I</a>  think that we have a job here to provide these people with recourse, what direction to go in if in fact they are aggrieved by the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5272.593s">You</a>  know, rhetoric is great, but action is better, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5275.514s">And,</a>  you know, I respect Councilor Penta's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5278.696s">I</a>  respect Councilor Camuso's position on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5280.617s">It's</a>  a passionate issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5282.678s">It's</a>  a big issue that's affecting the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5285.412s">However,</a>  I think that we really need to start providing solutions as opposed to, you know, yelling and screaming and fighting with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5291.197s">We</a>  all know that the program's not perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5292.959s">We</a>  all know the program's not perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5294.74s">The</a>  question is, what steps can we take to make it better? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5297.702s">Because</a>  as of right now, it's not going anywhere.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5300.124s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5300.825s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5302.406s">Sir,</a>  there are other people that would like to speak on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5304.828s">Do</a>  you have anything else to offer to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5307.782s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5308.783s">Hi,</a>  please state your name and address for the records, please.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5311.225s">My</a>  name is Michael Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5312.326s">I</a>  live on 18 Pembroke Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5314.027s">I</a>  think everyone in the council wants a solution to this contract issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5317.53s">I</a>  believe here is our issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5319.012s">Here's</a>  our solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5319.932s">It</a>  fixes all the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5321.134s">Let</a>  me read from the contract directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5322.855s">In</a>  section four, chapter D, it says the operator acknowledges, operator being Republic Parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5329.25s">acknowledges</a>  that it is within the exclusive discretion, province, and jurisdiction of the city to set, amend, alter, or change the amount of fees, fines, charges, or other expenses that relate to parking spaces in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5345.654s">The</a>  way that we fix the problem is make the parking spaces worth $0. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5351.056s">It</a>  does not violate the contract, and it removes this possibility of having any violation</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5360.119s">I'd</a>  be a little bit more comfortable relying on legal opinions from the solicitor as opposed to a layperson.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5365.402s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5366.583s">I'm</a>  not a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5367.463s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5368.103s">I'm</a>  just providing a possible solution to this parking problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5371.786s">We</a>  do not have to violate the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5374.027s">We</a>  do not have to pay onerous fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5376.329s">We</a>  have control over how the parking works in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5380.311s">That</a>  is the solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5381.412s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5382.252s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5382.733s">Gesundheit.</a> </p>

    <p>[acqgxK4yhEM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5387.308s">Mario</a>  Martin, formerly from 17 Benton Road at 198 Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5391.952s">I</a>  just wanted to talk about the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5393.713s">I</a>  think what Mr. Ruggiero just mentioned was a really good idea, and it supports creativity, which is something that we need, especially with this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5403.86s">Just</a>  to kind of highlight what people are telling me, going around South Medford, I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5411.432s">what</a>  people are telling me about this parking issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5413.854s">And</a>  it's drastic, especially because it's causing issues with businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5422.541s">There's</a>  businesses that are saying that they're going out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5424.423s">And</a>  I know someone personally who does massage therapy who tried to start her services after graduating from the Salter School here in Malden to try and compete out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5437.253s">And</a>  it was impossible for her to do that because her clients couldn't actually <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5441.769s">park</a>  anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5444.711s">Businesses</a>  are definitely being affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5448.793s">The</a>  residents, commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5451.434s">Residents</a>  really didn't have a say in this at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5454.436s">And</a>  I don't think residents would have strongly supported a Tennessee corporation coming in here and offering Tennessee taxes that they'd be collecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5468.28s">I</a>  mean, honestly, no one really supports this but Councilor Camuso, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5477.003s">The</a>  elderly are drastically affected by this, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5483.285s">Listen,</a>  this program affects everyone, honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5486.386s">And</a>  the problem is that this program doesn't really <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5491.991s">help</a>  in terms of the type of infrastructure that we have here in Medford, where in something like Somerville or in Boston, there's T's around. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5499.533s">There's</a>  better public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5502.174s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5502.734s">So</a>  people don't need to have cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5504.194s">So</a>  if they do park, whatever the reason was why, personally, I think the only reason why this program was implemented was because it was a revenue stream. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5513.617s">But</a>  that's speculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5515.478s">That's</a>  what I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5518.118s">But</a>  if it was really for fixing a parking problem, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5523.836s">It's</a>  not really doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5524.797s">In</a>  fact, it's obviously made it worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5527.659s">So,</a>  you know, Penta mentioned, you know, you said, you know, would Penta sue? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5532.482s">I</a>  would. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5533.682s">I</a>  would definitely look at the contingency plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5535.884s">I</a>  would look at the contingency plan, and I would see what we can do, because ultimately, Medford residents didn't have a choice or a say, and I think we need to welcome the feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5544.889s">I</a>  think we need to go back to the drawing board and figure out a way where we can make this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5548.652s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5551.949s">like</a>  to address a few things to the gentleman because he may walk around South Medford but as a councillor and I think most of us as councillors have heard positive feedback regarding this program from some businesses whether it's in West Medford whether it's in Medford Square where they've had their strongest March and April that they had in all time now I'm not gonna throw those businesses out there I know the mayor's done that on one occasion and I <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5577.613s">I</a>  didn't think it was quite fair to that particular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5580.296s">But</a>  I know for a fact that the loudest member of this council to get rid of this program has been told by a business owner that it was the best march they have ever had. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5592.226s">And</a>  there's a business owner right here, right now, that's marched over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5595.628s">Well,</a>  Mario, as you campaign across the city, you're going to understand, there's many people in this community with different philosophies, different feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5602.994s">And</a>  the majority of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5604.075s">Well,</a>  the majority of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5604.835s">Would</a>  you talk to 200? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5605.336s">The</a>  majority of them are saying that this program sucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5607.938s">With</a>  all due respect, with all due respect, as you're entitled to your opinion, I'm entitled to my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5614.743s">And</a>  there is people in this community, business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5618.746s">You're</a>  not talking to all the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5621.015s">in</a>  this community, throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5622.397s">People</a>  that are on second floors, that are not on street level, that have their massage parlors throughout the squares, throughout other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5629.345s">You</a>  are not getting the phone calls that this council has dealt with for the last 10 years of people parking and taking the bus all day, living in their neighborhoods like Damon Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5638.365s">like</a>  Winthrop Street, like Boston Ave, like High Street, like Boynton Road, the gentleman nodding his head right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5643.809s">You're</a>  not privy to those conversations, because you're not an elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5647.05s">Now,</a>  if you're successful in your endeavors, maybe you'll see the many different sides of every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5653.594s">But</a>  to say that everyone's for it or against it, it's fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5657.396s">It's</a>  fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5658.197s">That's</a>  not my rhetoric. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5659.437s">I</a>  can show you emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5660.438s">I</a>  can show you phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5662.739s">You</a>  walked South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5663.66s">I</a>  know you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5664.66s">I</a>  know you have, because people have told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5666.241s">But</a>  with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5668.546s">There's</a>  a portion of the community that— My rhetoric wasn't that every single person disagrees with it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5799.018s">Councilor</a>  Karafiello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5800.438s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5801.618s">No,</a>  Mr. President, the major objective of this plan was to turn the parking spots over for the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5810.96s">And</a>  at some point, it has done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5813.721s">But</a>  what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5816.362s">I'll</a>  tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5817.162s">The</a>  reason you're seeing more spots, especially in the squares, is because, A, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5822.03s">It's</a>  taking the commuters off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5824.592s">And</a>  B, it's taking the employees off the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5829.796s">That's</a>  why you're seeing all the open spaces because, you know, Brandon's law firm, who might be in the square, has five employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5837.262s">They're</a>  now parking in the parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5839.403s">You're</a>  finding that the business slots are all full now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5843.006s">And</a>  so now we've created another problem that we have nowhere for employees to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5850.85s">So</a>  that's what we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5853.571s">And</a>  people are parking in the governor's av lot and getting tickets because they're working in the square and they got nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5860.994s">The</a>  parking lot on Route 16, jam-packed every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5864.736s">If</a>  you're not there by 8.30, you're not getting a parking spot anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5867.437s">The</a>  parking lot down by the old Tony Lucci's, full every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5870.819s">Those</a>  lots used to be empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5872.639s">Now</a>  they're full. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5874.28s">And</a>  that's part of the reason you're seeing the empty spots in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5877.822s">Again,</a>  yes, it has hurt some business, and yes, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5881.048s">We</a>  do need to do some work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5883.75s">There</a>  is a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5884.41s">There</a>  is still a lot of work that needs to be done on this in order to make it even somewhat of a success or not a success. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5892.236s">But</a>  I say, more dialogue has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5894.698s">But</a>  again, you know, to come up here every week and do it every week, I don't think is the proper forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5898.961s">Maybe,</a>  you know, a separate public hearing with the parking company, I think, is the better forum to go so we can just concentrate on that particular issue of that evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5910.084s">Thank</a>  you for that recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5911.385s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5912.145s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5913.125s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5915.066s">And</a>  I know for a fact that a poll was done regarding major issues in this community and parking fell well below number four, followed behind education, economic development, um, senior citizens programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5932.795s">And</a>  that is factual to fall down that far on the <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5940.192s">totem</a>  pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5943.653s">It's</a>  speaks volumes and I'm going to leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5950.494s">But</a>  so we just heard that no one's for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5954.875s">No</a>  one's for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5956.335s">But</a>  one lady that's come up here and spoke eloquently that we don't see at the council meeting every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5960.996s">I</a>  think this is the first time I've seen her at the council meeting and she's been here longer than all of us cause she was here for five 30 for the library meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5968.215s">But</a>  this is a regular, average citizen that pays an enormous tax bill on Damon Road, and she just gave her feelings on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5975.941s">So</a>  for everyone to say that there's no one that's for this, this is why I caution people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5981.805s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5983.847s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5984.927s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5986.489s">And</a>  Councilor Caraviello made a very excellent point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5989.471s">And</a>  I think when we look at the transformation of this parking program and, you know, the reason why <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=5996.878s">it</a>  was brought to the city was to turn over spots and to prevent all day parking from commuters. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6004.299s">And</a>  I think we've accomplished those goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6006.72s">And</a>  the one thing that we've accomplished as well as scaring a lot of people away from our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6012.301s">And</a>  I've said that before, and I'll say it again, but, um, Councilor Caraviello was absolutely right when he said that, you know, a lot of the spots that have cleared up weren't necessarily all day commuters that were parking their car in West Medford square and getting on the train. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6024.997s">There</a>  were all-day commuters that were parking their car in West Medford Square to go to work in West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6029.18s">And</a>  when you look at the number of business permits that were issued in 2014 prior to the rollout of the plan, some 260 or so, versus the number of business permits that have been issued after the rollout of the plan, which is somewhere around 560 or so, I think we'll see that there was absolute abuse of our current systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6046.913s">So</a>  I can understand when people raise the issue saying, well, enforcement would have solved that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6051.516s">And</a>  paying might not necessarily be the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6054.645s">However,</a>  the program that we have is the program that we have, and we need to work within the confines of this contract that we have right now to determine whether or not we can make it work for us or not.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6062.67s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6064.151s">Ma'am,</a>  you wish to address the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6065.512s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6067.874s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6068.274s">Jean</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6070.035s">First</a>  of all, this was an enforcement issue, and we only have 105 police officers in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6075.738s">We</a>  didn't hire me to take care of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6079.201s">We</a>  didn't, internally or whatever, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6081.801s">We</a>  had a parking problem that needed to be enforced, and we only have 105 officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6085.665s">And</a>  to give them the task, the added task, to run after parked cars was a waste of their time and energy and skills, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6095.073s">We</a>  did need to get the commuter traffic off the streets, and it was a success. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6098.897s">Those</a>  are the two things that it did accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6102.0s">One,</a>  we took the bulk of ticketing off of the police roles, duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6107.919s">And</a>  two, we got the commuters and the employees off of those streets in front of their own businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6112.46s">And</a>  that was a success. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6114.44s">But</a>  I do encourage the public to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6117.881s">And</a>  so that's because, Mr. Knight, that is the, and I'll probably vote for you this year too, but you're doing a good job overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6125.862s">But</a>  I disagree with you on this one, which is it is only through the public coming forward to this podium that we can push <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6134.42s">the</a>  solicitor to have to answer these questions because the mayor doesn't have to right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6138.382s">He</a>  can just coast on the end of his tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6142.883s">And</a>  so we need to have public input so that we can pressure, and that's only by this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6151.207s">So</a>  I'm glad that everybody's questioning it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6153.148s">As</a>  far as the meters, it's a debacle. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6156.249s">I</a>  mean, it really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6157.269s">I'm</a>  glad that the parking is not under the, you know, police aren't wasting their time on parked cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6164.458s">and</a>  I'm glad that the commuters are off. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6166.32s">That</a>  said, Saturday night I saw a woman at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6170.484s">trying</a>  to put money in the meter and she was so grateful that I came up to her because she was trying to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6175.229s">Nobody</a>  understands these meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6177.05s">Nobody</a>  from, if you're not from Medford and you don't come to these meetings and you didn't take a class or, I've seen it over and over and over again across from Colleen's old people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6187.29s">trying</a>  to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6189.231s">And</a>  when they do know it, they're complaining about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6193.512s">Maybe</a>  after a while, they'd get used to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6195.813s">But</a>  my question is, because we do need a solution to it, is what about putting in meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6202.415s">How</a>  much would it cost the city to transfer over from these parking meters that are computerized and nobody understands to a meter system? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6212.338s">I</a>  mean, is that a solution? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6214.378s">And</a>  it has to happen in the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6216.7s">You</a>  get, like you said, these business people, they're going nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6220.683s">And</a>  I want the city, I want Medford Square to survive, and I want business in there until 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6226.368s">at</a>  night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6227.208s">And</a>  I want businesses during the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6229.67s">It's</a>  dead after 6 o'clock, and it shouldn't be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6232.252s">And</a>  on the weekends, it should be open until 11 or 12 o'clock, and we should be getting that business rotation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6238.651s">But</a>  if they're dying during the day, how are you going to produce something that's going to be open during the evening? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6244.894s">And</a>  we need the income from these businesses, because we do need so much building maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6249.335s">And</a>  so this feeds into the police department, which I always come back to. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6252.697s">So</a>  anyway, thank you very much for considering my thoughts.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6258.499s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6259.119s">And</a>  I'd just like to add one more point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6261.7s">The</a>  city of Medford, we all do know that we get those robocalls from the Captain Clemente. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6266.562s">There</a>  was a robocall that went out to this entire community regarding the parking meeting that this Medford City Council was holding in room 207, right over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6274.967s">A</a>  robocall, 57,000 people, many, many homes, and the meeting fit right in that room.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6286.073s">I</a>  and many people that I know never got that robocall, so I don't know who the 57,000 people he's talking about.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6291.696s">I'm</a>  sure, Mr. President, that the <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6296.673s">I'm</a>  not going to speak for anyone else, but I'm sure if the city administration wanted to, they could probably get the data back up that says either his phone was an answer machine or it was hung up on because they do keep records of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6308.165s">So</a>  I'm sure for zero summit road, if they go back and look at that robocall, they'll be able to tell the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6312.951s">But</a>  with that being said, um, here's one last point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6318.304s">I'd</a>  like to get an update of all the revenue collected through these machines, because for every one person that it's acting up on or is having a hard time, there's another 10, 15, 20, whatever it is, used it successfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6333.393s">So</a>  I'd like to know how much they've taken in so far through the Park Medford application on the cellular phones that I know is becoming very popular, as well as the meters itself.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6344.801s">So</a>  this is the only motion we've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6347.487s">A</a>  motion of Councilor Camuso that the Council get an update year to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6351.689s">Year</a>  to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6352.389s">Year</a>  to date on revenue generated by, what is it called? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6356.83s">Park</a>  Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6357.891s">Park</a>  Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6358.391s">Republican</a>  Parking.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6360.652s">And</a>  one last point is too. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6362.612s">Yes,</a>  Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6365.574s">Most</a>  of the majority of the people that are working there, this has been another <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6370.653s">Misinformation,</a>  more than half of the employees there are Medford residents from this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6377.136s">So,</a>  and God forbid one of them falls down and does get hurt now or something like that, throws out their back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6382.618s">It's</a>  not on the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6384.239s">It's</a>  on the vendor, but there are Medford employees that are doing most of the jobs down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6389.902s">And</a>  other Councilors around this real can back me up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6396.105s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6397.225s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6398.246s">Councilor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6406.547s">And</a>  a little amount year to date of all abated tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6410.77s">All</a>  tickets that have been abated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6412.451s">On</a>  that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6418.115s">We</a>  have a citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6419.516s">How</a>  are you Mr. Citizen? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6420.577s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6421.237s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6423.279s">My</a>  name is Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6427.062s">First</a>  of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6429.044s">People</a>  who seem to have no problem with the parking enforcement program are people that are least affected by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6435.606s">Now,</a>  we know that there's been some alleviation of the cars parking in the squares who take the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6441.087s">But</a>  all they've done is they've gone from here to here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6445.308s">They've</a>  gone from the streets to the Whole Food parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6448.228s">They've</a>  gone up to the Bow Street area, up near Magoon Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6453.67s">The</a>  cars are inundating the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6456.11s">And</a>  these are the people that are going and parking them back at Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6460.313s">You</a>  haven't stopped the commuter parking problem in Medford, because now all the streets are getting crowded, but they don't happen to be in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6467.095s">And</a>  I'll be honest with you, there was never a problem to get a parking spot in Medford in the big lot next to the senior citizen buildings years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6474.416s">I</a>  mean, you could always go there if you wanted to walk, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6477.177s">And</a>  that was your choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6478.057s">I</a>  like to see the business people who say that they enjoy and they look forward to people having to pay to come into their shops, because I have yet to find one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6487.339s">I</a>  really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6488.289s">And</a>  I'm not trying to be facetious. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6490.39s">And</a>  I'd like to see the numbers for a program that they had the best march in the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6496.532s">We</a>  still had the snow pile in front of the state police building on the parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6500.893s">It</a>  was over the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6502.294s">I</a>  mean, people couldn't even get to the stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6504.495s">So</a>  I'd like to, you know, unless it was the guy that sells shovels at the local hardware store, I mean, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6510.597s">But</a>  this started. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6511.577s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6513.858s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6517.92s">One</a>  piece of data that I would ask you to get maybe is the mills tax compared to last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6522.481s">And</a>  there was an increase in mills tax over the winter in the city of Medford and the whole first quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6528.782s">So</a>  that's data that backs up your theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6531.022s">Present</a>  our comments through the chair please.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6533.803s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6534.783s">Kindly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6536.523s">Point</a>  of clarification.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6538.684s">The</a>  first, the quarter that just came back in from the Commonwealth of Mass had an increase overall in the state by some 400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6546.137s">dollars</a>  in tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6548.439s">It's</a>  $400,000 more than projected. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6551.0s">It's</a>  a sign that the economy is getting better throughout the entire Commonwealth, but specifically here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6558.365s">You</a>  hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6559.766s">Show</a>  me the businesses that say they love them and they want them and it's good for their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6564.549s">Thank</a>  you for the point of information,</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6567.467s">Mr.</a>  Citizen, please continue your comments.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6571.749s">Through</a>  the chair, Councilor Camuso, I understand about the meals tax in the restaurants, because most people in a time of when you have one storm after another after another, most people cocoon, and they'll walk to the places. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6584.654s">Very</a>  few will probably drive in, but a lot of people are going in restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6589.496s">But</a>  I'm talking about the majority of businesses in the squares, in the private squares, the dry cleaners, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6596.343s">The</a>  floor is, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6599.125s">Did</a>  I say private square? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6600.886s">I</a>  meant the side squares.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6602.006s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6605.608s">I</a>  have a private square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6606.509s">No,</a>  it's a, I misspoke on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6609.09s">But,</a>  um, as I said before, the problem, there's a lot of things that could be fixed in the program, but the major problem with this whole parking program was it was no due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6621.757s">There</a>  was no, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6623.252s">going</a>  out to see how these other programs work in other cities, to see what problems they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6627.793s">It</a>  was wham, bam, thank you, man, and here we go with a parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6630.914s">And</a>  it's been a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6631.814s">It</a>  really has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6632.715s">It's</a>  been terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6633.515s">I've</a>  seen people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6634.835s">I've</a>  helped people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6635.635s">I</a>  can't see the bloody screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6637.496s">And</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6638.696s">There</a>  are people that are trying to put money in, and they get tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6642.777s">So</a>  I don't know what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6643.878s">I</a>  haven't gotten a ticket yet, because I refuse to put any money in the meters at all, none whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6647.899s">I'll</a>  walk the two miles to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6649.419s">I</a>  will. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6650.54s">I'm</a>  just upset with that parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6652.665s">And</a>  you councilors voted in good faith to give the administration the ability to work up to a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6659.671s">But</a>  then on behalf of your good efforts, the contract was signed, and then here it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6665.035s">Here's</a>  the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6665.755s">Now</a>  we have to live with the mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6667.457s">There</a>  was no shaking out of this whole bloody package. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6669.939s">So</a>  anyway, I just want to say that the problem has actually just moved to other neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6676.344s">And</a>  it's evident. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6677.265s">And</a>  anybody who wants to come in, I'll show you the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6679.787s">Whole</a>  Foods, the whole parking lot was loaded there at 9 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6682.808s">There</a>  were like about six people in Whole Foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6684.768s">So</a>  where are those guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6686.508s">They</a>  get the bus into Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6687.609s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[acqgxK4yhEM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6688.709s">Thank</a>  you, my neighbor.</p>

    <p>[acqgxK4yhEM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6692.41s">So</a>  I just actually want to finish before I was cut off.</p>

    <p>[Q7cD9OP2TNA_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6828.569s">Well,</a>  I just want to let everybody know that all these problems that you're talking about, he will clear them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6834.611s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6834.811s">This</a>  failed administration that we have here now with McGlynn, that's going to be over with. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6840.162s">And</a>  he will clear up all these failed programs.</p>

    <p>[Q7cD9OP2TNA_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6860.528s">They</a>  mentioned earlier, too, about the parking, where the city is going to get the money for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6867.431s">When</a>  our new mayor comes in,</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6914.183s">We</a>  have two amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6920.168s">What</a>  is an update of all revenue collected from the kiosks and the park application? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6926.374s">The</a>  park method application. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6928.564s">year-to-date,</a>  and all tickets that have been abated.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6932.868s">All</a>  tickets abated, year-to-date. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6935.21s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6937.071s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6937.471s">If</a>  we could also get an update from the Chief of Police, who works very hard on the Park Medford program, especially as a liaison and answering our questions, if we can get an update from him on the new signage and our other concerns that we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6952.724s">He</a>  had a list before he left our last meeting that he was here probably about a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6956.891s">So</a>  if we can get any updates with regards to any issues we had with the program.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6960.913s">Those</a>  outstanding issues that we had presented to the Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6962.874s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6963.855s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6964.435s">And</a>  Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6965.756s">Mr.</a>  President, if we can also get a listing of any complaints that were filed relative to the kiosk operation taking money after hours from the Consumer Commission.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6973.0s">And</a>  an update on complaints for after hours money taking to be given to the Council from the Medford Consumer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6983.526s">So</a>  on that motion, as amended, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6986.469s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6987.029s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6987.77s">The</a>  motion carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6991.413s">On</a>  the motion of Consular Longo Current to resort back to their revert, back to the regular order of business, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6999.421s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=6999.961s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7001.393s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions 15-524 are offered by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7007.517s">Be</a>  it resolved that a listing of all new hires and employee promotions since 7-01, that's July 1st, 2013, in both the school department and the city side of the budgets be forwarded to the council by title, job description, when hired, salary, person's name, address, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7030.951s">Also,</a>  all promotions of employees by name, salary, department since July 1, 2013 to the date of this 2015-2016 city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7045.335s">This</a>  information should be forwarded to the council ASAP as the entire city and school department is now under review for consideration.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7055.938s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7056.998s">Mr.</a>  President, I think it's quite obvious as to <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7060.85s">what</a>  the resolution says. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7062.571s">And</a>  I think it would be beneficial for us to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7065.773s">I</a>  believe before, I think it was some two years ago, we had asked of the budget director to have names associated next to positions in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7074.658s">And</a>  we still don't have it as of now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7077.58s">But</a>  last year, I believe that the budget increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7080.101s">And</a>  on the school department side, it increased by almost $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7083.603s">And</a>  this year, it looks like it's a projection of 1.8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7087.585s">The</a>  whole budget of the city looks like it's up almost $5 million this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7091.168s">So</a>  if there are new jobs and positions, if there are promotions that have taken place, I think it would be beneficial for the council to understand that rather than being told that, you know, this one got hired, that one got hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7101.054s">Plus</a>  the fact that it's a budgetary issue and a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7104.597s">And</a>  I just don't understand why all these titles and these positions are just not in the budget by name. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7111.301s">This</a>  is what the council asked for years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7113.482s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7119.206s">First</a>  of all, the names are in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7121.307s">The</a>  names of current employees are in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7123.248s">They've</a>  been in our budget for years, four or five years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7128.091s">That's</a>  the first thing.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7129.172s">Talking</a>  about the resolution's names, you didn't see, you didn't listen to me.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7132.694s">No,</a>  no, I'm quite familiar with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7134.095s">I'm</a>  also quite familiar with the attempted assault on a public employee that was, that was, what's the word I'm looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7144.562s">That</a>  a shooting subdued after, in that the Joint Terrorism Task Force actually ended up shooting someone <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7151.315s">in</a>  Boston, in Roslindale, and then they had another situation in Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7155.318s">And</a>  to blatantly put out this type of information, employees' addresses, and things of that nature, I don't think is prudent at this point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7163.485s">We</a>  all know it's public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7165.827s">But</a>  even addresses of employees, I believe, may not be public record under the public information law. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7172.193s">But</a>  with that being said, I can't support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7175.235s">The</a>  names are in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7176.536s">But</a>  asking for employees' addresses, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7178.885s">I</a>  think it stinks of nothing more than just wanting to have them for your own personal database, and there's no value to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7184.427s">And</a>  given the situations we're dealing with currently around the greater Boston area, with some serious criminal police matters in the neighboring community of Everett and Roslindale, and possibly even within the general immediate area, I don't think I'm comfortable asking for this type of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7204.974s">Police</a>  and fire are already protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7207.074s">They're</a>  not in the ward book. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7208.015s">They're</a>  not listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7209.114s">And</a>  I just don't feel comfortable doing this to any public employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7212.156s">If</a>  someone has a specific interest, they're more than welcome to come down here and get any applicable data through the Freedom of Information Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7219.119s">But</a>  I'm not supporting this for those reasons.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7221.0s">Point</a>  of clarification, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7222.882s">All</a>  set, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7224.843s">Yes,</a>  I'm all set.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7226.824s">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7231.626s">In</a>  the resolution after President's name, I'd be willing to take out address. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7235.809s">I'm</a>  okay with that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7237.518s">So,</a>  Mr. Clerk, we are striking from the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7241.761s">The</a>  word address. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7242.522s">The</a>  word address is attached to any employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7253.989s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7255.05s">Thank</a>  you, President De La Ruza. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7257.031s">I'd</a>  like to second this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7258.372s">I'd</a>  also like to possibly add a few things, if you don't mind, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7266.935s">be</a>  resolved that the listing of all new hires and employees' promotions, slump-sum raises, any lump-sum increases in salary.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7276.923s">I</a>  mean, I think what I have an issue with... For clarification, is that language in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7282.188s">I</a>  didn't see that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7283.369s">No,</a>  I'm asking that be added. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7284.53s">It</a>  says employee promotions to include lump-sum raises or any lump-sum increases in salaries.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7290.635s">So,</a>  as amended by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7293.989s">that</a>  any lump sum raises or increases in salaries be added to this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7304.154s">Is</a>  that all?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7305.134s">Yeah,</a>  I have very deep concern about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7308.836s">I've</a>  been getting calls from people from the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7315.559s">I</a>  mean, there's something going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7317.46s">We</a>  obviously need to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7319.161s">We</a>  spoke about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7320.612s">Six</a>  weeks ago, we didn't get any type of resolve or any type of answers from the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7326.594s">I</a>  think now we're hearing rumors that more money is needed to fund the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7331.196s">And</a>  what I've heard from people who are complaining to me is $20,000 raises to certain people, $6,000 raises, $7,000 raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7340.319s">And</a>  it's not across the board, it's just certain people, certain jobs, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7348.001s">Even</a>  the big job category, it's only half the people that are getting certain raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7351.622s">So</a>  I have concern and I thank Council Penton for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7355.684s">I</a>  think this is something we need before we can take a vote on the budget.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7358.965s">Has</a>  any of this been substantiated in public forum?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7363.066s">It</a>  was in our budget book. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7365.447s">I</a>  mean, yeah, I have it substantiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7369.108s">I</a>  have some of the data and I think we need a full accounting of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7374.878s">before</a>  we, you know, we are asked to approve more towards that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7379.199s">The</a>  teachers don't get supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7382.859s">I</a>  believe that they went around to the schools and they gave some classrooms one dry erase marker recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7388.28s">No</a>  joke, I got a call about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7390.201s">One</a>  dry erase marker, it went dead in about a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7393.061s">Teachers</a>  are paying for their own supplies, yet we're giving $20,000 raises, $6,000 raises to certain people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7400.142s">It's</a>  not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7401.342s">I</a>  don't see it much in the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7402.803s">You</a>  know, the city side seems to <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7405.09s">straightforward,</a>  1%, 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7405.97s">But</a>  what you hear in the school department, and then after this.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7411.213s">Just</a>  a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7412.854s">Has</a>  there been any actual raises in the same title, or was it promotions to different positions? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7417.896s">Because</a>  if there's a raise of $6,000 to $20,000, these are more, the people I've talked to in the school department said, most of them are putting in for different jobs, getting a promotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7428.721s">I</a>  mean, it's called anti-spiking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7430.842s">It's</a>  against the law.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7432.422s">That's</a>  what the resolution says.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7434.675s">Yeah,</a>  that's what I want to find out myself.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7436.595s">This</a>  is what we're going to find out.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7439.156s">Union</a>  people are getting the 1%, 2% raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7442.037s">And</a>  then after we speak about it on the council floor six weeks ago, I don't know how many more calls you got, but I get even more calls, people saying, yeah, that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7451.939s">And</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7452.619s">I</a>  mean, we need to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7455.02s">We</a>  haven't got anything from the school department letting us know who's gotten raises in the last two years like we asked for six weeks ago.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7464.991s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7465.531s">So</a>  you have that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7469.173s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7471.934s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7473.195s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7475.035s">Uh,</a>  I certainly understood the concerns of the Councilor Camuso had and where he was coming from in sharing the names and addresses of, uh, our public employees here in the city of Medford, especially those in the public safety field, but also those in the school system where around we've seen an increase in violence in our schools and an increase in violence against teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7490.623s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I think a proper negotiation and a proper middle ground would be that we strike person's name, we strike address as well, and we replace that with employee identification number. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7501.689s">That</a>  way we'll be able to tell if it's the same person or not based upon their employee identification number, which everybody in the city has, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7507.452s">So</a>  I'd like to move to amend the paper by striking the word name and striking the word address and replacing that with employee identification number.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7513.895s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to strike the word name and to add <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7518.467s">employee</a>  identification number. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7524.088s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7526.548s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7528.509s">I</a>  think this is a good resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7530.029s">I</a>  think with the Councilors Oskin and also Councilor Penter and Councilor Lungo is a listing of the new hires and employee promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7538.311s">This</a>  paper will be forwarded to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7541.231s">There's</a>  no reason why the legislative body cannot get a copy of a person's name, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7547.21s">I</a>  agree with the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7548.21s">I</a>  don't think we need an address, but a person's name and what their title is, and even what their responsibility is, and what the raise or promotion has been over the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7557.734s">I</a>  don't see a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7558.854s">I</a>  don't see why I can't get an employee's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7562.015s">We're</a>  not talking about adding this to the budget book. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7565.316s">We're</a>  talking about a separate document that would be sent to the council, and it would be confidential like all the other information we receive in the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7574.884s">and</a>  it would describe where these raises and where these promotions and who's getting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7580.007s">I</a>  don't see a problem with that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7581.127s">If</a>  I could just add a piece of information, it's all in our budget books right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7584.989s">It</a>  showed, even if you looked at the electrical department, just for instance, today, it showed length of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7590.973s">It</a>  showed step increases to those who got them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7593.754s">It</a>  showed job titles and their weekly salary.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7597.176s">It</a>  doesn't show length. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7598.056s">Where</a>  does it show length of service in the budget?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7600.672s">Councilor</a>  Penton. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7602.913s">Can</a>  you explain to the public the length of service that the assistant city engineer has? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7609.316s">Can</a>  you explain the years of service that they have and what the promotion is? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7612.757s">You</a>  can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7613.558s">All</a>  we're looking for is the new people that came on, brand new people.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7620.701s">And</a>  raises.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7621.241s">13</a>  is your 14 year budget and this one is the 15, 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7629.135s">It's</a>  the last budget in this budget.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7631.235s">Councilor</a>  Matz, did I cut you off? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7632.496s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7632.916s">No,</a>  I'm just saying I think it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7634.676s">I</a>  don't see why we can't get employees' names. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7637.657s">This</a>  is not for distribution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7638.897s">It's</a>  not going to go in the local paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7640.557s">It's</a>  coming to an elected body that's inquiring about what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7645.378s">So</a>  I don't see a problem with that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7647.759s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7650.82s">Councilor</a>  Camuso, did you want to speak on this?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7652.76s">No,</a>  just a roll call vote on this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7654.28s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7655.821s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7656.861s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7658.245s">I</a>  don't see why when the superintendent comes up, he can bring this with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7666.21s">He'll</a>  be here next week, all that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7668.131s">We're</a>  working out all those dates still with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7670.472s">Right,</a>  but we'll say when the school department, I mean, I would like to make this part of his budget when he comes in that night, rather than get it individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7681.978s">He</a>  can make it part of all the further departments coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7686.437s">doing</a>  that, to do that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7688.138s">So</a>  amended by Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7690.758s">Rather</a>  than to get a blanket statement, as the new departments come in, because we haven't done that many, let them point out their new hires and their raises and how long.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7704.662s">So</a>  that amended by Councilor Caraviello that the superintendent of schools make <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7710.99s">set</a>  presentation at our budget meeting.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7713.192s">And</a>  all the other department heads.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7714.492s">And</a>  all other department heads who meet with us next. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7722.438s">That</a>  all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7723.238s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7723.639s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7724.039s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7725.2s">And</a>  the schools has traditionally put retirements in the front of the budget as well as new hires in the front of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7732.785s">And</a>  jobs that have not been filled yet show the word vacant with a salary attached to it just because it hasn't been filled yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7738.729s">But</a>  to follow up on Councilor Knight's <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7741.671s">um,</a>  statement regarding teachers and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7745.336s">The</a>  more I think of it, I'm a little less apt to, uh, to support it even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7749.642s">Now</a>  in Danvers, we had a young teacher calling Ritza. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7754.849s">Oh,</a>  excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7756.891s">No,</a>  you didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7757.572s">This</a>  is, this is all departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7760.222s">be</a>  forward to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7761.623s">This</a>  is administrators, this is asking for secretaries and everyone else in the whole system wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7768.589s">And</a>  we had a situation and we didn't, but the city of Danvers had a situation where a student was following around a teacher, uh, around her place of home and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7778.738s">And</a>  we know the ultimately what happened there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7780.8s">So</a>  I don't feel comfortable with this at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7782.542s">It's</a>  in the budget, the same information that has always been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7785.724s">And,</a>  um,</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7787.777s">It's</a>  in there, it says school department in the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7790.058s">It</a>  says school department.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7790.738s">Councilor</a>  Penta, point of clarification.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7792.238s">It</a>  doesn't make any, what does that have, it has nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7794.739s">You're</a>  saying this about somebody here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7796.94s">You're</a>  saying something about somebody working here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7798.78s">Councilor,</a>  you're asking for people's addresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7801.441s">I'm</a>  not, I said I'm taking it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7803.141s">I</a>  took out the word address. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7805.062s">Why</a>  don't you listen? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7806.002s">I</a>  did hear you, and guess what, I still don't support it because it's- Well, you don't have to support it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7809.623s">And</a>  I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7810.283s">You're</a>  gonna be a real- Then don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7811.264s">You</a>  don't have to make a, forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7812.984s">You're</a>  gonna be a real good leader.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7815.265s">Easy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7817.26s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, you're all set?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7818.721s">I'm</a>  all set, Mr. Chair.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7820.102s">So</a>  on the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7824.566s">What's</a>  the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7825.567s">Is</a>  this two amendments on that?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7828.229s">Well,</a>  that's the motion.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7830.43s">Say</a>  it again? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7831.832s">Three.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7832.672s">One</a>  is strike addresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7833.693s">One</a>  is insert lump sums, raises, and increase in salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7839.718s">And</a>  the other one is by council on the night, to show the strike name and add employee IDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7847.851s">Can</a>  we separate those please?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7853.252s">That's</a>  four. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7858.473s">Councilor</a>  Knight withdraws his amendment.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7860.954s">I</a>  would just, if I could, through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7862.734s">Yes,</a>  you have Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7863.935s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7864.255s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7864.655s">Councilor</a>  Dela Cruz, President Dela Cruz. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7866.395s">So</a>  if I could further amend this, that we get the answers we want by June 19th, which is Friday and our Friday, Friday packet, that's almost two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7875.212s">I</a>  have a concern with the fact that the budget was already on the agenda at the beginning of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7879.153s">It</a>  was tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7880.354s">So</a>  I have a great feeling that we're going to be meeting with the superintendent's schools on Tuesday the 23rd at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7887.156s">and</a>  they're going to want us to vote on the budget at 7 p.m.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7889.977s">That's</a>  not a firm date. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7893.579s">That's</a>  been changed and it's a TBA on the school department because I want us to have ample time to have that budget in our hands, time to study it, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7903.801s">and</a>  ask proper questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7905.622s">Because</a>  we are not, we are not, as long as I'm president, accepting a budget and voting it that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7914.488s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7914.968s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7919.491s">I</a>  want to go on record that if that did happen, that I, you know, the school department would not have my vote for the budget.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7930.037s">So</a>  we have that all amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7931.178s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7931.478s">Martin,</a>  would you like to speak one? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7933.4s">more</a>  time.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7933.72s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7934.221s">I</a>  know I've talked a lot tonight, but, um, Jean Martin 10 coming street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7938.023s">And</a>  I want to support Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7939.144s">Cohen</a>  there because, um, I don't need to know anybody's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7943.407s">I</a>  don't know, need to know anybody's address as a member of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7947.089s">Unfortunately,</a>  the mayor is the person that's in charge of the school committee and it can look very biased. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7954.554s">I</a>  personally don't think that the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7956.765s">this</a>  is my personal opinion, should be in charge of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7960.107s">I</a>  think he's supposed to be above everybody, keeping the checks and balances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7964.109s">And</a>  whether it's the city side, why doesn't he be the chairman of the city council then? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7971.514s">So</a>  I think that it looks like it could be that favoritism happens under the covers of night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7979.939s">And</a>  it has the appearance of looking funny.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7986.837s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7988.438s">I</a>  think it's very important to point out that the school department's budget goes through a budget hearing process just like the city's budget does. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7993.742s">And</a>  the school committee actually puts the budget together and votes on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7996.665s">So</a>  there is a check and balance at that level as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=7999.307s">It's</a>  not just the mayor says do this and that's what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8001.769s">There</a>  is a check and balance at that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8003.25s">There</a>  is a legislative policymaking body at that level that does review these type of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8008.354s">So,</a>  you know, that's what the school committee is for, to set the school policy and to set the school department's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8013.832s">And</a>  they've gone through budget hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8015.093s">They</a>  had extensive budget debates, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8017.274s">I</a>  think they met five times in the month of May to go over their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8020.836s">So</a>  just to clarify the situation, the school committee has had an opportunity to review this budget, and the school committee has also had an opportunity to vote on it.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8028.72s">And</a>  I'm glad that they do that, but that is at a sub-level compared to the council and their responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8034.563s">But</a>  I do agree that that's one step in the process, and I'm glad. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8039.305s">Unfortunately,</a>  I want to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8043.121s">See,</a>  the person checking is on the committee, and it just, it smacks of kind of an, you know, it could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8050.469s">And</a>  I'm not saying that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8051.831s">I'm</a>  not saying that anybody's, you know, patting their, you know, bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8055.375s">I'm</a>  not saying that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8056.796s">But</a>  I am saying it gives the appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8058.758s">And</a>  I think that we should, there is nothing wrong with asking those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8062.542s">Do</a>  I, Jean Martin, need to know the teacher's name and how much, I don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8066.605s">But</a>  as long as I am confident that other people are making sure that those checks, that check, if I can have confidence in you guys that you're doing that check, then I don't need to know, because I believe in you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8078.596s">And</a>  so I just, that has to do with the role of government in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8082.9s">Which,</a>  you know, I have to comment on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8085.601s">But</a>  I thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8086.622s">But</a>  again, I want to support Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8088.322s">Cohen,</a>  only because she's asking those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8090.143s">And</a>  transparency, it doesn't have to be personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8093.425s">I</a>  don't have to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8094.545s">But</a>  I need to know that the government is working transparently. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8098.107s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8098.787s">Thank</a>  you, Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8100.047s">So,</a>  Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8104.289s">No,</a>  because the Councilor withdrew it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8109.723s">Your</a>  amendment and Councilor Caraviello's amendment and Councilor Mongo's amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8113.644s">Lump</a>  sums.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8115.205s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8116.245s">It's</a>  contrary so that's why I said it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8119.666s">I</a>  want this ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8120.546s">I</a>  don't want to wait.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8123.167s">Ask</a>  for it during the budget time.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8125.708s">Fine.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8125.928s">So</a>  you're moving this one?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8129.709s">Are</a>  we alright with the way it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8131.85s">Do</a>  we need to do any separations? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8133.29s">No?</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8133.97s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8134.911s">Because</a>  this is separate from the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8138.032s">Put</a>  it in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8138.592s">Let's</a>  figure out what we want to do.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8140.658s">Why</a>  wouldn't you want to get it ahead of time?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8144.519s">I'm</a>  more comfortable to say, when the department head comes in, these are the questions we can ask them that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8151.602s">There's</a>  no need to get it ahead of time.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8152.902s">If</a>  you're going to ask that night, he's not prepared for it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8155.163s">How</a>  is he going to answer that night? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8157.644s">The</a>  president will make him prepared.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8158.744s">I'm</a>  going to move on my end first. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8162.685s">Roll</a>  call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8164.286s">Roll</a>  call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8165.246s">On</a>  the resolution minus the word address.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8168.027s">with</a>  council on those amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8169.468s">So</a>  we're going to separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8170.848s">Is</a>  there a motion to separate, uh, out councilor Caraviello's? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8176.211s">You</a>  can separate them out if you want.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8177.272s">The</a>  contrary items, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8179.193s">So</a>  I think we'd have to separate, separate councilor Caraviello's amendment as their contrary. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8183.475s">So</a>  there'd have to be, there'd have to be seven.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8185.536s">So</a>  the, uh, councilor Caraviello's first. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8192.019s">On,</a>  uh, we asked for a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8195.18s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8199.834s">Do</a>  we have a motion to sever? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8202.076s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8202.936s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8203.637s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8203.977s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8204.938s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8206.499s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8208.681s">So</a>  the two is seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8209.742s">So</a>  we'll take Councilor Caraviello's amendment, which was? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8213.785s">The</a>  superintendent and the department heads provide this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8221.511s">At</a>  the time of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8222.512s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8223.373s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8225.334s">On</a>  that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8228.945s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could, uh, you know, if we're going to do it that way and get it that night, and if they come not prepared with that information, then what recourse do we have as a council? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8242.197s">Should</a>  we say also within the amendment that we will cancel that particular department heads budget meeting for that night if they don't come prepared? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8250.464s">Yes,</a>  I would, I would support that will be called.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8255.124s">If</a>  they don't have proper information, supporting documents.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8258.545s">We</a>  can't support the budget that night on that particular department.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8264.268s">I</a>  don't think that's a wise move. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8266.028s">I</a>  would support that, but I wouldn't support just a blanket, having them say they're going to come in with something and then they don't appear. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8273.711s">And</a>  we still go through the process because that defeats the purpose of us getting together and deliberating on items. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8280.294s">So</a>  if you want to amend yours, I'll amend it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8283.175s">So</a>  that, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8284.805s">If</a>  they're not prepared, then their budget won't get talked about that, and it'll get pushed to another night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8289.547s">We'll</a>  push it to another night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8291.507s">I</a>  mean, we're not talking about a ridiculous amount of people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8296.209s">If</a>  the department head doesn't know the two or three people that have come on, then... Yeah.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8303.792s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8304.432s">So,</a>  Councilor Caraviello has amended his amendment further. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8312.314s">So,</a>  we're ready for a vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8314.94s">Councilor</a>  Penta on that motion.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8316.46s">Rick,</a>  let me ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8317.821s">We</a>  got this book ahead of time to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8320.621s">You're</a>  going to be getting it on that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8322.861s">This</a>  resolution has given you ample time to get it, review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8326.402s">And</a>  so when that night comes and then you can just school can be school committees being tonight to do their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8332.243s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8332.723s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8333.703s">I</a>  can't wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8334.103s">I</a>  mean, council, we're not, we're not talking about hundreds of people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8337.144s">We're</a>  not talking about hundreds of people talking about how many people we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8342.505s">It</a>  may be 20 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8343.557s">throughout</a>  the whole school department and the city department? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8345.538s">I</a>  mean.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8347.659s">Well,</a>  this is both city and school.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8349.18s">City</a>  and school. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8349.74s">I</a>  mean, I would say, I mean, how many people will say what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8352.361s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8354.931s">There's</a>  no reason why the superintendent can't supply that information that night when he comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8363.497s">The</a>  city's already in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8364.998s">As</a>  the department heads come forward, they'll bring it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8370.582s">And</a>  if they don't have it, then we'll pass on their budget for that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8374.405s">If</a>  that's what your language reads, I support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8376.463s">The</a>  language is, the information on the city side, we have it already. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8380.046s">But</a>  let's say, the department head can just bring it to our attention, those few people that are on there.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8385.371s">It's</a>  not that big of a deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8386.552s">So</a>  on the motion of council, Chair Powell, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8390.456s">On</a>  that motion, if I understand that correctly, but can we get that as a separate document? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8395.72s">So</a>  it's not inclusive in the budget, it's included, but as a separate document. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8399.764s">In</a>  other words,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8401.445s">No,</a>  there's no need of that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8404.206s">Motion</a>  to table is undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8406.687s">Roll</a>  call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8407.748s">Roll</a>  call vote to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8412.469s">Are</a>  we tabling this Councilor Caraviello's separated amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8417.852s">Motion</a>  to table the whole paper.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8672.381s">Mr.</a>  President, over this past weekend and up until this afternoon, I've received a decent amount of emails as it relates to Rights Pond, the new change in the rules and the regulations as it relates to what is taking place up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8688.65s">And</a>  that has prompted a, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8690.632s">A</a>  flurry of concern from not only senior citizens, but bike enthusiasts, and from people who now have enjoyed Wrights Pond for so many years, but now really question what is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8704.154s">The</a>  fee has now gone up from $35 to $50 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8708.555s">And</a>  the two passes that normally would be given on an annual basis have not, or is not being given. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8715.577s">And</a>  that includes the separate, the walk-in passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8718.755s">Now</a>  you have to pay for those separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8721.396s">So</a>  if somebody shows up on foot or by a bike or by public transit, they're not going to be able to get in because apparently there's going to be a fee structure that's going to stop them from getting in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8734.159s">Again,</a>  I think what we're looking at, from my understanding from speaking with folks, this was from the administration handed down from the budget director to the parking board, parking commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8747.503s">I</a>  mean, strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8749.103s">Is</a>  it the park board? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8750.184s">Yeah,</a>  the park board, I guess, as it relates to what's going on up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8754.586s">And</a>  it's just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8756.106s">You</a>  know, this city gets hit on all kinds of taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8759.868s">Forget</a>  the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8761.149s">You</a>  get the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8761.849s">You</a>  get the sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8763.53s">You've</a>  got your real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8765.551s">You've</a>  got your income tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8766.972s">And</a>  you get your meals tax and room occupancy tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8770.774s">This</a>  is just a simple little thing that only is in our community for about eight to nine weeks a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8777.077s">Rights</a>  pawned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8778.989s">Wrights</a>  Point is not supposed to be a moneymaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8781.251s">Wrights</a>  Point is supposed to be one of these simple little places that we as a community, the people who live in this city, have an opportunity to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8788.176s">Whether</a>  you're a senior citizen, a mom with two or three kids, you want to spend your family and you go up there for the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8793.079s">It's</a>  a Medford home-based luxury, so to speak, that a lot of other cities and towns don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8800.265s">And</a>  now to go from $25 to $35, and now you're up to $50 per person or per car, whatever the sticker is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8808.112s">And</a>  now they're taking away the walk-in passes, and they're paying separate for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8813.315s">And</a>  I know there's a concern I see. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8814.596s">I</a>  think Bruce Kulick, is he still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8818.499s">He</a>  had a concern as a bike enthusiast, because he's the chairperson of the Bike Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8825.003s">They</a>  have major concerns over this, because now all these people are going to be charged to go up there and do something, eight to nine weeks out of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8833.028s">Last</a>  year, they opened by the skin of their tooth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8836.786s">play</a>  equipment, I believe, up there at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8839.807s">And,</a>  you know, it's just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8842.248s">The</a>  city should not be charging people for every single thing to try to make money on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8847.17s">There's</a>  a few things you got to just pony up and say, hey, it's eight to nine weeks out of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8851.291s">And</a>  sometimes you're not even going to get a good day if the weather was bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8854.672s">So</a>  that cuts down the season short. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8857.113s">But</a>  it's just unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8859.714s">And</a>  I think hopefully there's people here that want to speak on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8862.885s">But</a>  I just think the park commission, I think they meet on the 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8866.148s">It's</a>  a week from this Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8868.85s">I</a>  believe that's what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8870.672s">And</a>  it's at six o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8871.973s">And</a>  I would hope people would just go there and express to them that their concern, you know, it's rights pawned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8878.939s">It's</a>  a, it's a little place for moms to bring their kids and maybe dad's on the weekend or grandparents or friends that might want to come, but charging and keep charging and charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8890.313s">You're</a>  going to put people out of business for wanting to go there and enjoy something that we should be able to enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8895.596s">You</a>  know, once upon a time, you didn't have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8898.238s">And</a>  now they want to charge you to keep you out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8901.459s">So</a>  it doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8902.94s">So</a>  the resolution, Mr. President, I know those people want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8906.842s">I'd</a>  like to have it forwarded to the, I believe it's the park board, the park commission, excuse me, that they review the new fee structure that they have for this year and give consideration that the rate increases <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8919.73s">are</a>  just unfair to the citizens of Medford.</p>

    <p>[81H3OXzw2Ec_SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8925.072s">Linda</a>  Julia, 25 Edward Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8927.773s">I</a>  thank Councilor Pinta for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8933.095s">As</a>  he says, there's been quite a bit of talk about this this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8936.517s">I</a>  went to get my park pass for my family, as I do every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8940.058s">I</a>  was quite surprised to discover that the fees had been raised so dramatically, and also to see that the car pass no longer includes a walk-in pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8948.548s">My</a>  family very often drives in the pond, because we don't live particularly close. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8952.591s">But</a>  occasionally, we will make a bike trip, or we'll visit a friend who lives nearby, and then we'll walk into the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8959.055s">Under</a>  the new structure, we would have to pay twice as much this year as we have in previous years in order to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8964.639s">The</a>  car passes go from $35 to $50, and walking passes have gone from $5 to $20. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8969.602s">It's</a>  a 400% increase in walking passes, and they're no longer included with the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8977.537s">in</a>  direct opposition to Medford's goals to be a greener city, to encourage people to bike, to walk, to use their cars less often. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8985.962s">I</a>  now feel that in order to be environmentally responsible, I must pay a fee for the privilege, and that seems unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=8994.428s">I</a>  do understand that there have been some budget concerns, and certainly it takes money to maintain the pond, to pay the employees there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9001.955s">But</a>  I have to believe there's a better way to do this that's not such a huge increase in one shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9007.097s">That</a>  is a better system that better meets the needs of both individuals and families who would like to use this amazing resource in our town. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9016.459s">I</a>  don't know what can be done about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9017.96s">I</a>  don't know how this decision was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9020.38s">I've</a>  been corresponding with the recreation coordinators. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9023.018s">They</a>  tell me that they're as surprised as I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9025.299s">They</a>  don't know how this happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9026.92s">They</a>  don't control the brochures. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9028.421s">The</a>  people in the recreation department do not know how this happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9031.822s">So</a>  I don't know who does know, but perhaps somebody can get to the bottom of it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9037.845s">But</a>  as a point of clarification, I was told it came from the prior budget director, and that was directed at the end of last year's season to raise the rates for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9047.87s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9049.231s">Right,</a>  wrong, or indifferent, something happened because these rates got raised.</p>

    <p>[81H3OXzw2Ec_SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9052.55s">Yes,</a>  well, I do understand why rates might need to be raised, but I think the manner in which they were raised and the system of the fees is not really a workable one.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9061.012s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9061.412s">We</a>  will do our best to find out how those rates came about.</p>

    <p>[81H3OXzw2Ec_SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9064.913s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9065.574s">And</a>  reduce them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9069.015s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9070.215s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9071.715s">And</a>  I can certainly see the frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9073.716s">And</a>  I think that a 100% increase in any fee that we have here in the city is far too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9078.671s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I support the resolution to have the park board take a look at their fee structure and to make accommodations. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9084.653s">You</a>  know, a 5% increase, something like that, might seem a little bit more reasonable than a 100% increase at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9090.694s">I</a>  support the resolution that Councilor Penter has put forward in terms of having them take a look and revisiting the fee structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9097.816s">And,</a>  you know, I thank them for bringing the resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9099.936s">I</a>  think that it's problematic to have city government shy people away from using our recreational areas when we have <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9108.052s">so</a>  many problems in our community with drug abuse, with childhood obesity and the like, that we want people to take advantage of these resources, not be deterred, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9116.576s">So,</a>  with that being said, I appreciate your leadership on this, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9121.118s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9121.458s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9123.506s">Me</a>  again. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9124.606s">Debbie</a>  Steiner Hayes, 29 Damon Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9127.908s">So</a>  I came for the library, kind of interested in the parking meters, and I stayed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9132.529s">We're</a>  glad you stayed with us all evening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9133.79s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9134.23s">And</a>  I'm here to close the night with Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9137.231s">So</a>  I moved to Medford, I don't know, 25, 30 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9143.013s">Once</a>  I found out Medford had Wright's Pond, I have not left. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9146.334s">And</a>  you're stuck with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9148.695s">I</a>  love Wrights Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9150.236s">It</a>  is the jewel of Medford, absolutely, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9154.399s">When</a>  I first came here, I think a parking pass was $30 a year to go, absolutely, then it turned to $35, and we're talking about a 400% increase from $5 to $20 for walk and pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9167.587s">I</a>  understand that it costs money to be at Wrights Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9170.57s">There's</a>  a couple of issues I just want to make sure that if you're not aware of, that you should be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9175.093s">Number</a>  one, Wrights Pond is only open from July 4th weekend, somewhere around there, till Labor Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9184.68s">Also</a>  at Wrights Pond, you can only be there until a half an hour before sunset, so July is awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9190.405s">By</a>  the time you get to the middle of August, you have to be out of there by 6, 615. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9195.389s">I</a>  know Marie Cassidy used to do <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9198.472s">concerts</a>  at Wrights Pond on Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9200.553s">This</a>  year she's moved her August concerts to the Condon Shell just because it wasn't fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9206.117s">They</a>  were kicking us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9207.518s">Like</a>  the minute the concert ended, they were kicking people out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9211.4s">Again,</a>  was at MFN this morning, 20 new families in there with kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9215.863s">We</a>  are getting tons and tons of new families. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9218.585s">It's</a>  just, it's not fun to be kicked out of Wrights Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9222.067s">The</a>  kids weren't even swimming in the week we were getting kicked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9226.666s">This</a>  increase is sort of a hard nut to swallow. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9230.351s">I</a>  can see paying 50 bucks a year, I'm okay with that, but I do think that one should then get thrown in the bus, I mean the walk-in pass, because instead of <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9241.594s">paying</a>  $20, you should say, look, if you want both, we're going to charge you $50. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9245.996s">If</a>  you want a walk-in pass because you don't have a car, then we're going to give you a walk-in pass for four people or eight people or whatever, however many people you need, and we'll charge you $50 for that, or maybe even $40, a little bit less, because if someone doesn't have a car, they probably can't afford $50. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9259.687s">to</a>  come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9260.168s">I</a>  mean, we're talking that the pond is only open for about seven weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9264.213s">And</a>  out of those seven weeks, they don't have, I mean, this time of year, granted it's raining, but it was, you know, 80 degrees today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9271.484s">We</a>  could have gone swimming there after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9273.226s">The</a>  kids could have gone swimming. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9274.207s">We</a>  definitely can go swimming on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9276.38s">I</a>  get it that we want to hire our high school people, and so they're in school, so you can't have it open during the week, but I don't understand why we can't have it open on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9285.569s">It</a>  is a beautiful, I mean, between me and you, sorry, I know I'm on TV, but I snuck in there last week and went swimming. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9292.156s">It</a>  was gorgeous. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9293.397s">It</a>  is beautiful, like, it's swimmable now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9296.5s">And</a>  for us not to use it from May till July is just stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9301.625s">And</a>  yes, they did take out the playground, but you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9304.708s">He</a>  did put in a new playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9305.949s">The</a>  one that was at McNally then got put there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9308.111s">So</a>  there is a playground there, just for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9312.976s">It</a>  could be, yeah, there's a nice playground there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9315.498s">It's</a>  a beautiful, you know, it's the one that was at McNally. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9317.36s">He</a>  cleaned it up and he put it back in there all nice and spiffy clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9321.588s">So</a>  I'm sorry for rambling, but it's a beautiful place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9325.109s">We</a>  should be able to use it absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9327.909s">If</a>  people want a bike in there, I mean, the whole reason why we have to pay for parking is because it's a small parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9333.01s">I</a>  get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9333.41s">But</a>  I actually don't understand why you would have to pay for having a bike in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9337.591s">That</a>  to me makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9339.311s">Anyway,</a>  that's my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9340.911s">Have</a>  a nice day.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9389.816s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9390.777s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9391.817s">I</a>  certainly don't like to see any fees raised, as all of us do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9396.061s">I'd</a>  like to know, when did the park board actually increase this? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9401.085s">And</a>  if we could get the minutes of the park board, because they're the statutory authority that actually approved this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9407.57s">Secondly,</a>  I'd like to find out when the last increase was. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9411.626s">Because</a>  I'm sure if it was done three years ago, if we could also get the minutes from the three years ago when it was increased by the park board as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9421.597s">So</a>  we can just take a look at it, also see what it's costing to run it now as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9425.12s">I</a>  know that they were looking a few years ago to possibly put one of the fountains to keep the water running like Felsmere Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9432.61s">And</a>  I'm wondering if, uh, if that's still in the plans and if this is to offset the cost of some of that, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9437.774s">So</a>  if we could ask the park board, um, board when they did it and what the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9443.659s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9445.02s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9446.862s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9448.143s">And</a>  just to touch upon, I'm, I'm adamantly opposed to any increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9452.306s">I</a>  think that could be offset in a number of ways within the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9456.008s">But</a>  one of the big criticisms I hear from parents in the community is that there's a lack of places to take your children, as Councilor Knight mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9465.572s">Years</a>  ago, we used to have a movie theater, a drive-in theater, a bowling alley. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9468.893s">We</a>  had a lot of different things in the community, and for youngsters and, you know, teenagers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9475.716s">And</a>  to say that we're going to have an area which is a hidden gem in our community and raise the fees that, you know, you don't know what people's circumstances are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9484.445s">This</a>  might price people out from going up to a place that I believe everyone in the community should have access to. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9491.408s">And</a>  no matter what your financial ability is, everyone should have access to this particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9496.991s">There's</a>  no reason why we can't use the area that sells water and juice and snacks up there to offset any rate increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9505.995s">I</a>  realize there's an expense to running an area like this, but there's no reason why the city can't get creative <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9513.903s">The</a>  mayor knows how, when he needs to go to wind to get $100,000 for a peace garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9519.224s">He</a>  knows quickly how to get that money, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9522.185s">But</a>  when it comes to offsetting rates for our own residents that use an area in our city, they just raise the rate without any hesitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9533.568s">So,</a>  I think this could be done internally, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9538.569s">There's</a>  no reason to raise the rates, especially, as was mentioned, a 400 percent increase <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9543.797s">even</a>  though it's only 5 to 20, that's unheard of in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9549.0s">And</a>  the other issue about taking your bike and discouraging people from wanting to take their bike up there, that's a huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9557.366s">The</a>  mayor recently came out with his big press release, how he's going to be more bike friendly, and he's going to have bike stations around the community, and he's going to create bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9566.311s">But</a>  now he wants anyone taking a bike up to Wrights Pawn, charge you extra money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9570.721s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9572.882s">There's</a>  no thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9573.682s">There's</a>  no vision in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9575.602s">And</a>  it just seems like issues are thrown out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9578.543s">And</a>  really, there's no cohesion that puts all this together to make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9583.624s">And</a>  so I support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9585.104s">I</a>  thank Councilor Penta for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9588.165s">And</a>  I support finding out how these got raised and sending a message back to the administration and the park board that we are not in support of this, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9598.872s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Markswell. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9599.873s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9600.934s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9601.334s">I'd</a>  also like to, uh, Councilor Penta doesn't mind, um, ask for an answer to back from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9606.719s">I</a>  know they were looking at, uh, a year ago when I proposed it, uh, sprinkle a park and it's that time of year again. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9612.283s">And</a>  the parents at the Brooks school the other day were asking, Hey, is that going to come to fruition? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9615.686s">They</a>  heard about the dog park and this and that, and they're not seeing that get off the ground as quick as some people would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9621.451s">Um,</a>  but the sprinkle a park, I know there's a huge, huge, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9626.226s">portion</a>  of our community that would love a sprinkler park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9628.548s">Malden</a>  just opened up another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9631.01s">They</a>  had the ribbon cutting a few days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9634.692s">So</a>  if we could get an update, because I think that that's something that will be incredible in this community, a sprinkler park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9642.478s">And</a>  it's something that doesn't cost a fee to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9645.44s">And</a>  just the parents absolutely love them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9648.863s">People</a>  actually leave Medford to go to the DCR one over in the Belmont line. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9653.206s">That's</a>  how popular they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9655.417s">Thank</a>  you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9656.037s">And</a>  I'd hate to be behind Malden on anything.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9658.018s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9661.059s">Name</a>  and address of the record, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9661.999s">My</a>  name is Anthony D'Antonio, 12 years in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9668.681s">I</a>  have an affinity with Wrights Pond because I used to go there when I was younger, and there was never a fee to pay to get into Wrights Pond, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9677.544s">And</a>  if there was a fee, we always would have gone in over by Eagle Rock to get in there and hop the fence or whatever we had to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9684.18s">In</a>  1926, when my family moved out from the north end by way of Italy, we built one of the first houses on Elm Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9691.064s">As</a>  you come up and just take the right to Elm Street, number 7 Elm Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9695.226s">I</a>  have pictures of my grandfather, my uncles, my father, boating, fishing, right up in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9702.911s">And</a>  it's always a place where my grandfather used to take me when I was a little boy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9708.824s">I</a>  am so opposed to these fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9710.525s">I</a>  am opposed to having to pay for this because this should be something like an item in the budget that maintenance is taking care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9717.667s">There</a>  are also some ideas that you might want to put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9722.189s">Fishing</a>  tournaments like they have at Horn Pond, you get the state to come in, you get them to stock it, you run a couple of tournaments. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9727.851s">The</a>  state will not come in and stock the ponds.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9729.772s">Why,</a>  is it that polluted? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9731.072s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9731.592s">It's</a>  because if the state stocks the pond, that means it becomes open to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9736.791s">So</a>  currently it's only for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9738.972s">So</a>  that's, I did look into that some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9741.953s">They</a>  were gonna come in, but when they found out that it wasn't open to all residents, then they don't stock the pond.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9749.396s">Yeah,</a>  good idea.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9752.578s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry, Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9754.318s">But</a>  the city can stock it themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9755.659s">The</a>  city can stock the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9756.459s">So</a>  we can buy the fish and stock it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9758.02s">There's</a>  a lot of fish people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9759.5s">I</a>  did look into that with the state a couple of years ago, and they would have stocked it, but it's a city resource, not a state resource.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9768.617s">But,</a>  in spite of the fact that I don't agree with any of the increases and I think that residents should have some kind of an I.D. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9775.822s">Card</a>  maybe at a very minimum cost, I think that the least we should do is offer the membership free to our veterans and to our senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9786.37s">And,</a>  is this, is it A.D.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9789.352s">Compliant</a>  up there? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9794.512s">to</a>  expand that in any way, shape or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9797.294s">With</a>  the bathrooms, restrooms and everything to be an ADA certified?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9802.277s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9802.717s">We</a>  have that bike to get the, that car to get people into the water.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9807.66s">I</a>  just think it's a great resource.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9813.263s">It</a>  is the best resource in this community.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9814.924s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9815.444s">And</a>  it's, you know, like we have the mystic river, but we haven't taken advantage of anything on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9821.208s">And,</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9821.81s">No</a>  reason during the summertime, one night a week, a couple nights a month, do a movie night up there or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9828.612s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9830.253s">It</a>  can be open until nine o'clock, once or twice a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9832.833s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9833.133s">And</a>  do something up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9833.894s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9835.294s">Barbecue,</a>  movies for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9837.175s">Why</a>  not? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9837.895s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9838.755s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9841.076s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[bq-gVu-g8qk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9843.417s">Elise</a>  Burias, 38 Lawson Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9845.457s">I'll</a>  be brief because most of this has been covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9848.422s">We</a>  live a five-minute walk from Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9850.163s">My</a>  family and I have two little kids, and so we'll hop over for 20 minutes after supper, and we just, we make great use of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9856.285s">And</a>  so I'm happy to contribute to having it run. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9859.666s">I</a>  don't have a problem paying for a pass, but the jump from five to 20 just seemed really huge without any explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9866.849s">So</a>  I guess my only, my biggest request is it would be nice if there could be some transparency, and I think the community would be more open to these sorts of things if we were <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9876.542s">sort</a>  of let in on the process and just told why it was necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9881.326s">I</a>  had something else, but I lost it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9882.707s">Anyway,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9884.528s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9884.988s">Councilor</a>  Pater. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9887.45s">Did</a>  you already buy the pass?</p>

    <p>[bq-gVu-g8qk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9888.851s">I</a>  have not bought the pass this year yet.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9890.553s">So</a>  is the pass singular, or do you have to buy one for each person?</p>

    <p>[bq-gVu-g8qk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9893.875s">Oh,</a>  the $5 walk-in pass covers from one to three people, and so in the past what we would do is my husband and I would each buy one, and then if we had <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9900.954s">Friends</a>  along with us, as with young kids, you typically do have a couple of friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9904.336s">And</a>  we know people outside of Medford, too.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9906.918s">So</a>  prior to this rate increase, if you got your permit last year, you also got two walk-in passes.</p>

    <p>[bq-gVu-g8qk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9914.042s">Oh,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9914.442s">I</a>  only bought a walk-in pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9915.843s">I</a>  live a five-minute walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9916.904s">I</a>  would never go through.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9917.964s">But</a>  if you did last year, you bought the $35 permit, you would get the two walk-in passes.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9924.028s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9924.188s">You</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[bq-gVu-g8qk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9924.908s">I</a>  only walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9926.389s">It</a>  doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9927.27s">I</a>  know the other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9927.93s">There</a>  have been people who have said.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9929.671s">One</a>  person at a time with a rail.</p>

    <p>[bq-gVu-g8qk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9930.89s">publicly</a>  on some of the Medford lists that this will be enough to make them not come to the pond this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9936.234s">Because</a>  if you're a working parent, to go for the 20 minutes or half an hour after work, it doesn't make a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9942.839s">So</a>  maybe they'll make it a few times. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9944.42s">And</a>  for $35, maybe they were willing to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9947.543s">But</a>  for $50, just the added, they're not going to make it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9950.925s">No</a>  matter how you look at Wright's Pond, because they have to pay for the lifeguards, and they have to pay for all the support. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9954.889s">To</a>  me, it's like a business deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9956.31s">It's</a>  a loss leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9957.491s">But</a>  it's a good loss leader for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9959.882s">Because</a>  if you're ever going to try to think and make money on that, and then you're going to just keep raising this rate each and every year, and it really doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9966.349s">And</a>  it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9966.75s">No,</a>  I understand.</p>

    <p>[bq-gVu-g8qk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9967.15s">And</a>  I just wanted to be clear that, as a citizen, I am willing to contribute back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9970.414s">And</a>  we're fortunate in my family that we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9972.476s">But</a>  again, the lack of transparency in the community is difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9976.541s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9976.781s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9979.224s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9983.882s">So</a>  last year, the pass was $35 to drive in and $5 to walk in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9991.527s">So</a>  because I don't live five minutes away, I would buy one of each. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9995.209s">I</a>  would buy a drive-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9998.792s">There</a>  was never a free walk-in.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10003.835s">They're</a>  20.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10005.096s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10006.386s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10006.886s">But</a>  you didn't get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10008.187s">You</a>  had to pay for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10009.508s">So</a>  I would pay $45 and have a driving pass for $35 plus two $5 walking passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10020.214s">I</a>  would end up with two passes to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10023.976s">I</a>  would pay $45 and be able to drive or bike in with my kid.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10028.118s">So</a>  to do the same thing this year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10030.359s">It's</a>  going to cost me $70.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10032.698s">$70</a>  more.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10033.398s">No,</a>  not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10034.078s">$70</a>  total. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10036.28s">Oh,</a>  45.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10036.94s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10037.34s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10037.901s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10038.661s">15,</a>  three times.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10039.942s">Almost</a>  double. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10040.582s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10041.563s">Uh,</a>  the other thing is, is just FYI, there's tough school, which has also gone up significantly this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10047.326s">Um,</a>  I, I just thought on Facebook while I was waiting, I don't remember the exact numbers, but that's gone up significantly this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10053.93s">Then</a>  I don't really understand why that's quite so high. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10057.353s">And</a>  I'm glad to see, thank you all, that McNally Park is going to open this Friday with hot dogs and ice cream. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10065.419s">Woo-hoo.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10066.319s">But</a>  it's been ready for weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10068.161s">And</a>  it's finally, because there was an opening, it will be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10072.463s">The</a>  other park that is a new park is Magoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10077.687s">And</a>  that still is yet to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10079.288s">I</a>  mean, it's a beautiful park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10080.789s">It's</a>  90% done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10082.357s">The</a>  kids are drooling to get in there.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10084.038s">It's</a>  going to be... That's next on our agenda.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10086.22s">Oh,</a>  it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10086.92s">I</a>  should stay and talk about that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10088.962s">You</a>  want to stay a little longer with us?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10090.803s">Are</a>  you really going to talk about the parks next?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10094.166s">If</a>  you want to stay a little longer, you can stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10096.367s">We'll</a>  talk about that next. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10097.708s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10098.349s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10099.77s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10101.051s">I</a>  think that the question before us is what the prior fee structure was for Wrights Pond, what the current fee structure for Wrights Pond is, and why these changes were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10108.897s">I</a>  think that's the question that we're looking to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10111.809s">With</a>  that being said, I think that we pretty much know more about the Rights Upon Pass program now than we've ever known before in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10118.552s">I</a>  think it's time to get the question answered, Mr. President, so I'd move for approval on the paper.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10121.894s">One</a>  last question to the real now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10123.174s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[81H3OXzw2Ec_SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10124.475s">Linda</a>  Julian, 25 Edward Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10126.596s">I</a>  will try to be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10128.096s">I</a>  am quite certain that the car passes included a walking pass last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10132.178s">I</a>  did receive one in the envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10133.799s">I</a>  did not pay extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10135.099s">I'm</a>  sure we can look this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10137.458s">Just</a>  briefly to elaborate on what Elise said, I have also heard many people say, in this case, I can't afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10144.582s">I</a>  won't do it this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10146.023s">And</a>  just to pull your heart strings, yesterday my husband and I were discussing this fee increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10151.706s">Our</a>  five-year-old daughter overheard us, and she started crying in the back seat because she loves that pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10156.528s">And</a>  she thought this meant we couldn't go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10158.789s">And,</a>  you know, I will find the money, and I will go, because I'm not going to see my little girl cry. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10162.791s">But</a>  not everybody is in the position to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10165.06s">And</a>  I don't want to see children crying over Medford because they don't get to go swimming this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10169.824s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10170.324s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10171.845s">On</a>  Councilor Penter's motion motion is be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10181.252s">Be</a>  it resolved that the matter of the rights borne guidelines for this year regarding fees and walking passes be discussed and forwarded to the park board for <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10189.432s">Resolution,</a>  I think we have a couple of add-ons there.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10192.555s">Senator,</a>  the park board can revisit the fixed schedule.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10198.961s">Yeah,</a>  let's get an answer to the question, then we can find out what- Yeah, there may be a reason why.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10220.988s">The</a>  suggestion is you've heard it from enough people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10223.491s">The</a>  rate has gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10226.073s">It's</a>  gone up significantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10227.874s">Well,</a>  you're going to get all the information that's going to tell you this is the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10231.377s">And</a>  it's probably going to say, well, it's costing us money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10234.8s">We</a>  know it's costing us money and we know that the city is not making money on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10238.863s">But</a>  Wright's point is not to be made a place to have money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10242.426s">You</a>  know, that lady, the last lady who just came up, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10245.322s">When</a>  she hears a little girl in her car turn around and say that she thinks she may not be able to go to Wrightsbarn because it costs too much, you can't explain that to a 7, 8, or a 9-year-old kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10254.287s">We're</a>  not going to say your city doesn't want you to go there because you don't have enough money in your pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10259.17s">The</a>  park board, the park commission should realize, listen, we have four or five parks all summer long and that you put park supervisors in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10267.554s">We</a>  don't charge a citizen to go into any of those parks to participate in any of those programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10272.983s">And</a>  they're there all day long, and they don't have to worry about a time curfew. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10277.187s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10277.848s">So</a>  the difference between that and Rights Pond, there's no difference.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10288.168s">the</a>  recreational councils at our park. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10289.749s">We</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10290.53s">That's</a>  why we're asking the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10292.992s">That's</a>  why we're asking the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10295.735s">We</a>  tell them to reduce the fee structure, then what do they say to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10299.438s">They</a>  say, okay, we'll reduce the fee structure, but they're no more parkway constructors. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10302.901s">Why</a>  did the increase happen is the question that needs to be answered first and foremost. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10306.565s">I</a>  don't support the increase, but I just want to know why it happened and where the money is going.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10311.248s">If</a>  the mayor has the wherewithal to go out and get from Cummings $100,000, $150,000, he had the wherewithal to go to Wynn's Casino and get $100,000 for his pet projects, but he's not that concerned about the kids in this community in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10325.526s">that</a>  we have to keep raising the fees to try to maintain them, well that is not good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10331.013s">That's</a>  poor government and that doesn't work for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10334.177s">We</a>  all know you're not going to make money at Wrights Pond and you're not going to make money in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10338.724s">There</a>  are some things you're just going to have to lose money on and you eat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10342.068s">It's</a>  a lost leader in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10343.805s">but</a>  you're making the people come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10345.186s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10346.747s">You've</a>  got to give them something to want to come here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10349.41s">He</a>  just spent almost $275,000 because he found mysteriously this money to put into the library, but he's had it for the last six years because he wouldn't take it out of free cash.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10360.739s">Mr.</a>  President, we're asking the question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10364.722s">Mr.</a>  President, we're asking the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10365.983s">We're</a>  all in agreement we want the question answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10367.725s">I</a>  mean, I think we're belaboring this issue a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10370.047s">Right's</a>  Pawn is going to be closed by the time we close this debate on the issue.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10434.402s">Because</a>  I think the lady said there were, I think they said there was an increase at Tufts pool also.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10440.223s">But</a>  I'd like to get it from the park board who raises the rates because once again, we will add that to the motion because normally they go part and parcel, the lifeguards and the, what do they call them? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10450.305s">Not</a>  park rangers, attendants, bath attendants, park attendants and the park police. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10455.178s">No,</a>  park rangers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10456.679s">Mike</a>  Penta just got promoted to lieutenant.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10841.718s">Mr.</a>  President, I went to Magoon Park last night because I received the same email. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10845.319s">And</a>  clearly, the lights that illuminate the park are on all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10851.321s">I</a>  don't know of any other park that stays on at 2, 3, 4, 5 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10857.022s">That's</a>  well, that's that's a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10860.963s">The</a>  lights are very close to many of the backyards. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10865.344s">The</a>  woman that contacted me, she said light illuminates her kitchen at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10872.115s">And</a>  there's some issues that do present, as Councilor Penta mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10877.419s">And</a>  one of the issues was the fact that you have a beautiful park now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10883.143s">They</a>  do need to cut the grass down there, because the grass last night was about knee high. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10888.286s">But</a>  they have it fenced off, so no one can use the park at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10892.589s">Even</a>  if you wanted to just walk by and look at what's taking place, they did a beautiful job down there with the park, with the play structures and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10902.0s">I'm</a>  a little taken back why the basketball court, which is heavily used, wasn't fully done over, the rims and the backboards and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10911.703s">But,</a>  you know, maybe that's underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10913.763s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10914.363s">But</a>  the issue is with the lighting staying on all day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10917.944s">So</a>  maybe if we can forward that, Councilor, to Lauren and the park board, because they're in control of the lights, to make sure they get shut off in a time fashion that's suitable to all the abutters <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10930.849s">We</a>  all know that's park is surrounded by homes, a very close proximity. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10936.031s">And,</a>  uh, and we want to make sure that, uh, the park is great for the neighborhood, but also, uh, works well for the, uh, neighbors that have bought it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10945.575s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10946.155s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10946.515s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10947.596s">So</a>  as amended by a councilor marks on that motion, all those in favor, all those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10953.558s">Oh,</a>  ma'am, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10954.659s">You</a>  wanted to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10955.915s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10956.275s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10957.156s">Debbie</a>  Sander Hayes, 29 Damon Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10959.817s">So</a>  lights on, lights off. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10962.618s">We</a>  don't really need it at 2 in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10964.459s">We</a>  want to go play. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10965.579s">So</a>  whatever the lighting issue is, I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10967.96s">We</a>  can just open up the gates and let the kids play. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10970.602s">That's</a>  the only reason why I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10972.482s">The</a>  kids are drooling to get in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10974.243s">It</a>  is so gorgeous. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10977.064s">I</a>  don't think we need a ribbon cutting ceremony. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10979.365s">The</a>  kids don't care about ice cream and hot dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10981.446s">Just</a>  let's open up the gates and let them play. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10984.568s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10985.54s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10987.901s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10988.761s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=10990.222s">While</a>  we're on to suspension, 15-530 offered by Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the Mayor ask the DOT and DCR to come up with an agreement to allow trucks to travel on Route 16 during the Craddock Bridge construction period. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11007.667s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11008.907s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11010.088s">I'm</a>  assuming at this point this has been talked about between the different agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11014.877s">I</a>  think this needs to be done and something in writing has to be disseminated to the state police if they approve it, as well as the Medford police. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11023.161s">My</a>  concern is if they do not open up Route 16 to the smaller trucks, you're going to have these trucks going down Summer Street to evade the congestion during the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11035.587s">They're</a>  going to be going up South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11037.068s">They're</a>  going to be going through Forest Street, Lawrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11039.969s">They're</a>  going to be going everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11042.743s">Street</a>  that can handle it the most is Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11045.424s">And</a>  as we're all aware of, Route 16, you can't have any trucks on the DCR roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11050.846s">So</a>  during the Craddock Bridge construction, I think it just does make sense to do this to alleviate the neighborhood traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11058.069s">The</a>  roads are certainly bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11059.83s">I</a>  know in the past, the concern has been some of the trees and things of that nature years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11065.052s">But</a>  I just think it's going to, if we don't look into this and have something in writing, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11071.926s">We're</a>  going to just add more confusion to the neighborhoods, and as Mr. D'Antonio said earlier about the parking, just going to keep pushing it back, pushing it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11079.688s">George</a>  Street, then onto Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11081.868s">So</a>  by this simple approach, I think we can help alleviate some of the side street traffic.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11087.11s">Thank</a>  you for that, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11088.17s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11088.99s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11089.65s">On</a>  that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11090.711s">I</a>  disagree with my Councilor member here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11093.331s">Route</a>  16 is a nightmare right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11094.912s">I</a>  live over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11096.612s">I</a>  don't even go down Route 16 anymore to go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11098.733s">That's</a>  how bad it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11101.962s">To</a>  allow trucks to go down Route 16, I mean, right now, they don't bother the small trucks, but the big trucks, they're pulling them over on a regular basis over there in their parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11111.75s">There's</a>  no way for these trucks to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11113.051s">I</a>  mean, Route 16, where are they going to get off? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11115.833s">Now</a>  they're going to be traveling all the way down our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11118.615s">They're</a>  advertising, I mean, the signs around the highway telling them not to get off Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11125.301s">I</a>  said, to put a truck, any more trucks, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11129.171s">on</a>  that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11130.792s">Once</a>  that ramp closes, route 16 is going to be a bigger nightmare than it already is.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11137.094s">Like</a>  I said, I'd rather see them go down route 16, Mr. President, than coming through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11141.476s">We</a>  all know Councilor Marks a few years ago had a very good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11143.837s">Just</a>  the trash trucks can't get through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11146.366s">In</a>  the morning, there would be a bus and a trash truck, it would be total gridlock. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11150.287s">I</a>  just think, I understand Councilor Caraviello, he's got a very good point, but we're asking for trucks to start going down streets like where you live.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11157.888s">That's</a>  where they're gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11158.988s">They're</a>  not pulling small trucks, but the bigger trucks.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11163.209s">Well,</a>  right now the state police are pulling over any truck that has a box on it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11168.57s">Yeah,</a>  anything with a box, but let's say, I'd rather have them go to Medford Square than go down that parkway, let's say, because the parkway,</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11176.032s">Come</a>  2 o'clock, you just can't get out of that parkway anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11178.654s">Yeah,</a>  no, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11179.554s">But</a>  I think it's better off than getting them down the high street and everywhere else.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11183.216s">Like</a>  I say, I'm coming by your house every day when I go home as of now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11186.338s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11187.239s">That's</a>  why I go home every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11189.18s">I</a>  know.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11190.281s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11190.841s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11192.242s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11193.843s">And</a>  I have to commend Councilor Camuso for thinking out of the box and trying to address some of the traffic problems that are going to pop up with <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11200.97s">the</a>  Craddock Bridge reconstruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11203.631s">You</a>  know, as we discussed last week in our budget debates about the possibility of maybe hiring a transportation planner for the city of Medford and the cost versus the benefits and what that will bring to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11214.853s">But</a>  I won't belabor that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11216.254s">I</a>  just think it's very important that this issue, as well as many other issues that are going to come up relative to Craddock Bridge, be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11222.535s">And,</a>  Council President, I know you've been working very hard with members of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, as have I, to schedule a meeting for them to come down here before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11231.037s">And,</a>  um, I believe that this would be a great issue to bring up at the tentative meeting that we have scheduled for the June 30th.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11235.821s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11237.122s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11237.742s">So</a>  on the motion of a Councilor Camuso, a roll call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11243.366s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11248.01s">Have</a>  we seen a traffic plan regarding, uh, this bridge construction?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11255.336s">We</a>  saw conceptual plans, uh, in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11259.166s">We're</a>  now at a full construction design is all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11263.168s">So,</a>  uh, on the 30th of June, uh, the representative of the department of transportation will present himself, uh, to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11274.135s">Uh,</a>  and so Tuesday night, June 30th, we've asked them to come down and be ready to present themselves and be able to, uh, present to us the concerns about traffic rerouting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11287.718s">the</a>  use of temporary bridges, to address the issue of bus stops, and to talk about the mitigation issues and issues of contact for the local businesses to have a point person to get to when problems arise.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11307.167s">So</a>  until I have some feedback from a traffic engineer on what's the best way to reroute this traffic and where trucks should go, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11318.018s">Council's</a>  welcome to offer a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11319.558s">I</a>  just can't support it tonight until I see an overall master plan on what's going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11324.62s">This</a>  is going to be over a two-year construction process. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11328.84s">Well,</a>  it may be four, but it's going to be several years of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11334.062s">And</a>  I think we have to look at engineers and people that are much smarter in that field than we are and take their advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11341.743s">And</a>  so I can't support this here tonight.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11344.824s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11346.118s">So</a>  on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11353.26s">Madam?</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11354.421s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11356.942s">Shouldn't</a>  we wait until, I think it's great that we're thinking about it beforehand and that it's been brought up by Councilor Camuso, but don't you think we should maybe wait till the 30th where we have representatives come in, we can talk through it, see if they plan on giving us a traffic impact study and how they plan on rerouting traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11375.91s">I</a>  don't know what the right answer is myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11377.75s">I'm</a>  not a traffic consultant, but there has to be a way that we're going to reroute traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11382.571s">But</a>  let's try to get the answers from the, you know, see what they're saying.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11386.012s">Mr.</a>  President, hopefully the trucks will be in Somerville and Malton and not in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11389.893s">Mr.</a>  Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11390.773s">I</a>  think Councilor Lungo-Koehn has a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11393.554s">I'll</a>  send this to that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11397.474s">And</a>  like I said, this actually presented itself from people on Harvard Street in South Medford that are concerned about the trucks that we gave them some alleviation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11406.361s">And</a>  now they're concerned that it's going to be back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11409.643s">And</a>  when I thought about that, you start thinking about Spring Street again and Riverside Ave, where the trucks have always been a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11416.048s">So</a>  I want to thank Councilor Alango-Kern for offering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11419.33s">I</a>  think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11420.891s">And</a>  I'll move this paper to that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11423.113s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11423.513s">So</a>  on the motion of Council, it was to table this until that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11426.736s">Well,</a>  not to table it on the council agenda, just forward it to that meeting, forward it to the committee of the whole, because if it's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11433.269s">It's</a>  a presentation on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11435.611s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11436.652s">Even</a>  better. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11438.413s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11440.274s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11440.675s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11512.698s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11513.598s">Mr.</a>  President, this morning, midday today, I met with some state agencies and one of the agencies that was <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11521.77s">At</a>  issue was the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11523.23s">Department</a>  of Transportation, and one of the concerns as it relates to that was not only from my concern, but other folks' concern as it relates to their response and their response time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11535.053s">Now,</a>  you're telling us that we have a meeting scheduled for the 30th of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11540.253s">About</a>  a month ago, a little bit less than a month ago, signage was in Medford Square indicating that they were going to be doing some construction on the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11548.989s">None</a>  of the business folks, yet, as we speak right now, have been notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11553.151s">The</a>  chamber has not been notified as it relates to an update as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11558.052s">Now,</a>  the other day, coming into Saturday and Sunday, took these pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11561.473s">I'll</a>  just, we can pass them around. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11564.014s">As</a>  you all know, they dug up the middle of the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11567.376s">Larry,</a>  you want to pass that over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11568.816s">They</a>  dug up the middle of the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11570.076s">In</a>  the middle of the island, they left it, what, an eight <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11575.283s">to</a>  12-inch gully hole in the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11581.045s">All</a>  weekend long, they didn't put any plates on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11585.327s">And</a>  by putting no plates on there, you can ask folks who are walking across the street, one person almost, because it was dark out at nighttime, almost fell into the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11594.97s">But</a>  that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11595.81s">The</a>  fact of the matter is, is there a clerk of the works? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11599.391s">Where</a>  is the city on this particular matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11602.072s">Who's</a>  monitoring what needs to be done <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11604.534s">just</a>  because you put a cone, that doesn't mean that's going to resolve the subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11608.537s">And</a>  if you look at the picture, you can see someone now trying to make a U-turn where the cones are, because they felt that's what they were able to do, that's what they thought it was supposed to be about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11617.382s">This</a>  whole thing has a history, and if you speak to OCD, they'll tell you the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11621.604s">This</a>  has a history of the city not being involved on a timely, if not any kind of a basis, never mind the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11629.608s">And</a>  this just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11630.709s">And</a>  I believe just yesterday morning, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11632.937s">They</a>  hot topped it, and it's still not level. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11635.599s">And</a>  they have 9,000 cones over there that don't even light up at nighttime. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11640.423s">Sometimes</a>  you see those barrels that have the lights that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11642.724s">They</a>  don't even have those. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11643.545s">They</a>  just have cones that look like if you're a dunce in school, and you're a bad guy, and you're in trouble, you go sit in the corner and put the cone on your head. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11651.451s">This</a>  is too much of a serious project. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11653.512s">And</a>  the more you tell people that this is going to be almost four years, they can't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11657.035s">A</a>  121-foot bridge is going to take almost four years to get itself built. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11663.058s">with</a>  the state of technology that's out there today, with the state of construction that's out there today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11669.402s">It's</a>  mind-boggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11671.644s">And</a>  then the second aspect of this is the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11675.166s">They've</a>  never come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11676.086s">We've</a>  asked to have them come back over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11678.208s">The</a>  possibility of looking at putting the bus stop on Riverside Avenue, go down Riverside Avenue, change the route of River Street, have the bus go there, park there, comes back around the square, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11689.715s">and</a>  then it goes through without tying up anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11692.117s">Maybe</a>  no more than three to four extra minutes out of the normal route that it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11696.2s">Think</a>  about it, you're talking about the seniors that live at 99 and the folks that live at 121. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11700.022s">The</a>  way they have it projected now, you're gonna have to walk all the way down the ring road and then from under the ring road, you're gonna have to walk underneath the bridge over by 101 Main Street to get the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11710.209s">Where</a>  now, if you follow the riverside to the river street, all they'd be doing is walking into Medford Square and picking up the bus there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11717.463s">And</a>  all you'd be doing is displacing four car spaces that you could put, where you would be putting the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11724.166s">These</a>  are all options and these are all possibilities that need to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11728.409s">And</a>  the Medford City Council is the controller of the parking of the bus stops here in the city of Medford, not the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11734.432s">It's</a>  the city of Medford, the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11737.053s">So,</a>  Mr. President, what I'm proposing, in concert with Councilor Camuso's resolution, that we look at, is the MBTA coming to this meeting too? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11749.863s">But</a>  is the person from the MBTA going to be here?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11754.344s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11756.384s">As</a>  I understand, the transportation reform bill that was passed several years ago, everything is under the same mass dot umbrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11761.545s">MBTA,</a>  highway, DCR, all of the parties that are going to be having a stake in the reconstruction of the Craddock Bridge, with the exception of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11771.027s">And</a>  they're coming to see us.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11772.067s">But</a>  the last time we had this, Adam, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11776.931s">The</a>  lady from the MBTA had to be, she was invited separately.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11779.552s">When</a>  was the last time we had this?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11781.032s">Cause</a>  we were saying we never had this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11783.393s">I</a>  think maybe about a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11786.513s">So</a>  I would like to make sure in your invite on the 30th, um, that a representative or the person from the MBTA who would be involved here in the city of method regarding bus stops is here and to, um, so we could explore once again, changing the bus stop instead of 21 main street to river street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11806.427s">Redirecting</a>  the traffic and all those that just come around.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11809.608s">The</a>  legislative liaison for the Department of Transportation will be here, and he's well-versed in the issues of exploring the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11821.67s">He'll</a>  have the overall project manager here, as well as other constituencies.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11827.551s">But</a>  I think what we need to discuss is not a matter of having a discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11832.554s">I</a>  think a matter of having them know.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11834.175s">It's</a>  not a discussion.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11835.275s">No,</a>  a matter of a discussion expressing what our ideas would be and not to have them come back six, nine months later and decide to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11843.06s">This</a>  project is already designed, drawn up, has a battle plan and they're implementing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11849.563s">And</a>  without any support or input from this council or the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11854.846s">So</a>  all these meetings that supposedly were going to take place and be so transparent, <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11859.213s">just</a>  never took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11860.094s">So</a>  they're just going ahead and building what they want to build. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11864.336s">10,000,</a>  excuse me, now it's up to 10 million, 10.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11867.859s">So</a>  we've gone from 2.5 to 8.5 to 12.7, now down to 10.7. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11873.762s">So</a>  we really don't even know what the true cost of this project is, because we've already had one, two, three, we've had five separate numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11881.067s">So,</a>  you know, it's a bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11885.91s">It's</a>  not a mausoleum. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11887.597s">It's</a>  not an historical edifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11889.178s">It's</a>  just a plain, simple bridge to make buses, cars, and traffic and trucks drive over. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11894.522s">This</a>  is not the Longfellow Bridge in Boston, where you're looking at architectural scheme and design. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11901.507s">It's</a>  121 feet, Fred.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11902.388s">The</a>  place of the Craddock Bridge is longer and more significant in the history of the United States of America than is the <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11914.297s">Longfellow</a>  Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11915.658s">We're</a>  talking about a bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11916.739s">It's</a>  salt and pepper shakers, and it's graffiti, and it's red line.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11921.423s">That</a>  may be in your opinion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11923.465s">Mr.</a>  President, move to join this paper with the previous paper that was discussed.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11974.351s">Mr.</a>  President, Reverend Kilpatrick most recently just celebrated his 50 years as a pastor up at Monfield Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11982.958s">He's</a>  just personally a wonderful advocate in his religious advocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11988.843s">He</a>  was a former director at the West Medford Community Center, and he's been an extreme supporter <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=11995.998s">not</a>  only for those less fortunate, but for younger individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12000.079s">I</a>  think it would be appropriate to invite him before the council to receive a citation and to let him know and let him be recognized within his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12008.58s">50</a>  years is a long time to serve in a profession, and it's a profession well-respected, and he is well-respected within the Baptist community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12018.442s">So</a>  I move that paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12019.842s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Penter, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12093.99s">Yeah?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12096.771s">Well,</a>  it's Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12099.332s">Boston</a>  happens to be this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12102.734s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12103.894s">Ask.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12104.695s">You</a>  want to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12108.563s">have</a>  our own week, Medford Pride Week.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12111.204s">Further</a>  resolve that Medford establish its own Pride Week and declare it such on this.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12116.545s">And</a>  I think, I think Medford has done a significant job in this particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12121.427s">As</a>  I said, the majority of the city council has supported tremendous movement forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12127.508s">The</a>  bathroom issues at the Medford public schools that were discussed here, as well as many other things over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12133.87s">So</a>  we have a proven track record as a council.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12137.775s">On</a>  that motion offered by Councilor Camuso, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12141.216s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to say that Medford's no place for hate, and this is a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12147.318s">One</a>  of the best votes that this council's taken this past year was the ordinance that created the Fair Housing Ordinance in the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12154.321s">So</a>  I think that this falls in line with the actual past practice of this council and the support that this council's shown for anti-discrimination in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12160.963s">So</a>  I support this resolution wholeheartedly, Mr. President, and I ask my colleagues to join me in doing the same.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12166.185s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12167.043s">On</a>  that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12167.944s">Roll</a>  call. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12168.945s">Roll</a>  call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12171.266s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you would please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12173.588s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12175.369s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12176.811s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12178.272s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12180.794s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12183.195s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12183.796s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12184.176s">With</a>  the vote of seven in the affirmative, none negative, the motion carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12188.139s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12189.64s">The</a>  records. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12191.662s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12194.403s">Just</a>  if we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12195.263s">I</a>  believe it was last week, or was it two weeks ago, with the airplane noise that myself and Councilor Longo offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12201.844s">Part</a>  of that resolution was to get feedback from the current resident that the mayor appointed that sits on the Massport Advisory Board, our methods representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12213.667s">And</a>  we got a response back in the packet saying that that person resigned a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12219.388s">So</a>  I think we should ask the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12222.34s">if</a>  someone's going to be appointed to that very important body, and if so, when? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12229.604s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, just a birthday notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12234.426s">Not</a>  for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12234.966s">A</a>  very special person, Dolores Carroll, is celebrating a very special birthday, and I just want to wish her well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12242.49s">She</a>  tunes in on the council meetings every Tuesday, and I want to wish her well on her birthday.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12250.433s">And</a>  those of us who were present at the memorial ceremonies for the Metropolitan Fire Department got a firsthand experience of the presence of airplanes in our midst. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12262.015s">Madam</a>  Vice President, do you have anything on that?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12263.375s">I</a>  was just going to say, on the airplane comment, you did throw out the board member's name and number. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12268.096s">I</a>  did call. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12268.756s">I</a>  left a message to see if she'd come to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12271.297s">He</a>  or she? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12271.917s">It's</a>  a woman.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12272.957s">It's</a>  a woman.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12273.537s">She</a>  left a message on the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12275.277s">No</a>  wonder why I didn't get a call back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12277.598s">So</a>  if we could get another name. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12279.899s">from</a>  the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12280.799s">I'm</a>  sure he knows who was appointed on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12283.46s">I</a>  think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12285.5s">I</a>  do notice the planes at my house because I live in the heights, but that next weekend, woken up out of a dead sleep at like midnight at night, I mean, it felt like there was a plane landing on my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12296.823s">So</a>  it's the first time I was woken up at night, but it's getting worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12300.624s">And</a>  I think we need somebody here to answer the questions and figure out what's going on.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12309.796s">Mr.</a>  Ben Everbrook, God bless him, had passed away some time back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12313.937s">They</a>  have not replaced that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12316.778s">And</a>  that's a very important position when they had the bike rodeo back here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12320.958s">Mr.</a>  Everbrook was in charge of selling helmets to kids that used their bicycle in the city.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12328.56s">When</a>  we discuss the executive portion of the budget, we'll have an opportunity to ask him all those questions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12334.621s">Mr.</a>  President, June 20th is the bike rodeo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12338.224s">The</a>  method is doing it with the method by commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12343.046s">Out</a>  here in the parking lot, the bikes, the hot dogs, the kids, and beverages, and the police will be out here, and the helmets, and bring your bike down, get it tuned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12353.57s">I</a>  think 9, 10 o'clock tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12354.89s">I</a>  don't have a number, time, but 10 AM. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12357.651s">Happy</a>  rodeo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12358.752s">Bring</a>  the bike down. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12359.512s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12360.152s">Bring</a>  your bike down. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12361.553s">Have</a>  a hot dog, beverage.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12364.014s">So</a>  if you go to the Magoon Park ceremony and go there, you get two hot dogs?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12374.045s">Mr.</a>  President, while we are making announcements of matters that are going on in the community, I think it's important to point out, and I'm sure Councilor Caraviello will agree with me, that Friday the 26th at Anthony's in Malden is the Batter Up for Billy fundraiser for the Challenger League, which provides funding, necessary funding, for the Challenger League, which is a baseball league for individuals with developmental disabilities for which <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12397.288s">gone-but-not-forgotten</a>  good friend Billy Falasca was a pioneer for.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12401.592s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12402.713s">So</a>  the records of the June 2nd, 2015 meeting were passed to Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12408.358s">Councilor</a>  Camuso, how did you find those records? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12412.402s">Motion</a>  for approval by Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12414.344s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12415.064s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12416.045s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12417.026s">Motion</a>  for adjournment from Councilor Michael Marx <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12423.09s">In</a>  memory of Governor Cellucci, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=12427.279s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>
