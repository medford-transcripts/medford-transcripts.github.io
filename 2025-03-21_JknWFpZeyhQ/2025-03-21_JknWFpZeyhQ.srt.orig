[SPEAKER_21]: We have presentations tonight for the Medford Middle School String Ensemble.

21
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:56,066
[SPEAKER_21]: Before we do that, maestro, if you please.

22
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:04,686
you

23
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,611
[SPEAKER_05]: The second selection is called Mantras.

24
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:37,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a contemporary piece.

25
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:12,790
you

26
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:12,197
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Maestro Chang, and thank you to all of the performers with us here tonight.

27
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:27,522
[SPEAKER_21]: At this time, I'm going to ask Councilor Marks to come forward to make presentations of certificates of achievement to the members of the Medford Middle School's String Ensemble under the direction of Sophia Chang.

28
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:17,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, and thank you to the Method Middle School String Ensemble.

29
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,571
[SPEAKER_06]: What a calming effect.

30
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:29,256
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone watches a Tuesday night meeting, it sometimes gets contentious behind the reel.

31
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll tell you, I think tonight, we're gonna go smooth tonight.

32
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:39,225
[SPEAKER_06]: There won't be any harsh words, any harsh debate.

33
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:43,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you set us off in a tone that I'd like to see every Tuesday night.

34
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:45,589
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate you coming.

35
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:52,273
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are here to honor and recognize, Method is now on the map.

36
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:59,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Method was never known, in all the years I've been in the city of Method, for our string ensemble.

37
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:02,101
[SPEAKER_06]: But now, guess what?

38
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:04,585
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a leader in Massachusetts.

39
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:11,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Our students have put Meffitt on the map, and we are all very proud.

40
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,962
[SPEAKER_06]: The festival is designed to promote excellence in musical performance.

41
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:44,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the Massachusetts Instrumental and Chorus Conductors and Associations Band and Orchestra Concert Festival, we won a gold medal.

42
00:13:55,887 --> 00:14:05,490
[SPEAKER_06]: The festival was held in six sites across Massachusetts, with approximately 160 instrumental ensembles participating.

43
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Method won the gold medal.

44
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:18,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only did we win the gold medal,

45
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:28,880
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the fifth year Method String Ensemble brought back medals of excellence, earning four gold medals and one silver medal.

46
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:30,641
[SPEAKER_06]: What an accomplishment.

47
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:46,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, in addition to what you did here tonight, these are all students.

48
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:49,996
[SPEAKER_06]: They have all the coursework that any other student would have.

49
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:52,777
[SPEAKER_06]: They have hours of preparation.

50
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:56,800
[SPEAKER_06]: How many hours do we spend a week on our schoolwork?

51
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,480
[SPEAKER_06]: How many hours?

52
00:14:59,221 --> 00:14:59,401
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot.

53
00:14:59,421 --> 00:14:59,701
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot?

54
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:03,223
[SPEAKER_06]: How many hours do we spend on our strings?

55
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:07,046
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot.

56
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:07,186
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot.

57
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:07,306
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot.

58
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:08,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I hear 20 hours a week?

59
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:09,587
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

60
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:13,388
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of hours are being spent.

61
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:19,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's through the hard work and dedication that we hear the sounds that we heard tonight.

62
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:21,795
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't just happen.

63
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:24,578
[SPEAKER_06]: That is through dedication and hard work.

64
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:35,867
[SPEAKER_06]: That is through having an instructor that I believe has done yeoman's work to creating this program, keeping the enthusiasm.

65
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:40,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sophia Chang, who is in the back, really deserves

66
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:58,768
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I could, I'd like to read the citation.

67
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:09,610
[SPEAKER_06]: The Meffitt City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to the Meffitt Middle School String Ensemble.

68
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:24,153
[SPEAKER_06]: In recognition of winning a gold medal at the Massachusetts Instrumental and Chorus Conductors Association Band and Orchestra Concert Festival, the MICCA Concert Festival is designed to promote excellence in musical performance

69
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:30,427
[SPEAKER_06]: The festival was held in six sites across Massachusetts on March 27th through the 29th.

70
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:35,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Throughout the weekend, approximately 160 instrumental ensembles participated.

71
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:42,797
[SPEAKER_06]: By participating in the festival, students and teachers strive to meet the MICCA gold medal standards.

72
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:47,921
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the fifth year the Method String Ensemble has brought back medals of excellence.

73
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:51,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this time, I'd like to call up Sophia Chang.

74
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

75
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:06,613
[SPEAKER_05]: It is my distinctive honor to serve the Medford community.

76
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy my students very much.

77
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:11,954
[SPEAKER_05]: They are incredible.

78
00:17:12,914 --> 00:17:19,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And the award is the result of their enthusiasm and hard work.

79
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:27,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I also like to thank all the parents for your commitment, for your support over those years.

80
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:36,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to the administrators, Mr. Jada, and the principals.

81
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:38,397
[SPEAKER_05]: They are all very supporting.

82
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It is wonderful to work in this community.

83
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:44,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

84
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:55,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

85
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:00,352
[SPEAKER_06]: All at the end.

00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:11,957

00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:57,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Fadara Martin.

90
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:05,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Diego Hernandez.

91
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin Truong.

92
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:51,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Jacob George.

93
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Corinne Adams.

94
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:18,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Henry Nigin.

00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:31,704

00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:07,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Evan Lau.

00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:21,844
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Kylie Truong.

[SPEAKER_06]: Isabella Bazzara.

101
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:45,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin Wu.

00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Kyla Flores Lemus.

103
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:04,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Leah Bendaniel.

104
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:13,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Nadia Farmer.

105
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And Danielle Lee.

106
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:36,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also think we have to note there was perfect attendance here tonight.

107
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:43,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Which very seldom happens.

108
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:45,949
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope we're gonna get another song or two.

109
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:49,832
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Sophia's got hers.

110
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:53,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

111
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:48,775
[SPEAKER_21]: Council will go into recess for the dispersal of the band.

112
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:37,225
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford City Council will come back to order.

113
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:47,889
[SPEAKER_21]: Before we begin our regular agenda, we have an unannounced item here, a presentation for advocates of the Medford Public Library.

114
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:58,413
[SPEAKER_21]: For the record, the library budget was discussed tonight and it received an additional infusion of $251,325.

115
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:06,205
[SPEAKER_21]: under the auspices of Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

116
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:10,628
[SPEAKER_21]: A representative of the group wishes to speak.

117
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:15,511
[SPEAKER_21]: Please present yourself to the podium and state your name and address for the record.

118
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Samantha Sednik.

119
00:27:18,715 --> 00:27:20,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I am at 181 Kennedy Drive.

120
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:28,142
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here both as your children's librarian and also a member of the Medford Community Coalition.

121
00:27:28,742 --> 00:27:34,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to start off just by thanking you, really sincerely thanking you for the work that was done today.

122
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:42,312
[SPEAKER_01]: That additional money that was granted into our budget was super necessary.

123
00:27:42,332 --> 00:27:44,153
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we talk about accreditation,

124
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:51,593
[SPEAKER_01]: The heart and soul of the library is our community.

125
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:59,335
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the community really did speak, and I know that you guys have been hearing from them all week, about what they really want in a library.

126
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:09,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we have a little bit of additional funds, now that we have some additional staff, we can work on getting that vision and really make Medford Library what people want to see.

127
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:21,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know in the budget discussion earlier today, there was discussions about how circulations are down and foot traffic at the library is down, and I just want to attest that that is simply not true.

128
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:31,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been here since October of 2013, and since my time here, the circulation in the children's library has only gone up.

129
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:35,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I can probably say the same for that of the young adult librarian.

130
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:39,651
[SPEAKER_01]: She arrived in March of 2014.

131
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:42,293
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the books flying off the wall.

132
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,735
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the stacks of books coming back into us.

133
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:46,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the kids coming in.

134
00:28:47,857 --> 00:28:56,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, this very day, I had a conversation with a teacher from the middle school who was so excited because the kids are talking about what they're going to do after school.

135
00:28:56,743 --> 00:28:59,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're excited about is coming to our library.

136
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:10,534
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, the building needs some love and attention, and it has problems, as our falling tiles and leaking buckets do show.

137
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,578
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really do want to have the best library that we can have.

138
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:22,443
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way to do that is to have people in it, people that care about the library and people that care about Medford.

139
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:28,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And so amending the budget as you did today, I really sincerely thank you.

140
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:30,283
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

141
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,170
[SPEAKER_21]: Moana, please state your name and address for the record.

142
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:51,904
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm Vicky Hillel from 11 Mason Street here in Medford, and I'm here also on behalf of Sharon Guzik, who's at 10 Manning Street in Medford, and she's president of Friends of the Library.

143
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:57,803
[SPEAKER_25]: Friends of Medford Public Library, which is an all-volunteer 501c3, as you probably know.

144
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:11,006
[SPEAKER_25]: It's separate from the library and the major mission is raising funds, which do not pay for any overhead or paying for any staff positions.

145
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:15,387
[SPEAKER_25]: And the Friends of the Library feel strongly that that's the city's responsibility.

146
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:21,888
[SPEAKER_25]: But these funds raised by Friends of Medford Public Library go towards supplemental programs

147
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:29,620
[SPEAKER_25]: such as lectures, sing-alongs, workshops, and museum passes, which many kids enjoy and many families.

148
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:37,064
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you'll permit me, I'm going to read her statement beginning now.

149
00:30:38,064 --> 00:30:46,228
[SPEAKER_25]: So the first version of my letter, I ask for your support to secure more funding for the library and the city's new budget.

150
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:59,818
[SPEAKER_25]: We were at a critical stage facing possible loss of accreditation, which would preclude Medford library patrons from using other libraries and receiving state aid to libraries.

151
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:05,202
[SPEAKER_25]: Thankfully, thankfully the city has agreed to add the $251,325 needed to retain accreditation.

152
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:16,040
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to thank our Medford City Councilors for your support to fully fund the library.

153
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:25,484
[SPEAKER_25]: I also want to thank Mayor McGlynn for listening to the citizens of Medford and adding the additional funds that we needed to retain accreditation.

154
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:36,390
[SPEAKER_25]: However, though we could be satisfied with minimally meeting the accreditation standards, we know Medford Public Library could be so much more than it already is.

155
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,911
[SPEAKER_25]: We need to be thinking long-term

156
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:41,565
[SPEAKER_25]: and increase library funding accordingly.

157
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:52,984
[SPEAKER_25]: I strongly believe that Medford deserves an outstanding public library that will serve all of our citizens.

158
00:31:53,604 --> 00:31:57,326
[SPEAKER_25]: Modern public libraries are much more than places that lend books and movies.

159
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:06,251
[SPEAKER_25]: As summarized by Dara Lipton in an online article on the role of libraries today, quote, modern libraries are community centers.

160
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:15,917
[SPEAKER_25]: They should reflect the needs, personality, and nuance of the community they service and serve as a glue to bring disparate members of the community together.

161
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:30,323
[SPEAKER_25]: The modern library creates space where patrons engage with information, process it, reflect on it, have conversations about it, and develop new ideas, conversations, and opportunities as a result of it."

162
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:38,565
[SPEAKER_25]: I would like to see the city embrace a long-term vision for our public library with a scheduled plan for fulfilling it.

163
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:48,866
[SPEAKER_25]: This plan, this vision, should encompass the renovation and regular maintenance of the library as well as a scheduled plan updating its technology.

164
00:32:50,127 --> 00:33:00,775
[SPEAKER_25]: Ideally, such a plan will look even further into the future and consider how to lay the foundation for the rapidly evolving role that libraries play in our communities.

165
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:08,341
[SPEAKER_25]: I believe another step toward fulfilling this vision is to revitalize the board of library trustees,

166
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:14,682
[SPEAKER_25]: There are currently five dedicated individuals that have served as trustees for close to two decades.

167
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:20,448
[SPEAKER_25]: I congratulate them for their long years of service and dedication to our library.

168
00:33:20,988 --> 00:33:25,553
[SPEAKER_25]: However, turnover on the board is important to keep an organization energized and relevant.

169
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,677
[SPEAKER_25]: New blood brings new ideas and new enthusiasm to the table.

170
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:38,774
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel it is vital to appoint new people to the board as trustee positions come up for renewal.

171
00:33:40,295 --> 00:33:45,176
[SPEAKER_25]: I end with the words of Andrew Carnegie, that great supporter of public libraries.

172
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:52,417
[SPEAKER_25]: Quote, a library outranks any other one thing a community can do to benefit its people.

173
00:33:53,277 --> 00:33:57,938
[SPEAKER_25]: It is a never failing spring in the desert, unquote.

174
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:00,927
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you for taking us.

175
00:34:01,267 --> 00:34:05,912
[SPEAKER_25]: And on behalf of all the friends, thank you again.

176
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:16,621
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

177
00:34:16,661 --> 00:34:18,923
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

178
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:24,568
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Anne Frenning-Gesuth.

179
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:34,451
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm the president of the Medford Educational Foundation, and I live at 88 Winthrop Street in Medford, Massachusetts.

180
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:39,473
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'd like to say that I'm very excited to see the turnout today.

181
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:41,833
[SPEAKER_24]: What's happened has been very exciting.

182
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:48,576
[SPEAKER_24]: As you may know, there's a new group in town called the Medford Community Coalition, and they're very vocal.

183
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:50,636
[SPEAKER_24]: They're parents, and they care.

184
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:52,977
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's a longstanding group,

185
00:34:53,502 --> 00:34:59,445
[SPEAKER_24]: that's called the Friends of the Medford Public Library, and they care also, and for much, much longer.

186
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:15,073
[SPEAKER_24]: So these two groups have united in support of the Medford Public Library, and it's very thrilling, because as Andrew Carnegie once said, it is like, well, it's not just a spring, it's like an oasis.

187
00:35:15,754 --> 00:35:20,356
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a place to go that anyone in the community from cradle to grave can learn

188
00:35:20,964 --> 00:35:23,246
[SPEAKER_24]: and benefit from the information provided there.

189
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:35,297
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that I'd like to give a special shout out to Children's Reference Librarian, Sam Sednick, for the incredible work that she's done to revitalize the library.

190
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:43,505
[SPEAKER_24]: And we used to go, most of us parents used to go to Winchester because we were part of the Minuteman Library Network, and it was very pleasant there.

191
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:46,758
[SPEAKER_24]: But they don't have half of the programming that we have.

192
00:35:46,798 --> 00:35:51,519
[SPEAKER_24]: And the very first program she did was this fairy tale ball.

193
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:54,979
[SPEAKER_24]: It was one hour long.

194
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:59,180
[SPEAKER_24]: And all the children dressed as little fairies.

195
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,500
[SPEAKER_24]: And the parents went.

196
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,781
[SPEAKER_24]: And Barbara Kerr was a fortune teller.

197
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:05,561
[SPEAKER_24]: And Brian Boutillier had a mask.

198
00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:07,102
[SPEAKER_24]: And there were fencers.

199
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:09,222
[SPEAKER_24]: And there were people dressed in period costumes.

200
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:12,843
[SPEAKER_24]: One hour outside the box.

201
00:36:13,843 --> 00:36:20,127
[SPEAKER_24]: transform the library into a space beyond our imagination, and this is what I think we can see with the Medford Public Library.

202
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:33,255
[SPEAKER_24]: If we were able to get funds so quickly, it makes me think that we can keep going, and I think that the thrust of the message that President of the Friends of the Medford Public Library, Sharon Guzik, had, we do need a plan.

203
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:41,460
[SPEAKER_24]: We need citizens, and we need to work with the city, and we need to make this library something that the entire community can benefit from.

204
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,241
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just want to close with the fact

205
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:49,638
[SPEAKER_24]: Starting at 530 this evening for this committee of the whole, I took names just by passing a clip sheet.

206
00:36:50,218 --> 00:36:53,819
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm not going to read them all off, but I can provide them to the clerk if they're interested.

207
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:03,521
[SPEAKER_24]: There are 40 people provided voluntarily their names and their email addresses in support of the Medford Community Coalition and the Friends of the Medford Public Library.

208
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:06,862
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's, I think, a true testament.

209
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:10,702
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you for all you've done to support us, and I look forward to working with you.

210
00:37:11,303 --> 00:37:12,083
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

211
00:37:12,423 --> 00:37:13,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

212
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:18,380
[SPEAKER_21]: Ma'am, come on up.

213
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:20,365
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

214
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:23,735
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, I'm Laura Brereton at 270 Winthrop Street.

215
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:31,935
[SPEAKER_23]: We're all, thank you, we're all, this is Melanie Raeland and Sam Sednick as you already know.

216
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:36,340
[SPEAKER_23]: The three of us are co-founders of the Medford Community Coalition that Anne just mentioned.

217
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,564
[SPEAKER_23]: I know we've met many of you in person and all of you via email.

218
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:46,530
[SPEAKER_23]: We wanted to echo the sentiments that have already been made by the friends and

219
00:37:47,391 --> 00:38:04,114
[SPEAKER_23]: Of course at the committee of the whole meeting and in particular we appreciate being acknowledged as a grassroots organization We just started in January and we feel like we're really here to try to make some positive changes in Medford and it's really nice to know that the City Council is in support of that and

220
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:05,738
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you very much.

221
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:07,199
[SPEAKER_23]: The library matters.

222
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:15,102
[SPEAKER_23]: It is a wonderful place with a wonderful staff and can get better with the appropriate funding and with even more staff.

223
00:38:15,582 --> 00:38:20,984
[SPEAKER_23]: And we look forward to working with you all in continued work to make Medford a better place.

224
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:21,624
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

225
00:38:22,044 --> 00:38:23,065
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your kindness.

226
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:30,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

227
00:38:31,557 --> 00:38:34,019
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, Debbie Steiner Hayes, 29 Damon Road.

228
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,103
[SPEAKER_27]: A lot of what I wanted to say has already been said, but I wanted to come and say hi to you all anyway.

229
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:48,189
[SPEAKER_27]: You guys, I don't know how you managed it, but in one day or a couple of days, $250,000 was raised for the library.

230
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,671
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you imagine what we could do next year at this time?

231
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:05,742
[SPEAKER_27]: So the library, you know, if you read the Boston Magazine, it's not only do we have the best donut shop in Medford, we also have 40 new, well, according to Marie Cassidy, we have 40 new families moving into Medford.

232
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:09,930
[SPEAKER_27]: having babies every single month, 40 babies born in Medford every single month.

233
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:13,793
[SPEAKER_27]: We're a top place for new families to move into as Medford.

234
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:17,295
[SPEAKER_27]: Our housing prices are going through the roof.

235
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:19,856
[SPEAKER_27]: We are fabulous.

236
00:39:19,936 --> 00:39:22,898
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a great sound string ensemble.

237
00:39:23,658 --> 00:39:27,641
[SPEAKER_27]: And our library just has been not that exciting.

238
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:29,702
[SPEAKER_27]: And as she said, I have a five-year-old daughter.

239
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:34,685
[SPEAKER_27]: From the time she was one to three, we didn't step foot in our Medford library.

240
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,986
[SPEAKER_27]: We went every other library in the area.

241
00:39:37,046 --> 00:39:43,168
[SPEAKER_27]: I could tell you about Watertown, Winchester, Arlington, Lexington, and all the programming that went on there.

242
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:47,509
[SPEAKER_27]: And I did not go into our library for a multitude of reasons, which I won't go in here because they're all kind of negative.

243
00:39:48,149 --> 00:39:52,771
[SPEAKER_27]: But Samantha, Sam, is amazing.

244
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:56,332
[SPEAKER_27]: She revitalized the children's program, one human being.

245
00:39:56,892 --> 00:40:02,354
[SPEAKER_27]: If you go into the library, I please ask of you to all go in the library, go down those back steps, look on the wall.

246
00:40:02,874 --> 00:40:03,895
[SPEAKER_27]: It is covered.

247
00:40:05,215 --> 00:40:10,058
[SPEAKER_27]: to floor of activities going on almost every single day in the library.

248
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:12,560
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, they're all mixed.

249
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,263
[SPEAKER_27]: There's teens, there's children, there's preschoolers, there's babies, there's seniors, there's everything.

250
00:40:18,303 --> 00:40:19,323
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not just a book group.

251
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:26,254
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, the library is the one thing that everybody in a city can all take part in.

252
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:27,595
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe everybody doesn't go to Ritz-Carlton.

253
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:29,236
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe everybody doesn't go to schools.

254
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:30,638
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe everybody isn't part of government.

255
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:33,140
[SPEAKER_27]: But everybody at some point goes to the library.

256
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,462
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not online.

257
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:38,024
[SPEAKER_27]: The joy of holding a book is still there.

258
00:40:38,084 --> 00:40:39,345
[SPEAKER_27]: The joy of doing activities.

259
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:43,849
[SPEAKER_27]: Please, please put money back into our library.

260
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:52,593
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm Barbara Kerr.

261
00:40:52,613 --> 00:40:57,178
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm the assistant director of the Medford Library, and I live at 35 Baker Place in Newport.

262
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,681
[SPEAKER_29]: I wanted to say thank you.

263
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:01,864
[SPEAKER_29]: That is what I am here to say.

264
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:07,150
[SPEAKER_29]: It has been a difficult decade, and I'm going to cry at the city council meeting, but it's been a hard decade.

265
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,413
[SPEAKER_29]: We've struggled like every other city department.

266
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:14,577
[SPEAKER_29]: And there have been times where I did not think that we had the support of anybody.

267
00:41:15,157 --> 00:41:21,922
[SPEAKER_29]: And what happened today and all of the things that have happened in the last month have really restored my faith in this community.

268
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,824
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's nice to know that everyone appreciates us.

269
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:32,910
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you to the council.

270
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,691
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you to the mayor.

271
00:41:33,731 --> 00:41:36,554
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you to Alex who wrote that very good article a few weeks ago.

272
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:41,479
[SPEAKER_29]: And thank you to my staff who have struggled through some tough times.

273
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,680
[SPEAKER_29]: I've worked there 30 years.

274
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,002
[SPEAKER_29]: This is the best staff we have ever had.

275
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:46,223
[SPEAKER_29]: They are enthusiastic.

276
00:41:46,343 --> 00:41:47,524
[SPEAKER_29]: They're somewhat crazy.

277
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:48,726
[SPEAKER_29]: Sam wants to get chickens.

278
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:49,566
[SPEAKER_29]: We'll talk about that.

279
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:55,612
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, she only did that once.

280
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:56,512
[SPEAKER_29]: She didn't do that again.

281
00:41:57,953 --> 00:41:58,934
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a lot of glitter, too.

282
00:41:59,354 --> 00:42:00,215
[SPEAKER_29]: But they're good.

283
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:01,075
[SPEAKER_29]: They're enthusiastic.

284
00:42:01,115 --> 00:42:01,636
[SPEAKER_29]: They're smart.

285
00:42:02,756 --> 00:42:06,839
[SPEAKER_29]: With what we got today, we can move forward a lot in the next year.

286
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,900
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's a beginning.

287
00:42:08,981 --> 00:42:09,641
[SPEAKER_29]: We will do better.

288
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:11,522
[SPEAKER_29]: But thank you all very much.

289
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:17,946
[SPEAKER_29]: And thank you to everybody who's watching, because many people sent letters and emails and talked to us.

290
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:21,028
[SPEAKER_29]: And I feel much better about our future.

291
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:22,109
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you all very much.

292
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:23,130
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

293
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:32,390
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Michael Vaggiero.

294
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

295
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:38,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time for me to ask a question to our new budget director.

296
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:44,995
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was hoping to find out whether we anticipate maintaining this funding over more than just one year.

297
00:42:45,536 --> 00:42:48,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, there's a groundswell of energy and focus on this issue.

298
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:57,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make sure that as the city council and as we as a public maintain a focus on this budgetary line item to make sure that it doesn't drop out after 2016.

299
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:57,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

300
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,491
[SPEAKER_21]: In my conversations with Ms.

301
00:43:00,531 --> 00:43:11,440
[SPEAKER_21]: Miller this afternoon, it was made clear to me that this was something that would be workable over time, and it was not a one-year fix.

302
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:12,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

303
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:18,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

304
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:19,846
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

305
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:20,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

306
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:24,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts.

307
00:43:25,807 --> 00:43:31,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello had mentioned the library is a good spot for the public access station.

308
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:38,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we have so much money in reserve, I suggest a bit of a trade maybe.

309
00:43:38,613 --> 00:43:50,319
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can modernize the inner structure with peg monies, lend the monies to the library, have a van that is parked at the library with equipment that can help election 2015, because it's 164 days away,

310
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,901
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a win-win situation.

311
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:59,984
[SPEAKER_08]: You get additional monies to help refurbish the inside of the library, which really needs some help.

312
00:44:00,525 --> 00:44:01,725
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a wonderful old building.

313
00:44:02,926 --> 00:44:06,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the Medford Public Library, but it needs more money.

314
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,069
[SPEAKER_08]: $251,000 is not enough.

315
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:13,213
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have close to a million dollars in the PEG fund once that contract is signed with Comcast.

316
00:44:13,593 --> 00:44:18,136
[SPEAKER_08]: An additional $330,000, I believe, and another $32,000 from Verizon.

317
00:44:18,716 --> 00:44:22,579
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have almost a million dollars in reserve and no access station.

318
00:44:23,104 --> 00:44:24,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So we work with the library.

319
00:44:24,804 --> 00:44:26,385
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a van outside of the library.

320
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:27,525
[SPEAKER_08]: We have mobile equipment.

321
00:44:27,985 --> 00:44:32,806
[SPEAKER_08]: We can transmit through the telephone, through the cell phones.

322
00:44:32,846 --> 00:44:37,808
[SPEAKER_08]: We can transmit from the mobile van right onto Channel 3 and the Verizon channel.

323
00:44:38,368 --> 00:44:39,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my suggestion.

324
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:40,088
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some money.

325
00:44:40,248 --> 00:44:43,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's really, really help out the library.

326
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caviello.

327
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:51,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

328
00:44:52,683 --> 00:45:00,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, I had the first time working with Sam Snedek, doing my book program to the public school, the parochial school kids, for that summer reading drive.

329
00:45:01,027 --> 00:45:18,996
[SPEAKER_07]: And the real thank you came from the children of Medford, who wrote, I probably delivered to Sam at the library, over 100 letters from the kids from the schools, thanking her for all the work that she did when she came with us, going around to all the schools in Medford.

330
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And next week, Sam is going to be coming around again

331
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:26,986
[SPEAKER_07]: with the Methodist and we're going to be delivering books to the schools of all the children in the school.

332
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:34,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gives Sam a chance to promote her summer reading program that's gotten bigger every year.

333
00:45:35,129 --> 00:45:46,593
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I think she's one of the best additions to the library we've had in many years.

334
00:45:46,673 --> 00:45:52,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm looking forward to being with her next week as we travel to all the public schools and the parochial schools in Bethlehem.

335
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:00,684
[SPEAKER_07]: It gives her a chance to get to every single kid that's in the first and third grade, so they know about summer reading and what it takes to read.

336
00:46:00,904 --> 00:46:01,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

337
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:03,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councillor.

338
00:46:03,985 --> 00:46:04,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Camuso.

339
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:06,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

340
00:46:06,707 --> 00:46:11,469
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to thank everyone in the community that's been involved over the past... This isn't just the last week.

341
00:46:11,509 --> 00:46:16,711
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been over about a month or so, that the emails, the groundswell behind the scenes.

342
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:19,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was ecstatic today.

343
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:29,798
[SPEAKER_09]: when I spoke with the mayor and his staff around noontime, when he committed the additional funds based upon a couple of new developments that are coming online with new growth.

344
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:41,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just a financial commitment to keep the library just not only in a better financial situation than it is today,

345
00:46:42,229 --> 00:46:45,552
[SPEAKER_09]: But as the gentleman said a little earlier, it's going forward.

346
00:46:45,572 --> 00:46:46,793
[SPEAKER_09]: And I asked a similar question.

347
00:46:47,273 --> 00:46:56,321
[SPEAKER_09]: And you don't want to be in the same boat as we are now next year, when the new mayor has to look for additional funding.

348
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:58,502
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm glad we were able to get to this point.

349
00:46:59,323 --> 00:47:05,208
[SPEAKER_09]: But I really want to thank the people that were patient, because government doesn't work so quickly.

350
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:13,782
[SPEAKER_09]: We had to wait until the additional new growth not went online, but there was the actual commitment for the funds.

351
00:47:14,142 --> 00:47:17,685
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, week after week, it's easy for people to say, we want this, we want that, we want this.

352
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,707
[SPEAKER_09]: But ultimately, you have to pay for these city services.

353
00:47:21,228 --> 00:47:23,990
[SPEAKER_09]: And this council has been committed to doing that.

354
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:32,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, this wouldn't be possible without Mayor McGlynn and his top administrative staff, because we can only approve the budget or cut the budget.

355
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:34,518
[SPEAKER_09]: We cannot add to the budget.

356
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:42,613
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to thank him for his commitment to the children and the residents of our community here in this particular matter.

357
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:43,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

358
00:47:44,193 --> 00:47:45,054
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councillor.

359
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:46,214
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Vice President.

360
00:47:46,374 --> 00:47:48,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

361
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:55,438
[SPEAKER_15]: I too want to thank the mayor's office for coming up with the funds that are needed and the two new positions that are going to be hired.

362
00:47:55,498 --> 00:48:00,159
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds like they definitely are going to be put to good use.

363
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,760
[SPEAKER_15]: I also just want to thank

364
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:15,418
[SPEAKER_15]: It wouldn't have been possible without the community, without these two organizations and the library staff coming together and creating momentum that almost I couldn't keep up with between the emails and the phone calls.

365
00:48:15,438 --> 00:48:17,079
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I was still calling people back today.

366
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:27,645
[SPEAKER_15]: But it really goes to show, and especially with the two professional staff members here today, how much people care about the library and care about its future.

367
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:38,127
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to thank the mayor and the administration for what they've done and coming out today, rather than the city council fighting the next couple of weeks to get it done.

368
00:48:38,267 --> 00:48:43,471
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's very refreshing to have that come across my desk at 5 o'clock this afternoon.

369
00:48:44,531 --> 00:48:51,856
[SPEAKER_15]: But with all the positivity, and I want to stay positive, we do have to recognize that there is a need for a maintenance plan.

370
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:56,980
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a need for, and it was said by all the councilors tonight, and I'm sure it'll be reiterated,

371
00:48:57,515 --> 00:48:59,397
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a need for a maintenance plan.

372
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:11,388
[SPEAKER_15]: And we say it all the time, whether it's this building, the schools, the library, the DPW yard that was just redone, this city needs to spend more time on maintenance, number one.

373
00:49:11,788 --> 00:49:14,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two, I think we do need a five-year plan.

374
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:21,417
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to, whoever the next mayor is, we need to figure out what we're going to do within the next five years, what grants we can apply for.

375
00:49:21,994 --> 00:49:24,456
[SPEAKER_15]: and how we can move the library forward.

376
00:49:24,856 --> 00:49:28,299
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was very good to hear that there is some sort of plan in the works.

377
00:49:28,379 --> 00:49:39,267
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope the community is involved in that and gets to give input and insight and voice their concerns and what they'd like to see within the next five, six, seven years for the Medford Public Library.

378
00:49:39,347 --> 00:49:42,489
[SPEAKER_15]: So just thank everybody for moving this forward.

379
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:47,633
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's a great step forward for the library.

380
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:48,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

381
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,934
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

382
00:49:49,975 --> 00:49:50,495
[SPEAKER_21]: Counsel Knight.

383
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:52,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you.

384
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:56,789
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you to the Medford Community Coalition for their hard work on this very, very important issue.

385
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,973
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I'm very comfortable supporting this increase in the budget for the library.

386
00:50:02,534 --> 00:50:06,577
[SPEAKER_18]: And the reason I'm supportive of it is because we're not just throwing money at a problem.

387
00:50:06,597 --> 00:50:09,299
[SPEAKER_18]: There's an operational plan for the use of funds that's in place.

388
00:50:09,779 --> 00:50:15,764
[SPEAKER_18]: And based upon the correspondence from the administration that we received today, we're going to have $70,000 for part-time helpers.

389
00:50:16,185 --> 00:50:18,867
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have $30,000 for increased cleaning services.

390
00:50:19,813 --> 00:50:31,040
[SPEAKER_18]: $75,000 for a new employee that would work in the technology field, $60,000 for a new employee that would work as a reference librarian, and $15,000 for new equipment, Mr. President.

391
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,483
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we have a plan and we have an actual dedicated use for these monies, I'm very comfortable supporting this.

392
00:50:37,163 --> 00:50:43,927
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I think that the grassroots effort of the Metro Community Coalition was a driving factor behind the issuance of these funds and the increase in our budget.

393
00:50:44,347 --> 00:50:46,989
[SPEAKER_18]: And for that, I'm very supportive because I value our library.

394
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:50,381
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Pinto.

395
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:58,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President and folks who might be watching who don't have the opportunity to be here tonight and understand how we got to the position that we're in.

396
00:50:59,366 --> 00:51:14,714
[SPEAKER_11]: As a point of clarification, in the budget meeting that we had tonight regarding the Method Public Library, the question was asked of Mr. Boutelier, who is the librarian, why didn't this information come forward on these type of requests come forward before?

397
00:51:14,774 --> 00:51:18,316
[SPEAKER_11]: And he did indicate that the prior budget director through the administration

398
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:20,870
[SPEAKER_11]: told them not to present that to come forward.

399
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:30,857
[SPEAKER_11]: So the scuttlebutt as it relates to why it got to this point right here is a result of the frustration of the folks, you folks, that are here tonight and those folks that might be watching that couldn't make it here tonight.

400
00:51:31,577 --> 00:51:47,547
[SPEAKER_11]: This is nothing more than a reactionary plan, not actionary, reactionary, because the administration understands that the people of this community, especially the people who support the library, are completely frustrated with the inaction going six years to get waivers

401
00:51:48,024 --> 00:51:52,067
[SPEAKER_11]: to get waivers to be certified absolutely makes no sense at all.

402
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:56,290
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to go for one year, two years, okay.

403
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:06,017
[SPEAKER_11]: $225,000, whatever that dollar amount might be or needs to be on an annual basis, that should have been included in the budget to keep this city abreast of where it should be rather than seeking a waiver.

404
00:52:06,337 --> 00:52:09,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Because one of these days a waiver would not be made available.

405
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,862
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the city did not have the finances to pick up on that waiver,

406
00:52:13,266 --> 00:52:17,247
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been sitting on $6.5 million of free cash.

407
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,647
[SPEAKER_11]: $6.5 million of free cash.

408
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:24,529
[SPEAKER_11]: And over the last five to six years, this has been a growing from $1.5 million up to $6.5 million.

409
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:31,170
[SPEAKER_11]: The Memphis Library is like the stepchild to the school buildings, the public buildings in this community.

410
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:33,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caviello, if he was here,

411
00:52:34,636 --> 00:52:42,885
[SPEAKER_11]: And his first term three years ago indicated with these new buildings that we have, these new school buildings, 12 years old, they're already a million dollars in need of repairs.

412
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:45,528
[SPEAKER_11]: That's absolutely unacceptable.

413
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:56,760
[SPEAKER_11]: And you folks out there who are supporters of the library and understand what the value of what a book can do, when a child opens that book and reads it, it's the greatest learning utensil that they have.

414
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,271
[SPEAKER_11]: over and beyond a teacher, making sure that the teacher teaches the right thing.

415
00:53:00,631 --> 00:53:11,413
[SPEAKER_11]: But when that child picks up a book and opens it and reads it and understands what's in that book and puts a smile on his face, whether it's for pleasure or entertainment or whether it's for education, that is great.

416
00:53:12,313 --> 00:53:25,135
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you have a stupid, and that's what I call it, a stupid kiosk parked in front of your public library that stops people to go in there to bring a book or to pay a book off and come out and find a ticket

417
00:53:25,495 --> 00:53:29,076
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the fastest way to lose a patron to come to your Medford Public Library.

418
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:30,756
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe in that.

419
00:53:30,856 --> 00:53:31,717
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't accept it.

420
00:53:32,437 --> 00:53:34,977
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, that is not what a public library is about.

421
00:53:34,997 --> 00:53:36,618
[SPEAKER_11]: A public library is like a school.

422
00:53:36,698 --> 00:53:38,298
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a basis of education.

423
00:53:38,518 --> 00:53:41,159
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a central point in this community of Medford.

424
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:46,620
[SPEAKER_11]: You folks out there tonight, and those who might be watching, you folks made this happen.

425
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,161
[SPEAKER_11]: You were the actionary force that called the mayor's hand.

426
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,881
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's how you got it done.

427
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:54,862
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope this doesn't have to be done in every other part of this budget.

428
00:53:55,397 --> 00:53:59,878
[SPEAKER_11]: But you folks should be complimenting yourselves, knowing your kids are going to have a library.

429
00:54:00,178 --> 00:54:07,459
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I have my way, you won't ever have to come before this podium to ask for this again, because it'll be there each and every year like it's supposed to be.

430
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,721
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Counselor Penta.

431
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:14,581
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselor Marks.

432
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:16,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

433
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:24,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was mentioned at the Committee of the Whole meeting that I think when we talk about a public library,

434
00:54:25,164 --> 00:54:34,511
[SPEAKER_06]: The vision that many of us have, especially people that have been around for a while, is a place where you go and look up periodicals and read the newspaper and get online and so forth.

435
00:54:35,312 --> 00:54:43,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the vision that many of us have now in our community is that we don't have to stick with the old vision of what a library used to be.

436
00:54:43,498 --> 00:54:48,302
[SPEAKER_06]: We can present our own vision of having a quality gathering space

437
00:54:49,018 --> 00:55:03,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Potentially, it was mentioned about having maybe an area that serves coffee and muffins or, you know, an area where people can get together and show off things that may be of interest to them.

438
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:15,959
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many different uses that could take place in that building that would increase the image of the building and also increase the participation at that library.

439
00:55:16,678 --> 00:55:20,759
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was mentioned tonight, I mentioned it at the meeting about a five-year plan.

440
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:27,241
[SPEAKER_06]: We were told by Brian Boutelier and that there is one in the works right now.

441
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:30,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that plan comes to fruition.

442
00:55:30,182 --> 00:55:35,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it gets posted online on the city website and anywhere else that people can access it.

443
00:55:36,244 --> 00:55:44,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope there's going to be plenty of community involvement for suggestions and opinions on what they'd like to see the library

444
00:55:45,040 --> 00:56:01,994
[SPEAKER_06]: be within the next five years and where we should be in the next five years, but make no mistake about it, that what took place today was a groundswell that I haven't seen in this community in quite some time.

445
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to see what happened today through the Meffitt Community Coalition, the Friends of the Meffitt Public Library,

446
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:26,098
[SPEAKER_06]: and all the other residents not connected to any particular group that expressed their interest in the library, expressed the fact that their children has had use in the past of the library.

447
00:56:26,438 --> 00:56:36,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember growing up, we used to have a satellite in West Method by the fire station, a library, and over tough economic times, that was the first to be cut.

448
00:56:37,265 --> 00:56:42,488
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd like to see this interest in our library expand throughout the community.

449
00:56:43,212 --> 00:56:45,213
[SPEAKER_06]: because we really need the public input.

450
00:56:45,814 --> 00:56:50,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I stated, what happened today was, in my opinion, a miracle.

451
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:57,822
[SPEAKER_06]: The new growth the mayor talks about is something that has been under construction for several months now.

452
00:56:58,342 --> 00:57:01,144
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's new growth that we knew about eight months ago.

453
00:57:01,925 --> 00:57:03,646
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we don't just start construction.

454
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:06,247
[SPEAKER_06]: That project has been in the work for well over a year.

455
00:57:06,787 --> 00:57:07,927
[SPEAKER_06]: So the money is out there.

456
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:10,748
[SPEAKER_06]: As Councilor Pinto said, we have over six million in free cash.

457
00:57:11,249 --> 00:57:12,209
[SPEAKER_06]: The money is out there.

458
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,830
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a matter of priorities.

459
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:24,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think when the administration saw that we are no longer going to sit back and just accept what's given to us, that we're going to get out there, we're going to fight for what we want as a community.

460
00:57:24,634 --> 00:57:27,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's when the mayor finally gave in and said, you know what?

461
00:57:28,633 --> 00:57:37,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't go for a seventh year of having a waiver because, you know, we're losing residents to surrounding communities.

462
00:57:37,836 --> 00:57:53,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've received more emails from people, as we heard tonight, that are going to Lexington Public Library, the Winchester Public Library, and there's no reason why you should have to leave your own city to go to a place that's comfortable and safe for our children and our residents to attend.

463
00:57:54,938 --> 00:58:14,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to a future that talks about capital improvement, investments in the library, expanding the second floor in the library, looking at ways of adding staff to a severely underfunded staff and underfunded budget.

464
00:58:14,923 --> 00:58:21,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And believe me, we may get the additional funding next year just to maintain what we currently have, as the speaker said.

465
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:22,960
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not enough.

466
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,081
[SPEAKER_06]: That maintains the status quo.

467
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:49,568
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to go above the status quo in our community and ask that the administration and whoever's mayor, that they fund the things that we feel are appropriate to our community and that, you know, improve the value of our homes and improve the lifestyle and a host of other things that a public library brings into a community, as well as education and community programming

468
00:58:50,298 --> 00:58:53,579
[SPEAKER_06]: and the ability to meet other people in your community.

469
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,540
[SPEAKER_06]: The list goes on and on.

470
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And Barbara, I know you're still here.

471
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:06,043
[SPEAKER_06]: There used to be a little box in the front with a glass top that people would come in that saved old buttons, election buttons.

472
00:59:07,463 --> 00:59:08,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that still present in something?

473
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:19,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be a great thing to expand on someday in a community room where people can bring things of interest and have nights where you swap things and so forth.

474
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:28,512
[SPEAKER_06]: and talk about antique cars or anything that may bring some interest back into a public library.

475
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:30,393
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like the direction we're going in.

476
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:34,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say we all have to stay on top of this for the future of our library.

477
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:35,534
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thank all the participation.

478
00:59:39,954 --> 00:59:41,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

479
00:59:41,675 --> 00:59:42,935
[SPEAKER_21]: Ma'am, you'd like to address the council.

480
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:44,435
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

481
00:59:44,675 --> 00:59:46,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

482
00:59:46,756 --> 00:59:49,216
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I want to thank you all for showing up tonight.

483
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:54,777
[SPEAKER_00]: It does feel like a dam has been broken open with the public, and I think that's a wonderful thing.

484
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:57,918
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a proponent of the library.

485
00:59:58,318 --> 00:59:59,178
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the library.

486
00:59:59,418 --> 01:00:00,018
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep it.

487
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:01,419
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that idea.

488
01:00:01,439 --> 01:00:07,641
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Mr. Marks that talked to me about adding a second floor, making a meeting space maybe for the arts community.

489
01:00:07,721 --> 01:00:08,361
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm for that.

490
01:00:08,861 --> 01:00:10,482
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we need to buy it for me.

491
01:00:10,762 --> 01:00:12,002
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to buy another building.

492
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:13,763
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take care of the buildings we have first.

493
01:00:14,603 --> 01:00:19,506
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do believe that the business community should be talking to the library community.

494
01:00:19,906 --> 01:00:22,648
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the arts community should be talking to the police department.

495
01:00:23,068 --> 01:00:31,353
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that all these little groups should be talking to each other, and maybe one of those spaces could be the Medford Public Library, because we all need to come together.

496
01:00:31,553 --> 01:00:36,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am a proponent of the library more than a lot of other projects in the city.

497
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:42,600
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to say, and I know I'm going to bust your bubble, which is the police station has to come first.

498
01:00:43,603 --> 01:00:45,244
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you paid for the $250,000.

499
01:00:45,404 --> 01:00:47,186
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad it came out of the sky.

500
01:00:47,786 --> 01:00:50,708
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea where it came from, but I'm glad it came out of the sky.

501
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:53,831
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm for funding that.

502
01:00:54,551 --> 01:01:01,436
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also need to be behind the police department and the fire department headquarters, because that needs to come first.

503
01:01:02,317 --> 01:01:04,338
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am for the library, and I think it's great.

504
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:09,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the partnership with Chevalier Theater, I went to see Frankie and Ella.

505
01:01:09,698 --> 01:01:11,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday night, it was a fantastic show.

506
01:01:11,681 --> 01:01:18,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the library and the community, if we do put on a second floor after we build the police station,

507
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:35,334
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put on a second floor and we have the arts community in there with the library, I love the idea of coffee and some kind of, you know, donuts or whatever, bagels or whatever, so that you can sit down, read a book, play on your computer, your latest gadget, and make it a meeting space.

508
01:01:35,374 --> 01:01:36,055
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all for that.

509
01:01:36,095 --> 01:01:36,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's wonderful.

510
01:01:37,617 --> 01:01:39,579
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that should be part of the business.

511
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,941
[SPEAKER_00]: district of Medford Square.

512
01:01:42,682 --> 01:01:52,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that all of these people need to sit down at the same time because you have the Rotary sits over here and they have their business meeting and arts community has their meetings.

513
01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:54,390
[SPEAKER_00]: These people need to crossbreed.

514
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:59,173
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to cross ideas and we need to see it as one big Medford Square.

515
01:02:00,014 --> 01:02:05,337
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that if we build it out, I see the Medford Public Library as part of that bigger plan.

516
01:02:05,758 --> 01:02:06,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

517
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,872
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to receive and place on file.

518
01:02:17,152 --> 01:02:18,353
[SPEAKER_21]: You wish to speak on this matter?

519
01:02:18,773 --> 01:02:19,314
[SPEAKER_21]: On the library?

520
01:02:20,995 --> 01:02:21,335
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

521
01:02:22,836 --> 01:02:25,218
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to receive and place on file.

522
01:02:25,258 --> 01:02:26,099
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

523
01:02:26,759 --> 01:02:27,180
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

524
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:28,801
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

525
01:02:29,922 --> 01:02:34,906
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion by Councilor Camuso for suspension of the rules to take paper on the hand of the clerk.

526
01:02:35,326 --> 01:02:36,087
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

527
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:37,328
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

528
01:02:38,248 --> 01:02:42,972
[SPEAKER_21]: Offered by Councilor Camuso be it resolved that the Medford City Council adjourns this evening

529
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:49,344
[SPEAKER_21]: in memory of former governor, RGO Paul Cellucci, who passed away two years ago today.

530
01:02:49,844 --> 01:02:50,765
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Camuso.

531
01:02:51,405 --> 01:02:52,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

532
01:02:53,027 --> 01:02:58,490
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, two years ago, we lost a great person, and that was Governor Cellucci.

533
01:02:59,011 --> 01:03:01,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was very instrumental here in our community.

534
01:03:02,513 --> 01:03:05,635
[SPEAKER_09]: He lost his battle with ALS, I'm sure most of us are aware.

535
01:03:06,035 --> 01:03:08,477
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd just like to adjourn this evening in his memory.

536
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:12,540
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the one thing that I remember specifically about Governor Cellucci,

537
01:03:12,987 --> 01:03:20,149
[SPEAKER_09]: was I had the distinct honor of being sworn in by him 16 years ago at the Chevalier Auditorium.

538
01:03:20,729 --> 01:03:21,949
[SPEAKER_09]: It was when I first got sworn in.

539
01:03:22,529 --> 01:03:26,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And one thing that was evident was his ability to work with people.

540
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:38,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether you were Mike McGlynn, the Democrat, staunch Democrat for years, or at the time, people like our senior member, staunch Republican, he worked with everybody.

541
01:03:39,094 --> 01:03:39,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Worked with everybody.

542
01:03:40,247 --> 01:03:46,012
[SPEAKER_09]: He was friends with Republicans, friends with Democrats, and he just was a really good guy, and he helped Medford a lot.

543
01:03:46,432 --> 01:03:52,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd just like to keep his memory alive by adjourning this evening in memory of him who passed away two years ago.

544
01:03:54,158 --> 01:04:04,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Several years ago, when I was still in religion, I was invited by a prominent local attorney at a fundraiser for Governor Slucci to give the invocation there.

545
01:04:05,087 --> 01:04:06,649
[SPEAKER_21]: Great man, great leader.

546
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:07,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Super.

547
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:08,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta?

548
01:04:10,285 --> 01:04:21,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Camuso for bringing this up because one of my greatest feelings in government was being the chairperson for Governor Salucci here in the city of Medford.

549
01:04:21,954 --> 01:04:25,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And as everyone knows, this is an extremely democratic community.

550
01:04:26,337 --> 01:04:28,459
[SPEAKER_11]: But we won the city of Medford by six votes.

551
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:37,505
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was a great accomplishment because it was just symptomatic of his winning throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

552
01:04:37,646 --> 01:04:39,527
[SPEAKER_11]: He definitely was a people's person.

553
01:04:39,985 --> 01:04:44,008
[SPEAKER_11]: He had a wonderful father, I met him, wonderful wife and two beautiful daughters.

554
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:48,151
[SPEAKER_11]: He just really exemplified what a leader should be.

555
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:50,953
[SPEAKER_11]: He never threw his weight around to say, I'm the governor.

556
01:04:50,993 --> 01:04:57,798
[SPEAKER_11]: He was just, he could walk in here right now and he would sit down and he would just be like one of the people, truly exemplifying what a leader should be all about.

557
01:04:58,298 --> 01:05:05,403
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am very fortunate to have had that pleasure and that honor to not only work on this committee, but to be his campaign manager here in the city of Medford.

558
01:05:06,009 --> 01:05:18,693
[SPEAKER_11]: and very proud of the fact that not only did he win here in the city of Medford, but more importantly, he won for all the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, because I think his record, upon reflection, will show that he definitely was a people's person and governor.

559
01:05:19,073 --> 01:05:19,593
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

560
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Counselor.

561
01:05:21,113 --> 01:05:21,753
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion.

562
01:05:21,993 --> 01:05:31,196
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I may, before, as Counselor Penta said, for Counselor Penta to run the campaign here as a Republican in Medford, for him to win by six votes, it's unheard of, Counselor.

563
01:05:32,276 --> 01:05:32,836
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why.

564
01:05:32,977 --> 01:05:33,917
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why they love them.

565
01:05:34,037 --> 01:05:34,537
[SPEAKER_11]: But wait a minute.

566
01:05:34,882 --> 01:05:40,365
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's why this November, I'm going to win and be your new mayor.

567
01:05:40,465 --> 01:05:43,467
[SPEAKER_21]: How's that?

568
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:44,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I'm sorry.

569
01:05:46,048 --> 01:05:48,090
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

570
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:48,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

571
01:05:50,271 --> 01:05:52,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

572
01:05:52,752 --> 01:06:00,697
[SPEAKER_21]: While we're under suspension, 15-527 petition by Alexander Della Pace of a Laundry Unlimited

573
01:06:02,298 --> 01:06:09,620
[SPEAKER_21]: 4110 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford for keno to go monitor to be installed at 4110 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford.

574
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,740
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you here, Mr. Della Pace?

575
01:06:13,401 --> 01:06:20,182
[SPEAKER_21]: And do we have, whose committee is this?

576
01:06:20,202 --> 01:06:22,983
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

577
01:06:23,623 --> 01:06:25,003
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Alex Della Pace.

578
01:06:25,584 --> 01:06:29,484
[SPEAKER_19]: I work at the Circle Laundry at 110 Mystic Valley Parkway.

579
01:06:29,504 --> 01:06:31,365
[SPEAKER_19]: I live in Waltham, Massachusetts.

580
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:33,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

581
01:06:34,097 --> 01:06:35,378
[SPEAKER_21]: And you're in favor of this matter?

582
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:35,898
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

583
01:06:36,298 --> 01:06:36,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

584
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:37,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselor Penta.

585
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you just say you work there or do you own the store?

586
01:06:40,481 --> 01:06:40,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I own the store.

587
01:06:40,982 --> 01:06:43,884
[SPEAKER_11]: You own the store and you're the applicant for the license, correct?

588
01:06:44,224 --> 01:06:44,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

589
01:06:44,825 --> 01:06:45,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

590
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:46,306
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't understand that.

591
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:46,666
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

592
01:06:47,406 --> 01:06:55,693
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselor Knight of the licensing committee in the absence of Chairman Caviello, do you have a recommendation for us?

593
01:06:55,753 --> 01:06:57,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, the paperwork appears in order.

594
01:06:57,434 --> 01:06:57,614
[SPEAKER_17]: I would

595
01:06:58,133 --> 01:07:01,774
[SPEAKER_17]: move for approval because the paperwork is in order and it's a conforming use.

596
01:07:01,814 --> 01:07:03,314
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I'd like to be recorded in opposition.

597
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:04,855
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

598
01:07:04,995 --> 01:07:05,955
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

599
01:07:06,135 --> 01:07:12,936
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may ask the clerk through the chair, how many Kino licenses do we have in laundry establishments?

600
01:07:14,277 --> 01:07:14,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

601
01:07:14,777 --> 01:07:18,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that, is that, that's an allowable use, but.

602
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,019
[SPEAKER_22]: This might be the only one.

603
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:23,179
[SPEAKER_22]: First one.

604
01:07:24,479 --> 01:07:26,960
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I mean, this particular petitioner has, um,

605
01:07:29,352 --> 01:07:37,496
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe, other lottery items, the tickets, the megabucks, and all that kind of stuff like that.

606
01:07:37,516 --> 01:07:43,258
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have a little, can you explain your establishment a little bit more?

607
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:44,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there like a little convenience type?

608
01:07:45,779 --> 01:07:48,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Or it's just lottery with a clerk?

609
01:07:49,161 --> 01:07:50,001
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a laundromat.

610
01:07:50,021 --> 01:07:51,242
[SPEAKER_19]: It's by cleaning drop off store.

611
01:07:51,862 --> 01:07:53,823
[SPEAKER_19]: And we sell lottery tickets.

612
01:07:53,843 --> 01:07:57,524
[SPEAKER_19]: We have the machine to sell mega millions, megabucks, etc.

613
01:07:58,485 --> 01:07:59,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Scratch tickets?

614
01:07:59,892 --> 01:08:00,193
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

615
01:08:00,733 --> 01:08:02,555
[SPEAKER_15]: So somebody's always there working the counter.

616
01:08:02,635 --> 01:08:03,716
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always got attended.

617
01:08:03,736 --> 01:08:03,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

618
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:04,377
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

619
01:08:05,518 --> 01:08:05,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

620
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:07,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

621
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:19,213
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion of approval by council, no, on the motion of approval by counseling night, who wishes to be marked in opposition, all those in favor.

622
01:08:31,464 --> 01:08:32,224
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

623
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:36,085
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

624
01:08:36,105 --> 01:08:36,865
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

625
01:08:37,825 --> 01:08:38,626
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

626
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:42,146
[SPEAKER_21]: The chair is in doubt.

627
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:45,507
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

628
01:08:46,427 --> 01:08:47,147
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is to?

629
01:08:48,388 --> 01:08:49,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Grant the keno license.

630
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:51,048
[SPEAKER_21]: Not in opposition.

631
01:08:51,188 --> 01:08:52,048
[SPEAKER_21]: Not in opposition.

632
01:08:52,088 --> 01:08:53,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I ask one more question?

633
01:08:54,722 --> 01:08:55,963
[SPEAKER_22]: Not in oppositional care.

634
01:08:56,003 --> 01:08:57,444
[SPEAKER_22]: Not in oppositional care.

635
01:08:58,365 --> 01:08:59,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one more question.

636
01:08:59,726 --> 01:09:01,007
[SPEAKER_21]: Councillor Longo-Curran.

637
01:09:01,107 --> 01:09:01,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, through the chair.

638
01:09:02,948 --> 01:09:08,112
[SPEAKER_15]: With regards to notification, how far, how many people were notified on this?

639
01:09:11,155 --> 01:09:12,456
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as neighbours are concerned?

640
01:09:13,076 --> 01:09:18,460
[SPEAKER_22]: This is something that the lottery takes care of through newspaper advertising.

641
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:21,062
[SPEAKER_22]: Not anything the city does.

642
01:09:21,082 --> 01:09:22,163
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a lottery.

643
01:09:22,243 --> 01:09:24,225
[SPEAKER_22]: They're just giving the consideration to the cities if

644
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:31,116
[SPEAKER_22]: if they oppose it or don't oppose it, but it's not a hearing type deal.

645
01:09:33,178 --> 01:09:35,579
[SPEAKER_21]: So a yes vote is for no opposition.

646
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:36,199
[SPEAKER_21]: No opposition.

647
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,241
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

648
01:09:39,681 --> 01:09:40,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Pinto.

649
01:09:41,442 --> 01:09:42,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me ask you a question, sir.

650
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,924
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a laundry mat.

651
01:09:44,344 --> 01:09:44,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

652
01:09:44,944 --> 01:09:48,626
[SPEAKER_11]: And you want to put a Kino license in there and you want to put Kino in the laundry map?

653
01:09:48,806 --> 01:09:49,007
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

654
01:09:51,768 --> 01:09:53,189
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

655
01:09:53,363 --> 01:10:01,609
[SPEAKER_18]: It's my understanding that you already have the ability to sell Kino and now you just want to put the screen in so that people can sit there and watch their numbers come up while they're washing their clothes, right?

656
01:10:01,649 --> 01:10:01,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

657
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:08,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, is the other part of that, is the requirement that you have to have somebody in there at a desk, at a Kino desk to make sure that they're the right age?

658
01:10:09,655 --> 01:10:11,677
[SPEAKER_19]: We have an attendant at all times.

659
01:10:12,357 --> 01:10:13,658
[SPEAKER_11]: You have an attendant there at all times?

660
01:10:13,698 --> 01:10:13,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

661
01:10:17,861 --> 01:10:19,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

662
01:10:20,603 --> 01:10:21,264
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Camuccio.

663
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:23,878
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caviello?

664
01:10:24,039 --> 01:10:24,219
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

665
01:10:25,259 --> 01:10:25,820
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

666
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,200
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

667
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:28,381
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Laura Kern?

668
01:10:28,421 --> 01:10:28,521
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

669
01:10:30,863 --> 01:10:31,403
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

670
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:31,483
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

671
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:33,164
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Penta?

672
01:10:34,145 --> 01:10:34,205
Yes.

673
01:10:34,245 --> 01:10:35,026
[SPEAKER_22]: President DelaRusso?

674
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:36,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

675
01:10:36,847 --> 01:10:39,108
[SPEAKER_21]: With a vote of six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

676
01:10:39,608 --> 01:10:41,209
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations, keynote to go.

677
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:42,050
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

678
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:52,857
[SPEAKER_21]: While we're under suspension, offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that a Medford business person appear before the council to explain his

679
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:58,564
[SPEAKER_21]: most recent experience with the Republic parking kiosk people.

680
01:10:59,544 --> 01:11:04,127
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Businessman, please come to the podium and state your name and address for the record.

681
01:11:08,909 --> 01:11:10,130
[SPEAKER_10]: John Warren Stonem.

682
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:16,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I work at the Medford Tax Experts, 425 High Street, West Medford.

683
01:11:17,814 --> 01:11:22,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I distributed an email over the weekend asking

684
01:11:23,435 --> 01:11:39,227
[SPEAKER_10]: The council, for consideration of two points, there's a Park Medford program in the city and I don't see where the Park Medford program is held accountable or responsible for the enforcement.

685
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:47,152
[SPEAKER_10]: The issue specific to West Medford is the parking lot where the signage says, two hour business.

686
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:49,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I got my hair cut today and

687
01:11:50,934 --> 01:11:57,218
[SPEAKER_10]: At the salon, I didn't bring this up, but that was the discussion, it's three hours free parking.

688
01:11:58,419 --> 01:12:03,962
[SPEAKER_10]: In my request for dismissal, it was stated, the lot is not a free lot.

689
01:12:05,023 --> 01:12:12,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Now when the program was put in place in January, I drove down to the Park Medfit office in South Medfit to find out the rules.

690
01:12:13,668 --> 01:12:15,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't be in business if my customers are getting tickets.

691
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:20,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I was told the lot was off the program.

692
01:12:20,838 --> 01:12:25,840
[SPEAKER_10]: that it was unnecessary for me to buy a business permit.

693
01:12:26,941 --> 01:12:32,683
[SPEAKER_10]: The appeal process of this is being heard by Park Medford.

694
01:12:33,803 --> 01:12:44,508
[SPEAKER_10]: My suggestion is that there be a citizen council or something else to review the behavior of Park Medford.

695
01:12:45,188 --> 01:12:49,910
[SPEAKER_10]: The signage is inadequate, the communications is lacking.

696
01:12:51,503 --> 01:12:54,485
[SPEAKER_10]: I get a phone call this afternoon, a customer.

697
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:59,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if I pay the ticket, she won't come back.

698
01:13:00,889 --> 01:13:04,912
[SPEAKER_10]: She won't shop or dine in Medford.

699
01:13:06,113 --> 01:13:11,917
[SPEAKER_10]: She parked in front of the funeral home where there was no signage and there's no parking kiosks.

700
01:13:13,057 --> 01:13:19,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I explained to her, as I did anyone that I sat down to do business with, here are some quarters, please put something in there.

701
01:13:20,342 --> 01:13:22,623
[SPEAKER_10]: When she got down to a car, there was a ticket on it.

702
01:13:24,044 --> 01:13:24,724
[SPEAKER_10]: She appealed it.

703
01:13:25,844 --> 01:13:26,685
[SPEAKER_10]: She's from Malden.

704
01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:32,127
[SPEAKER_10]: She understands we have to pay to park, but there's parking meters and signage.

705
01:13:32,727 --> 01:13:37,129
[SPEAKER_10]: So people who want to do the right thing know what they're supposed to do.

706
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:47,294
[SPEAKER_10]: My second point that I want to make tonight before the council is that there's a seven-day payment requirement.

707
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,712
[SPEAKER_10]: or my car is subject to being impounded.

708
01:13:51,753 --> 01:13:57,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I could be down in the Cape for two weeks this summer or taking the kids to Disney.

709
01:13:58,796 --> 01:14:03,639
[SPEAKER_10]: MedFed has a student transit population.

710
01:14:04,959 --> 01:14:08,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they moved after the semester, and the U.S.

711
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:11,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Post Office might not get that message to them in seven days.

712
01:14:12,443 --> 01:14:15,785
[SPEAKER_10]: There are several issues in the administration of this program.

713
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:19,377
[SPEAKER_10]: that really needs some supervision and review.

714
01:14:20,438 --> 01:14:24,139
[SPEAKER_10]: And I ask your help to make the program run better, please.

715
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your consideration.

716
01:14:30,582 --> 01:14:31,922
[SPEAKER_11]: You got a ticket yourself, correct?

717
01:14:32,803 --> 01:14:33,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get a ticket yourself?

718
01:14:34,343 --> 01:14:34,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.

719
01:14:35,344 --> 01:14:44,668
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was the first I learned that the rules had changed of the lot in West Medford.

720
01:14:46,425 --> 01:14:52,668
[SPEAKER_10]: When I went there to ask what the rules were for the village, I was told I didn't need a business permit.

721
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:55,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, after I got the ticket, I got the business permit.

722
01:14:56,349 --> 01:15:02,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight, I parked here at City Hall, and it said, permit for municipal employees two hours business.

723
01:15:03,753 --> 01:15:06,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, it's possible we're all gonna get tickets, because the rules have changed.

724
01:15:07,194 --> 01:15:07,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I really don't know.

725
01:15:09,155 --> 01:15:11,496
[SPEAKER_10]: There has to be a better way to communicate the rules.

726
01:15:12,076 --> 01:15:13,557
[SPEAKER_10]: There has to be better signage.

727
01:15:14,396 --> 01:15:22,802
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a community, we really should be holding Park Medved up to the level of responsibility that we're holding the citizens to.

728
01:15:24,923 --> 01:15:38,493
[SPEAKER_11]: On this subject that you're talking, you're not the first person to complain, but you're saying something that rings true to all the parking lots, because that signage was supposed to be changed to three hours, and it's still at two hours.

729
01:15:39,374 --> 01:15:43,937
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you notice, when you talked about the funeral home, if you look across the street in front of a two-family house,

730
01:15:44,587 --> 01:15:51,349
[SPEAKER_11]: There were people still packing out there and trying to put money in front of that two-family house that was supposed to come down in January when the chief of police was here.

731
01:15:51,369 --> 01:15:57,471
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of the first nights we had this huge discussion on kiosks in the square in certain locations.

732
01:16:00,191 --> 01:16:05,373
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just symptomatic of why this whole system has to go, because it's inconsistent.

733
01:16:05,413 --> 01:16:06,033
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unfair.

734
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:09,434
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't truly reflect upon you as a businessperson.

735
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:22,187
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're going to have to be worried about where your patrons go, and if they're going to get a ticket, and if they're going to express they're not coming back, like you said, if there were meters or something more easily understandable, hey, you see a meter, you know what a meter means.

736
01:16:22,808 --> 01:16:28,471
[SPEAKER_11]: But the city didn't go that option, and they went through this idea of kiosks, and some of the spots just don't make any sense.

737
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:31,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, you talked about in front of the funeral home where you're at.

738
01:16:31,933 --> 01:16:35,455
[SPEAKER_11]: In front of Elmont Glass, I believe, there's a kiosk, and if you go further up the street,

739
01:16:36,062 --> 01:16:39,804
[SPEAKER_11]: In front of a dentist's office, there's a kiosk, which makes absolutely no sense at all.

740
01:16:40,644 --> 01:16:47,167
[SPEAKER_11]: You go across the street in West Medford Square in front of a shoe store on the side street by the railroad tracks, he has a kiosk.

741
01:16:48,068 --> 01:16:55,792
[SPEAKER_11]: But you go further down the street in West Medford to the Arlington line, where there's a block of stores there, and there's no kiosk.

742
01:16:56,492 --> 01:17:04,376
[SPEAKER_11]: You go on Boston Avenue, the corner of Boston Avenue and Arlington Street, I believe there's eight stores there, businesses, and there's no kiosk there.

743
01:17:05,268 --> 01:17:17,710
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a huge inconsistency, it's absolutely totally unfair, and whatever you could come up with, a suggestion to me would be, I wouldn't want to amend it, I'd want to get rid of it, because it doesn't serve any purpose.

744
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,891
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not what this council was looking for.

745
01:17:20,531 --> 01:17:29,633
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee that first formed to review all of this was to have a traffic enforcement, not a traffic enhancement program, revenue enhancement, especially to an out-of-towner.

746
01:17:29,873 --> 01:17:32,233
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank you for coming and telling us your plight.

747
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:56,711
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just one of many, and since tonight, this afternoon, when I met this lady, she indicated to me not only that she put the money in the machine, the machine said it didn't take the money, and when she finally put it in a second time, she got a receipt for another car, which wasn't hers, which means that the person prior to her did not take her receipt.

748
01:17:57,332 --> 01:18:00,953
[SPEAKER_11]: So now, she put the money in, she has no, so that's now, she's up to 50 cents.

749
01:18:01,857 --> 01:18:07,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Now she had to put a third quarter in to make it 75, so it spit out her number plate on that particular receipt.

750
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,561
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there's just so many things, just so many problems with this thing.

751
01:18:11,962 --> 01:18:15,263
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sorry, as a business person, because that's what my concern is.

752
01:18:15,663 --> 01:18:24,787
[SPEAKER_11]: You're the guy, the small business person that's getting hurt throughout this entire community, and I apologize on behalf of the city that you have to go through that, but I can assure you, it's gonna go.

753
01:18:25,688 --> 01:18:26,068
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna go.

754
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:35,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, and I appreciate the gentleman at the podium's comments.

755
01:18:37,365 --> 01:18:43,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Over the past several, three or four weeks, it's been discussed that it's gonna go, it's gotta go.

756
01:18:43,567 --> 01:18:45,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are we gonna fund the $800,000 from?

757
01:18:46,168 --> 01:18:48,989
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the question, because it's gotta go is one thing.

758
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:52,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this council took a vote that we'd like to see it go, but you have to pay for it.

759
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,431
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a library that was looking for $250,000 this evening to just maintain

760
01:19:00,977 --> 01:19:09,022
[SPEAKER_09]: status accredited and to be, not accredited, but to be part of the Minuteman Association, $800,000 of taxpayer money.

761
01:19:09,342 --> 01:19:10,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are we going to take it from?

762
01:19:12,444 --> 01:19:16,846
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't say that we'll just take them to court and get out of the contract because that's... Point of information.

763
01:19:17,406 --> 01:19:22,529
[SPEAKER_11]: That dollar amount is absolutely incorrect because right now nobody knows what that dollar amount might be.

764
01:19:22,809 --> 01:19:25,451
[SPEAKER_11]: If you read the contract and the contract talks within the first year,

765
01:19:26,013 --> 01:19:31,179
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe the first year the stat up number is 900,000, but they've collected almost close to 300,000 so far.

766
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:34,003
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are seven infractions in this contract.

767
01:19:34,457 --> 01:19:35,317
[SPEAKER_11]: in the contract.

768
01:19:35,557 --> 01:19:37,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Name the major one that you could go to court and get rid of them with.

769
01:19:38,198 --> 01:19:40,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Name the infraction.

770
01:19:40,639 --> 01:19:43,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Name the infraction that you think a judge would say, you know what, Medford?

771
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:44,160
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

772
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Get rid of them at no charge.

773
01:19:45,601 --> 01:19:46,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Name the infraction.

774
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:47,482
[SPEAKER_09]: You said there's seven.

775
01:19:47,962 --> 01:19:49,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't have my book with me tonight.

776
01:19:49,382 --> 01:19:52,803
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't realize we were going to get into this, but one of the real main ones is when- You said seven.

777
01:19:53,264 --> 01:19:53,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you wait a minute?

778
01:19:53,984 --> 01:19:54,584
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

779
01:19:54,604 --> 01:20:00,146
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the real main ones was when the gentleman, Mr. Nash, came here, they were supposed to have a public program that

780
01:20:01,423 --> 01:20:05,366
[SPEAKER_11]: indoctrinated their employees to what they were supposed to do, knowing the streets.

781
01:20:05,446 --> 01:20:07,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, tagging people who had permits.

782
01:20:07,748 --> 01:20:12,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, driving around the streets of the city of Medford without having their cars properly leaded.

783
01:20:12,372 --> 01:20:16,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three, giving tickets out in public parking lots.

784
01:20:17,315 --> 01:20:20,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Four, five, I just don't have it here.

785
01:20:21,739 --> 01:20:23,020
[SPEAKER_11]: They're there, they're there.

786
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,461
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe Councillor Camuso has the floor.

787
01:20:25,481 --> 01:20:28,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So the five that he just mentioned, there's not one that would,

788
01:20:29,044 --> 01:20:34,387
[SPEAKER_09]: put us out of the contract in a reasonable person's, um, as far as I'm concerned.

789
01:20:34,687 --> 01:20:37,649
[SPEAKER_09]: But the rhetoric saying we can just get rid of it, this and that, we have to pay for it.

790
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:43,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd just like to know where, because, because bring something forward, tangible, where the dollars and cents are going to come from, and then we'll look at it.

791
01:20:43,792 --> 01:20:44,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know something, Councillor?

792
01:20:45,193 --> 01:20:45,874
[SPEAKER_11]: That's your opinion.

793
01:20:45,894 --> 01:20:47,434
[SPEAKER_11]: In my, I feel very, very comfortable.

794
01:20:47,474 --> 01:20:48,015
[SPEAKER_11]: You know something?

795
01:20:48,575 --> 01:20:55,940
[SPEAKER_11]: You were on this council when the vote took place a few years ago to take a million dollars from the water and sewer account to balance the budget of the mayor's budget, okay?

796
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,721
[SPEAKER_11]: You took it from one account because you couldn't balance the budget.

797
01:20:58,942 --> 01:21:00,322
[SPEAKER_11]: You took over a million dollars.

798
01:21:00,543 --> 01:21:01,423
[SPEAKER_11]: And you voted for her.

799
01:21:01,463 --> 01:21:02,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And I voted for her too.

800
01:21:02,304 --> 01:21:02,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And you voted for her too.

801
01:21:02,964 --> 01:21:04,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And I voted for her too, okay?

802
01:21:04,465 --> 01:21:04,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

803
01:21:04,685 --> 01:21:07,146
[SPEAKER_11]: But this situation is entirely different.

804
01:21:07,206 --> 01:21:08,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, why are you bringing that up?

805
01:21:08,486 --> 01:21:14,788
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have to pay to get rid of it and to save the small business person, whatever it costs, that's what I would intend to do.

806
01:21:14,808 --> 01:21:15,908
[SPEAKER_09]: So is that going to be your answer to everything?

807
01:21:15,928 --> 01:21:16,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I would mitigate it.

808
01:21:16,428 --> 01:21:17,128
[SPEAKER_11]: I would mitigate it.

809
01:21:17,168 --> 01:21:17,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Pardon me?

810
01:21:17,728 --> 01:21:20,569
[SPEAKER_09]: So your answer to everything is just going to be pay to stop this, pay to stop that?

811
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:21,609
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I said I would mitigate it.

812
01:21:21,629 --> 01:21:22,249
[SPEAKER_09]: The city would be bankrupt.

813
01:21:22,289 --> 01:21:22,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I said I would mitigate it.

814
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:23,630
[SPEAKER_09]: The city would be bankrupt.

815
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:24,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to argue with you anymore.

816
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:26,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know, because you don't have a leg to stand on.

817
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:28,031
[SPEAKER_09]: It just doesn't work.

818
01:21:28,111 --> 01:21:30,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillors, let's focus on the subject matter.

819
01:21:31,352 --> 01:21:32,452
[SPEAKER_09]: As I said, Mr. President,

820
01:21:33,045 --> 01:21:35,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to the gentleman, I'm just sick and tired of the rhetoric saying let's get rid of it.

821
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:39,420
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a tangible something to get rid of it.

822
01:21:40,703 --> 01:21:42,247
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, counselor.

823
01:21:42,968 --> 01:21:52,875
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're sick and tired of the rhetoric, then you should, you are the one, one of the main reasons why we're in this program, because you support the mayor rank and file on every issue.

824
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:58,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not sit back now because some of us want to get out of a program that you supported.

825
01:21:58,858 --> 01:22:00,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought the resolution forward to get rid of it.

826
01:22:00,579 --> 01:22:01,500
[SPEAKER_06]: You brought nothing forward.

827
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor, you brought these minutes to the city.

828
01:22:03,201 --> 01:22:04,382
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go back to the minutes.

829
01:22:04,742 --> 01:22:05,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I have the floor.

830
01:22:05,804 --> 01:22:07,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be disingenuous.

831
01:22:07,546 --> 01:22:09,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be disingenuous.

832
01:22:10,391 --> 01:22:12,073
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad Councilor Marks brought this up.

833
01:22:12,133 --> 01:22:19,545
[SPEAKER_09]: It was him and his committee that he sat on for many years that said we need to have parking enforcement number one and parking meters.

834
01:22:19,845 --> 01:22:22,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the records from the chief of police.

835
01:22:22,648 --> 01:22:26,952
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, he just said it was my committee, which the gentleman doesn't know what he's talking about.

836
01:22:27,012 --> 01:22:33,618
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the mayor's committee, so the gentleman is just spurting out again, like he does every Tuesday night, false information.

837
01:22:33,879 --> 01:22:41,326
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the mayor's committee that you happen to be very friendly with, and now you're trying to back away from him now because he's a lame duck mayor.

838
01:22:41,886 --> 01:22:44,407
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the one that supported this program, rank and file.

839
01:22:44,467 --> 01:22:45,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Same vote as you.

840
01:22:45,147 --> 01:22:46,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And we took the vote.

841
01:22:46,288 --> 01:22:46,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Same vote as you.

842
01:22:46,948 --> 01:22:51,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And we took the vote, Mr. President, with all due respect, to have this program done in-house.

843
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,090
[SPEAKER_06]: You were against taking it in-house.

844
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:55,011
[SPEAKER_06]: You wanted to hire the Tennessee group.

845
01:22:55,311 --> 01:22:56,291
[SPEAKER_06]: That was your stance.

846
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:56,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

847
01:22:56,892 --> 01:22:57,712
[SPEAKER_06]: That was your stance.

848
01:22:58,052 --> 01:23:03,594
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talked, Mr. President, about kiosk on the street, Councilor Camuso was in favor of kiosk on the street.

849
01:23:03,634 --> 01:23:05,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Camuso, point of information.

850
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:08,956
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to talk issues, we'll talk issues.

851
01:23:08,996 --> 01:23:10,337
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk issues.

852
01:23:10,357 --> 01:23:17,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso was the president at the time when I made the motion to have parking meters at the final meeting and not kiosks.

853
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:21,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to just throw out stuff that's not true and inaccurate, listen, you've been doing it for a long time.

854
01:23:21,842 --> 01:23:22,542
[SPEAKER_09]: People are catching on.

855
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:23,382
[SPEAKER_09]: The numbers are going down.

856
01:23:23,763 --> 01:23:26,684
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's, but that's, we'll see if you're here November 4th.

857
01:23:27,264 --> 01:23:33,188
[SPEAKER_09]: But with all due respect, Mr. President, with all due respect, this council voted unanimously for this program.

858
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:39,433
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a valid question to ask a colleague of mine where he's going to get the money to get out of a contract.

859
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:42,320
[SPEAKER_21]: Where is the point of personal privilege?

860
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:45,623
[SPEAKER_11]: He said this council, look, I did not vote for this kiosk program.

861
01:23:45,723 --> 01:23:46,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not vote.

862
01:23:47,165 --> 01:23:54,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I only allowed the mayor to go and to negotiate for a contract up to 10 years and then represent it back to the council and compare it.

863
01:23:54,433 --> 01:23:56,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Check your notes, check your notes, April of 2014.

864
01:23:56,395 --> 01:24:00,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we came back in September 12th of 2014 and we had a two.

865
01:24:02,401 --> 01:24:06,842
[SPEAKER_11]: two rinky dink piece of paper that said confidential as if the city was to do it.

866
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:10,663
[SPEAKER_11]: And the city and the mayor and the budget director at that time would entertain it.

867
01:24:11,123 --> 01:24:13,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Would not entertain it.

868
01:24:13,103 --> 01:24:15,004
[SPEAKER_11]: This is getting so blown out of hand.

869
01:24:15,044 --> 01:24:16,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sticking to my comment.

870
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,345
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I would mitigate to get rid of the program.

871
01:24:19,405 --> 01:24:21,405
[SPEAKER_11]: If he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to like it.

872
01:24:21,465 --> 01:24:22,626
[SPEAKER_11]: He doesn't support me anyway.

873
01:24:22,646 --> 01:24:23,686
[SPEAKER_09]: So what difference should I make?

874
01:24:23,706 --> 01:24:24,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should I think about what he said?

875
01:24:25,286 --> 01:24:25,906
[SPEAKER_09]: As I stated,

876
01:24:29,419 --> 01:24:32,061
[SPEAKER_09]: There are valid concerns out there, but it's thrown around.

877
01:24:32,221 --> 01:24:34,022
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the fourth week in a row that it's been thrown around.

878
01:24:34,062 --> 01:24:35,303
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to get rid of it and do this.

879
01:24:35,623 --> 01:24:37,425
[SPEAKER_09]: People in the community want to know where we're going to get it.

880
01:24:37,465 --> 01:24:38,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to take it from the library funding?

881
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:40,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to take it from the school's funding?

882
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:41,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to take it from the police?

883
01:24:41,447 --> 01:24:46,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are we going to come up with the $800,000 plus to have them take a walk?

884
01:24:46,371 --> 01:24:47,732
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a legitimate question.

885
01:24:48,152 --> 01:24:51,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the counselor feels uncomfortable getting a question asked, then guess what?

886
01:24:52,315 --> 01:24:53,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what to tell him.

887
01:24:53,316 --> 01:24:54,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unfortunate, but back up.

888
01:24:55,177 --> 01:24:56,538
[SPEAKER_09]: You say you wanted to get out of it.

889
01:24:56,972 --> 01:24:57,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of clarification.

890
01:24:57,532 --> 01:24:59,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of clarification, Councilor Longo Kern.

891
01:24:59,672 --> 01:25:00,633
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just so confused.

892
01:25:00,673 --> 01:25:05,514
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pretty sure, wasn't it you, Councilor Camuso, that brought the motion forward to vote to get rid of the parking?

893
01:25:05,554 --> 01:25:05,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

894
01:25:05,914 --> 01:25:07,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Where did you believe we were going to get the money?

895
01:25:07,614 --> 01:25:07,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

896
01:25:08,534 --> 01:25:10,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Where did you believe we were going to get the money when you put that forward?

897
01:25:11,014 --> 01:25:14,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I had an idea, and I didn't present it yet, but we'll see soon.

898
01:25:14,475 --> 01:25:21,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Because with all due respect, with all due respect, with all due respect, I brought the motion forward.

899
01:25:22,757 --> 01:25:25,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I had five members of this council support it.

900
01:25:27,098 --> 01:25:30,881
[SPEAKER_09]: But the councilor that sits across from me wants to talk about it week after week.

901
01:25:30,921 --> 01:25:34,723
[SPEAKER_09]: He hasn't made a tangible effort to bring forward a plan to get rid of it.

902
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:40,007
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, let's move on then, councilors.

903
01:25:40,187 --> 01:25:43,549
[SPEAKER_09]: As I said... Thank you.

904
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:47,692
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor, if you remember... Councilor Camuso has the floor.

905
01:25:48,012 --> 01:25:48,833
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor, please wrap it up.

906
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:54,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll wrap it up, but the request that we had was for the mayor to get out of this and to come up with a plan

907
01:25:55,127 --> 01:25:58,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Penta's throwing it out without a plan, so be it.

908
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councillors.

909
01:26:01,212 --> 01:26:03,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Councillor Penta, let's wrap this up.

910
01:26:04,554 --> 01:26:05,595
[SPEAKER_11]: I am going to wrap it up.

911
01:26:05,615 --> 01:26:06,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I am going to wrap it up.

912
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:09,638
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to dignify the comment he just made that I don't have a plan.

913
01:26:09,718 --> 01:26:13,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have to say anything as to what I'm going to do and how I'm going to do it.

914
01:26:13,741 --> 01:26:16,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm telling you that I would

915
01:26:16,623 --> 01:26:20,104
[SPEAKER_11]: mitigate the plan to get out, and if it's gonna cost money, who cares?

916
01:26:20,424 --> 01:26:24,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm more concerned about saving the businesses that are losing business right now.

917
01:26:24,565 --> 01:26:42,849
[SPEAKER_11]: And if a guy like that has to come here and defend his position as it relates to having to pay quarters to give his patrons to put in a kiosk so he can do business, and the guy down the street with the coffee shop has to do the same thing, and other parts of the city don't have it, that's unfair, that's unjust, and as far as I'm concerned, it's got to go.

918
01:26:43,089 --> 01:26:45,191
[SPEAKER_11]: And whatever it takes to get rid of it, that's what we're going to do.

919
01:26:45,211 --> 01:26:46,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Counselor.

920
01:26:46,972 --> 01:26:47,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Counselor Knight.

921
01:26:48,393 --> 01:26:49,915
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

922
01:26:50,175 --> 01:26:55,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that it's important to note that the resolution that was brought forward was to listen to the concerns that this gentleman had.

923
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:56,860
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've done that.

924
01:26:57,361 --> 01:26:58,742
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's asked us to take some action.

925
01:26:58,782 --> 01:27:07,629
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think it would be important for us to sit down, maybe as a body, and come up with something that we can agree on, that we can present to the Traffic Commission, if, in fact, it is the wishes of this council to get out of the contract.

926
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:10,772
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a little concerned that

927
01:27:11,217 --> 01:27:19,059
[SPEAKER_18]: the meetings are going to start turning into campaign commercials, and we're not going to be taking care of the business that needs to be taken care of, Mr. President.

928
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,340
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I'd appreciate that.

929
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:26,682
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that, you know, we've heard from business owners, and we'll continue to hear from business owners, because it's not a perfect program.

930
01:27:26,922 --> 01:27:27,522
[SPEAKER_18]: The gentleman's right.

931
01:27:27,962 --> 01:27:28,482
[SPEAKER_18]: The gentleman's right.

932
01:27:28,522 --> 01:27:29,443
[SPEAKER_18]: The signage is terrible.

933
01:27:29,823 --> 01:27:30,663
[SPEAKER_18]: The signage is terrible.

934
01:27:30,943 --> 01:27:31,963
[SPEAKER_18]: The communication is terrible.

935
01:27:33,064 --> 01:27:37,145
[SPEAKER_18]: And the relationship that we have with Pac-Medfed could be much stronger.

936
01:27:37,985 --> 01:27:44,769
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the recommendations that we as a council have been giving to people would be when they feel as though there has been a violation of their rights to report it to the Consumer Commission.

937
01:27:45,129 --> 01:27:51,872
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that we have a job here to provide these people with recourse, what direction to go in if in fact they are aggrieved by the situation.

938
01:27:52,593 --> 01:27:55,374
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, rhetoric is great, but action is better, Mr. President.

939
01:27:55,514 --> 01:27:58,656
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I respect Councilor Penta's position.

940
01:27:58,696 --> 01:28:00,577
[SPEAKER_18]: I respect Councilor Camuso's position on the issue.

941
01:28:00,617 --> 01:28:02,378
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a passionate issue.

942
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:04,819
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a big issue that's affecting the community as a whole.

943
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:10,797
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I think that we really need to start providing solutions as opposed to, you know, yelling and screaming and fighting with each other.

944
01:28:11,197 --> 01:28:12,738
[SPEAKER_18]: We all know that the program's not perfect.

945
01:28:12,959 --> 01:28:14,360
[SPEAKER_18]: We all know the program's not perfect.

946
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:17,022
[SPEAKER_18]: The question is, what steps can we take to make it better?

947
01:28:17,702 --> 01:28:19,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Because as of right now, it's not going anywhere.

948
01:28:20,124 --> 01:28:20,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.

949
01:28:20,825 --> 01:28:21,806
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councillor Knight.

950
01:28:22,406 --> 01:28:24,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Sir, there are other people that would like to speak on this matter.

951
01:28:24,828 --> 01:28:26,670
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have anything else to offer to us?

952
01:28:27,782 --> 01:28:28,162
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

953
01:28:28,783 --> 01:28:30,985
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, please state your name and address for the records, please.

954
01:28:31,225 --> 01:28:32,286
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

955
01:28:32,326 --> 01:28:33,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

956
01:28:34,027 --> 01:28:36,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everyone in the council wants a solution to this contract issue.

957
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:38,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe here is our issue.

958
01:28:39,012 --> 01:28:39,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's our solution.

959
01:28:39,932 --> 01:28:41,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It fixes all the problems.

960
01:28:41,134 --> 01:28:42,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read from the contract directly.

961
01:28:42,855 --> 01:28:48,660
[SPEAKER_04]: In section four, chapter D, it says the operator acknowledges, operator being Republic Parking.

962
01:28:49,250 --> 01:29:05,214
[SPEAKER_04]: acknowledges that it is within the exclusive discretion, province, and jurisdiction of the city to set, amend, alter, or change the amount of fees, fines, charges, or other expenses that relate to parking spaces in the city of Medford.

963
01:29:05,654 --> 01:29:09,255
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that we fix the problem is make the parking spaces worth $0.

964
01:29:11,056 --> 01:29:16,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not violate the contract, and it removes this possibility of having any violation

965
01:29:20,119 --> 01:29:25,142
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be a little bit more comfortable relying on legal opinions from the solicitor as opposed to a layperson.

966
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:25,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

967
01:29:26,583 --> 01:29:27,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a lawyer.

968
01:29:27,463 --> 01:29:28,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

969
01:29:28,103 --> 01:29:31,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just providing a possible solution to this parking problem.

970
01:29:31,786 --> 01:29:33,667
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not have to violate the contract.

971
01:29:34,027 --> 01:29:35,928
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not have to pay onerous fees.

972
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:39,511
[SPEAKER_04]: We have control over how the parking works in this city.

973
01:29:40,311 --> 01:29:41,172
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the solution.

974
01:29:41,412 --> 01:29:41,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

975
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:42,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

976
01:29:42,733 --> 01:29:43,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Gesundheit.

977
01:29:47,308 --> 01:29:50,971
[SPEAKER_26]: Mario Martin, formerly from 17 Benton Road at 198 Harvard.

978
01:29:51,952 --> 01:29:53,693
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted to talk about the parking program.

979
01:29:53,713 --> 01:30:01,819
[SPEAKER_26]: I think what Mr. Ruggiero just mentioned was a really good idea, and it supports creativity, which is something that we need, especially with this issue.

980
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:10,165
[SPEAKER_26]: Just to kind of highlight what people are telling me, going around South Medford, I'm

981
01:30:11,432 --> 01:30:13,794
[SPEAKER_26]: what people are telling me about this parking issue.

982
01:30:13,854 --> 01:30:22,461
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's drastic, especially because it's causing issues with businesses.

983
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:24,383
[SPEAKER_26]: There's businesses that are saying that they're going out of business.

984
01:30:24,423 --> 01:30:36,793
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know someone personally who does massage therapy who tried to start her services after graduating from the Salter School here in Malden to try and compete out here.

985
01:30:37,253 --> 01:30:40,136
[SPEAKER_26]: And it was impossible for her to do that because her clients couldn't actually

986
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:42,409
[SPEAKER_26]: park anywhere.

987
01:30:44,711 --> 01:30:46,451
[SPEAKER_26]: Businesses are definitely being affected.

988
01:30:48,793 --> 01:30:50,193
[SPEAKER_26]: The residents, commerce.

989
01:30:51,434 --> 01:30:54,176
[SPEAKER_26]: Residents really didn't have a say in this at all.

990
01:30:54,436 --> 01:31:04,681
[SPEAKER_26]: And I don't think residents would have strongly supported a Tennessee corporation coming in here and offering Tennessee taxes that they'd be collecting.

991
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:12,942
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, honestly, no one really supports this but Councilor Camuso, to be quite honest with you.

992
01:31:17,003 --> 01:31:20,764
[SPEAKER_26]: The elderly are drastically affected by this, sir.

993
01:31:23,285 --> 01:31:26,146
[SPEAKER_26]: Listen, this program affects everyone, honestly.

994
01:31:26,386 --> 01:31:30,568
[SPEAKER_26]: And the problem is that this program doesn't really

995
01:31:31,991 --> 01:31:39,493
[SPEAKER_26]: help in terms of the type of infrastructure that we have here in Medford, where in something like Somerville or in Boston, there's T's around.

996
01:31:39,533 --> 01:31:41,654
[SPEAKER_26]: There's better public transportation.

997
01:31:42,174 --> 01:31:42,674
[SPEAKER_26]: You know what I mean?

998
01:31:42,734 --> 01:31:44,154
[SPEAKER_26]: So people don't need to have cars.

999
01:31:44,194 --> 01:31:52,977
[SPEAKER_26]: So if they do park, whatever the reason was why, personally, I think the only reason why this program was implemented was because it was a revenue stream.

1000
01:31:53,617 --> 01:31:55,458
[SPEAKER_26]: But that's speculation.

1001
01:31:55,478 --> 01:31:56,018
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what I think.

1002
01:31:58,118 --> 01:32:00,719
[SPEAKER_26]: But if it was really for fixing a parking problem,

1003
01:32:03,836 --> 01:32:04,677
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not really doing that.

1004
01:32:04,797 --> 01:32:06,278
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, it's obviously made it worse.

1005
01:32:07,659 --> 01:32:12,281
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, Penta mentioned, you know, you said, you know, would Penta sue?

1006
01:32:12,482 --> 01:32:12,822
[SPEAKER_26]: I would.

1007
01:32:13,682 --> 01:32:15,263
[SPEAKER_26]: I would definitely look at the contingency plan.

1008
01:32:15,884 --> 01:32:24,869
[SPEAKER_26]: I would look at the contingency plan, and I would see what we can do, because ultimately, Medford residents didn't have a choice or a say, and I think we need to welcome the feedback.

1009
01:32:24,889 --> 01:32:28,331
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we need to go back to the drawing board and figure out a way where we can make this work.

1010
01:32:28,652 --> 01:32:28,912
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1011
01:32:31,949 --> 01:32:56,832
[SPEAKER_09]: like to address a few things to the gentleman because he may walk around South Medford but as a councillor and I think most of us as councillors have heard positive feedback regarding this program from some businesses whether it's in West Medford whether it's in Medford Square where they've had their strongest March and April that they had in all time now I'm not gonna throw those businesses out there I know the mayor's done that on one occasion and I

1012
01:32:57,613 --> 01:32:59,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't think it was quite fair to that particular business.

1013
01:33:00,296 --> 01:33:10,086
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know for a fact that the loudest member of this council to get rid of this program has been told by a business owner that it was the best march they have ever had.

1014
01:33:12,226 --> 01:33:15,588
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a business owner right here, right now, that's marched over here.

1015
01:33:15,628 --> 01:33:22,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Mario, as you campaign across the city, you're going to understand, there's many people in this community with different philosophies, different feelings.

1016
01:33:22,994 --> 01:33:23,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And the majority of them.

1017
01:33:24,075 --> 01:33:24,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the majority of them.

1018
01:33:24,835 --> 01:33:25,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you talk to 200?

1019
01:33:25,336 --> 01:33:27,878
[SPEAKER_09]: The majority of them are saying that this program sucks.

1020
01:33:27,938 --> 01:33:34,142
[SPEAKER_09]: With all due respect, with all due respect, as you're entitled to your opinion, I'm entitled to my opinion.

1021
01:33:34,743 --> 01:33:37,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is people in this community, business owners.

1022
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:40,107
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not talking to all the business owners.

1023
01:33:41,015 --> 01:33:42,196
[SPEAKER_09]: in this community, throughout the community.

1024
01:33:42,397 --> 01:33:49,085
[SPEAKER_09]: People that are on second floors, that are not on street level, that have their massage parlors throughout the squares, throughout other areas.

1025
01:33:49,345 --> 01:33:57,335
[SPEAKER_09]: You are not getting the phone calls that this council has dealt with for the last 10 years of people parking and taking the bus all day, living in their neighborhoods like Damon Road.

1026
01:33:58,365 --> 01:34:03,548
[SPEAKER_09]: like Winthrop Street, like Boston Ave, like High Street, like Boynton Road, the gentleman nodding his head right there.

1027
01:34:03,809 --> 01:34:06,810
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not privy to those conversations, because you're not an elected official.

1028
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:13,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if you're successful in your endeavors, maybe you'll see the many different sides of every issue.

1029
01:34:13,594 --> 01:34:17,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But to say that everyone's for it or against it, it's fiction.

1030
01:34:17,396 --> 01:34:17,877
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fiction.

1031
01:34:18,197 --> 01:34:19,317
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not my rhetoric.

1032
01:34:19,437 --> 01:34:20,378
[SPEAKER_09]: I can show you emails.

1033
01:34:20,438 --> 01:34:21,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I can show you phone calls.

1034
01:34:22,739 --> 01:34:23,640
[SPEAKER_09]: You walked South Medford.

1035
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:24,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you have.

1036
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:26,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you have, because people have told me.

1037
01:34:26,241 --> 01:34:27,082
[SPEAKER_09]: But with that being said,

1038
01:34:28,546 --> 01:34:34,972
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a portion of the community that— My rhetoric wasn't that every single person disagrees with it.

1039
01:34:35,032 --> 01:34:45,603
[SPEAKER_26]: My rhetoric was that the majority of people that are dealing with this, the elderly, when it's wintertime, and those things don't work, and they shut off, and they don't accept your credit cards— Snow emergencies?

1040
01:34:45,923 --> 01:34:46,103
[SPEAKER_26]: See?

1041
01:34:46,123 --> 01:34:46,964
[SPEAKER_26]: Snow emergencies?

1042
01:34:46,984 --> 01:34:47,364
[SPEAKER_26]: They're off.

1043
01:34:47,584 --> 01:34:47,965
[SPEAKER_26]: They're off.

1044
01:34:48,045 --> 01:34:51,148
[SPEAKER_26]: When elderly women and men get out of their vehicle—

1045
01:34:53,983 --> 01:34:58,244
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that we're losing focus here, and the quorum's starting to deteriorate a little bit.

1046
01:34:58,284 --> 01:35:01,145
[SPEAKER_18]: When individuals are speaking, they should be speaking through the chair.

1047
01:35:01,225 --> 01:35:02,666
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a one-on-one conversation.

1048
01:35:02,726 --> 01:35:05,547
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a conversation through the chair, Mr. President, that's necessary.

1049
01:35:05,567 --> 01:35:05,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1050
01:35:05,807 --> 01:35:07,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Musil, thank you for your remarks.

1051
01:35:08,668 --> 01:35:13,910
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight has made his point of parliamentary procedure.

1052
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:20,372
[SPEAKER_21]: The next councilor in queue is Councilor Caraviello, who has, there is no yielding on the floor.

1053
01:35:20,955 --> 01:35:23,136
[SPEAKER_21]: And the madam will speak and present to the council.

1054
01:35:23,156 --> 01:35:24,818
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1055
01:35:24,918 --> 01:35:26,298
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm so glad I came tonight.

1056
01:35:26,358 --> 01:35:28,060
[SPEAKER_27]: I think I'm going to be up here three times tonight.

1057
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:28,700
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, y'all.

1058
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:31,502
[SPEAKER_27]: But my name is Debbie Steiner-Hayes.

1059
01:35:31,562 --> 01:35:32,883
[SPEAKER_27]: I live at 29 Damon Road.

1060
01:35:33,203 --> 01:35:36,385
[SPEAKER_27]: I have to say, I applaud you guys for having the parking meters.

1061
01:35:36,465 --> 01:35:37,986
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's a fabulous idea.

1062
01:35:38,506 --> 01:35:39,807
[SPEAKER_27]: I do live on Damon Road.

1063
01:35:40,827 --> 01:35:53,533
[SPEAKER_27]: I know people who park in Medford Square who come from Stoneham and Wilmington and all sorts of places and have to get to park on our streets for free and take the 326 and go into Boston.

1064
01:35:53,854 --> 01:36:01,317
[SPEAKER_27]: If you live in Winchester, you have to pay, I think it's $300 a quarter to park on the street in front of the train station because it's so packed.

1065
01:36:01,757 --> 01:36:02,758
[SPEAKER_27]: And then you have the

1066
01:36:03,278 --> 01:36:05,620
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, you can park on the street for $300 a quarter.

1067
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:08,381
[SPEAKER_27]: For us to pay the meters is no big deal.

1068
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:14,705
[SPEAKER_27]: My only small thing is, yes, if you don't have kiosks in West Medford, yes, you should get a kiosk.

1069
01:36:15,105 --> 01:36:16,466
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, you should get the sign spinner.

1070
01:36:16,866 --> 01:36:22,910
[SPEAKER_27]: And my recommendation, if you so please just listen, is to maybe make it a four-hour time frame instead of a two-hour.

1071
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:26,813
[SPEAKER_27]: So that, yes, because honestly, when I get my hair done, it takes a long time.

1072
01:36:27,273 --> 01:36:30,855
[SPEAKER_27]: So I understand the hair salon saying, you know, they're losing customers.

1073
01:36:30,915 --> 01:36:31,716
[SPEAKER_27]: But other than that,

1074
01:36:32,736 --> 01:36:33,656
[SPEAKER_27]: Good job, guys.

1075
01:36:33,676 --> 01:36:36,637
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's come into the 21st century and make some money for this town.

1076
01:36:36,837 --> 01:36:37,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1077
01:36:37,097 --> 01:36:38,137
[SPEAKER_27]: So we can improve our library.

1078
01:36:39,018 --> 01:36:40,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Karafiello.

1079
01:36:40,438 --> 01:36:41,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1080
01:36:41,618 --> 01:36:50,860
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Mr. President, the major objective of this plan was to turn the parking spots over for the businesses.

1081
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,701
[SPEAKER_07]: And at some point, it has done that.

1082
01:36:53,721 --> 01:36:56,342
[SPEAKER_07]: But what is it?

1083
01:36:56,362 --> 01:36:57,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you.

1084
01:36:57,162 --> 01:37:00,603
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason you're seeing more spots, especially in the squares, is because, A,

1085
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:03,511
[SPEAKER_07]: It's taking the commuters off the street.

1086
01:37:04,592 --> 01:37:09,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And B, it's taking the employees off the streets.

1087
01:37:09,796 --> 01:37:16,921
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you're seeing all the open spaces because, you know, Brandon's law firm, who might be in the square, has five employees.

1088
01:37:17,262 --> 01:37:19,043
[SPEAKER_07]: They're now parking in the parking lots.

1089
01:37:19,403 --> 01:37:22,346
[SPEAKER_07]: You're finding that the business slots are all full now.

1090
01:37:23,006 --> 01:37:29,151
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now we've created another problem that we have nowhere for employees to park.

1091
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:32,911
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we've done.

1092
01:37:33,571 --> 01:37:40,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And people are parking in the governor's av lot and getting tickets because they're working in the square and they got nowhere.

1093
01:37:40,994 --> 01:37:44,696
[SPEAKER_07]: The parking lot on Route 16, jam-packed every day.

1094
01:37:44,736 --> 01:37:46,997
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not there by 8.30, you're not getting a parking spot anymore.

1095
01:37:47,437 --> 01:37:50,358
[SPEAKER_07]: The parking lot down by the old Tony Lucci's, full every day.

1096
01:37:50,819 --> 01:37:51,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Those lots used to be empty.

1097
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:53,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they're full.

1098
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:57,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's part of the reason you're seeing the empty spots in the square.

1099
01:37:57,822 --> 01:38:00,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, yes, it has hurt some business, and yes,

1100
01:38:01,048 --> 01:38:03,089
[SPEAKER_07]: We do need to do some work on this.

1101
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:04,370
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a lot of work.

1102
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:11,936
[SPEAKER_07]: There is still a lot of work that needs to be done on this in order to make it even somewhat of a success or not a success.

1103
01:38:12,236 --> 01:38:14,217
[SPEAKER_07]: But I say, more dialogue has to happen.

1104
01:38:14,698 --> 01:38:18,921
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, you know, to come up here every week and do it every week, I don't think is the proper forum.

1105
01:38:18,961 --> 01:38:29,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, you know, a separate public hearing with the parking company, I think, is the better forum to go so we can just concentrate on that particular issue of that evening, Mr. President.

1106
01:38:30,084 --> 01:38:31,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that recommendation.

1107
01:38:31,385 --> 01:38:32,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello.

1108
01:38:32,145 --> 01:38:32,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso.

1109
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:34,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1110
01:38:35,066 --> 01:38:52,235
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know for a fact that a poll was done regarding major issues in this community and parking fell well below number four, followed behind education, economic development, um, senior citizens programs.

1111
01:38:52,795 --> 01:38:58,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is factual to fall down that far on the

1112
01:39:00,192 --> 01:39:00,812
[SPEAKER_09]: totem pole.

1113
01:39:03,653 --> 01:39:10,214
[SPEAKER_09]: It's speaks volumes and I'm going to leave it at that.

1114
01:39:10,494 --> 01:39:14,315
[SPEAKER_09]: But so we just heard that no one's for it.

1115
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:15,555
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's for it.

1116
01:39:16,335 --> 01:39:20,696
[SPEAKER_09]: But one lady that's come up here and spoke eloquently that we don't see at the council meeting every week.

1117
01:39:20,996 --> 01:39:26,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is the first time I've seen her at the council meeting and she's been here longer than all of us cause she was here for five 30 for the library meeting.

1118
01:39:28,215 --> 01:39:35,641
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is a regular, average citizen that pays an enormous tax bill on Damon Road, and she just gave her feelings on it.

1119
01:39:35,941 --> 01:39:41,265
[SPEAKER_09]: So for everyone to say that there's no one that's for this, this is why I caution people.

1120
01:39:41,805 --> 01:39:42,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

1121
01:39:43,847 --> 01:39:44,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1122
01:39:44,927 --> 01:39:46,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1123
01:39:46,489 --> 01:39:48,950
[SPEAKER_18]: And Councilor Caviello made a very excellent point.

1124
01:39:49,471 --> 01:39:56,436
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think when we look at the transformation of this parking program and, you know, the reason why

1125
01:39:56,878 --> 01:40:03,859
[SPEAKER_18]: it was brought to the city was to turn over spots and to prevent all day parking from commuters.

1126
01:40:04,299 --> 01:40:06,300
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think we've accomplished those goals.

1127
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:12,281
[SPEAKER_18]: And the one thing that we've accomplished as well as scaring a lot of people away from our business districts.

1128
01:40:12,301 --> 01:40:24,343
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've said that before, and I'll say it again, but, um, counselor Cabrillo was absolutely right when he said that, you know, a lot of the spots that have cleared up weren't necessarily all day commuters that were parking their car in West Memphis square and getting on the train.

1129
01:40:24,997 --> 01:40:28,680
[SPEAKER_18]: There were all-day commuters that were parking their car in West Medford Square to go to work in West Medford Square.

1130
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:46,433
[SPEAKER_18]: And when you look at the number of business permits that were issued in 2014 prior to the rollout of the plan, some 260 or so, versus the number of business permits that have been issued after the rollout of the plan, which is somewhere around 560 or so, I think we'll see that there was absolute abuse of our current systems.

1131
01:40:46,913 --> 01:40:50,756
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can understand when people raise the issue saying, well, enforcement would have solved that problem.

1132
01:40:51,516 --> 01:40:53,958
[SPEAKER_18]: And paying might not necessarily be the answer.

1133
01:40:54,645 --> 01:41:02,270
[SPEAKER_18]: However, the program that we have is the program that we have, and we need to work within the confines of this contract that we have right now to determine whether or not we can make it work for us or not.

1134
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:03,631
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1135
01:41:04,151 --> 01:41:05,492
[SPEAKER_21]: Ma'am, you wish to address the council.

1136
01:41:05,512 --> 01:41:07,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1137
01:41:07,874 --> 01:41:08,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1138
01:41:08,274 --> 01:41:09,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1139
01:41:10,035 --> 01:41:15,058
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, this was an enforcement issue, and we only have 105 police officers in this city.

1140
01:41:15,738 --> 01:41:18,600
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't hire me to take care of this.

1141
01:41:19,201 --> 01:41:21,262
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't, internally or whatever,

1142
01:41:21,801 --> 01:41:25,585
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a parking problem that needed to be enforced, and we only have 105 officers.

1143
01:41:25,665 --> 01:41:33,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give them the task, the added task, to run after parked cars was a waste of their time and energy and skills, in my opinion.

1144
01:41:35,073 --> 01:41:38,737
[SPEAKER_00]: We did need to get the commuter traffic off the streets, and it was a success.

1145
01:41:38,897 --> 01:41:41,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two things that it did accomplish.

1146
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,225
[SPEAKER_00]: One, we took the bulk of ticketing off of the police roles, duties.

1147
01:41:47,919 --> 01:41:52,200
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, we got the commuters and the employees off of those streets in front of their own businesses.

1148
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:53,960
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a success.

1149
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:57,121
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do encourage the public to come forward.

1150
01:41:57,881 --> 01:42:05,022
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's because, Mr. Knight, that is the, and I'll probably vote for you this year too, but you're doing a good job overall.

1151
01:42:05,862 --> 01:42:14,004
[SPEAKER_00]: But I disagree with you on this one, which is it is only through the public coming forward to this podium that we can push

1152
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:17,941
[SPEAKER_00]: the solicitor to have to answer these questions because the mayor doesn't have to right now.

1153
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:22,183
[SPEAKER_00]: He can just coast on the end of his tour.

1154
01:42:22,883 --> 01:42:30,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to have public input so that we can pressure, and that's only by this podium.

1155
01:42:31,207 --> 01:42:32,687
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that everybody's questioning it.

1156
01:42:33,148 --> 01:42:35,949
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the meters, it's a debacle.

1157
01:42:36,249 --> 01:42:37,169
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really is.

1158
01:42:37,269 --> 01:42:43,852
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that the parking is not under the, you know, police aren't wasting their time on parked cars.

1159
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:45,839
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm glad that the commuters are off.

1160
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:50,404
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, Saturday night I saw a woman at 7 p.m.

1161
01:42:50,484 --> 01:42:54,808
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to put money in the meter and she was so grateful that I came up to her because she was trying to figure it out.

1162
01:42:55,229 --> 01:42:56,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody understands these meters.

1163
01:42:57,050 --> 01:43:06,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody from, if you're not from Medfit and you don't come to these meetings and you didn't take a class or, I've seen it over and over and over again across from Colleen's old people.

1164
01:43:07,290 --> 01:43:08,410
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure it out.

1165
01:43:09,231 --> 01:43:13,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do know it, they're complaining about it.

1166
01:43:13,512 --> 01:43:15,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe after a while, they'd get used to it.

1167
01:43:15,813 --> 01:43:22,095
[SPEAKER_00]: But my question is, because we do need a solution to it, is what about putting in meters?

1168
01:43:22,415 --> 01:43:31,918
[SPEAKER_00]: How much would it cost the city to transfer over from these parking meters that are computerized and nobody understands to a meter system?

1169
01:43:32,338 --> 01:43:33,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is that a solution?

1170
01:43:34,378 --> 01:43:35,859
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to happen in the next year.

1171
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:40,123
[SPEAKER_00]: You get, like you said, these business people, they're going nuts.

1172
01:43:40,683 --> 01:43:46,328
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want the city, I want Medford Square to survive, and I want business in there until 10 p.m.

1173
01:43:46,368 --> 01:43:46,688
[SPEAKER_00]: at night.

1174
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:48,990
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want businesses during the week.

1175
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:51,872
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dead after 6 o'clock, and it shouldn't be.

1176
01:43:52,252 --> 01:43:58,237
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the weekends, it should be open until 11 or 12 o'clock, and we should be getting that business rotation.

1177
01:43:58,651 --> 01:44:04,613
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're dying during the day, how are you going to produce something that's going to be open during the evening?

1178
01:44:04,894 --> 01:44:08,915
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need the income from these businesses, because we do need so much building maintenance.

1179
01:44:09,335 --> 01:44:12,217
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this feeds into the police department, which I always come back to.

1180
01:44:12,697 --> 01:44:15,418
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, thank you very much for considering my thoughts.

1181
01:44:18,499 --> 01:44:19,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1182
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:21,080
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd just like to add one more point.

1183
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:25,562
[SPEAKER_09]: The city of Medford, we all do know that we get those robocalls from the Captain Clemente.

1184
01:44:26,562 --> 01:44:34,626
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a robocall that went out to this entire community regarding the parking meeting that this Medford City Council was holding in room 207, right over here.

1185
01:44:34,967 --> 01:44:41,810
[SPEAKER_09]: A robocall, 57,000 people, many, many homes, and the meeting fit right in that room.

1186
01:44:46,073 --> 01:44:51,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I and many people that I know never got that robocall, so I don't know who the 57,000 people he's talking about.

1187
01:44:51,696 --> 01:44:52,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure, Mr. President, that the

1188
01:44:56,673 --> 01:45:07,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to speak for anyone else, but I'm sure if the city administration wanted to, they could probably get the data back up that says either his phone was an answer machine or it was hung up on because they do keep records of that.

1189
01:45:08,165 --> 01:45:12,590
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure for zero summit road, if they go back and look at that robocall, they'll be able to tell the data.

1190
01:45:12,951 --> 01:45:16,895
[SPEAKER_09]: But with that being said, um, here's one last point.

1191
01:45:18,304 --> 01:45:33,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to get an update of all the revenue collected through these machines, because for every one person that it's acting up on or is having a hard time, there's another 10, 15, 20, whatever it is, used it successfully.

1192
01:45:33,393 --> 01:45:44,520
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to know how much they've taken in so far through the Park Medfit application on the cellular phones that I know is becoming very popular, as well as the meters itself.

1193
01:45:44,801 --> 01:45:46,942
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is the only motion we've had.

1194
01:45:47,487 --> 01:45:51,088
[SPEAKER_21]: A motion of Councilor Camuso that the Council get an update year to date.

1195
01:45:51,689 --> 01:45:52,089
[SPEAKER_21]: Year to date.

1196
01:45:52,389 --> 01:45:56,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Year to date on revenue generated by, what is it called?

1197
01:45:56,830 --> 01:45:57,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Park Medford?

1198
01:45:57,891 --> 01:45:58,371
[SPEAKER_21]: Park Medford.

1199
01:45:58,391 --> 01:45:59,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Republican Parking.

1200
01:46:00,652 --> 01:46:02,272
[SPEAKER_09]: And one last point is too.

1201
01:46:02,612 --> 01:46:05,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Councilor.

1202
01:46:05,574 --> 01:46:08,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the majority of the people that are working there, this has been another

1203
01:46:10,653 --> 01:46:16,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Misinformation, more than half of the employees there are Medford residents from this community.

1204
01:46:17,136 --> 01:46:22,098
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and God forbid one of them falls down and does get hurt now or something like that, throws out their back.

1205
01:46:22,618 --> 01:46:23,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not on the city of Medford.

1206
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:29,422
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the vendor, but there are Medford employees that are doing most of the jobs down there.

1207
01:46:29,902 --> 01:46:35,044
[SPEAKER_09]: And other counselors around this real can back me up on that.

1208
01:46:36,105 --> 01:46:36,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1209
01:46:37,225 --> 01:46:38,186
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1210
01:46:38,246 --> 01:46:38,586
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselor.

1211
01:46:40,843 --> 01:46:41,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

1212
01:46:41,844 --> 01:46:45,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we also amend that to get all the tickets that have been abated?

1213
01:46:46,547 --> 01:46:50,130
[SPEAKER_21]: And a little amount year to date of all abated tickets.

1214
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:52,431
[SPEAKER_21]: All tickets that have been abated.

1215
01:46:52,451 --> 01:46:56,554
[SPEAKER_21]: On that motion.

1216
01:46:58,115 --> 01:46:58,796
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a citizen.

1217
01:46:59,516 --> 01:47:00,477
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you Mr. Citizen?

1218
01:47:00,577 --> 01:47:00,877
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome.

1219
01:47:01,237 --> 01:47:02,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1220
01:47:03,279 --> 01:47:05,560
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street in Medford.

1221
01:47:07,062 --> 01:47:07,522
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all,

1222
01:47:09,044 --> 01:47:14,985
[SPEAKER_14]: People who seem to have no problem with the parking enforcement program are people that are least affected by it.

1223
01:47:15,606 --> 01:47:20,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, we know that there's been some alleviation of the cars parking in the squares who take the bus.

1224
01:47:21,087 --> 01:47:24,628
[SPEAKER_14]: But all they've done is they've gone from here to here.

1225
01:47:25,308 --> 01:47:27,948
[SPEAKER_14]: They've gone from the streets to the Whole Food parking lot.

1226
01:47:28,228 --> 01:47:31,509
[SPEAKER_14]: They've gone up to the Bow Street area, up near Magoon Square.

1227
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:35,730
[SPEAKER_14]: The cars are inundating the streets.

1228
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:38,751
[SPEAKER_14]: And these are the people that are going and parking them back at Mystic Avenue.

1229
01:47:40,313 --> 01:47:46,655
[SPEAKER_14]: You haven't stopped the commuter parking problem in Medford, because now all the streets are getting crowded, but they don't happen to be in the square.

1230
01:47:47,095 --> 01:47:54,396
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll be honest with you, there was never a problem to get a parking spot in Medford in the big lot next to the senior citizen buildings years ago.

1231
01:47:54,416 --> 01:47:56,597
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you could always go there if you wanted to walk, all right?

1232
01:47:57,177 --> 01:47:58,037
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was your choice.

1233
01:47:58,057 --> 01:48:06,759
[SPEAKER_14]: I like to see the business people who say that they enjoy and they look forward to people having to pay to come into their shops, because I have yet to find one.

1234
01:48:07,339 --> 01:48:07,879
[SPEAKER_14]: I really do.

1235
01:48:08,289 --> 01:48:09,529
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not trying to be facetious.

1236
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:16,192
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd like to see the numbers for a program that they had the best march in the years.

1237
01:48:16,532 --> 01:48:20,813
[SPEAKER_14]: We still had the snow pile in front of the state police building on the parkway.

1238
01:48:20,893 --> 01:48:21,714
[SPEAKER_14]: It was over the roof.

1239
01:48:22,294 --> 01:48:23,915
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, people couldn't even get to the stores.

1240
01:48:24,495 --> 01:48:30,197
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to, you know, unless it was the guy that sells shovels at the local hardware store, I mean, really.

1241
01:48:30,597 --> 01:48:31,457
[SPEAKER_14]: But this started.

1242
01:48:31,577 --> 01:48:32,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information.

1243
01:48:33,858 --> 01:48:35,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1244
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,101
[SPEAKER_09]: One piece of data that I would ask you to get maybe is the mills tax compared to last year.

1245
01:48:42,481 --> 01:48:48,462
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was an increase in mills tax over the winter in the city of Medford and the whole first quarter.

1246
01:48:48,782 --> 01:48:50,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's data that backs up your theory.

1247
01:48:51,022 --> 01:48:53,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Present our comments through the chair please.

1248
01:48:53,803 --> 01:48:54,423
[SPEAKER_21]: I apologize.

1249
01:48:54,783 --> 01:48:55,463
[SPEAKER_21]: Kindly.

1250
01:48:56,523 --> 01:48:58,064
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of clarification.

1251
01:48:58,684 --> 01:49:04,225
[SPEAKER_11]: The first, the quarter that just came back in from the Commonwealth of Mass had an increase overall in the state by some 400,000.

1252
01:49:06,137 --> 01:49:08,078
[SPEAKER_11]: dollars in tax revenue.

1253
01:49:08,439 --> 01:49:10,680
[SPEAKER_11]: It's $400,000 more than projected.

1254
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:18,345
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a sign that the economy is getting better throughout the entire Commonwealth, but specifically here in the city of Medford.

1255
01:49:18,365 --> 01:49:19,065
[SPEAKER_11]: You hit it right in the head.

1256
01:49:19,766 --> 01:49:24,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Show me the businesses that say they love them and they want them and it's good for their business.

1257
01:49:24,549 --> 01:49:26,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the point of information,

1258
01:49:27,467 --> 01:49:31,229
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Citizen, please continue your comments.

1259
01:49:31,749 --> 01:49:43,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Through the chair, Councilor Camuso, I understand about the meals tax in the restaurants, because most people in a time of when you have one storm after another after another, most people cocoon, and they'll walk to the places.

1260
01:49:44,654 --> 01:49:49,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Very few will probably drive in, but a lot of people are going in restaurants.

1261
01:49:49,496 --> 01:49:55,879
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm talking about the majority of businesses in the squares, in the private squares, the dry cleaners,

1262
01:49:56,343 --> 01:49:57,384
[SPEAKER_14]: The floor is, huh?

1263
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:00,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I say private square?

1264
01:50:00,886 --> 01:50:01,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I meant the side squares.

1265
01:50:02,006 --> 01:50:03,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1266
01:50:05,608 --> 01:50:06,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a private square.

1267
01:50:06,509 --> 01:50:08,670
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's a, I misspoke on that one.

1268
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:21,657
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um, as I said before, the problem, there's a lot of things that could be fixed in the program, but the major problem with this whole parking program was it was no due diligence.

1269
01:50:21,757 --> 01:50:22,398
[SPEAKER_14]: There was no,

1270
01:50:23,252 --> 01:50:27,293
[SPEAKER_14]: going out to see how these other programs work in other cities, to see what problems they had.

1271
01:50:27,793 --> 01:50:30,534
[SPEAKER_14]: It was wham, bam, thank you, man, and here we go with a parking program.

1272
01:50:30,914 --> 01:50:31,714
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's been a mess.

1273
01:50:31,814 --> 01:50:32,515
[SPEAKER_14]: It really has been.

1274
01:50:32,715 --> 01:50:33,395
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been terrible.

1275
01:50:33,515 --> 01:50:34,135
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen people.

1276
01:50:34,835 --> 01:50:35,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I've helped people.

1277
01:50:35,635 --> 01:50:36,956
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't see the bloody screen.

1278
01:50:37,496 --> 01:50:38,616
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're right.

1279
01:50:38,696 --> 01:50:42,757
[SPEAKER_14]: There are people that are trying to put money in, and they get tagged.

1280
01:50:42,777 --> 01:50:43,538
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know what they are.

1281
01:50:43,878 --> 01:50:47,639
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't gotten a ticket yet, because I refuse to put any money in the meters at all, none whatsoever.

1282
01:50:47,899 --> 01:50:49,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll walk the two miles to the square.

1283
01:50:49,419 --> 01:50:49,699
[SPEAKER_14]: I will.

1284
01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:52,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just upset with that parking program.

1285
01:50:52,665 --> 01:50:58,690
[SPEAKER_14]: And you councilors voted in good faith to give the administration the ability to work up to a 10-year contract.

1286
01:50:59,671 --> 01:51:04,995
[SPEAKER_14]: But then on behalf of your good efforts, the contract was signed, and then here it is.

1287
01:51:05,035 --> 01:51:05,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the contract.

1288
01:51:05,755 --> 01:51:07,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we have to live with the mistakes.

1289
01:51:07,457 --> 01:51:09,839
[SPEAKER_14]: There was no shaking out of this whole bloody package.

1290
01:51:09,939 --> 01:51:15,764
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyway, I just want to say that the problem has actually just moved to other neighborhoods.

1291
01:51:16,344 --> 01:51:16,984
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's evident.

1292
01:51:17,265 --> 01:51:18,826
[SPEAKER_14]: And anybody who wants to come in, I'll show you the cars.

1293
01:51:19,787 --> 01:51:22,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Whole Foods, the whole parking lot was loaded there at 9 o'clock.

1294
01:51:22,808 --> 01:51:24,468
[SPEAKER_14]: There were like about six people in Whole Foods.

1295
01:51:24,768 --> 01:51:26,328
[SPEAKER_14]: So where are those guys?

1296
01:51:26,508 --> 01:51:27,589
[SPEAKER_14]: They get the bus into Harvard.

1297
01:51:27,609 --> 01:51:28,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1298
01:51:28,709 --> 01:51:29,309
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, my neighbor.

1299
01:51:30,489 --> 01:51:31,189
[SPEAKER_14]: And my other neighbor.

1300
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:34,410
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just actually want to finish before I was cut off.

1301
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:36,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Your name and address are on the record.

1302
01:51:36,331 --> 01:51:37,011
[SPEAKER_26]: Mario Martin, 198 Harvard.

1303
01:51:37,231 --> 01:51:38,731
[SPEAKER_26]: You said I said everyone.

1304
01:51:38,771 --> 01:51:39,471
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't say everyone.

1305
01:51:39,491 --> 01:51:41,012
[SPEAKER_21]: Sir, sir, I don't want to get you nervous.

1306
01:51:41,032 --> 01:51:41,692
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't say everyone.

1307
01:51:41,712 --> 01:51:42,632
[SPEAKER_26]: I said majority of the people.

1308
01:51:44,755 --> 01:51:47,096
[SPEAKER_26]: I said, let me talk this time.

1309
01:51:48,437 --> 01:51:50,938
[SPEAKER_26]: I said the majority of the people.

1310
01:51:50,978 --> 01:51:51,719
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't say everyone.

1311
01:51:51,799 --> 01:51:53,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of parliamentary procedure, Counselor Knight.

1312
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:55,641
[SPEAKER_21]: The questions have to go through the chair.

1313
01:51:55,661 --> 01:51:57,542
[SPEAKER_18]: This is turning into people screaming in the playground.

1314
01:51:57,562 --> 01:51:58,823
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a legislative body.

1315
01:51:58,843 --> 01:51:59,883
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we need to act like it.

1316
01:51:59,903 --> 01:52:00,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1317
01:52:00,123 --> 01:52:00,504
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Martin.

1318
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:13,804
[SPEAKER_21]: You may continue to speak, and please direct your remarks to the chair.

1319
01:52:13,984 --> 01:52:14,264
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1320
01:52:14,484 --> 01:52:14,765
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1321
01:52:15,105 --> 01:52:15,585
[SPEAKER_26]: I apologize.

1322
01:52:17,587 --> 01:52:24,434
[SPEAKER_26]: Although we just had a young lady come in here and state her testimony, and I want to thank you.

1323
01:52:25,635 --> 01:52:28,478
[SPEAKER_26]: And I agree there is a parking problem in Medford.

1324
01:52:31,194 --> 01:52:35,697
[SPEAKER_26]: We've had several people come here today and speak about it.

1325
01:52:36,318 --> 01:52:46,024
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, that's all I was trying to finish explaining earlier, which was that, you know, I wasn't saying everyone in Medford disagrees with it.

1326
01:52:46,424 --> 01:52:49,927
[SPEAKER_26]: What I'm simply saying is that, yes, there was a parking problem.

1327
01:52:50,327 --> 01:52:55,130
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, you know, we implemented a solution that didn't work.

1328
01:52:56,111 --> 01:52:58,172
[SPEAKER_26]: And businesses are failing.

1329
01:52:58,697 --> 01:53:00,438
[SPEAKER_26]: and suffering and residents and other people.

1330
01:53:00,538 --> 01:53:09,862
[SPEAKER_26]: Some people may, you know, think it's a really good thing, but the majority, is what I was saying, believe that it's not, that it's not a good solution.

1331
01:53:10,542 --> 01:53:19,046
[SPEAKER_26]: And so, you know, at this point right now, what I'm really trying to ask is, you know, why wouldn't a certain someone here understand that and see that?

1332
01:53:20,106 --> 01:53:21,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you see what I'm saying?

1333
01:53:21,487 --> 01:53:22,447
[SPEAKER_26]: That's just really all I'm saying.

1334
01:53:23,848 --> 01:53:24,688
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1335
01:53:26,289 --> 01:53:28,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

1336
01:53:29,741 --> 01:53:31,662
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope this was the subject you came to speak on.

1337
01:53:31,822 --> 01:53:32,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1338
01:53:32,482 --> 01:53:32,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1339
01:53:32,942 --> 01:53:33,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President.

1340
01:53:33,703 --> 01:53:37,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank the President and all the city councilors for everything that they do for the city.

1341
01:53:38,264 --> 01:53:42,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And a very big thank you thanks for Robert Penner to be running for the mayor.

1342
01:53:42,806 --> 01:53:45,407
[SPEAKER_03]: He will be the next new mayor of the city of Medford.

1343
01:53:45,527 --> 01:53:48,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Sir, we can't campaign at the railroad.

1344
01:53:48,569 --> 01:53:54,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just want to let everybody know that all these problems that you're talking about, he will clear them up.

1345
01:53:54,611 --> 01:53:54,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1346
01:53:54,811 --> 01:53:59,313
[SPEAKER_03]: This failed administration that we have here now with McGlynn, that's going to be over with.

1347
01:54:00,162 --> 01:54:04,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And he will clear up all these failed programs.

1348
01:54:05,164 --> 01:54:05,524
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1349
01:54:05,564 --> 01:54:07,724
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't campaign in this room.

1350
01:54:08,004 --> 01:54:12,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to get praised, because he's a hard worker, and he's going to clear up the city.

1351
01:54:12,746 --> 01:54:17,688
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't just speak on the parking, so would you please direct your remarks at that?

1352
01:54:17,708 --> 01:54:19,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I mention something about the parking?

1353
01:54:19,788 --> 01:54:19,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1354
01:54:20,528 --> 01:54:25,290
[SPEAKER_03]: They mentioned earlier, too, about the parking, where the city is going to get the money for that.

1355
01:54:27,431 --> 01:54:28,571
[SPEAKER_03]: When our new mayor comes in,

1356
01:54:29,313 --> 01:54:30,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much, sir.

1357
01:54:34,577 --> 01:54:39,460
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do with the money is look at the legal team of Medford.

1358
01:54:39,941 --> 01:54:42,342
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look at that, and they'll pick that apart.

1359
01:54:44,564 --> 01:54:45,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be ended.

1360
01:54:45,404 --> 01:54:50,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be ended because all the things that they've done illegally will be raised out of that contract.

1361
01:54:51,088 --> 01:54:52,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to say that.

1362
01:54:52,810 --> 01:54:55,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll go with one more statement.

1363
01:54:56,412 --> 01:54:58,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Stephanie Burke will only be a continuance of McGill.

1364
01:55:02,232 --> 01:55:06,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you need to speak?

1365
01:55:07,157 --> 01:55:08,898
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion, all those in favor?

1366
01:55:08,918 --> 01:55:09,479
[SPEAKER_21]: I love it.

1367
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:11,340
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion is.

1368
01:55:14,183 --> 01:55:17,646
[SPEAKER_22]: We have two amendments.

1369
01:55:20,168 --> 01:55:25,913
[SPEAKER_22]: What is an update of all revenue collected from the kiosks and the park application?

1370
01:55:26,374 --> 01:55:27,715
[SPEAKER_22]: The park method application.

1371
01:55:28,564 --> 01:55:32,167
[SPEAKER_22]: year-to-date, and all tickets that have been abated.

1372
01:55:32,868 --> 01:55:34,469
[SPEAKER_21]: All tickets abated, year-to-date.

1373
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:37,011
[SPEAKER_21]: On that motion, Councilor Langel-Kern.

1374
01:55:37,071 --> 01:55:37,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1375
01:55:37,471 --> 01:55:52,664
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could also get an update from the Chief of Police, who works very hard on the Park Medford program, especially as a liaison and answering our questions, if we can get an update from him on the new signage and our other concerns that we did.

1376
01:55:52,724 --> 01:55:56,447
[SPEAKER_15]: He had a list before he left our last meeting that he was here probably about a month ago.

1377
01:55:56,891 --> 01:56:00,893
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we can get any updates with regards to any issues we had with the program.

1378
01:56:00,913 --> 01:56:02,834
[SPEAKER_21]: Those outstanding issues that we had presented to the Chief.

1379
01:56:02,874 --> 01:56:03,094
[SPEAKER_21]: Please.

1380
01:56:03,855 --> 01:56:04,255
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1381
01:56:04,435 --> 01:56:05,235
[SPEAKER_21]: And Counselor Knight.

1382
01:56:05,756 --> 01:56:12,279
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, if we can also get a listing of any complaints that were filed relative to the kiosk operation taking money after hours from the Consumer Commission.

1383
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:23,005
[SPEAKER_21]: And an update on complaints for after hours money taking to be given to the Council from the Medford Consumer Commission.

1384
01:56:23,526 --> 01:56:26,048
[SPEAKER_21]: So on that motion, as amended, all those in favor?

1385
01:56:26,469 --> 01:56:26,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1386
01:56:27,029 --> 01:56:27,750
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

1387
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:30,052
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion carries.

1388
01:56:31,413 --> 01:56:39,401
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Consular Longo Current to resort back to their revert, back to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

1389
01:56:39,421 --> 01:56:39,941
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1390
01:56:39,961 --> 01:56:40,822
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

1391
01:56:41,393 --> 01:56:46,896
[SPEAKER_21]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 15-524 are offered by Councilor Penta.

1392
01:56:47,517 --> 01:57:10,050
[SPEAKER_21]: Be it resolved that a listing of all new hires and employee promotions since 7-01, that's July 1st, 2013, in both the school department and the city side of the budgets be forwarded to the council by title, job description, when hired, salary, person's name, address,

1393
01:57:10,951 --> 01:57:24,675
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, all promotions of employees by name, salary, department since July 1, 2013 to the date of this 2015-2016 city budget.

1394
01:57:25,335 --> 01:57:35,538
[SPEAKER_21]: This information should be forwarded to the council ASAP as the entire city and school department is now under review for consideration.

1395
01:57:35,938 --> 01:57:36,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

1396
01:57:36,998 --> 01:57:39,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I think it's quite obvious as to

1397
01:57:40,850 --> 01:57:42,411
[SPEAKER_11]: what the resolution says.

1398
01:57:42,571 --> 01:57:44,932
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it would be beneficial for us to have that.

1399
01:57:45,773 --> 01:57:53,777
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe before, I think it was some two years ago, we had asked of the budget director to have names associated next to positions in the budget.

1400
01:57:54,658 --> 01:57:56,719
[SPEAKER_11]: And we still don't have it as of now.

1401
01:57:57,580 --> 01:58:00,041
[SPEAKER_11]: But last year, I believe that the budget increased.

1402
01:58:00,101 --> 01:58:03,303
[SPEAKER_11]: And on the school department side, it increased by almost $2 million.

1403
01:58:03,603 --> 01:58:06,825
[SPEAKER_11]: And this year, it looks like it's a projection of 1.8 million.

1404
01:58:07,585 --> 01:58:10,627
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole budget of the city looks like it's up almost $5 million this year.

1405
01:58:11,168 --> 01:58:20,794
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there are new jobs and positions, if there are promotions that have taken place, I think it would be beneficial for the council to understand that rather than being told that, you know, this one got hired, that one got hired.

1406
01:58:21,054 --> 01:58:23,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus the fact that it's a budgetary issue and a concern.

1407
01:58:24,597 --> 01:58:30,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just don't understand why all these titles and these positions are just not in the budget by name.

1408
01:58:31,301 --> 01:58:33,462
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what the council asked for years ago.

1409
01:58:33,482 --> 01:58:34,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

1410
01:58:39,206 --> 01:58:40,667
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, the names are in our budget.

1411
01:58:41,307 --> 01:58:43,208
[SPEAKER_09]: The names of current employees are in our budget.

1412
01:58:43,248 --> 01:58:47,491
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been in our budget for years, four or five years now.

1413
01:58:48,091 --> 01:58:48,772
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the first thing.

1414
01:58:49,172 --> 01:58:52,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Talking about the resolution's names, you didn't see, you didn't listen to me.

1415
01:58:52,694 --> 01:58:54,075
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, I'm quite familiar with it.

1416
01:58:54,095 --> 01:59:04,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also quite familiar with the attempted assault on a public employee that was, that was, what's the word I'm looking for?

1417
01:59:04,562 --> 01:59:10,246
[SPEAKER_09]: That a shooting subdued after, in that the Joint Terrorism Task Force actually ended up shooting someone

1418
01:59:11,315 --> 01:59:14,918
[SPEAKER_09]: in Boston, in Roslindale, and then they had another situation in Everett.

1419
01:59:15,318 --> 01:59:23,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And to blatantly put out this type of information, employees' addresses, and things of that nature, I don't think is prudent at this point, Mr. President.

1420
01:59:23,485 --> 01:59:24,606
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know it's public record.

1421
01:59:25,827 --> 01:59:31,752
[SPEAKER_09]: But even addresses of employees, I believe, may not be public record under the public information law.

1422
01:59:32,193 --> 01:59:34,094
[SPEAKER_09]: But with that being said, I can't support this.

1423
01:59:35,235 --> 01:59:36,156
[SPEAKER_09]: The names are in the budget.

1424
01:59:36,536 --> 01:59:38,338
[SPEAKER_09]: But asking for employees' addresses,

1425
01:59:38,885 --> 01:59:44,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it stinks of nothing more than just wanting to have them for your own personal database, and there's no value to it.

1426
01:59:44,427 --> 02:00:04,374
[SPEAKER_09]: And given the situations we're dealing with currently around the greater Boston area, with some serious criminal police matters in the neighboring community of Everett and Roslindale, and possibly even within the general immediate area, I don't think I'm comfortable asking for this type of information.

1427
02:00:04,974 --> 02:00:06,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Police and fire are already protected.

1428
02:00:07,074 --> 02:00:07,955
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not in the ward book.

1429
02:00:08,015 --> 02:00:08,635
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not listed.

1430
02:00:09,114 --> 02:00:12,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just don't feel comfortable doing this to any public employees.

1431
02:00:12,156 --> 02:00:18,619
[SPEAKER_09]: If someone has a specific interest, they're more than welcome to come down here and get any applicable data through the Freedom of Information Act.

1432
02:00:19,119 --> 02:00:20,980
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not supporting this for those reasons.

1433
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of clarification, Mr. President.

1434
02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:24,002
[SPEAKER_21]: All set, Councilor Camuso.

1435
02:00:24,843 --> 02:00:26,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I'm all set.

1436
02:00:26,824 --> 02:00:31,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of clarification, Councilor Pinto.

1437
02:00:31,626 --> 02:00:35,708
[SPEAKER_11]: In the resolution after President's name, I'd be willing to take out address.

1438
02:00:35,809 --> 02:00:36,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm okay with that.

1439
02:00:37,518 --> 02:00:41,621
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Mr. Clerk, we are striking from the resolution.

1440
02:00:41,761 --> 02:00:42,401
[SPEAKER_21]: The word address.

1441
02:00:42,522 --> 02:00:53,849
[SPEAKER_21]: The word address is attached to any employee.

1442
02:00:53,989 --> 02:00:54,850
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Vice President.

1443
02:00:55,050 --> 02:00:57,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President De La Ruza.

1444
02:00:57,031 --> 02:00:58,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to second this paper.

1445
02:00:58,372 --> 02:01:06,478
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd also like to possibly add a few things, if you don't mind, Councilor Penta.

1446
02:01:06,935 --> 02:01:16,783
[SPEAKER_15]: be resolved that the listing of all new hires and employees' promotions, slump-sum raises, any lump-sum increases in salary.

1447
02:01:16,923 --> 02:01:22,128
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I think what I have an issue with... For clarification, is that language in there?

1448
02:01:22,188 --> 02:01:22,828
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't see that.

1449
02:01:23,369 --> 02:01:24,510
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm asking that be added.

1450
02:01:24,530 --> 02:01:30,294
[SPEAKER_15]: It says employee promotions to include lump-sum raises or any lump-sum increases in salaries.

1451
02:01:30,635 --> 02:01:33,377
[SPEAKER_21]: So, as amended by Vice President Lugo-Kern,

1452
02:01:33,989 --> 02:01:42,593
[SPEAKER_21]: that any lump sum raises or increases in salaries be added to this report.

1453
02:01:44,154 --> 02:01:44,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that all?

1454
02:01:45,134 --> 02:01:48,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I have very deep concern about this.

1455
02:01:48,836 --> 02:01:55,139
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been getting calls from people from the school department.

1456
02:01:55,559 --> 02:01:57,420
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's something going on.

1457
02:01:57,460 --> 02:01:59,081
[SPEAKER_15]: We obviously need to figure it out.

1458
02:01:59,161 --> 02:01:59,881
[SPEAKER_15]: We spoke about this.

1459
02:02:00,612 --> 02:02:05,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Six weeks ago, we didn't get any type of resolve or any type of answers from the school department.

1460
02:02:06,594 --> 02:02:10,676
[SPEAKER_15]: I think now we're hearing rumors that more money is needed to fund the school budget.

1461
02:02:11,196 --> 02:02:19,919
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I've heard from people who are complaining to me is $20,000 raises to certain people, $6,000 raises, $7,000 raises.

1462
02:02:20,319 --> 02:02:23,601
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not across the board, it's just certain people, certain jobs,

1463
02:02:28,001 --> 02:02:31,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Even the big job category, it's only half the people that are getting certain raises.

1464
02:02:31,622 --> 02:02:35,644
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have concern and I thank Council Penton for bringing this forward.

1465
02:02:35,684 --> 02:02:38,705
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is something we need before we can take a vote on the budget.

1466
02:02:38,965 --> 02:02:42,586
[SPEAKER_21]: Has any of this been substantiated in public forum?

1467
02:02:43,066 --> 02:02:44,687
[SPEAKER_15]: It was in our budget book.

1468
02:02:45,447 --> 02:02:49,048
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, yeah, I have it substantiated.

1469
02:02:49,108 --> 02:02:54,390
[SPEAKER_15]: I have some of the data and I think we need a full accounting of what's going on.

1470
02:02:54,878 --> 02:02:58,359
[SPEAKER_15]: before we, you know, we are asked to approve more towards that budget.

1471
02:02:59,199 --> 02:03:02,399
[SPEAKER_15]: The teachers don't get supplies.

1472
02:03:02,859 --> 02:03:08,080
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe that they went around to the schools and they gave some classrooms one dry erase marker recently.

1473
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,801
[SPEAKER_15]: No joke, I got a call about this.

1474
02:03:10,201 --> 02:03:12,601
[SPEAKER_15]: One dry erase marker, it went dead in about a week.

1475
02:03:13,061 --> 02:03:19,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Teachers are paying for their own supplies, yet we're giving $20,000 raises, $6,000 raises to certain people.

1476
02:03:20,142 --> 02:03:20,782
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not right.

1477
02:03:21,342 --> 02:03:22,763
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see it much in the city side.

1478
02:03:22,803 --> 02:03:24,123
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the city side seems to

1479
02:03:25,090 --> 02:03:25,770
[SPEAKER_15]: straightforward, 1%, 2%.

1480
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:30,633
[SPEAKER_15]: But what you hear in the school department, and then after this.

1481
02:03:31,213 --> 02:03:32,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a point of information.

1482
02:03:32,854 --> 02:03:37,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Has there been any actual raises in the same title, or was it promotions to different positions?

1483
02:03:37,896 --> 02:03:48,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if there's a raise of $6,000 to $20,000, these are more, the people I've talked to in the school department said, most of them are putting in for different jobs, getting a promotion.

1484
02:03:48,721 --> 02:03:50,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's called anti-spiking.

1485
02:03:50,842 --> 02:03:51,562
[SPEAKER_09]: It's against the law.

1486
02:03:52,422 --> 02:03:53,743
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the resolution says.

1487
02:03:54,675 --> 02:03:56,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's what I want to find out myself.

1488
02:03:56,595 --> 02:03:57,856
[SPEAKER_21]: This is what we're going to find out.

1489
02:03:59,156 --> 02:04:01,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Union people are getting the 1%, 2% raises.

1490
02:04:02,037 --> 02:04:11,519
[SPEAKER_15]: And then after we speak about it on the council floor six weeks ago, I don't know how many more calls you got, but I get even more calls, people saying, yeah, that's going on.

1491
02:04:11,939 --> 02:04:12,559
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is.

1492
02:04:12,619 --> 02:04:14,500
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we need to figure that out.

1493
02:04:15,020 --> 02:04:24,402
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't got anything from the school department letting us know who's gotten raises in the last two years like we asked for six weeks ago.

1494
02:04:24,991 --> 02:04:25,371
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

1495
02:04:25,531 --> 02:04:27,292
[SPEAKER_21]: So you have that amendment.

1496
02:04:29,173 --> 02:04:29,493
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1497
02:04:31,934 --> 02:04:32,454
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

1498
02:04:33,195 --> 02:04:34,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1499
02:04:35,035 --> 02:04:49,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, I certainly understood the concerns of the Councilor Camuso had and where he was coming from in sharing the names and addresses of, uh, our public employees here in the city of Medford, especially those in the public safety field, but also those in the school system where around we've seen an increase in violence in our schools and an increase in violence against teachers.

1500
02:04:50,623 --> 02:05:01,349
[SPEAKER_18]: With that being said, Mr. President, I think a proper negotiation and a proper middle ground would be that we strike person's name, we strike address as well, and we replace that with employee identification number.

1501
02:05:01,689 --> 02:05:07,432
[SPEAKER_18]: That way we'll be able to tell if it's the same person or not based upon their employee identification number, which everybody in the city has, Mr. President.

1502
02:05:07,452 --> 02:05:13,255
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd like to move to amend the paper by striking the word name and striking the word address and replacing that with employee identification number.

1503
02:05:13,895 --> 02:05:17,777
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to strike the word name and to add

1504
02:05:18,467 --> 02:05:20,987
[SPEAKER_21]: employee identification number.

1505
02:05:24,088 --> 02:05:25,208
[SPEAKER_21]: Councillor Marks.

1506
02:05:26,548 --> 02:05:27,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1507
02:05:28,509 --> 02:05:29,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a good resolve.

1508
02:05:30,029 --> 02:05:37,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I think with the Councillors Oskin and also Councillor Penter and Councillor Lungo is a listing of the new hires and employee promotions.

1509
02:05:38,311 --> 02:05:40,251
[SPEAKER_06]: This paper will be forwarded to the council.

1510
02:05:41,231 --> 02:05:46,512
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason why the legislative body cannot get a copy of a person's name,

1511
02:05:47,210 --> 02:05:48,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with the address.

1512
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:56,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we need an address, but a person's name and what their title is, and even what their responsibility is, and what the raise or promotion has been over the last couple of years.

1513
02:05:57,734 --> 02:05:58,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a problem with that.

1514
02:05:58,854 --> 02:06:01,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why I can't get an employee's name.

1515
02:06:02,015 --> 02:06:04,796
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not talking about adding this to the budget book.

1516
02:06:05,316 --> 02:06:13,879
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about a separate document that would be sent to the council, and it would be confidential like all the other information we receive in the packet.

1517
02:06:14,884 --> 02:06:19,987
[SPEAKER_06]: and it would describe where these raises and where these promotions and who's getting them.

1518
02:06:20,007 --> 02:06:21,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a problem with that.

1519
02:06:21,127 --> 02:06:24,609
[SPEAKER_21]: If I could just add a piece of information, it's all in our budget books right now.

1520
02:06:24,989 --> 02:06:30,432
[SPEAKER_21]: It showed, even if you looked at the electrical department, just for instance, today, it showed length of service.

1521
02:06:30,973 --> 02:06:33,194
[SPEAKER_21]: It showed step increases to those who got them.

1522
02:06:33,754 --> 02:06:37,156
[SPEAKER_21]: It showed job titles and their weekly salary.

1523
02:06:37,176 --> 02:06:37,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't show length.

1524
02:06:38,056 --> 02:06:39,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does it show length of service in the budget?

1525
02:06:40,672 --> 02:06:41,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Penton.

1526
02:06:42,913 --> 02:06:48,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you explain to the public the length of service that the assistant city engineer has?

1527
02:06:49,316 --> 02:06:52,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you explain the years of service that they have and what the promotion is?

1528
02:06:52,757 --> 02:06:53,157
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't.

1529
02:06:53,558 --> 02:06:57,059
[SPEAKER_11]: All we're looking for is the new people that came on, brand new people.

1530
02:07:00,701 --> 02:07:01,221
[SPEAKER_09]: And raises.

1531
02:07:01,241 --> 02:07:05,003
[SPEAKER_11]: 13 is your 14 year budget and this one is the 15, 16.

1532
02:07:09,135 --> 02:07:10,835
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the last budget in this budget.

1533
02:07:11,235 --> 02:07:12,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Matz, did I cut you off?

1534
02:07:12,496 --> 02:07:12,836
[SPEAKER_21]: I apologize.

1535
02:07:12,916 --> 02:07:14,656
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just saying I think it's a good idea.

1536
02:07:14,676 --> 02:07:16,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why we can't get employees' names.

1537
02:07:17,657 --> 02:07:18,857
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not for distribution.

1538
02:07:18,897 --> 02:07:20,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to go in the local paper.

1539
02:07:20,557 --> 02:07:25,318
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming to an elected body that's inquiring about what's going on.

1540
02:07:25,378 --> 02:07:27,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't see a problem with that.

1541
02:07:27,759 --> 02:07:28,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1542
02:07:30,820 --> 02:07:32,700
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Camuso, did you want to speak on this?

1543
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:34,000
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just a roll call vote on this.

1544
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:34,640
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1545
02:07:35,821 --> 02:07:36,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caravaglio.

1546
02:07:36,861 --> 02:07:37,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1547
02:07:38,245 --> 02:07:43,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see why when the superintendent comes up, he can bring this with him.

1548
02:07:46,210 --> 02:07:48,111
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll be here next week, all that information.

1549
02:07:48,131 --> 02:07:50,432
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working out all those dates still with him.

1550
02:07:50,472 --> 02:08:01,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, but we'll say when the school department, I mean, I would like to make this part of his budget when he comes in that night, rather than get it individually.

1551
02:08:01,978 --> 02:08:05,140
[SPEAKER_07]: He can make it part of all the further departments coming in.

1552
02:08:06,437 --> 02:08:07,617
[SPEAKER_07]: doing that, to do that.

1553
02:08:08,138 --> 02:08:10,698
[SPEAKER_21]: So amended by Councilor Caviello.

1554
02:08:10,758 --> 02:08:24,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Rather than to get a blanket statement, as the new departments come in, because we haven't done that many, let them point out their new hires and their raises and how long.

1555
02:08:24,662 --> 02:08:30,303
[SPEAKER_21]: So that amended by Councilor Caviello that the superintendent of schools make

1556
02:08:30,990 --> 02:08:33,131
[SPEAKER_21]: set presentation at our budget meeting.

1557
02:08:33,192 --> 02:08:34,312
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the other department heads.

1558
02:08:34,492 --> 02:08:40,917
[SPEAKER_21]: And all other department heads who meet with us next.

1559
02:08:42,438 --> 02:08:42,918
[SPEAKER_21]: That all set?

1560
02:08:43,238 --> 02:08:43,438
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1561
02:08:43,639 --> 02:08:43,959
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1562
02:08:44,039 --> 02:08:44,819
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Camuso.

1563
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:52,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And the schools has traditionally put retirements in the front of the budget as well as new hires in the front of the budget.

1564
02:08:52,785 --> 02:08:58,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And jobs that have not been filled yet show the word vacant with a salary attached to it just because it hasn't been filled yet.

1565
02:08:58,729 --> 02:09:00,350
[SPEAKER_09]: But to follow up on Councilor Knight's

1566
02:09:01,671 --> 02:09:04,655
[SPEAKER_09]: um, statement regarding teachers and stuff.

1567
02:09:05,336 --> 02:09:09,602
[SPEAKER_09]: The more I think of it, I'm a little less apt to, uh, to support it even more.

1568
02:09:09,642 --> 02:09:13,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Now in Danvers, we had a young teacher calling Ritza.

1569
02:09:14,849 --> 02:09:15,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, excuse me.

1570
02:09:16,891 --> 02:09:17,332
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you didn't.

1571
02:09:17,572 --> 02:09:19,435
[SPEAKER_09]: This is, this is all departments.

1572
02:09:20,222 --> 02:09:21,503
[SPEAKER_09]: be forward to the city council.

1573
02:09:21,623 --> 02:09:28,029
[SPEAKER_09]: This is administrators, this is asking for secretaries and everyone else in the whole system wide.

1574
02:09:28,589 --> 02:09:38,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had a situation and we didn't, but the city of Danvers had a situation where a student was following around a teacher, uh, around her place of home and everything else.

1575
02:09:38,738 --> 02:09:40,360
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know the ultimately what happened there.

1576
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't feel comfortable with this at all.

1577
02:09:42,542 --> 02:09:45,124
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the budget, the same information that has always been there.

1578
02:09:45,724 --> 02:09:46,205
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um,

1579
02:09:47,777 --> 02:09:50,038
[SPEAKER_21]: It's in there, it says school department in the resolution.

1580
02:09:50,058 --> 02:09:50,718
[SPEAKER_09]: It says school department.

1581
02:09:50,738 --> 02:09:52,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Penta, point of clarification.

1582
02:09:52,238 --> 02:09:54,719
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't make any, what does that have, it has nothing to do with it.

1583
02:09:54,739 --> 02:09:56,560
[SPEAKER_11]: You're saying this about somebody here at City Hall.

1584
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:58,760
[SPEAKER_11]: You're saying something about somebody working here at City Hall.

1585
02:09:58,780 --> 02:10:01,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor, you're asking for people's addresses.

1586
02:10:01,441 --> 02:10:03,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not, I said I'm taking it out.

1587
02:10:03,141 --> 02:10:04,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I took out the word address.

1588
02:10:05,062 --> 02:10:05,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you listen?

1589
02:10:06,002 --> 02:10:09,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I did hear you, and guess what, I still don't support it because it's- Well, you don't have to support it.

1590
02:10:09,623 --> 02:10:10,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not.

1591
02:10:10,283 --> 02:10:11,004
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna be a real- Then don't.

1592
02:10:11,264 --> 02:10:12,744
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to make a, forget it.

1593
02:10:12,984 --> 02:10:14,024
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna be a real good leader.

1594
02:10:15,265 --> 02:10:15,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Easy.

1595
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:18,601
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Caviello, you're all set?

1596
02:10:18,721 --> 02:10:19,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all set, Mr. Chair.

1597
02:10:20,102 --> 02:10:24,526
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1598
02:10:24,566 --> 02:10:25,326
[SPEAKER_22]: What's the motion?

1599
02:10:25,567 --> 02:10:28,129
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this two amendments on that?

1600
02:10:28,229 --> 02:10:30,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's the motion.

1601
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:31,811
[SPEAKER_22]: Say it again?

1602
02:10:31,832 --> 02:10:32,252
[SPEAKER_22]: Three.

1603
02:10:32,672 --> 02:10:33,673
[SPEAKER_22]: One is strike addresses.

1604
02:10:33,693 --> 02:10:38,897
[SPEAKER_22]: One is insert lump sums, raises, and increase in salaries.

1605
02:10:39,718 --> 02:10:46,103
[SPEAKER_22]: And the other one is by council on the night, to show the strike name and add employee IDs.

1606
02:10:47,851 --> 02:10:53,212
[SPEAKER_22]: Can we separate those please?

1607
02:10:53,252 --> 02:10:58,413
[SPEAKER_21]: That's four.

1608
02:10:58,473 --> 02:11:00,294
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselor Knight withdraws his amendment.

1609
02:11:00,954 --> 02:11:02,574
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just, if I could, through the chair.

1610
02:11:02,734 --> 02:11:03,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, you have Mike.

1611
02:11:03,935 --> 02:11:04,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

1612
02:11:04,255 --> 02:11:04,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1613
02:11:04,655 --> 02:11:06,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor Dela Cruz, President Dela Cruz.

1614
02:11:06,395 --> 02:11:14,677
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I could further amend this, that we get the answers we want by June 19th, which is Friday and our Friday, Friday packet, that's almost two weeks.

1615
02:11:15,212 --> 02:11:19,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a concern with the fact that the budget was already on the agenda at the beginning of May.

1616
02:11:19,153 --> 02:11:19,874
[SPEAKER_15]: It was tabled.

1617
02:11:20,354 --> 02:11:27,076
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have a great feeling that we're going to be meeting with the superintendent's schools on Tuesday the 23rd at 6 p.m.

1618
02:11:27,156 --> 02:11:29,817
[SPEAKER_15]: and they're going to want us to vote on the budget at 7 p.m.

1619
02:11:29,977 --> 02:11:32,658
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not a firm date.

1620
02:11:33,579 --> 02:11:43,262
[SPEAKER_21]: That's been changed and it's a TBA on the school department because I want us to have ample time to have that budget in our hands, time to study it,

1621
02:11:43,801 --> 02:11:45,542
[SPEAKER_21]: and ask proper questions.

1622
02:11:45,622 --> 02:11:54,247
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we are not, we are not, as long as I'm president, accepting a budget and voting it that night.

1623
02:11:54,488 --> 02:11:54,708
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1624
02:11:54,968 --> 02:11:55,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1625
02:11:59,491 --> 02:12:06,155
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to go on record that if that did happen, that I, you know, the school department would not have my vote for the budget.

1626
02:12:10,037 --> 02:12:11,118
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have that all amended.

1627
02:12:11,178 --> 02:12:11,458
[SPEAKER_21]: And Ms.

1628
02:12:11,478 --> 02:12:12,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Martin, would you like to speak one?

1629
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:13,700
[SPEAKER_21]: more time.

1630
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:14,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1631
02:12:14,221 --> 02:12:17,983
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've talked a lot tonight, but, um, Jean Martin 10 coming street.

1632
02:12:18,023 --> 02:12:19,124
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to support Ms.

1633
02:12:19,144 --> 02:12:23,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Cohen there because, um, I don't need to know anybody's name.

1634
02:12:23,407 --> 02:12:26,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, need to know anybody's address as a member of the public.

1635
02:12:27,089 --> 02:12:34,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the mayor is the person that's in charge of the school committee and it can look very biased.

1636
02:12:34,554 --> 02:12:36,015
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't think that the mayor,

1637
02:12:36,765 --> 02:12:39,727
[SPEAKER_00]: this is my personal opinion, should be in charge of the school committee.

1638
02:12:40,107 --> 02:12:44,049
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's supposed to be above everybody, keeping the checks and balances.

1639
02:12:44,109 --> 02:12:50,793
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it's the city side, why doesn't he be the chairman of the city council then?

1640
02:12:51,514 --> 02:12:59,258
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it looks like it could be that favoritism happens under the covers of night.

1641
02:12:59,939 --> 02:13:04,201
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has the appearance of looking funny.

1642
02:13:06,837 --> 02:13:08,078
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1643
02:13:08,438 --> 02:13:13,642
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's very important to point out that the school department's budget goes through a budget hearing process just like the city's budget does.

1644
02:13:13,742 --> 02:13:16,565
[SPEAKER_18]: And the school committee actually puts the budget together and votes on the budget.

1645
02:13:16,665 --> 02:13:19,247
[SPEAKER_18]: So there is a check and balance at that level as well.

1646
02:13:19,307 --> 02:13:21,489
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not just the mayor says do this and that's what they do.

1647
02:13:21,769 --> 02:13:23,210
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a check and balance at that level.

1648
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:27,954
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a legislative policymaking body at that level that does review these type of things.

1649
02:13:28,354 --> 02:13:33,338
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, that's what the school committee is for, to set the school policy and to set the school department's budget.

1650
02:13:33,832 --> 02:13:35,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And they've gone through budget hearings.

1651
02:13:35,093 --> 02:13:37,254
[SPEAKER_18]: They had extensive budget debates, if I'm not mistaken.

1652
02:13:37,274 --> 02:13:40,796
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they met five times in the month of May to go over their budget.

1653
02:13:40,836 --> 02:13:48,640
[SPEAKER_18]: So just to clarify the situation, the school committee has had an opportunity to review this budget, and the school committee has also had an opportunity to vote on it.

1654
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:54,543
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that they do that, but that is at a sub-level compared to the council and their responsibility.

1655
02:13:54,563 --> 02:13:58,865
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do agree that that's one step in the process, and I'm glad.

1656
02:13:59,305 --> 02:14:02,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I want to make sure

1657
02:14:03,121 --> 02:14:10,089
[SPEAKER_00]: See, the person checking is on the committee, and it just, it smacks of kind of an, you know, it could be.

1658
02:14:10,469 --> 02:14:11,711
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying that it is.

1659
02:14:11,831 --> 02:14:15,134
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that anybody's, you know, patting their, you know, bed.

1660
02:14:15,375 --> 02:14:16,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that at all.

1661
02:14:16,796 --> 02:14:18,338
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am saying it gives the appearance.

1662
02:14:18,758 --> 02:14:22,141
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we should, there is nothing wrong with asking those questions.

1663
02:14:22,542 --> 02:14:26,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I, Jean Martin, need to know the teacher's name and how much, I don't care.

1664
02:14:26,605 --> 02:14:38,116
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as I am confident that other people are making sure that those checks, that check, if I can have confidence in you guys that you're doing that check, then I don't need to know, because I believe in you.

1665
02:14:38,596 --> 02:14:42,280
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just, that has to do with the role of government in general.

1666
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:45,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, I have to comment on.

1667
02:14:45,601 --> 02:14:46,582
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thank you very much.

1668
02:14:46,622 --> 02:14:48,302
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I want to support Ms.

1669
02:14:48,322 --> 02:14:50,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Cohen, only because she's asking those questions.

1670
02:14:50,143 --> 02:14:53,184
[SPEAKER_00]: And transparency, it doesn't have to be personal.

1671
02:14:53,425 --> 02:14:54,105
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to know.

1672
02:14:54,545 --> 02:14:57,746
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need to know that the government is working transparently.

1673
02:14:58,107 --> 02:14:58,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1674
02:14:58,787 --> 02:14:59,367
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Jean.

1675
02:15:00,047 --> 02:15:03,049
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1676
02:15:04,289 --> 02:15:05,890
[SPEAKER_21]: No, because the counselor withdrew it.

1677
02:15:09,723 --> 02:15:13,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Your amendment and Councilor Caviello's amendment and Councilor Mongo's amendment.

1678
02:15:13,644 --> 02:15:14,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Lump sums.

1679
02:15:15,205 --> 02:15:16,125
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caviello.

1680
02:15:16,245 --> 02:15:18,266
[SPEAKER_18]: It's contrary so that's why I said it.

1681
02:15:19,666 --> 02:15:20,486
[SPEAKER_11]: I want this ahead of time.

1682
02:15:20,546 --> 02:15:21,046
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to wait.

1683
02:15:23,167 --> 02:15:25,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask for it during the budget time.

1684
02:15:25,708 --> 02:15:25,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Fine.

1685
02:15:25,928 --> 02:15:29,669
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're moving this one?

1686
02:15:29,709 --> 02:15:31,229
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we alright with the way it is?

1687
02:15:31,850 --> 02:15:33,230
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we need to do any separations?

1688
02:15:33,290 --> 02:15:33,450
[SPEAKER_21]: No?

1689
02:15:33,970 --> 02:15:34,150
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1690
02:15:34,911 --> 02:15:36,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this is separate from the resolution.

1691
02:15:38,032 --> 02:15:38,572
[SPEAKER_18]: Put it in committee.

1692
02:15:38,592 --> 02:15:39,432
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's figure out what we want to do.

1693
02:15:40,658 --> 02:15:43,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Why wouldn't you want to get it ahead of time?

1694
02:15:44,519 --> 02:15:50,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm more comfortable to say, when the department head comes in, these are the questions we can ask them that night.

1695
02:15:51,602 --> 02:15:52,822
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no need to get it ahead of time.

1696
02:15:52,902 --> 02:15:55,123
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're going to ask that night, he's not prepared for it.

1697
02:15:55,163 --> 02:15:57,624
[SPEAKER_07]: How is he going to answer that night?

1698
02:15:57,644 --> 02:15:58,724
[SPEAKER_07]: The president will make him prepared.

1699
02:15:58,744 --> 02:16:01,665
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to move on my end first.

1700
02:16:02,685 --> 02:16:04,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote.

1701
02:16:04,286 --> 02:16:05,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote.

1702
02:16:05,246 --> 02:16:07,007
[SPEAKER_11]: On the resolution minus the word address.

1703
02:16:08,027 --> 02:16:09,348
[SPEAKER_21]: with council on those amendments.

1704
02:16:09,468 --> 02:16:10,628
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to separate.

1705
02:16:10,848 --> 02:16:14,370
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a motion to separate, uh, out councilor Caviello's?

1706
02:16:16,211 --> 02:16:17,232
[SPEAKER_21]: You can separate them out if you want.

1707
02:16:17,272 --> 02:16:19,152
[SPEAKER_18]: The contrary items, Mr. President.

1708
02:16:19,193 --> 02:16:23,455
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think we'd have to separate, separate councilor Caviello's amendment as their contrary.

1709
02:16:23,475 --> 02:16:25,035
[SPEAKER_18]: So there'd have to be, there'd have to be seven.

1710
02:16:25,536 --> 02:16:27,897
[SPEAKER_21]: So the, uh, councilor Caviello's first.

1711
02:16:32,019 --> 02:16:34,660
[SPEAKER_21]: On, uh, we asked for a roll call vote.

1712
02:16:35,180 --> 02:16:35,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Mr. President.

1713
02:16:39,834 --> 02:16:42,056
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we have a motion to sever?

1714
02:16:42,076 --> 02:16:42,896
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

1715
02:16:42,936 --> 02:16:43,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1716
02:16:43,637 --> 02:16:43,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1717
02:16:43,977 --> 02:16:44,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1718
02:16:44,938 --> 02:16:45,699
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

1719
02:16:46,499 --> 02:16:47,960
[SPEAKER_21]: The ayes have it.

1720
02:16:48,681 --> 02:16:49,602
[SPEAKER_21]: So the two is seven.

1721
02:16:49,742 --> 02:16:53,765
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll take Councilor Caviello's amendment, which was?

1722
02:16:53,785 --> 02:17:00,571
[SPEAKER_21]: The superintendent and the department heads provide this information.

1723
02:17:01,511 --> 02:17:02,412
[SPEAKER_21]: At the time of the meeting.

1724
02:17:02,512 --> 02:17:03,013
[SPEAKER_21]: That's correct.

1725
02:17:03,373 --> 02:17:03,773
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

1726
02:17:05,334 --> 02:17:07,156
[SPEAKER_21]: On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1727
02:17:08,945 --> 02:17:22,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, if I could, uh, you know, if we're going to do it that way and get it that night, and if they come not prepared with that information, then what recourse do we have as a council?

1728
02:17:22,197 --> 02:17:30,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we say also within the amendment that we will cancel that particular department heads budget meeting for that night if they don't come prepared?

1729
02:17:30,464 --> 02:17:34,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I would, I would support that will be called.

1730
02:17:35,124 --> 02:17:38,085
[SPEAKER_21]: If they don't have proper information, supporting documents.

1731
02:17:38,545 --> 02:17:44,208
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't support the budget that night on that particular department.

1732
02:17:44,268 --> 02:17:45,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's a wise move.

1733
02:17:46,028 --> 02:17:53,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I would support that, but I wouldn't support just a blanket, having them say they're going to come in with something and then they don't appear.

1734
02:17:53,711 --> 02:17:59,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And we still go through the process because that defeats the purpose of us getting together and deliberating on items.

1735
02:18:00,294 --> 02:18:03,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to amend yours, I'll amend it.

1736
02:18:03,175 --> 02:18:03,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So that,

1737
02:18:04,805 --> 02:18:09,527
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're not prepared, then their budget won't get talked about that, and it'll get pushed to another night.

1738
02:18:09,547 --> 02:18:10,827
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll push it to another night.

1739
02:18:11,507 --> 02:18:15,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're not talking about a ridiculous amount of people here.

1740
02:18:16,209 --> 02:18:22,591
[SPEAKER_07]: If the department head doesn't know the two or three people that have come on, then... Yeah.

1741
02:18:23,792 --> 02:18:24,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

1742
02:18:24,432 --> 02:18:31,574
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Councillor Caravaglio has amended his amendment further.

1743
02:18:32,314 --> 02:18:33,735
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we're ready for a vote on that.

1744
02:18:34,940 --> 02:18:36,420
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Penta on that motion.

1745
02:18:36,460 --> 02:18:37,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Rick, let me ask you a question.

1746
02:18:37,821 --> 02:18:39,921
[SPEAKER_11]: We got this book ahead of time to review it.

1747
02:18:40,621 --> 02:18:42,101
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to be getting it on that night.

1748
02:18:42,861 --> 02:18:46,202
[SPEAKER_11]: This resolution has given you ample time to get it, review it.

1749
02:18:46,402 --> 02:18:51,663
[SPEAKER_11]: And so when that night comes and then you can just school can be school committees being tonight to do their budget.

1750
02:18:52,243 --> 02:18:52,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1751
02:18:52,723 --> 02:18:52,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1752
02:18:53,703 --> 02:18:54,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait.

1753
02:18:54,103 --> 02:18:57,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, council, we're not, we're not talking about hundreds of people here.

1754
02:18:57,144 --> 02:19:02,465
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not talking about hundreds of people talking about how many people we're talking about.

1755
02:19:02,505 --> 02:19:02,965
[SPEAKER_07]: It may be 20 people.

1756
02:19:03,557 --> 02:19:05,478
[SPEAKER_07]: throughout the whole school department and the city department?

1757
02:19:05,538 --> 02:19:05,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean.

1758
02:19:07,659 --> 02:19:09,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is both city and school.

1759
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:09,720
[SPEAKER_07]: City and school.

1760
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:12,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I would say, I mean, how many people will say what?

1761
02:19:12,361 --> 02:19:12,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1762
02:19:14,931 --> 02:19:22,536
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason why the superintendent can't supply that information that night when he comes.

1763
02:19:23,497 --> 02:19:24,878
[SPEAKER_07]: The city's already in the budget.

1764
02:19:24,998 --> 02:19:30,322
[SPEAKER_07]: As the department heads come forward, they'll bring it.

1765
02:19:30,582 --> 02:19:34,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they don't have it, then we'll pass on their budget for that evening.

1766
02:19:34,405 --> 02:19:36,026
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's what your language reads, I support that.

1767
02:19:36,463 --> 02:19:39,986
[SPEAKER_07]: The language is, the information on the city side, we have it already.

1768
02:19:40,046 --> 02:19:45,171
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's say, the department head can just bring it to our attention, those few people that are on there.

1769
02:19:45,371 --> 02:19:46,532
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not that big of a deal.

1770
02:19:46,552 --> 02:19:50,135
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion of council, Chair Powell, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1771
02:19:50,456 --> 02:19:55,460
[SPEAKER_11]: On that motion, if I understand that correctly, but can we get that as a separate document?

1772
02:19:55,720 --> 02:19:59,404
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not inclusive in the budget, it's included, but as a separate document.

1773
02:19:59,764 --> 02:20:00,144
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words,

1774
02:20:01,445 --> 02:20:04,166
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's no need of that.

1775
02:20:04,206 --> 02:20:06,667
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to table is undebatable.

1776
02:20:06,687 --> 02:20:07,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call vote.

1777
02:20:07,748 --> 02:20:09,228
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call vote to table.

1778
02:20:12,469 --> 02:20:16,331
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we tabling this Councilor Caravaglio's separated amendment?

1779
02:20:16,811 --> 02:20:16,951
No.

1780
02:20:17,852 --> 02:20:19,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to table the whole paper.

1781
02:20:23,354 --> 02:20:23,534
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1782
02:20:24,274 --> 02:20:25,215
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't got anything yet.

1783
02:20:27,075 --> 02:20:27,876
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Camuso?

1784
02:20:27,896 --> 02:20:28,176
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1785
02:20:28,816 --> 02:20:28,976
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1786
02:20:29,917 --> 02:20:30,657
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caravaglio?

1787
02:20:30,857 --> 02:20:30,917
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1788
02:20:31,898 --> 02:20:32,398
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Nye?

1789
02:20:32,538 --> 02:20:32,759
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1790
02:20:33,919 --> 02:20:34,720
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice Mayor Long, current?

1791
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:35,160
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

1792
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:36,461
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marx?

1793
02:20:36,561 --> 02:20:36,821
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1794
02:20:38,122 --> 02:20:38,722
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Penta?

1795
02:20:38,762 --> 02:20:39,002
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1796
02:20:40,063 --> 02:20:40,803
[SPEAKER_22]: President De La Rosa?

1797
02:20:41,124 --> 02:20:41,304
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1798
02:20:47,047 --> 02:20:51,290
[SPEAKER_21]: Five, two to table, five in the negative.

1799
02:20:51,650 --> 02:20:52,530
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion fails.

1800
02:20:53,431 --> 02:20:59,795
[SPEAKER_21]: So before us is Councilor Caviello's motion that the superintendent and department heads

1801
02:21:00,406 --> 02:21:12,469
[SPEAKER_21]: come prepared on the night of their meetings to present to the counselors the requested information regarding new hires, raises, et cetera.

1802
02:21:13,849 --> 02:21:25,812
[SPEAKER_21]: And if they are unprepared to have that discussion, their portion of the budget hearing will be closed out, and they will have no presentation that night.

1803
02:21:26,773 --> 02:21:28,153
[SPEAKER_21]: On that motion, counselor?

1804
02:21:29,579 --> 02:21:30,920
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1805
02:21:32,181 --> 02:21:33,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Quick question, Councilor Camuso.

1806
02:21:35,083 --> 02:21:35,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Raises.

1807
02:21:36,344 --> 02:21:40,648
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about 99% of the employees get the raises, as Councilor Longo said.

1808
02:21:40,688 --> 02:21:42,169
[SPEAKER_09]: The Secretary's got a 1%.

1809
02:21:44,451 --> 02:21:46,312
[SPEAKER_09]: So everyone got a raise, basically.

1810
02:21:47,533 --> 02:21:50,035
[SPEAKER_09]: We want every single job description of every single employee.

1811
02:21:50,355 --> 02:21:51,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's the way this reads right now.

1812
02:21:52,196 --> 02:21:52,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of clarification.

1813
02:21:53,337 --> 02:21:55,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of clarification, Councilor Longo-Kern.

1814
02:21:55,639 --> 02:21:58,101
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why we put the wording lump sum.

1815
02:21:59,678 --> 02:22:02,439
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not talking about the 1%, the 2%, the teachers.

1816
02:22:02,459 --> 02:22:03,540
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not talking about the teachers.

1817
02:22:03,580 --> 02:22:10,143
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about people that got lump sum, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 20 plus $1,000 raises.

1818
02:22:10,183 --> 02:22:11,524
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to know who those people are.

1819
02:22:11,564 --> 02:22:12,465
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't want their addresses.

1820
02:22:12,805 --> 02:22:13,385
[SPEAKER_15]: We just want to know.

1821
02:22:13,565 --> 02:22:14,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I ask a question?

1822
02:22:14,326 --> 02:22:15,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Where does it say lump sum?

1823
02:22:15,326 --> 02:22:16,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I missing it?

1824
02:22:16,627 --> 02:22:17,307
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an amendment.

1825
02:22:17,327 --> 02:22:18,868
[SPEAKER_09]: If you paid attention, you would have heard it.

1826
02:22:19,248 --> 02:22:22,390
[SPEAKER_09]: The lump sum amendment was on Council Member Kern.

1827
02:22:23,498 --> 02:22:27,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're going to get a blank piece of paper back, because these are fictitious, these promotions.

1828
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:28,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're promotions.

1829
02:22:28,721 --> 02:22:29,181
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not just raises.

1830
02:22:29,201 --> 02:22:30,081
[SPEAKER_21]: Move the question, Mr. President.

1831
02:22:30,201 --> 02:22:30,661
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion.

1832
02:22:30,782 --> 02:22:32,402
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we're not here to obstruct the process.

1833
02:22:32,422 --> 02:22:34,964
[SPEAKER_09]: This sounds more like a union issue at the schools.

1834
02:22:35,204 --> 02:22:35,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselors.

1835
02:22:36,104 --> 02:22:36,764
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing to do with the union.

1836
02:22:36,784 --> 02:22:38,325
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not here to obstruct the process.

1837
02:22:38,365 --> 02:22:40,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1838
02:22:40,926 --> 02:22:43,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this on Councilor Caviello's amendment?

1839
02:22:43,087 --> 02:22:43,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1840
02:22:43,668 --> 02:22:44,548
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a union issue.

1841
02:22:44,588 --> 02:22:46,509
[SPEAKER_22]: We're getting involved with union issues now.

1842
02:22:46,529 --> 02:22:48,510
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caviello's amendment.

1843
02:22:48,970 --> 02:22:49,751
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Camuso.

1844
02:22:49,911 --> 02:22:50,091
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1845
02:22:51,171 --> 02:22:51,912
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caviello.

1846
02:22:51,952 --> 02:22:52,092
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1847
02:22:53,067 --> 02:22:53,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

1848
02:22:53,687 --> 02:22:53,807
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1849
02:22:55,088 --> 02:22:55,968
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice Mayor Longo-Kern?

1850
02:22:55,988 --> 02:22:56,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1851
02:22:57,108 --> 02:22:57,728
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Martins?

1852
02:22:57,968 --> 02:22:58,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1853
02:22:59,229 --> 02:22:59,829
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Penta?

1854
02:22:59,909 --> 02:23:00,129
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1855
02:23:00,549 --> 02:23:01,529
[SPEAKER_21]: President DelaRusso?

1856
02:23:01,769 --> 02:23:01,989
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1857
02:23:02,870 --> 02:23:05,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Vote of four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

1858
02:23:05,070 --> 02:23:05,970
[SPEAKER_21]: The motion carries.

1859
02:23:06,871 --> 02:23:13,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Now to the main motion of Councilor Penta as amended by Councilor Penta and Vice President Alongo-Kern.

1860
02:23:14,393 --> 02:23:15,813
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1861
02:23:18,114 --> 02:23:18,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Camuso?

1862
02:23:21,811 --> 02:23:22,552
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Cavillo?

1863
02:23:22,972 --> 02:23:23,132
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1864
02:23:24,093 --> 02:23:24,633
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Nye?

1865
02:23:24,793 --> 02:23:24,973
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1866
02:23:26,054 --> 02:23:27,075
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Long-Term?

1867
02:23:28,036 --> 02:23:28,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1868
02:23:29,257 --> 02:23:29,897
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Matz?

1869
02:23:30,037 --> 02:23:30,398
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1870
02:23:31,498 --> 02:23:32,059
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Pantano?

1871
02:23:32,099 --> 02:23:32,379
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1872
02:23:34,781 --> 02:23:35,541
[SPEAKER_21]: President Del Rosso?

1873
02:23:35,742 --> 02:23:35,942
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1874
02:23:37,103 --> 02:23:42,106
[SPEAKER_21]: In the vote of three in the affirmative, four in the negative, the motion fails.

1875
02:23:49,092 --> 02:23:50,352
[SPEAKER_21]: The next item.

1876
02:23:52,083 --> 02:23:52,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President?

1877
02:23:53,063 --> 02:23:54,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Councilor Camuso.

1878
02:23:54,184 --> 02:24:02,407
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some people that have been waiting very patiently in the back for Councilor Penta's paper on the rights.

1879
02:24:03,727 --> 02:24:07,068
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to take a paper out of order.

1880
02:24:07,388 --> 02:24:08,169
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

1881
02:24:08,449 --> 02:24:09,149
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1882
02:24:09,189 --> 02:24:09,569
[SPEAKER_21]: Opposed?

1883
02:24:09,589 --> 02:24:10,349
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion carries.

1884
02:24:10,369 --> 02:24:16,151
[SPEAKER_21]: 15-529, offered by Councilor Penta.

1885
02:24:21,114 --> 02:24:31,440
[SPEAKER_21]: be resolved that the matter of Rights Pond guidelines for this year regarding fees and walk-in passes be discussed and forwarded to the Park Board for resolution.

1886
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:32,220
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Penta.

1887
02:24:32,381 --> 02:24:48,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, over this past weekend and up until this afternoon, I've received a decent amount of emails as it relates to Rights Pond, the new change in the rules and the regulations as it relates to what is taking place up there.

1888
02:24:48,650 --> 02:24:49,631
[SPEAKER_11]: And that has prompted a, uh,

1889
02:24:50,632 --> 02:25:03,474
[SPEAKER_11]: A flurry of concern from not only senior citizens, but bike enthusiasts, and from people who now have enjoyed Wrights Pond for so many years, but now really question what is going on.

1890
02:25:04,154 --> 02:25:07,595
[SPEAKER_11]: The fee has now gone up from $35 to $50 this year.

1891
02:25:08,555 --> 02:25:14,496
[SPEAKER_11]: And the two passes that normally would be given on an annual basis have not, or is not being given.

1892
02:25:15,577 --> 02:25:18,197
[SPEAKER_11]: And that includes the separate, the walk-in passes.

1893
02:25:18,755 --> 02:25:20,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you have to pay for those separate.

1894
02:25:21,396 --> 02:25:32,279
[SPEAKER_11]: So if somebody shows up on foot or by a bike or by public transit, they're not going to be able to get in because apparently there's going to be a fee structure that's going to stop them from getting in.

1895
02:25:34,159 --> 02:25:47,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I think what we're looking at, from my understanding from speaking with folks, this was from the administration handed down from the budget director to the parking board, parking commission.

1896
02:25:47,503 --> 02:25:48,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, strike that.

1897
02:25:49,103 --> 02:25:49,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it the park board?

1898
02:25:50,184 --> 02:25:54,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the park board, I guess, as it relates to what's going on up there.

1899
02:25:54,586 --> 02:25:56,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just not fair.

1900
02:25:56,106 --> 02:25:59,588
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this city gets hit on all kinds of taxes.

1901
02:25:59,868 --> 02:26:00,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Forget the kiosk.

1902
02:26:01,149 --> 02:26:01,829
[SPEAKER_11]: You get the water.

1903
02:26:01,849 --> 02:26:02,610
[SPEAKER_11]: You get the sewer.

1904
02:26:03,530 --> 02:26:04,951
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got your real estate tax.

1905
02:26:05,551 --> 02:26:06,912
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got your income tax.

1906
02:26:06,972 --> 02:26:10,033
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get your meals tax and room occupancy tax.

1907
02:26:10,774 --> 02:26:16,957
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just a simple little thing that only is in our community for about eight to nine weeks a year.

1908
02:26:17,077 --> 02:26:17,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Rights pawned.

1909
02:26:18,989 --> 02:26:21,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Wrights Point is not supposed to be a moneymaker.

1910
02:26:21,251 --> 02:26:27,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Wrights Point is supposed to be one of these simple little places that we as a community, the people who live in this city, have an opportunity to go.

1911
02:26:28,176 --> 02:26:33,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether you're a senior citizen, a mom with two or three kids, you want to spend your family and you go up there for the day.

1912
02:26:33,079 --> 02:26:39,364
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Medford home-based luxury, so to speak, that a lot of other cities and towns don't have.

1913
02:26:40,265 --> 02:26:47,550
[SPEAKER_11]: And now to go from $25 to $35, and now you're up to $50 per person or per car, whatever the sticker is going to be.

1914
02:26:48,112 --> 02:26:52,955
[SPEAKER_11]: And now they're taking away the walk-in passes, and they're paying separate for those.

1915
02:26:53,315 --> 02:26:54,576
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know there's a concern I see.

1916
02:26:54,596 --> 02:26:56,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Bruce Kulick, is he still here?

1917
02:26:58,499 --> 02:27:04,182
[SPEAKER_11]: He had a concern as a bike enthusiast, because he's the chairperson of the Bike Commission.

1918
02:27:05,003 --> 02:27:11,407
[SPEAKER_11]: They have major concerns over this, because now all these people are going to be charged to go up there and do something, eight to nine weeks out of the year.

1919
02:27:13,028 --> 02:27:15,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year, they opened by the skin of their tooth.

1920
02:27:16,786 --> 02:27:19,267
[SPEAKER_11]: play equipment, I believe, up there at that time.

1921
02:27:19,807 --> 02:27:21,968
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it's just wrong.

1922
02:27:22,248 --> 02:27:26,629
[SPEAKER_11]: The city should not be charging people for every single thing to try to make money on them.

1923
02:27:27,170 --> 02:27:31,231
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a few things you got to just pony up and say, hey, it's eight to nine weeks out of the year.

1924
02:27:31,291 --> 02:27:33,972
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes you're not even going to get a good day if the weather was bad.

1925
02:27:34,672 --> 02:27:36,533
[SPEAKER_11]: So that cuts down the season short.

1926
02:27:37,113 --> 02:27:38,954
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just unfortunate.

1927
02:27:39,714 --> 02:27:42,235
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think hopefully there's people here that want to speak on it.

1928
02:27:42,885 --> 02:27:46,088
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just think the park commission, I think they meet on the 16th.

1929
02:27:46,148 --> 02:27:47,649
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a week from this Tuesday.

1930
02:27:48,850 --> 02:27:49,891
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that's what it is.

1931
02:27:50,672 --> 02:27:51,933
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's at six o'clock at night.

1932
02:27:51,973 --> 02:27:58,198
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would hope people would just go there and express to them that their concern, you know, it's rights pawned.

1933
02:27:58,939 --> 02:28:09,228
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a, it's a little place for moms to bring their kids and maybe dad's on the weekend or grandparents or friends that might want to come, but charging and keep charging and charging.

1934
02:28:10,313 --> 02:28:15,576
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to put people out of business for wanting to go there and enjoy something that we should be able to enjoy.

1935
02:28:15,596 --> 02:28:17,437
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, once upon a time, you didn't have to pay for it.

1936
02:28:18,238 --> 02:28:21,439
[SPEAKER_11]: And now they want to charge you to keep you out of there.

1937
02:28:21,459 --> 02:28:22,480
[SPEAKER_11]: So it doesn't make any sense.

1938
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:25,762
[SPEAKER_11]: So the resolution, Mr. President, I know those people want to speak.

1939
02:28:26,842 --> 02:28:39,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to have it forwarded to the, I believe it's the park board, the park commission, excuse me, that they review the new fee structure that they have for this year and give consideration that the rate increases

1940
02:28:39,730 --> 02:28:42,431
[SPEAKER_11]: are just unfair to the citizens of Medford.

1941
02:28:43,792 --> 02:28:44,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record.

1942
02:28:45,072 --> 02:28:46,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Linda Julia, 25 Edward Street.

1943
02:28:47,773 --> 02:28:50,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank Councilor Pinta for bringing this up.

1944
02:28:53,095 --> 02:28:56,056
[SPEAKER_02]: As he says, there's been quite a bit of talk about this this week.

1945
02:28:56,517 --> 02:28:59,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to get my park pass for my family, as I do every year.

1946
02:29:00,058 --> 02:29:07,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I was quite surprised to discover that the fees had been raised so dramatically, and also to see that the car pass no longer includes a walk-in pass.

1947
02:29:08,548 --> 02:29:12,151
[SPEAKER_02]: My family very often drives in the pond, because we don't live particularly close.

1948
02:29:12,591 --> 02:29:18,615
[SPEAKER_02]: But occasionally, we will make a bike trip, or we'll visit a friend who lives nearby, and then we'll walk into the park.

1949
02:29:19,055 --> 02:29:23,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the new structure, we would have to pay twice as much this year as we have in previous years in order to do that.

1950
02:29:24,639 --> 02:29:28,942
[SPEAKER_02]: The car passes go from $35 to $50, and walking passes have gone from $5 to $20.

1951
02:29:29,602 --> 02:29:34,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 400% increase in walking passes, and they're no longer included with the cars.

1952
02:29:37,537 --> 02:29:45,602
[SPEAKER_02]: in direct opposition to Medford's goals to be a greener city, to encourage people to bike, to walk, to use their cars less often.

1953
02:29:45,962 --> 02:29:53,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I now feel that in order to be environmentally responsible, I must pay a fee for the privilege, and that seems unfair.

1954
02:29:54,428 --> 02:30:00,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I do understand that there have been some budget concerns, and certainly it takes money to maintain the pond, to pay the employees there.

1955
02:30:01,955 --> 02:30:06,556
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to believe there's a better way to do this that's not such a huge increase in one shot.

1956
02:30:07,097 --> 02:30:15,939
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a better system that better meets the needs of both individuals and families who would like to use this amazing resource in our town.

1957
02:30:16,459 --> 02:30:17,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what can be done about it.

1958
02:30:17,960 --> 02:30:20,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how this decision was made.

1959
02:30:20,380 --> 02:30:22,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been corresponding with the recreation coordinators.

1960
02:30:23,018 --> 02:30:24,959
[SPEAKER_02]: They tell me that they're as surprised as I am.

1961
02:30:25,299 --> 02:30:26,580
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know how this happened.

1962
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:28,100
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't control the brochures.

1963
02:30:28,421 --> 02:30:31,342
[SPEAKER_02]: The people in the recreation department do not know how this happened.

1964
02:30:31,822 --> 02:30:37,125
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know who does know, but perhaps somebody can get to the bottom of it.

1965
02:30:37,845 --> 02:30:47,670
[SPEAKER_11]: But as a point of clarification, I was told it came from the prior budget director, and that was directed at the end of last year's season to raise the rates for this.

1966
02:30:47,870 --> 02:30:48,050
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1967
02:30:49,231 --> 02:30:51,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, wrong, or indifferent, something happened because these rates got raised.

1968
02:30:52,550 --> 02:31:00,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, well, I do understand why rates might need to be raised, but I think the manner in which they were raised and the system of the fees is not really a workable one.

1969
02:31:01,012 --> 02:31:01,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1970
02:31:01,412 --> 02:31:04,173
[SPEAKER_07]: We will do our best to find out how those rates came about.

1971
02:31:04,913 --> 02:31:05,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1972
02:31:05,574 --> 02:31:06,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And reduce them.

1973
02:31:09,015 --> 02:31:09,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1974
02:31:10,215 --> 02:31:11,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1975
02:31:11,715 --> 02:31:13,676
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can certainly see the frustration.

1976
02:31:13,716 --> 02:31:17,537
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that a 100% increase in any fee that we have here in the city is far too much.

1977
02:31:18,671 --> 02:31:23,872
[SPEAKER_18]: With that being said, Mr. President, I support the resolution to have the park board take a look at their fee structure and to make accommodations.

1978
02:31:24,653 --> 02:31:30,594
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, a 5% increase, something like that, might seem a little bit more reasonable than a 100% increase at this point in time.

1979
02:31:30,694 --> 02:31:36,916
[SPEAKER_18]: I support the resolution that Councillor Penter has put forward in terms of having them take a look and revisiting the fee structure.

1980
02:31:37,816 --> 02:31:39,896
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I thank them for bringing the resolution forward.

1981
02:31:39,936 --> 02:31:47,338
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that it's problematic to have city government shy people away from using our recreational areas when we have

1982
02:31:48,052 --> 02:31:56,536
[SPEAKER_18]: so many problems in our community with drug abuse, with childhood obesity and the like, that we want people to take advantage of these resources, not be deterred, Mr. President.

1983
02:31:56,576 --> 02:32:00,038
[SPEAKER_18]: So, with that being said, I appreciate your leadership on this, Councilor Pinto.

1984
02:32:01,118 --> 02:32:01,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1985
02:32:01,458 --> 02:32:02,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address of the record, please.

1986
02:32:03,506 --> 02:32:03,866
[SPEAKER_27]: Me again.

1987
02:32:04,606 --> 02:32:07,347
[SPEAKER_27]: Debbie Steiner Hayes, 29 Damon Road, Medford, Mass.

1988
02:32:07,908 --> 02:32:12,509
[SPEAKER_27]: So I came for the library, kind of interested in the parking meters, and I stayed.

1989
02:32:12,529 --> 02:32:13,590
[SPEAKER_07]: We're glad you stayed with us all evening.

1990
02:32:13,790 --> 02:32:14,150
[SPEAKER_27]: That's right.

1991
02:32:14,230 --> 02:32:17,051
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm here to close the night with Wright's Pond.

1992
02:32:17,231 --> 02:32:22,433
[SPEAKER_27]: So I moved to Medford, I don't know, 25, 30 years ago.

1993
02:32:23,013 --> 02:32:26,314
[SPEAKER_27]: Once I found out Medford had Wright's Pond, I have not left.

1994
02:32:26,334 --> 02:32:27,255
[SPEAKER_27]: And you're stuck with me.

1995
02:32:28,695 --> 02:32:30,156
[SPEAKER_27]: I love Wrights Pond.

1996
02:32:30,236 --> 02:32:33,238
[SPEAKER_27]: It is the jewel of Medford, absolutely, without a doubt.

1997
02:32:34,399 --> 02:32:42,364
[SPEAKER_27]: When I first came here, I think a parking pass was $30 a year to go, absolutely, then it turned to $35, and we're talking about a 400% increase from $5 to $20 for walk and pass.

1998
02:32:47,587 --> 02:32:50,269
[SPEAKER_27]: I understand that it costs money to be at Wrights Pond.

1999
02:32:50,570 --> 02:32:54,653
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a couple of issues I just want to make sure that if you're not aware of, that you should be aware of.

2000
02:32:55,093 --> 02:33:04,360
[SPEAKER_27]: Number one, Wrights Pond is only open from July 4th weekend, somewhere around there, till Labor Day.

2001
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:10,005
[SPEAKER_27]: Also at Wrights Pond, you can only be there until a half an hour before sunset, so July is awesome.

2002
02:33:10,405 --> 02:33:13,287
[SPEAKER_27]: By the time you get to the middle of August, you have to be out of there by 6, 615.

2003
02:33:15,389 --> 02:33:16,750
[SPEAKER_27]: I know Marie Cassidy used to do

2004
02:33:18,472 --> 02:33:20,153
[SPEAKER_27]: concerts at Wrights Pond on Tuesday night.

2005
02:33:20,553 --> 02:33:26,077
[SPEAKER_27]: This year she's moved her August concerts to the Condon Shell just because it wasn't fun.

2006
02:33:26,117 --> 02:33:27,138
[SPEAKER_27]: They were kicking us out.

2007
02:33:27,518 --> 02:33:30,300
[SPEAKER_27]: Like the minute the concert ended, they were kicking people out.

2008
02:33:31,400 --> 02:33:35,443
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, was at MFN this morning, 20 new families in there with kids.

2009
02:33:35,863 --> 02:33:37,985
[SPEAKER_27]: We are getting tons and tons of new families.

2010
02:33:38,585 --> 02:33:41,747
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just, it's not fun to be kicked out of Wrights Pond.

2011
02:33:42,067 --> 02:33:44,809
[SPEAKER_27]: The kids weren't even swimming in the week we were getting kicked out.

2012
02:33:46,666 --> 02:33:49,850
[SPEAKER_27]: This increase is sort of a hard nut to swallow.

2013
02:33:50,351 --> 02:34:01,106
[SPEAKER_27]: I can see paying 50 bucks a year, I'm okay with that, but I do think that one should then get thrown in the bus, I mean the walk-in pass, because instead of

2014
02:34:01,594 --> 02:34:05,556
[SPEAKER_27]: paying $20, you should say, look, if you want both, we're going to charge you $50.

2015
02:34:05,996 --> 02:34:18,442
[SPEAKER_27]: If you want a walk-in pass because you don't have a car, then we're going to give you a walk-in pass for four people or eight people or whatever, however many people you need, and we'll charge you $50 for that, or maybe even $40, a little bit less, because if someone doesn't have a car, they probably can't afford $50.

2016
02:34:19,687 --> 02:34:20,148
[SPEAKER_27]: to come in.

2017
02:34:20,168 --> 02:34:23,452
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, we're talking that the pond is only open for about seven weeks.

2018
02:34:24,213 --> 02:34:31,303
[SPEAKER_27]: And out of those seven weeks, they don't have, I mean, this time of year, granted it's raining, but it was, you know, 80 degrees today.

2019
02:34:31,484 --> 02:34:33,186
[SPEAKER_27]: We could have gone swimming there after school.

2020
02:34:33,226 --> 02:34:34,187
[SPEAKER_27]: The kids could have gone swimming.

2021
02:34:34,207 --> 02:34:35,910
[SPEAKER_27]: We definitely can go swimming on the weekends.

2022
02:34:36,380 --> 02:34:44,788
[SPEAKER_27]: I get it that we want to hire our high school people, and so they're in school, so you can't have it open during the week, but I don't understand why we can't have it open on the weekends.

2023
02:34:45,569 --> 02:34:51,916
[SPEAKER_27]: It is a beautiful, I mean, between me and you, sorry, I know I'm on TV, but I snuck in there last week and went swimming.

2024
02:34:52,156 --> 02:34:53,177
[SPEAKER_27]: It was gorgeous.

2025
02:34:53,397 --> 02:34:55,840
[SPEAKER_27]: It is beautiful, like, it's swimmable now.

2026
02:34:56,500 --> 02:35:01,205
[SPEAKER_27]: And for us not to use it from May till July is just stupid.

2027
02:35:01,625 --> 02:35:04,668
[SPEAKER_27]: And yes, they did take out the playground, but you know what?

2028
02:35:04,708 --> 02:35:05,929
[SPEAKER_27]: He did put in a new playground.

2029
02:35:05,949 --> 02:35:07,991
[SPEAKER_27]: The one that was at McNally then got put there.

2030
02:35:08,111 --> 02:35:12,075
[SPEAKER_27]: So there is a playground there, just for clarification.

2031
02:35:12,976 --> 02:35:15,478
[SPEAKER_27]: It could be, yeah, there's a nice playground there.

2032
02:35:15,498 --> 02:35:17,340
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a beautiful, you know, it's the one that was at McNally.

2033
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:20,143
[SPEAKER_27]: He cleaned it up and he put it back in there all nice and spiffy clean.

2034
02:35:21,588 --> 02:35:24,709
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm sorry for rambling, but it's a beautiful place.

2035
02:35:25,109 --> 02:35:27,189
[SPEAKER_27]: We should be able to use it absolutely.

2036
02:35:27,909 --> 02:35:32,950
[SPEAKER_27]: If people want a bike in there, I mean, the whole reason why we have to pay for parking is because it's a small parking lot.

2037
02:35:33,010 --> 02:35:33,350
[SPEAKER_27]: I get it.

2038
02:35:33,410 --> 02:35:37,551
[SPEAKER_27]: But I actually don't understand why you would have to pay for having a bike in there.

2039
02:35:37,591 --> 02:35:38,971
[SPEAKER_27]: That to me makes no sense.

2040
02:35:39,311 --> 02:35:40,691
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, that's my thoughts.

2041
02:35:40,911 --> 02:35:41,231
[SPEAKER_27]: Have a nice day.

2042
02:35:41,251 --> 02:35:41,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2043
02:35:41,551 --> 02:35:42,091
[SPEAKER_07]: You are correct.

2044
02:35:42,111 --> 02:35:43,352
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the real jewel of the community.

2045
02:35:43,612 --> 02:35:43,892
[SPEAKER_27]: It is.

2046
02:35:44,092 --> 02:35:44,532
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2047
02:35:44,912 --> 02:35:45,532
[SPEAKER_27]: That's your words.

2048
02:35:45,552 --> 02:35:51,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

2049
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:52,620
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Michael Leggero.

2050
02:35:52,660 --> 02:35:54,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

2051
02:35:54,841 --> 02:36:02,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to, I wish to talk about sort of the tone of what this budget increase or this fee increase actually says to the community.

2052
02:36:02,984 --> 02:36:06,965
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why we have a park and we make it available is that we want people to enjoy it.

2053
02:36:07,145 --> 02:36:08,306
[SPEAKER_04]: We want people to be outside.

2054
02:36:08,346 --> 02:36:09,406
[SPEAKER_04]: We want people to bike in.

2055
02:36:10,006 --> 02:36:13,368
[SPEAKER_04]: You could charge $5 for our library cards, but we don't.

2056
02:36:13,668 --> 02:36:13,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

2057
02:36:14,248 --> 02:36:16,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it has a positive impact on the community.

2058
02:36:16,909 --> 02:36:20,450
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the, we have to consider very carefully these kinds of increases.

2059
02:36:21,149 --> 02:36:27,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And for this reason, I hope that we can maintain the level that we were at last year.

2060
02:36:27,874 --> 02:36:28,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2061
02:36:28,935 --> 02:36:29,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2062
02:36:29,816 --> 02:36:30,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso.

2063
02:36:30,777 --> 02:36:31,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2064
02:36:31,817 --> 02:36:35,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly don't like to see any fees raised, as all of us do.

2065
02:36:36,061 --> 02:36:39,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to know, when did the park board actually increase this?

2066
02:36:41,085 --> 02:36:46,949
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we could get the minutes of the park board, because they're the statutory authority that actually approved this.

2067
02:36:47,570 --> 02:36:50,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Secondly, I'd like to find out when the last increase was.

2068
02:36:51,626 --> 02:36:59,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm sure if it was done three years ago, if we could also get the minutes from the three years ago when it was increased by the park board as well.

2069
02:37:01,597 --> 02:37:04,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can just take a look at it, also see what it's costing to run it now as well.

2070
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:11,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that they were looking a few years ago to possibly put one of the fountains to keep the water running like Felsmere Pond.

2071
02:37:12,610 --> 02:37:17,414
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm wondering if, uh, if that's still in the plans and if this is to offset the cost of some of that, I don't know.

2072
02:37:17,774 --> 02:37:22,658
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could ask the park board, um, board when they did it and what the motion.

2073
02:37:23,659 --> 02:37:23,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2074
02:37:25,020 --> 02:37:25,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

2075
02:37:26,862 --> 02:37:27,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2076
02:37:28,143 --> 02:37:31,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to touch upon, I'm, I'm adamantly opposed to any increase.

2077
02:37:32,306 --> 02:37:35,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that could be offset in a number of ways within the budget.

2078
02:37:36,008 --> 02:37:44,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the big criticisms I hear from parents in the community is that there's a lack of places to take your children, as Councilor Knight mentioned.

2079
02:37:45,572 --> 02:37:48,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Years ago, we used to have a movie theater, a drive-in theater, a bowling alley.

2080
02:37:48,893 --> 02:37:55,216
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a lot of different things in the community, and for youngsters and, you know, teenagers.

2081
02:37:55,716 --> 02:38:04,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And to say that we're going to have an area which is a hidden gem in our community and raise the fees that, you know, you don't know what people's circumstances are.

2082
02:38:04,445 --> 02:38:10,808
[SPEAKER_06]: This might price people out from going up to a place that I believe everyone in the community should have access to.

2083
02:38:11,408 --> 02:38:16,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And no matter what your financial ability is, everyone should have access to this particular area.

2084
02:38:16,991 --> 02:38:25,935
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason why we can't use the area that sells water and juice and snacks up there to offset any rate increase.

2085
02:38:25,995 --> 02:38:33,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize there's an expense to running an area like this, but there's no reason why the city can't get creative

2086
02:38:33,903 --> 02:38:38,904
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor knows how, when he needs to go to wind to get $100,000 for a peace garden.

2087
02:38:39,224 --> 02:38:41,505
[SPEAKER_06]: He knows quickly how to get that money, Mr. President.

2088
02:38:42,185 --> 02:38:53,508
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it comes to offsetting rates for our own residents that use an area in our city, they just raise the rate without any hesitation.

2089
02:38:53,568 --> 02:38:58,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think this could be done internally, Mr. President.

2090
02:38:58,569 --> 02:39:02,990
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason to raise the rates, especially, as was mentioned, a 400 percent increase

2091
02:39:03,797 --> 02:39:08,340
[SPEAKER_06]: even though it's only 5 to 20, that's unheard of in this day and age.

2092
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:16,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other issue about taking your bike and discouraging people from wanting to take their bike up there, that's a huge issue.

2093
02:39:17,366 --> 02:39:25,931
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor recently came out with his big press release, how he's going to be more bike friendly, and he's going to have bike stations around the community, and he's going to create bike lanes.

2094
02:39:26,311 --> 02:39:29,533
[SPEAKER_06]: But now he wants anyone taking a bike up to Wrights Pawn, charge you extra money.

2095
02:39:30,721 --> 02:39:32,662
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make any sense, Mr. President.

2096
02:39:32,882 --> 02:39:33,642
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no thought.

2097
02:39:33,682 --> 02:39:35,262
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no vision in this community.

2098
02:39:35,602 --> 02:39:37,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just seems like issues are thrown out there.

2099
02:39:38,543 --> 02:39:43,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, there's no cohesion that puts all this together to make sense.

2100
02:39:43,624 --> 02:39:45,044
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I support this.

2101
02:39:45,104 --> 02:39:47,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank Councilor Penta for bringing this issue up.

2102
02:39:48,165 --> 02:39:58,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And I support finding out how these got raised and sending a message back to the administration and the park board that we are not in support of this, Mr. President.

2103
02:39:58,872 --> 02:39:59,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Maxwell.

2104
02:39:59,873 --> 02:40:00,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

2105
02:40:00,934 --> 02:40:01,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2106
02:40:01,334 --> 02:40:06,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd also like to, uh, Councilor Penta doesn't mind, um, ask for an answer to back from the mayor.

2107
02:40:06,719 --> 02:40:12,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they were looking at, uh, a year ago when I proposed it, uh, sprinkle a park and it's that time of year again.

2108
02:40:12,283 --> 02:40:15,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And the parents at the Brooks school the other day were asking, Hey, is that going to come to fruition?

2109
02:40:15,686 --> 02:40:20,790
[SPEAKER_09]: They heard about the dog park and this and that, and they're not seeing that get off the ground as quick as some people would like.

2110
02:40:21,451 --> 02:40:24,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but the sprinkle a park, I know there's a huge, huge,

2111
02:40:26,226 --> 02:40:28,488
[SPEAKER_09]: portion of our community that would love a sprinkler park.

2112
02:40:28,548 --> 02:40:30,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Malden just opened up another one.

2113
02:40:31,010 --> 02:40:33,111
[SPEAKER_09]: They had the ribbon cutting a few days ago.

2114
02:40:34,692 --> 02:40:42,438
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could get an update, because I think that that's something that will be incredible in this community, a sprinkler park.

2115
02:40:42,478 --> 02:40:45,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's something that doesn't cost a fee to use.

2116
02:40:45,440 --> 02:40:48,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And just the parents absolutely love them.

2117
02:40:48,863 --> 02:40:52,386
[SPEAKER_09]: People actually leave Medford to go to the DCR one over in the Belmont line.

2118
02:40:53,206 --> 02:40:54,147
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how popular they are.

2119
02:40:55,417 --> 02:40:56,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilman.

2120
02:40:56,037 --> 02:40:57,718
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd hate to be behind Malden on anything.

2121
02:40:58,018 --> 02:40:58,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2122
02:41:01,059 --> 02:41:01,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, sir.

2123
02:41:01,999 --> 02:41:05,600
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio, 12 years in Medford.

2124
02:41:08,681 --> 02:41:16,624
[SPEAKER_14]: I have an affinity with Wrights Pond because I used to go there when I was younger, and there was never a fee to pay to get into Wrights Pond, if I'm not mistaken.

2125
02:41:17,544 --> 02:41:23,186
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there was a fee, we always would have gone in over by Eagle Rock to get in there and hop the fence or whatever we had to do.

2126
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:30,324
[SPEAKER_14]: In 1926, when my family moved out from the north end by way of Italy, we built one of the first houses on Elm Street.

2127
02:41:31,064 --> 02:41:34,846
[SPEAKER_14]: As you come up and just take the right to Elm Street, number 7 Elm Street.

2128
02:41:35,226 --> 02:41:42,611
[SPEAKER_14]: I have pictures of my grandfather, my uncles, my father, boating, fishing, right up in that area.

2129
02:41:42,911 --> 02:41:46,313
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's always a place where my grandfather used to take me when I was a little boy.

2130
02:41:48,824 --> 02:41:50,445
[SPEAKER_14]: I am so opposed to these fees.

2131
02:41:50,525 --> 02:41:57,307
[SPEAKER_14]: I am opposed to having to pay for this because this should be something like an item in the budget that maintenance is taking care of.

2132
02:41:57,667 --> 02:42:01,049
[SPEAKER_14]: There are also some ideas that you might want to put forward.

2133
02:42:02,189 --> 02:42:07,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Fishing tournaments like they have at Horn Pond, you get the state to come in, you get them to stock it, you run a couple of tournaments.

2134
02:42:07,851 --> 02:42:09,492
[SPEAKER_14]: The state will not come in and stock the ponds.

2135
02:42:09,772 --> 02:42:10,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Why, is it that polluted?

2136
02:42:11,072 --> 02:42:11,272
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2137
02:42:11,592 --> 02:42:16,134
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because if the state stocks the pond, that means it becomes open to everybody.

2138
02:42:16,791 --> 02:42:18,352
[SPEAKER_07]: So currently it's only for residents.

2139
02:42:18,972 --> 02:42:21,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, I did look into that some years ago.

2140
02:42:21,953 --> 02:42:27,475
[SPEAKER_07]: They were gonna come in, but when they found out that it wasn't open to all residents, then they don't stock the pond.

2141
02:42:29,396 --> 02:42:30,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, good idea.

2142
02:42:32,578 --> 02:42:33,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry, Councilor Pinto.

2143
02:42:34,318 --> 02:42:35,639
[SPEAKER_11]: But the city can stock it themselves.

2144
02:42:35,659 --> 02:42:36,379
[SPEAKER_11]: The city can stock the pond.

2145
02:42:36,459 --> 02:42:38,000
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can buy the fish and stock it.

2146
02:42:38,020 --> 02:42:39,480
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of fish people.

2147
02:42:39,500 --> 02:42:45,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I did look into that with the state a couple of years ago, and they would have stocked it, but it's a city resource, not a state resource.

2148
02:42:48,617 --> 02:42:55,802
[SPEAKER_14]: But, in spite of the fact that I don't agree with any of the increases and I think that residents should have some kind of an I.D.

2149
02:42:55,822 --> 02:43:06,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Card maybe at a very minimum cost, I think that the least we should do is offer the membership free to our veterans and to our senior citizens.

2150
02:43:06,370 --> 02:43:08,511
[SPEAKER_14]: And, is this, is it A.D.A.

2151
02:43:09,352 --> 02:43:10,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Compliant up there?

2152
02:43:14,512 --> 02:43:16,834
[SPEAKER_14]: to expand that in any way, shape or form.

2153
02:43:17,294 --> 02:43:22,217
[SPEAKER_14]: With the bathrooms, restrooms and everything to be an ADA certified?

2154
02:43:22,277 --> 02:43:22,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2155
02:43:22,717 --> 02:43:27,140
[SPEAKER_07]: We have that bike to get the, that car to get people into the water.

2156
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:30,401
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think it's a great resource.

2157
02:43:33,263 --> 02:43:34,784
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the best resource in this community.

2158
02:43:34,924 --> 02:43:35,184
[SPEAKER_14]: It is.

2159
02:43:35,444 --> 02:43:40,407
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's, you know, like we have the mystic river, but we haven't taken advantage of anything on that.

2160
02:43:41,208 --> 02:43:41,288
[SPEAKER_14]: And,

2161
02:43:41,810 --> 02:43:48,332
[SPEAKER_07]: No reason during the summertime, one night a week, a couple nights a month, do a movie night up there or something like that.

2162
02:43:48,612 --> 02:43:50,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

2163
02:43:50,253 --> 02:43:52,313
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be open until nine o'clock, once or twice a month.

2164
02:43:52,833 --> 02:43:53,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

2165
02:43:53,133 --> 02:43:53,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And do something up there.

2166
02:43:53,894 --> 02:43:54,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2167
02:43:55,294 --> 02:43:56,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Barbecue, movies for the kids.

2168
02:43:57,175 --> 02:43:57,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

2169
02:43:57,895 --> 02:43:58,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2170
02:43:58,755 --> 02:43:59,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2171
02:44:01,076 --> 02:44:02,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

2172
02:44:03,417 --> 02:44:05,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Elise Burias, 38 Lawson Street.

2173
02:44:05,457 --> 02:44:07,398
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be brief because most of this has been covered.

2174
02:44:08,422 --> 02:44:10,103
[SPEAKER_12]: We live a five-minute walk from Wright's Pond.

2175
02:44:10,163 --> 02:44:16,125
[SPEAKER_12]: My family and I have two little kids, and so we'll hop over for 20 minutes after supper, and we just, we make great use of it.

2176
02:44:16,285 --> 02:44:19,386
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'm happy to contribute to having it run.

2177
02:44:19,666 --> 02:44:26,769
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have a problem paying for a pass, but the jump from five to 20 just seemed really huge without any explanation.

2178
02:44:26,849 --> 02:44:35,992
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess my only, my biggest request is it would be nice if there could be some transparency, and I think the community would be more open to these sorts of things if we were

2179
02:44:36,542 --> 02:44:39,624
[SPEAKER_12]: sort of let in on the process and just told why it was necessary.

2180
02:44:41,326 --> 02:44:42,507
[SPEAKER_12]: I had something else, but I lost it.

2181
02:44:42,707 --> 02:44:43,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, thank you very much.

2182
02:44:44,528 --> 02:44:44,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

2183
02:44:44,988 --> 02:44:45,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Pater.

2184
02:44:47,450 --> 02:44:48,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you already buy the pass?

2185
02:44:48,851 --> 02:44:50,212
[SPEAKER_12]: I have not bought the pass this year yet.

2186
02:44:50,553 --> 02:44:53,495
[SPEAKER_11]: So is the pass singular, or do you have to buy one for each person?

2187
02:44:53,875 --> 02:45:00,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the $5 walk-in pass covers from one to three people, and so in the past what we would do is my husband and I would each buy one, and then if we had

2188
02:45:00,954 --> 02:45:04,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Friends along with us, as with young kids, you typically do have a couple of friends.

2189
02:45:04,336 --> 02:45:06,137
[SPEAKER_12]: And we know people outside of Medford, too.

2190
02:45:06,918 --> 02:45:13,922
[SPEAKER_11]: So prior to this rate increase, if you got your permit last year, you also got two walk-in passes.

2191
02:45:14,042 --> 02:45:14,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no.

2192
02:45:14,442 --> 02:45:15,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I only bought a walk-in pass.

2193
02:45:15,843 --> 02:45:16,864
[SPEAKER_12]: I live a five-minute walk.

2194
02:45:16,904 --> 02:45:17,944
[SPEAKER_12]: I would never go through.

2195
02:45:17,964 --> 02:45:21,947
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you did last year, you bought the $35 permit, you would get the two walk-in passes.

2196
02:45:22,167 --> 02:45:22,647
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2197
02:45:22,747 --> 02:45:24,008
[SPEAKER_12]: I never have bought my driving pass.

2198
02:45:24,028 --> 02:45:24,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, OK.

2199
02:45:24,188 --> 02:45:24,608
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't know.

2200
02:45:24,908 --> 02:45:25,469
[SPEAKER_12]: I only walk.

2201
02:45:26,389 --> 02:45:27,170
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't make sense.

2202
02:45:27,270 --> 02:45:27,890
[SPEAKER_12]: I know the other thing.

2203
02:45:27,930 --> 02:45:29,651
[SPEAKER_12]: There have been people who have said.

2204
02:45:29,671 --> 02:45:30,512
[SPEAKER_07]: One person at a time with a rail.

2205
02:45:30,890 --> 02:45:36,174
[SPEAKER_12]: publicly on some of the Medford lists that this will be enough to make them not come to the pond this summer.

2206
02:45:36,234 --> 02:45:42,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if you're a working parent, to go for the 20 minutes or half an hour after work, it doesn't make a lot of sense.

2207
02:45:42,839 --> 02:45:44,320
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe they'll make it a few times.

2208
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:47,022
[SPEAKER_12]: And for $35, maybe they were willing to work it out.

2209
02:45:47,543 --> 02:45:50,865
[SPEAKER_12]: But for $50, just the added, they're not going to make it.

2210
02:45:50,925 --> 02:45:54,849
[SPEAKER_11]: No matter how you look at Wright's Pond, because they have to pay for the lifeguards, and they have to pay for all the support.

2211
02:45:54,889 --> 02:45:56,270
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, it's like a business deal.

2212
02:45:56,310 --> 02:45:57,110
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a loss leader.

2213
02:45:57,491 --> 02:45:59,252
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a good loss leader for the community.

2214
02:45:59,882 --> 02:46:06,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you're ever going to try to think and make money on that, and then you're going to just keep raising this rate each and every year, and it really doesn't make any sense at all.

2215
02:46:06,349 --> 02:46:06,730
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's wrong.

2216
02:46:06,750 --> 02:46:07,110
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I understand.

2217
02:46:07,150 --> 02:46:10,374
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanted to be clear that, as a citizen, I am willing to contribute back.

2218
02:46:10,414 --> 02:46:12,376
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're fortunate in my family that we can do that.

2219
02:46:12,476 --> 02:46:15,600
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, the lack of transparency in the community is difficult.

2220
02:46:16,541 --> 02:46:16,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2221
02:46:16,781 --> 02:46:17,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2222
02:46:19,224 --> 02:46:20,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

2223
02:46:23,882 --> 02:46:30,886
[SPEAKER_27]: So last year, the pass was $35 to drive in and $5 to walk in.

2224
02:46:31,527 --> 02:46:34,989
[SPEAKER_27]: So because I don't live five minutes away, I would buy one of each.

2225
02:46:35,209 --> 02:46:36,350
[SPEAKER_27]: I would buy a drive-in.

2226
02:46:38,792 --> 02:46:40,813
[SPEAKER_27]: There was never a free walk-in.

2227
02:46:43,835 --> 02:46:44,435
[SPEAKER_11]: They're 20.

2228
02:46:45,096 --> 02:46:45,396
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.

2229
02:46:46,386 --> 02:46:46,706
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.

2230
02:46:46,886 --> 02:46:48,127
[SPEAKER_27]: But you didn't get them.

2231
02:46:48,187 --> 02:46:49,088
[SPEAKER_27]: You had to pay for them.

2232
02:46:49,508 --> 02:47:00,054
[SPEAKER_27]: So I would pay $45 and have a driving pass for $35 plus two $5 walking passes.

2233
02:47:00,214 --> 02:47:03,856
[SPEAKER_27]: I would end up with two passes to walk.

2234
02:47:03,976 --> 02:47:07,578
[SPEAKER_27]: I would pay $45 and be able to drive or bike in with my kid.

2235
02:47:08,118 --> 02:47:10,339
[SPEAKER_11]: So to do the same thing this year.

2236
02:47:10,359 --> 02:47:11,060
[SPEAKER_27]: It's going to cost me $70.

2237
02:47:12,698 --> 02:47:12,998
[SPEAKER_11]: $70 more.

2238
02:47:13,398 --> 02:47:14,058
[SPEAKER_27]: No, not more.

2239
02:47:14,078 --> 02:47:16,100
[SPEAKER_27]: $70 total.

2240
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:16,640
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, 45.

2241
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:17,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2242
02:47:17,340 --> 02:47:17,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

2243
02:47:17,861 --> 02:47:17,721
45.

2244
02:47:17,901 --> 02:47:18,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2245
02:47:18,661 --> 02:47:19,221
[SPEAKER_11]: 15, three times.

2246
02:47:19,942 --> 02:47:20,482
[SPEAKER_27]: Almost double.

2247
02:47:20,582 --> 02:47:20,762
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

2248
02:47:21,563 --> 02:47:27,306
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, the other thing is, is just FYI, there's tough school, which has also gone up significantly this year.

2249
02:47:27,326 --> 02:47:33,510
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, I, I just thought on Facebook while I was waiting, I don't remember the exact numbers, but that's gone up significantly this year.

2250
02:47:33,930 --> 02:47:36,652
[SPEAKER_27]: Then I don't really understand why that's quite so high.

2251
02:47:37,353 --> 02:47:45,399
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm glad to see, thank you all, that McNally Park is going to open this Friday with hot dogs and ice cream.

2252
02:47:45,419 --> 02:47:45,779
[SPEAKER_27]: Woo-hoo.

2253
02:47:46,319 --> 02:47:48,000
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's been ready for weeks.

2254
02:47:48,161 --> 02:47:51,223
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's finally, because there was an opening, it will be open.

2255
02:47:52,463 --> 02:47:57,207
[SPEAKER_27]: The other park that is a new park is Magoon.

2256
02:47:57,687 --> 02:47:59,188
[SPEAKER_27]: And that still is yet to be open.

2257
02:47:59,288 --> 02:48:00,729
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, it's a beautiful park.

2258
02:48:00,789 --> 02:48:01,149
[SPEAKER_27]: It's 90% done.

2259
02:48:02,357 --> 02:48:04,018
[SPEAKER_27]: The kids are drooling to get in there.

2260
02:48:04,038 --> 02:48:05,659
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be... That's next on our agenda.

2261
02:48:06,220 --> 02:48:06,560
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, it is?

2262
02:48:06,920 --> 02:48:08,942
[SPEAKER_27]: I should stay and talk about that.

2263
02:48:08,962 --> 02:48:10,723
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to stay a little longer with us?

2264
02:48:10,803 --> 02:48:14,026
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you really going to talk about the parks next?

2265
02:48:14,166 --> 02:48:16,347
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to stay a little longer, you can stay.

2266
02:48:16,367 --> 02:48:17,308
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about that next.

2267
02:48:17,708 --> 02:48:18,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2268
02:48:18,349 --> 02:48:18,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

2269
02:48:19,770 --> 02:48:21,011
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2270
02:48:21,051 --> 02:48:28,857
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that the question before us is what the prior fee structure was for Wrights Pond, what the current fee structure for Wrights Pond is, and why these changes were made.

2271
02:48:28,897 --> 02:48:30,658
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's the question that we're looking to ask.

2272
02:48:31,809 --> 02:48:38,172
[SPEAKER_18]: With that being said, I think that we pretty much know more about the Rights Upon Pass program now than we've ever known before in the past.

2273
02:48:38,552 --> 02:48:41,634
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's time to get the question answered, Mr. President, so I'd move for approval on the paper.

2274
02:48:41,894 --> 02:48:42,974
[SPEAKER_07]: One last question to the real now.

2275
02:48:43,174 --> 02:48:44,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

2276
02:48:44,475 --> 02:48:45,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Linda Julian, 25 Edward Street.

2277
02:48:46,596 --> 02:48:47,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I will try to be brief.

2278
02:48:48,096 --> 02:48:51,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I am quite certain that the car passes included a walking pass last year.

2279
02:48:52,178 --> 02:48:53,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I did receive one in the envelope.

2280
02:48:53,799 --> 02:48:54,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not pay extra.

2281
02:48:55,099 --> 02:48:56,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we can look this up.

2282
02:48:57,458 --> 02:49:04,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Just briefly to elaborate on what Elise said, I have also heard many people say, in this case, I can't afford it.

2283
02:49:04,582 --> 02:49:05,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't do it this year.

2284
02:49:06,023 --> 02:49:11,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to pull your heart strings, yesterday my husband and I were discussing this fee increase.

2285
02:49:11,706 --> 02:49:16,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Our five-year-old daughter overheard us, and she started crying in the back seat because she loves that pond.

2286
02:49:16,528 --> 02:49:18,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And she thought this meant we couldn't go.

2287
02:49:18,789 --> 02:49:22,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I will find the money, and I will go, because I'm not going to see my little girl cry.

2288
02:49:22,791 --> 02:49:24,512
[SPEAKER_02]: But not everybody is in the position to do that.

2289
02:49:25,060 --> 02:49:29,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to see children crying over Medford because they don't get to go swimming this year.

2290
02:49:29,824 --> 02:49:30,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2291
02:49:30,324 --> 02:49:30,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2292
02:49:31,845 --> 02:49:39,231
[SPEAKER_07]: On Councilor Penter's motion motion is be resolved.

2293
02:49:41,252 --> 02:49:48,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the matter of the rights borne guidelines for this year regarding fees and walking passes be discussed and forwarded to the park board for

2294
02:49:49,432 --> 02:49:51,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Resolution, I think we have a couple of add-ons there.

2295
02:49:52,555 --> 02:49:55,378
[SPEAKER_22]: Senator, the park board can revisit the fixed schedule.

2296
02:49:58,961 --> 02:50:14,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let's get an answer to the question, then we can find out what- Yeah, there may be a reason why.

2297
02:50:20,988 --> 02:50:23,470
[SPEAKER_11]: The suggestion is you've heard it from enough people.

2298
02:50:23,491 --> 02:50:24,932
[SPEAKER_11]: The rate has gone up.

2299
02:50:26,073 --> 02:50:27,294
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gone up significantly.

2300
02:50:27,874 --> 02:50:31,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you're going to get all the information that's going to tell you this is the reason why.

2301
02:50:31,377 --> 02:50:34,560
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's probably going to say, well, it's costing us money.

2302
02:50:34,800 --> 02:50:38,783
[SPEAKER_11]: We know it's costing us money and we know that the city is not making money on it.

2303
02:50:38,863 --> 02:50:42,226
[SPEAKER_11]: But Wright's point is not to be made a place to have money.

2304
02:50:42,426 --> 02:50:44,468
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that lady, the last lady who just came up,

2305
02:50:45,322 --> 02:50:53,567
[SPEAKER_11]: When she hears a little girl in her car turn around and say that she thinks she may not be able to go to Wrightsbarn because it costs too much, you can't explain that to a 7, 8, or a 9-year-old kid.

2306
02:50:54,287 --> 02:50:58,309
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to say your city doesn't want you to go there because you don't have enough money in your pocket.

2307
02:50:59,170 --> 02:51:07,094
[SPEAKER_11]: The park board, the park commission should realize, listen, we have four or five parks all summer long and that you put park supervisors in there.

2308
02:51:07,554 --> 02:51:12,297
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't charge a citizen to go into any of those parks to participate in any of those programs.

2309
02:51:12,983 --> 02:51:16,326
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're there all day long, and they don't have to worry about a time curfew.

2310
02:51:17,187 --> 02:51:17,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

2311
02:51:17,848 --> 02:51:21,932
[SPEAKER_11]: So the difference between that and Rights Pond, there's no difference.

2312
02:51:28,168 --> 02:51:29,689
[SPEAKER_18]: the recreational councils at our park.

2313
02:51:29,749 --> 02:51:30,230
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know.

2314
02:51:30,530 --> 02:51:31,871
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why we're asking the question.

2315
02:51:32,992 --> 02:51:35,715
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why we're asking the question.

2316
02:51:35,735 --> 02:51:39,398
[SPEAKER_18]: We tell them to reduce the fee structure, then what do they say to us?

2317
02:51:39,438 --> 02:51:42,441
[SPEAKER_18]: They say, okay, we'll reduce the fee structure, but they're no more parkway constructors.

2318
02:51:42,901 --> 02:51:46,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Why did the increase happen is the question that needs to be answered first and foremost.

2319
02:51:46,565 --> 02:51:49,347
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't support the increase, but I just want to know why it happened and where the money is going.

2320
02:51:51,248 --> 02:52:05,133
[SPEAKER_11]: If the mayor has the wherewithal to go out and get from Cummings $100,000, $150,000, he had the wherewithal to go to Wynn's Casino and get $100,000 for his pet projects, but he's not that concerned about the kids in this community in the summertime.

2321
02:52:05,526 --> 02:52:10,953
[SPEAKER_11]: that we have to keep raising the fees to try to maintain them, well that is not good government.

2322
02:52:11,013 --> 02:52:13,877
[SPEAKER_11]: That's poor government and that doesn't work for the people.

2323
02:52:14,177 --> 02:52:18,463
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know you're not going to make money at Wrights Pond and you're not going to make money in the summertime.

2324
02:52:18,724 --> 02:52:21,828
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some things you're just going to have to lose money on and you eat it.

2325
02:52:22,068 --> 02:52:23,550
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lost leader in business.

2326
02:52:23,805 --> 02:52:25,146
[SPEAKER_11]: but you're making the people come in.

2327
02:52:25,186 --> 02:52:26,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero hit it right in the head.

2328
02:52:26,747 --> 02:52:28,989
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to give them something to want to come here for.

2329
02:52:29,410 --> 02:52:39,358
[SPEAKER_11]: He just spent almost $275,000 because he found mysteriously this money to put into the library, but he's had it for the last six years because he wouldn't take it out of free cash.

2330
02:52:40,739 --> 02:52:44,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, we're asking the question here.

2331
02:52:44,722 --> 02:52:45,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, we're asking the question.

2332
02:52:45,983 --> 02:52:47,625
[SPEAKER_18]: We're all in agreement we want the question answered.

2333
02:52:47,725 --> 02:52:50,027
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I think we're belaboring this issue a little bit.

2334
02:52:50,047 --> 02:52:52,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Right's Pawn is going to be closed by the time we close this debate on the issue.

2335
02:52:54,375 --> 02:52:55,516
[SPEAKER_07]: We will go for a vote tonight.

2336
02:52:57,058 --> 02:52:57,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Member Kern.

2337
02:52:58,219 --> 02:53:00,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Carviello.

2338
02:53:00,501 --> 02:53:05,966
[SPEAKER_15]: I would move to reduce it back down to the $5, at least for the walk-ins.

2339
02:53:06,666 --> 02:53:08,048
[SPEAKER_15]: No kids should be crying.

2340
02:53:08,168 --> 02:53:09,889
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, what do they expect?

2341
02:53:09,949 --> 02:53:12,512
[SPEAKER_07]: We will add it on to the motion there.

2342
02:53:12,572 --> 02:53:12,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2343
02:53:12,872 --> 02:53:13,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I finish?

2344
02:53:13,773 --> 02:53:15,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Reduce or kept the same as was last year.

2345
02:53:15,754 --> 02:53:16,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I finish?

2346
02:53:16,295 --> 02:53:16,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

2347
02:53:16,893 --> 02:53:20,234
[SPEAKER_15]: I think what they're looking to make is probably another $300 to $500.

2348
02:53:20,274 --> 02:53:23,475
[SPEAKER_15]: We have $6.5 million in free cash.

2349
02:53:23,495 --> 02:53:29,876
[SPEAKER_15]: You're taking it from Medford families who want to go to use the pond.

2350
02:53:30,316 --> 02:53:31,376
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's ridiculous.

2351
02:53:31,456 --> 02:53:33,117
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree.

2352
02:53:33,137 --> 02:53:36,158
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be reduced back to what it was last year.

2353
02:53:36,338 --> 02:53:36,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2354
02:53:37,278 --> 02:53:38,598
[SPEAKER_07]: On Council Appendix motion.

2355
02:53:40,258 --> 02:53:43,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, could you read back the amendments to it?

2356
02:53:43,919 --> 02:53:44,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2357
02:53:47,620 --> 02:53:53,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we also ask the status if there were or if they intend to have any increases at Tufts pool?

2358
02:53:54,402 --> 02:54:00,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think the lady said there were, I think they said there was an increase at Tufts pool also.

2359
02:54:00,223 --> 02:54:09,965
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'd like to get it from the park board who raises the rates because once again, we will add that to the motion because normally they go part and parcel, the lifeguards and the, what do they call them?

2360
02:54:10,305 --> 02:54:14,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Not park rangers, attendants, bath attendants, park attendants and the park police.

2361
02:54:15,178 --> 02:54:16,659
[SPEAKER_09]: No, park rangers.

2362
02:54:16,679 --> 02:54:18,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Penta just got promoted to lieutenant.

2363
02:54:20,460 --> 02:54:21,420
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll get it on your list.

2364
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:23,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Penta.

2365
02:54:24,741 --> 02:54:25,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, councilor Caluso.

2366
02:54:26,042 --> 02:54:28,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, if you could read back the amendment, please.

2367
02:54:31,383 --> 02:54:42,547
[SPEAKER_22]: I report it to the park board to review the, revisit the fee schedule as the current rate is unfair to the public.

2368
02:54:42,587 --> 02:54:44,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caluso is at the

2369
02:54:45,598 --> 02:54:50,000
[SPEAKER_22]: When did the increase in fee take place, the minutes of that particular meeting?

2370
02:54:51,761 --> 02:54:58,405
[SPEAKER_22]: And last year, three years ago, last increase three years ago in the minutes of that meeting.

2371
02:55:01,806 --> 02:55:05,608
[SPEAKER_22]: I may report back on sprinkler parks.

2372
02:55:06,929 --> 02:55:09,550
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a lot of current.

2373
02:55:12,167 --> 02:55:17,050
[SPEAKER_22]: Recommendation to the park board, reduce the fee by $5 or keep it the same as last year.

2374
02:55:17,891 --> 02:55:22,274
[SPEAKER_22]: And this last one is the status of increases at the Tufts pool.

2375
02:55:22,514 --> 02:55:22,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2376
02:55:23,955 --> 02:55:24,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso.

2377
02:55:24,976 --> 02:55:34,262
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may too, if we can congratulate Michael Penta, who was just promoted in our community to lieutenant of the Medford Park Ranges.

2378
02:55:35,105 --> 02:55:37,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Michael Penta has been a very good employee for about 15 years.

2379
02:55:37,728 --> 02:55:39,911
[SPEAKER_07]: We will do that after we vote on this motion.

2380
02:55:40,451 --> 02:55:43,776
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's within this department, so Michael Penta deserves congratulations.

2381
02:55:43,956 --> 02:55:48,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's vote on this first and then we'll commend Mr. Penta for his promotion.

2382
02:55:55,250 --> 02:55:59,673
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe Councillor Lungo said to revert the walk-in to $5, but to revert the $50 to $35.

2383
02:55:59,713 --> 02:56:04,156
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking to revert to last year's rate, period.

2384
02:56:04,856 --> 02:56:05,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2385
02:56:06,057 --> 02:56:07,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Pender, do you want to roll call on this?

2386
02:56:08,159 --> 02:56:09,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote has been requested.

2387
02:56:21,888 --> 02:56:30,973
[SPEAKER_22]: By Councilor Patu, is it the park board we paid before with the park board to revisit the fee structure as the current rates are not paid?

2388
02:56:32,473 --> 02:56:33,314
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2389
02:56:33,354 --> 02:56:42,018
[SPEAKER_22]: By Councilor Camuso, is it the date of the, the date of the, when the increase took place in the minutes of that particular meeting?

2390
02:56:42,899 --> 02:56:49,842
[SPEAKER_22]: And on the last increase that happened three years ago in the meetings of that meeting,

2391
02:56:53,035 --> 02:56:54,335
[SPEAKER_22]: Status on sprinkler parks.

2392
02:56:58,056 --> 02:56:59,256
[SPEAKER_22]: Congratulate Mike Penker.

2393
02:56:59,836 --> 02:57:01,797
[SPEAKER_22]: Status increase on Tusk Pool.

2394
02:57:02,517 --> 02:57:05,117
[SPEAKER_22]: Increase in price on Tusk Pool.

2395
02:57:05,517 --> 02:57:13,739
[SPEAKER_22]: And reduction of up to $5 on the fee or to be at last year's rate.

2396
02:57:13,819 --> 02:57:15,559
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2397
02:57:16,099 --> 02:57:17,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And to reduce it to last year's rate.

2398
02:57:17,640 --> 02:57:18,700
[SPEAKER_22]: And to reduce it to last year's rate.

2399
02:57:19,080 --> 02:57:19,840
[SPEAKER_07]: To last year's rate.

2400
02:57:23,963 --> 02:57:25,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clegg, please call the roll.

2401
02:57:27,946 --> 02:57:29,067
[SPEAKER_18]: What information counsel tonight?

2402
02:57:29,227 --> 02:57:30,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Amendment A says to revisit the rates.

2403
02:57:30,829 --> 02:57:33,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Amendment E says to reduce the fees to last year's rate, Dick.

2404
02:57:34,412 --> 02:57:35,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Contradictory.

2405
02:57:35,492 --> 02:57:38,555
[SPEAKER_18]: We're either telling them to reduce it or we're telling them to revisit it, but we can't tell them to do both.

2406
02:57:40,196 --> 02:57:40,656
[SPEAKER_18]: Reduce it.

2407
02:57:42,878 --> 02:57:43,118
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2408
02:57:52,253 --> 02:57:53,314
[SPEAKER_22]: So you have two of the same?

2409
02:57:53,894 --> 02:57:54,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2410
02:57:54,174 --> 02:57:56,036
[SPEAKER_07]: You have two of the same?

2411
02:57:56,356 --> 02:57:56,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2412
02:57:56,476 --> 02:57:57,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of the same.

2413
02:57:58,117 --> 02:58:00,319
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2414
02:58:00,339 --> 02:58:01,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, if you can please call the roll.

2415
02:58:03,041 --> 02:58:03,741
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Camuso?

2416
02:58:03,822 --> 02:58:04,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2417
02:58:05,042 --> 02:58:05,723
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caviello?

2418
02:58:05,963 --> 02:58:06,123
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2419
02:58:06,143 --> 02:58:09,065
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

2420
02:58:09,246 --> 02:58:09,546
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2421
02:58:10,567 --> 02:58:11,427
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Long-Term?

2422
02:58:11,487 --> 02:58:11,887
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2423
02:58:12,148 --> 02:58:12,688
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks?

2424
02:58:12,708 --> 02:58:13,349
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2425
02:58:13,389 --> 02:58:13,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Pantano?

2426
02:58:14,509 --> 02:58:14,650
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2427
02:58:14,670 --> 02:58:15,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor Galarruso?

2428
02:58:15,830 --> 02:58:18,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2429
02:58:19,393 --> 02:58:21,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

2430
02:58:21,094 --> 02:58:21,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

2431
02:58:22,517 --> 02:58:32,060
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're still under suspension, 15-528, offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that the matter of neighboring issues of concern around Magoon Park be discussed.

2432
02:58:33,580 --> 02:58:34,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

2433
02:58:36,321 --> 02:58:38,742
[SPEAKER_11]: There have been some concerns as it relates to Magoon Park.

2434
02:58:38,782 --> 02:58:43,143
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've all received emails from some of the neighboring folks that are down there.

2435
02:58:43,784 --> 02:58:46,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I believe, um, the park is ready to go.

2436
02:58:47,166 --> 02:58:50,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what, what the problem might be.

2437
02:58:51,128 --> 02:59:03,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but I believe, um, this is going to be referred to OCD, Lauren DeLaurento, because apparently this has come under her bailiwick and I just can't answer the question as to what the problems might be from the neighbors.

2438
02:59:03,175 --> 02:59:09,218
[SPEAKER_11]: They just don't seem to be satisfied either, either with the work schedule or some of the concerns that are taking place at the park.

2439
02:59:09,759 --> 02:59:12,100
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think to be better informed,

2440
02:59:12,602 --> 02:59:14,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe Lauren should just explain to us what's going on.

2441
02:59:14,603 --> 02:59:16,665
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to refer this.

2442
02:59:17,906 --> 02:59:31,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Vice President, so on the motion of Council Penta that this matter be forwarded to the Department of Community Development for information and updating from Lauren DiLorenzo.

2443
02:59:32,089 --> 02:59:32,749
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Vice President.

2444
02:59:32,789 --> 02:59:34,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

2445
02:59:34,230 --> 02:59:35,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be brief as well.

2446
02:59:35,091 --> 02:59:36,231
[SPEAKER_15]: I received the emails.

2447
02:59:36,571 --> 02:59:37,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I think lighting is an issue.

2448
02:59:38,012 --> 02:59:41,914
[SPEAKER_15]: I did speak to Lauren today through email, and she is going to look into the issues.

2449
02:59:41,994 --> 02:59:46,217
[SPEAKER_15]: So if she could forward the answers to the whole council, that would be appreciated.

2450
02:59:46,237 --> 02:59:52,320
[SPEAKER_20]: So on the motion as amended by Vice President Margot Kern.

2451
02:59:53,348 --> 02:59:55,170
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Knight has asked for the floor next.

2452
02:59:55,710 --> 02:59:57,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Would the clerk please read back the resolution?

2453
02:59:57,812 --> 02:59:58,272
[SPEAKER_18]: As amended.

2454
02:59:58,292 --> 03:00:03,517
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now it just says be it resolved the matter of neighboring issues of concern around Magoon Park be discussed.

2455
03:00:04,017 --> 03:00:05,178
[SPEAKER_18]: What is the question that we're asking?

2456
03:00:05,238 --> 03:00:07,540
[SPEAKER_11]: And refer it to the Office of Community Development for answers.

2457
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:08,881
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the question we're asking?

2458
03:00:09,441 --> 03:00:10,182
[SPEAKER_11]: They're neighboring issues.

2459
03:00:10,222 --> 03:00:10,522
[SPEAKER_11]: She knows.

2460
03:00:10,542 --> 03:00:11,683
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been forwarded to her.

2461
03:00:11,803 --> 03:00:12,584
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know what they are.

2462
03:00:12,624 --> 03:00:13,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what they are.

2463
03:00:13,685 --> 03:00:15,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Lighting is one of the main issues.

2464
03:00:17,972 --> 03:00:19,433
[SPEAKER_11]: cars being parked on the park.

2465
03:00:19,673 --> 03:00:22,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilman, I mean, that's my question.

2466
03:00:22,195 --> 03:00:24,797
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to pass a piece of legislation here, but we don't know what the issues are.

2467
03:00:24,817 --> 03:00:25,998
[SPEAKER_18]: But what are the issues of neighboring concern?

2468
03:00:26,018 --> 03:00:27,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell us what they are and address them for us.

2469
03:00:27,258 --> 03:00:27,979
[SPEAKER_18]: But we don't know what they are.

2470
03:00:28,299 --> 03:00:29,140
[SPEAKER_11]: She knows what they are.

2471
03:00:29,160 --> 03:00:29,560
[SPEAKER_11]: But we don't.

2472
03:00:29,580 --> 03:00:30,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

2473
03:00:30,761 --> 03:00:31,722
[SPEAKER_11]: So we want to report back.

2474
03:00:32,062 --> 03:00:39,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's an unclear resolution, clearly.

2475
03:00:39,847 --> 03:00:40,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Council Marks.

2476
03:00:41,718 --> 03:00:45,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I went to Magoon Park last night because I received the same email.

2477
03:00:45,319 --> 03:00:50,420
[SPEAKER_06]: And clearly, the lights that illuminate the park are on all night.

2478
03:00:51,321 --> 03:00:55,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know of any other park that stays on at 2, 3, 4, 5 in the morning.

2479
03:00:57,022 --> 03:00:59,663
[SPEAKER_06]: That's well, that's that's a major concern.

2480
03:01:00,963 --> 03:01:04,704
[SPEAKER_06]: The lights are very close to many of the backyards.

2481
03:01:05,344 --> 03:01:10,326
[SPEAKER_06]: The woman that contacted me, she said light illuminates her kitchen at night.

2482
03:01:12,115 --> 03:01:16,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some issues that do present, as Councilor Penta mentioned.

2483
03:01:17,419 --> 03:01:23,103
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the issues was the fact that you have a beautiful park now.

2484
03:01:23,143 --> 03:01:27,826
[SPEAKER_06]: They do need to cut the grass down there, because the grass last night was about knee high.

2485
03:01:28,286 --> 03:01:32,169
[SPEAKER_06]: But they have it fenced off, so no one can use the park at all.

2486
03:01:32,589 --> 03:01:40,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you wanted to just walk by and look at what's taking place, they did a beautiful job down there with the park, with the play structures and so forth.

2487
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:51,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little taken back why the basketball court, which is heavily used, wasn't fully done over, the rims and the backboards and so forth.

2488
03:01:51,703 --> 03:01:53,743
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, maybe that's underway.

2489
03:01:53,763 --> 03:01:54,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

2490
03:01:54,363 --> 03:01:57,564
[SPEAKER_06]: But the issue is with the lighting staying on all day, Mr. President.

2491
03:01:57,944 --> 03:02:10,547
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe if we can forward that, Counselor, to Lauren and the park board, because they're in control of the lights, to make sure they get shut off in a time fashion that's suitable to all the abutters

2492
03:02:10,849 --> 03:02:15,431
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know that's park is surrounded by homes, a very close proximity.

2493
03:02:16,031 --> 03:02:24,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, and we want to make sure that, uh, the park is great for the neighborhood, but also, uh, works well for the, uh, neighbors that have bought it.

2494
03:02:25,575 --> 03:02:26,115
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

2495
03:02:26,155 --> 03:02:26,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2496
03:02:26,515 --> 03:02:27,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks.

2497
03:02:27,596 --> 03:02:33,218
[SPEAKER_21]: So as amended by a councilor marks on that motion, all those in favor, all those opposed.

2498
03:02:33,558 --> 03:02:34,519
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, ma'am, I'm sorry.

2499
03:02:34,659 --> 03:02:35,299
[SPEAKER_21]: You wanted to speak.

2500
03:02:35,915 --> 03:02:36,255
[SPEAKER_21]: Go ahead.

2501
03:02:36,275 --> 03:02:37,096
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure.

2502
03:02:37,156 --> 03:02:38,776
[SPEAKER_27]: Debbie Sander Hayes, 29 Damon Road.

2503
03:02:39,817 --> 03:02:42,438
[SPEAKER_27]: So lights on, lights off.

2504
03:02:42,618 --> 03:02:44,439
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't really need it at 2 in the afternoon.

2505
03:02:44,459 --> 03:02:45,299
[SPEAKER_27]: We want to go play.

2506
03:02:45,579 --> 03:02:47,940
[SPEAKER_27]: So whatever the lighting issue is, I get it.

2507
03:02:47,960 --> 03:02:50,481
[SPEAKER_27]: We can just open up the gates and let the kids play.

2508
03:02:50,602 --> 03:02:52,002
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the only reason why I'm here.

2509
03:02:52,482 --> 03:02:54,223
[SPEAKER_27]: The kids are drooling to get in there.

2510
03:02:54,243 --> 03:02:55,404
[SPEAKER_27]: It is so gorgeous.

2511
03:02:57,064 --> 03:02:59,325
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think we need a ribbon cutting ceremony.

2512
03:02:59,365 --> 03:03:01,366
[SPEAKER_27]: The kids don't care about ice cream and hot dogs.

2513
03:03:01,446 --> 03:03:03,867
[SPEAKER_27]: Just let's open up the gates and let them play.

2514
03:03:04,568 --> 03:03:04,908
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2515
03:03:05,540 --> 03:03:07,301
[SPEAKER_21]: On that motion, all those in favor?

2516
03:03:07,901 --> 03:03:08,681
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

2517
03:03:08,761 --> 03:03:09,561
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion carries.

2518
03:03:10,222 --> 03:03:27,127
[SPEAKER_21]: While we're on to suspension, 15-530 offered by Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the Mayor ask the DOT and DCR to come up with an agreement to allow trucks to travel on Route 16 during the Craddock Bridge construction period.

2519
03:03:27,667 --> 03:03:28,567
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Camuso.

2520
03:03:28,907 --> 03:03:29,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2521
03:03:30,088 --> 03:03:33,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming at this point this has been talked about between the different agencies.

2522
03:03:34,877 --> 03:03:42,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this needs to be done and something in writing has to be disseminated to the state police if they approve it, as well as the Medford police.

2523
03:03:43,161 --> 03:03:55,567
[SPEAKER_09]: My concern is if they do not open up Route 16 to the smaller trucks, you're going to have these trucks going down Summer Street to evade the congestion during the traffic.

2524
03:03:55,587 --> 03:03:57,048
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be going up South Street.

2525
03:03:57,068 --> 03:03:59,949
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be going through Forest Street, Lawrence.

2526
03:03:59,969 --> 03:04:01,249
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be going everywhere.

2527
03:04:02,743 --> 03:04:05,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Street that can handle it the most is Route 16.

2528
03:04:05,424 --> 03:04:10,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we're all aware of, Route 16, you can't have any trucks on the DCR roadways.

2529
03:04:10,846 --> 03:04:18,009
[SPEAKER_09]: So during the Craddock Bridge construction, I think it just does make sense to do this to alleviate the neighborhood traffic.

2530
03:04:18,069 --> 03:04:19,330
[SPEAKER_09]: The roads are certainly bigger.

2531
03:04:19,830 --> 03:04:23,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I know in the past, the concern has been some of the trees and things of that nature years ago.

2532
03:04:25,052 --> 03:04:31,155
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just think it's going to, if we don't look into this and have something in writing,

2533
03:04:31,926 --> 03:04:39,588
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to just add more confusion to the neighborhoods, and as Mr. D'Antonio said earlier about the parking, just going to keep pushing it back, pushing it back.

2534
03:04:39,688 --> 03:04:41,368
[SPEAKER_09]: George Street, then onto Boston Ave.

2535
03:04:41,868 --> 03:04:46,250
[SPEAKER_09]: So by this simple approach, I think we can help alleviate some of the side street traffic.

2536
03:04:47,110 --> 03:04:48,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for that, Councilor.

2537
03:04:48,170 --> 03:04:48,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Caravaglio.

2538
03:04:48,990 --> 03:04:49,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2539
03:04:49,650 --> 03:04:50,190
[SPEAKER_07]: On that motion.

2540
03:04:50,711 --> 03:04:52,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I disagree with my Councilor member here.

2541
03:04:53,331 --> 03:04:54,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Route 16 is a nightmare right now.

2542
03:04:54,912 --> 03:04:55,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I live over there.

2543
03:04:56,612 --> 03:04:58,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even go down Route 16 anymore to go home.

2544
03:04:58,733 --> 03:04:59,433
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how bad it is.

2545
03:05:01,962 --> 03:05:11,370
[SPEAKER_07]: To allow trucks to go down Route 16, I mean, right now, they don't bother the small trucks, but the big trucks, they're pulling them over on a regular basis over there in their parking lot.

2546
03:05:11,750 --> 03:05:12,971
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way for these trucks to go.

2547
03:05:13,051 --> 03:05:15,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Route 16, where are they going to get off?

2548
03:05:15,833 --> 03:05:18,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they're going to be traveling all the way down our way.

2549
03:05:18,615 --> 03:05:23,199
[SPEAKER_07]: They're advertising, I mean, the signs around the highway telling them not to get off Route 16.

2550
03:05:25,301 --> 03:05:28,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, to put a truck, any more trucks,

2551
03:05:29,171 --> 03:05:30,692
[SPEAKER_07]: on that road.

2552
03:05:30,792 --> 03:05:35,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Once that ramp closes, route 16 is going to be a bigger nightmare than it already is.

2553
03:05:37,094 --> 03:05:41,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I'd rather see them go down route 16, Mr. President, than coming through Medford Square.

2554
03:05:41,476 --> 03:05:43,797
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know Councilor Marks a few years ago had a very good point.

2555
03:05:43,837 --> 03:05:45,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the trash trucks can't get through Medford Square.

2556
03:05:46,366 --> 03:05:49,787
[SPEAKER_09]: In the morning, there would be a bus and a trash truck, it would be total gridlock.

2557
03:05:50,287 --> 03:05:57,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think, I understand Councilor Caviello, he's got a very good point, but we're asking for trucks to start going down streets like where you live.

2558
03:05:57,888 --> 03:05:58,968
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where they're gonna be.

2559
03:05:58,988 --> 03:06:02,209
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not pulling small trucks, but the bigger trucks.

2560
03:06:03,209 --> 03:06:08,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, right now the state police are pulling over any truck that has a box on it.

2561
03:06:08,570 --> 03:06:15,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, anything with a box, but let's say, I'd rather have them go to Meffitt Square than go down that parkway, let's say, because the parkway,

2562
03:06:16,032 --> 03:06:18,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Come 2 o'clock, you just can't get out of that parkway anymore.

2563
03:06:18,654 --> 03:06:19,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, I understand.

2564
03:06:19,554 --> 03:06:23,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's better off than getting them down the high street and everywhere else.

2565
03:06:23,216 --> 03:06:25,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I say, I'm coming by your house every day when I go home as of now.

2566
03:06:26,338 --> 03:06:27,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

2567
03:06:27,239 --> 03:06:28,840
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I go home every day.

2568
03:06:29,180 --> 03:06:29,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2569
03:06:30,281 --> 03:06:30,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

2570
03:06:30,841 --> 03:06:31,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Counselor Knight.

2571
03:06:32,242 --> 03:06:33,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2572
03:06:33,843 --> 03:06:40,287
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have to commend Counselor Camuso for thinking out of the box and trying to address some of the traffic problems that are going to pop up with

2573
03:06:40,970 --> 03:06:42,970
[SPEAKER_18]: the Craddock Bridge reconstruction.

2574
03:06:43,631 --> 03:06:54,233
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, as we discussed last week in our budget debates about the possibility of maybe hiring a transportation planner for the city of Medford and the cost versus the benefits and what that will bring to our community.

2575
03:06:54,853 --> 03:06:56,194
[SPEAKER_18]: But I won't belabor that issue.

2576
03:06:56,254 --> 03:07:02,095
[SPEAKER_18]: I just think it's very important that this issue, as well as many other issues that are going to come up relative to Craddock Bridge, be discussed.

2577
03:07:02,535 --> 03:07:10,517
[SPEAKER_18]: And, Council President, I know you've been working very hard with members of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, as have I, to schedule a meeting for them to come down here before this council.

2578
03:07:11,037 --> 03:07:15,400
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, I believe that this would be a great issue to bring up at the tentative meeting that we have scheduled for the June 30th.

2579
03:07:15,821 --> 03:07:16,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

2580
03:07:17,122 --> 03:07:17,402
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

2581
03:07:17,742 --> 03:07:23,346
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the motion of a counselor Camuso, a roll call vote has been requested.

2582
03:07:23,366 --> 03:07:26,249
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, counselor marks.

2583
03:07:28,010 --> 03:07:32,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we seen a traffic plan regarding, uh, this bridge construction?

2584
03:07:35,336 --> 03:07:38,378
[SPEAKER_21]: We saw conceptual plans, uh, in the past.

2585
03:07:39,166 --> 03:07:42,488
[SPEAKER_21]: We're now at a full construction design is all done.

2586
03:07:43,168 --> 03:07:53,034
[SPEAKER_21]: So, uh, on the 30th of June, uh, the representative of the department of transportation will present himself, uh, to the city council.

2587
03:07:54,135 --> 03:08:07,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, and so Tuesday night, June 30th, we've asked them to come down and be ready to present themselves and be able to, uh, present to us the concerns about traffic rerouting.

2588
03:08:07,718 --> 03:08:25,946
[SPEAKER_21]: the use of temporary bridges, to address the issue of bus stops, and to talk about the mitigation issues and issues of contact for the local businesses to have a point person to get to when problems arise.

2589
03:08:27,167 --> 03:08:35,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So until I have some feedback from a traffic engineer on what's the best way to reroute this traffic and where trucks should go,

2590
03:08:38,018 --> 03:08:39,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Council's welcome to offer a suggestion.

2591
03:08:39,558 --> 03:08:44,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I just can't support it tonight until I see an overall master plan on what's going to take place.

2592
03:08:44,620 --> 03:08:48,040
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be over a two-year construction process.

2593
03:08:48,840 --> 03:08:53,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it may be four, but it's going to be several years of construction.

2594
03:08:54,062 --> 03:09:01,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we have to look at engineers and people that are much smarter in that field than we are and take their advice.

2595
03:09:01,743 --> 03:09:04,524
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I can't support this here tonight.

2596
03:09:04,824 --> 03:09:05,084
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2597
03:09:06,118 --> 03:09:09,059
[SPEAKER_21]: So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2598
03:09:13,260 --> 03:09:13,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam?

2599
03:09:14,421 --> 03:09:15,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

2600
03:09:16,942 --> 03:09:34,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Shouldn't we wait until, I think it's great that we're thinking about it beforehand and that it's been brought up by Councilor Camuso, but don't you think we should maybe wait till the 30th where we have representatives come in, we can talk through it, see if they plan on giving us a traffic impact study and how they plan on rerouting traffic.

2601
03:09:35,910 --> 03:09:37,690
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what the right answer is myself.

2602
03:09:37,750 --> 03:09:42,491
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not a traffic consultant, but there has to be a way that we're going to reroute traffic.

2603
03:09:42,571 --> 03:09:45,992
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's try to get the answers from the, you know, see what they're saying.

2604
03:09:46,012 --> 03:09:49,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, hopefully the trucks will be in Somerville and Malton and not in Medford.

2605
03:09:49,893 --> 03:09:50,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Councillor.

2606
03:09:50,773 --> 03:09:52,713
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Councillor Lungo-Kern has a great idea.

2607
03:09:53,554 --> 03:09:56,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll send this to that evening.

2608
03:09:57,474 --> 03:10:05,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, this actually presented itself from people on Harvard Street in South Medford that are concerned about the trucks that we gave them some alleviation.

2609
03:10:06,361 --> 03:10:09,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And now they're concerned that it's going to be back.

2610
03:10:09,643 --> 03:10:16,008
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I thought about that, you start thinking about Spring Street again and Riverside Ave, where the trucks have always been a problem.

2611
03:10:16,048 --> 03:10:19,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank Councilor Alango-Kern for offering that.

2612
03:10:19,330 --> 03:10:20,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a great idea.

2613
03:10:20,891 --> 03:10:22,753
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll move this paper to that meeting.

2614
03:10:23,113 --> 03:10:23,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

2615
03:10:23,513 --> 03:10:26,696
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of Council, it was to table this until that meeting.

2616
03:10:26,736 --> 03:10:32,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not to table it on the council agenda, just forward it to that meeting, forward it to the committee of the whole, because if it's a,

2617
03:10:33,269 --> 03:10:35,371
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a presentation on the floor.

2618
03:10:35,611 --> 03:10:36,512
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

2619
03:10:36,652 --> 03:10:37,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Even better.

2620
03:10:38,413 --> 03:10:38,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2621
03:10:40,274 --> 03:10:40,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

2622
03:10:40,675 --> 03:10:41,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

2623
03:10:41,275 --> 03:10:45,138
[SPEAKER_21]: Refer it to the Committee of the Whole for Craddock Bridge discussion.

2624
03:10:47,520 --> 03:10:47,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

2625
03:10:51,163 --> 03:10:51,483
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

2626
03:10:52,163 --> 03:10:52,904
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

2627
03:10:54,205 --> 03:10:54,965
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

2628
03:10:55,586 --> 03:10:58,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion passes.

2629
03:10:58,508 --> 03:10:58,528
[SPEAKER_21]: 15-5.

2630
03:10:59,409 --> 03:11:01,170
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Kenta.

2631
03:11:01,582 --> 03:11:03,323
[SPEAKER_21]: to go back to the regular order of business.

2632
03:11:03,363 --> 03:11:04,004
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

2633
03:11:04,024 --> 03:11:05,445
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

2634
03:11:05,625 --> 03:11:07,286
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion carries.

2635
03:11:07,306 --> 03:11:08,688
[SPEAKER_21]: 15-525 offered by Councilor Panza.

2636
03:11:09,188 --> 03:11:13,011
[SPEAKER_21]: Be it resolved that because the Council's ongoing requests to have Mass.

2637
03:11:13,031 --> 03:11:25,561
[SPEAKER_21]: Department of Transportation officials and MBTA officials meet at the City Council meeting to explain the timing, scheduling, and bus route changes that will become effective soon according to Mass.

2638
03:11:25,581 --> 03:11:30,945
[SPEAKER_21]: DOT public notices, a letter be sent to the Governor expressing the disappointment and frustration

2639
03:11:31,527 --> 03:11:49,696
[SPEAKER_21]: of this situation and seeks such help for having the state agency be accountable for its failure to honor the City Council requests for timely and updated information on this most important project that will present a major impact on our downtown business and traffic flow pattern.

2640
03:11:50,097 --> 03:11:52,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Penta, I'm out of breath.

2641
03:11:52,698 --> 03:11:52,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

2642
03:11:53,598 --> 03:12:00,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, this morning, midday today, I met with some state agencies and one of the agencies that was

2643
03:12:01,770 --> 03:12:03,210
[SPEAKER_11]: At issue was the Mass.

2644
03:12:03,230 --> 03:12:14,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Department of Transportation, and one of the concerns as it relates to that was not only from my concern, but other folks' concern as it relates to their response and their response time.

2645
03:12:15,053 --> 03:12:19,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, you're telling us that we have a meeting scheduled for the 30th of June.

2646
03:12:20,253 --> 03:12:28,115
[SPEAKER_11]: About a month ago, a little bit less than a month ago, signage was in Medford Square indicating that they were going to be doing some construction on the bridge.

2647
03:12:28,989 --> 03:12:32,430
[SPEAKER_11]: None of the business folks, yet, as we speak right now, have been notified.

2648
03:12:33,151 --> 03:12:37,452
[SPEAKER_11]: The chamber has not been notified as it relates to an update as to what's going on.

2649
03:12:38,052 --> 03:12:41,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the other day, coming into Saturday and Sunday, took these pictures.

2650
03:12:41,473 --> 03:12:43,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just, we can pass them around.

2651
03:12:44,014 --> 03:12:46,835
[SPEAKER_11]: As you all know, they dug up the middle of the island.

2652
03:12:47,376 --> 03:12:48,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Larry, you want to pass that over there?

2653
03:12:48,816 --> 03:12:50,016
[SPEAKER_11]: They dug up the middle of the island.

2654
03:12:50,076 --> 03:12:54,318
[SPEAKER_11]: In the middle of the island, they left it, what, an eight

2655
03:12:55,283 --> 03:12:58,524
[SPEAKER_11]: to 12-inch gully hole in the middle of the street.

2656
03:13:01,045 --> 03:13:04,286
[SPEAKER_11]: All weekend long, they didn't put any plates on there.

2657
03:13:05,327 --> 03:13:14,950
[SPEAKER_11]: And by putting no plates on there, you can ask folks who are walking across the street, one person almost, because it was dark out at nighttime, almost fell into the hole.

2658
03:13:14,970 --> 03:13:15,790
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's not the point.

2659
03:13:15,810 --> 03:13:18,851
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact of the matter is, is there a clerk of the works?

2660
03:13:19,391 --> 03:13:21,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Where is the city on this particular matter?

2661
03:13:22,072 --> 03:13:23,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's monitoring what needs to be done

2662
03:13:24,534 --> 03:13:28,036
[SPEAKER_11]: just because you put a cone, that doesn't mean that's going to resolve the subject matter.

2663
03:13:28,537 --> 03:13:36,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you look at the picture, you can see someone now trying to make a U-turn where the cones are, because they felt that's what they were able to do, that's what they thought it was supposed to be about.

2664
03:13:37,382 --> 03:13:41,544
[SPEAKER_11]: This whole thing has a history, and if you speak to OCD, they'll tell you the same thing.

2665
03:13:41,604 --> 03:13:48,408
[SPEAKER_11]: This has a history of the city not being involved on a timely, if not any kind of a basis, never mind the council.

2666
03:13:49,608 --> 03:13:50,629
[SPEAKER_11]: And this just doesn't make sense.

2667
03:13:50,709 --> 03:13:52,310
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe just yesterday morning,

2668
03:13:52,937 --> 03:13:55,299
[SPEAKER_11]: They hot topped it, and it's still not level.

2669
03:13:55,599 --> 03:13:59,222
[SPEAKER_11]: And they have 9,000 cones over there that don't even light up at nighttime.

2670
03:14:00,423 --> 03:14:02,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes you see those barrels that have the lights that work.

2671
03:14:02,724 --> 03:14:03,505
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't even have those.

2672
03:14:03,545 --> 03:14:11,431
[SPEAKER_11]: They just have cones that look like if you're a dunce in school, and you're a bad guy, and you're in trouble, you go sit in the corner and put the cone on your head.

2673
03:14:11,451 --> 03:14:13,052
[SPEAKER_11]: This is too much of a serious project.

2674
03:14:13,512 --> 03:14:16,995
[SPEAKER_11]: And the more you tell people that this is going to be almost four years, they can't believe it.

2675
03:14:17,035 --> 03:14:22,699
[SPEAKER_11]: A 121-foot bridge is going to take almost four years to get itself built.

2676
03:14:23,058 --> 03:14:28,181
[SPEAKER_11]: with the state of technology that's out there today, with the state of construction that's out there today.

2677
03:14:29,402 --> 03:14:31,143
[SPEAKER_11]: It's mind-boggling.

2678
03:14:31,644 --> 03:14:34,525
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the second aspect of this is the MBTA.

2679
03:14:35,166 --> 03:14:36,046
[SPEAKER_11]: They've never come back.

2680
03:14:36,086 --> 03:14:37,687
[SPEAKER_11]: We've asked to have them come back over here.

2681
03:14:38,208 --> 03:14:49,435
[SPEAKER_11]: The possibility of looking at putting the bus stop on Riverside Avenue, go down Riverside Avenue, change the route of River Street, have the bus go there, park there, comes back around the square,

2682
03:14:49,715 --> 03:14:51,696
[SPEAKER_11]: and then it goes through without tying up anybody.

2683
03:14:52,117 --> 03:14:55,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe no more than three to four extra minutes out of the normal route that it takes.

2684
03:14:56,200 --> 03:14:59,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about it, you're talking about the seniors that live at 99 and the folks that live at 121.

2685
03:15:00,022 --> 03:15:09,669
[SPEAKER_11]: The way they have it projected now, you're gonna have to walk all the way down the ring road and then from under the ring road, you're gonna have to walk underneath the bridge over by 101 Main Street to get the bus.

2686
03:15:10,209 --> 03:15:16,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Where now, if you follow the riverside to the river street, all they'd be doing is walking into Medford Square and picking up the bus there.

2687
03:15:17,463 --> 03:15:23,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And all you'd be doing is displacing four car spaces that you could put, where you would be putting the buses.

2688
03:15:24,166 --> 03:15:27,788
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all options and these are all possibilities that need to be discussed.

2689
03:15:28,409 --> 03:15:33,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Medford City Council is the controller of the parking of the bus stops here in the city of Medford, not the MBTA.

2690
03:15:34,432 --> 03:15:36,273
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the city of Medford, the Medford City Council.

2691
03:15:37,053 --> 03:15:46,618
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Mr. President, what I'm proposing, in concert with Councilor Camuso's resolution, that we look at, is the MBTA coming to this meeting too?

2692
03:15:49,863 --> 03:15:52,284
[SPEAKER_11]: But is the person from the MBTA going to be here?

2693
03:15:54,344 --> 03:15:54,944
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Knight.

2694
03:15:56,384 --> 03:16:01,405
[SPEAKER_18]: As I understand, the transportation reform bill that was passed several years ago, everything is under the same mass dot umbrella.

2695
03:16:01,545 --> 03:16:10,567
[SPEAKER_18]: MBTA, highway, DCR, all of the parties that are going to be having a stake in the reconstruction of the Craddock Bridge, with the exception of us.

2696
03:16:11,027 --> 03:16:11,987
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're coming to see us.

2697
03:16:12,067 --> 03:16:14,628
[SPEAKER_11]: But the last time we had this, Adam,

2698
03:16:16,931 --> 03:16:19,492
[SPEAKER_11]: The lady from the MBTA had to be, she was invited separately.

2699
03:16:19,552 --> 03:16:20,952
[SPEAKER_18]: When was the last time we had this?

2700
03:16:21,032 --> 03:16:23,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause we were saying we never had this meeting.

2701
03:16:23,393 --> 03:16:26,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I think maybe about a year and a half ago.

2702
03:16:26,513 --> 03:16:44,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would like to make sure in your invite on the 30th, um, that a representative or the person from the MBTA who would be involved here in the city of method regarding bus stops is here and to, um, so we could explore once again, changing the bus stop instead of 21 main street to river street.

2703
03:16:46,427 --> 03:16:49,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Redirecting the traffic and all those that just come around.

2704
03:16:49,608 --> 03:17:00,810
[SPEAKER_21]: The legislative liaison for the Department of Transportation will be here, and he's well-versed in the issues of exploring the MBTA.

2705
03:17:01,670 --> 03:17:07,191
[SPEAKER_21]: He'll have the overall project manager here, as well as other constituencies.

2706
03:17:07,551 --> 03:17:11,932
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think what we need to discuss is not a matter of having a discussion,

2707
03:17:12,554 --> 03:17:14,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a matter of having them know.

2708
03:17:14,175 --> 03:17:15,075
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a discussion.

2709
03:17:15,275 --> 03:17:22,499
[SPEAKER_11]: No, a matter of a discussion expressing what our ideas would be and not to have them come back six, nine months later and decide to make a decision.

2710
03:17:23,060 --> 03:17:28,823
[SPEAKER_11]: This project is already designed, drawn up, has a battle plan and they're implementing it.

2711
03:17:29,563 --> 03:17:34,486
[SPEAKER_11]: And without any support or input from this council or the taxpayers of this community.

2712
03:17:34,846 --> 03:17:38,948
[SPEAKER_11]: So all these meetings that supposedly were going to take place and be so transparent,

2713
03:17:39,213 --> 03:17:40,074
[SPEAKER_11]: just never took place.

2714
03:17:40,094 --> 03:17:42,835
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're just going ahead and building what they want to build.

2715
03:17:44,336 --> 03:17:47,118
[SPEAKER_11]: 10,000, excuse me, now it's up to 10 million, 10.1.

2716
03:17:47,859 --> 03:17:53,722
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've gone from 2.5 to 8.5 to 12.7, now down to 10.7.

2717
03:17:53,762 --> 03:17:59,866
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really don't even know what the true cost of this project is, because we've already had one, two, three, we've had five separate numbers.

2718
03:18:01,067 --> 03:18:04,289
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, it's a bridge.

2719
03:18:05,910 --> 03:18:06,931
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a mausoleum.

2720
03:18:07,597 --> 03:18:09,098
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not an historical edifice.

2721
03:18:09,178 --> 03:18:14,502
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a plain, simple bridge to make buses, cars, and traffic and trucks drive over.

2722
03:18:14,522 --> 03:18:21,007
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not the Longfellow Bridge in Boston, where you're looking at architectural scheme and design.

2723
03:18:21,507 --> 03:18:22,308
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 121 feet, Fred.

2724
03:18:22,388 --> 03:18:33,496
[SPEAKER_21]: The place of the Craddock Bridge is longer and more significant in the history of the United States of America than is the

2725
03:18:34,297 --> 03:18:35,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Longfellow Bridge.

2726
03:18:35,658 --> 03:18:36,719
[SPEAKER_21]: We're talking about a bridge.

2727
03:18:36,739 --> 03:18:40,703
[SPEAKER_21]: It's salt and pepper shakers, and it's graffiti, and it's red line.

2728
03:18:41,423 --> 03:18:43,105
[SPEAKER_11]: That may be in your opinion.

2729
03:18:43,465 --> 03:18:46,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, move to join this paper with the previous paper that was discussed.

2730
03:18:46,828 --> 03:18:48,329
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion.

2731
03:18:48,349 --> 03:18:50,551
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll put it in the Committee of the Whole for Credit Bridge Discussions.

2732
03:18:52,033 --> 03:18:52,693
[SPEAKER_11]: With the invitation.

2733
03:18:54,595 --> 03:18:55,576
[SPEAKER_21]: With the invitation.

2734
03:18:55,916 --> 03:18:56,817
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

2735
03:18:56,917 --> 03:18:57,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2736
03:18:57,698 --> 03:18:58,478
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

2737
03:18:58,799 --> 03:18:59,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion carries.

2738
03:19:01,321 --> 03:19:16,289
[SPEAKER_21]: 15-526 offered by Council of Penta be resolved that a bounty of well wishes be forwarded to the Reverend David Kilpatrick on the celebration of his 50 years as an ordained minister in the Baptist Church.

2739
03:19:16,989 --> 03:19:25,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Reverend Kilpatrick, through the years he has been a wonderful community advocate for those less fortunate and for partnering with many non-prophets

2740
03:19:26,244 --> 03:19:28,106
[SPEAKER_21]: in their helping of those less fortunate.

2741
03:19:28,546 --> 03:19:34,171
[SPEAKER_21]: Reverend Kilpatrick is the pastor of the West Medford Baptist Church, Consul Pente.

2742
03:19:34,351 --> 03:19:41,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, Reverend Kilpatrick most recently just celebrated his 50 years as a pastor up at Monfield Plaza.

2743
03:19:42,958 --> 03:19:47,942
[SPEAKER_11]: He's just personally a wonderful advocate in his religious advocation.

2744
03:19:48,843 --> 03:19:55,308
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a former director at the West Medford Community Center, and he's been an extreme supporter

2745
03:19:55,998 --> 03:19:59,479
[SPEAKER_11]: not only for those less fortunate, but for younger individuals.

2746
03:20:00,079 --> 03:20:08,560
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would be appropriate to invite him before the council to receive a citation and to let him know and let him be recognized within his community.

2747
03:20:08,580 --> 03:20:18,202
[SPEAKER_11]: 50 years is a long time to serve in a profession, and it's a profession well-respected, and he is well-respected within the Baptist community.

2748
03:20:18,442 --> 03:20:19,802
[SPEAKER_11]: So I move that paper, Mr. President.

2749
03:20:19,842 --> 03:20:21,823
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Penter, all those in favor?

2750
03:20:22,103 --> 03:20:22,183
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2751
03:20:22,483 --> 03:20:23,043
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?

2752
03:20:23,083 --> 03:20:23,683
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion carries.

2753
03:20:24,683 --> 03:20:27,125
[SPEAKER_21]: We've finished our agenda.

2754
03:20:27,245 --> 03:20:28,626
[SPEAKER_21]: Papers in the hand of the clerk.

2755
03:20:29,567 --> 03:20:31,428
[SPEAKER_21]: We have one here from Councilor Camuso.

2756
03:20:32,068 --> 03:20:37,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council goes on record in supporting Boston Pride Week.

2757
03:20:38,633 --> 03:20:50,922
[SPEAKER_21]: Furthermore, that we go on record in supporting of human rights and equal access to all denominations, including gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual, pansexual, and others.

2758
03:20:51,662 --> 03:20:53,904
[SPEAKER_21]: Furthermore, that equal access

2759
03:20:54,863 --> 03:20:58,587
[SPEAKER_21]: to all remain a priority of the city of Medford.

2760
03:20:58,647 --> 03:20:59,587
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Camuso.

2761
03:20:59,828 --> 03:21:01,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2762
03:21:02,490 --> 03:21:13,420
[SPEAKER_09]: The majority of the city council has been very supportive of the transgender issues here in our community, as well as just opening up in full and equal access across the board.

2763
03:21:14,060 --> 03:21:17,203
[SPEAKER_09]: We've made some significant strides in this community over the past few years.

2764
03:21:17,623 --> 03:21:24,946
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd just like to go on record in supporting Boston Pride Week and continuing to have an all-inclusive community for everybody.

2765
03:21:26,027 --> 03:21:29,668
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for moving to put an end to bigotry in our community, Councilor Camuso.

2766
03:21:29,848 --> 03:21:30,468
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call vote.

2767
03:21:30,989 --> 03:21:32,669
[SPEAKER_21]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso.

2768
03:21:33,990 --> 03:21:34,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?

2769
03:21:36,771 --> 03:21:38,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's Gay and Lesbian Pride Month.

2770
03:21:39,332 --> 03:21:40,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Boston happens to be this week.

2771
03:21:42,734 --> 03:21:42,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

2772
03:21:43,894 --> 03:21:44,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask.

2773
03:21:44,695 --> 03:21:45,115
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to do it?

2774
03:21:48,563 --> 03:21:50,324
[SPEAKER_09]: have our own week, Medford Pride Week.

2775
03:21:51,204 --> 03:21:56,365
[SPEAKER_21]: Further resolve that Medford establish its own Pride Week and declare it such on this.

2776
03:21:56,545 --> 03:22:00,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, I think Medford has done a significant job in this particular area.

2777
03:22:01,427 --> 03:22:06,448
[SPEAKER_09]: As I said, the majority of the city council has supported tremendous movement forward.

2778
03:22:07,508 --> 03:22:13,670
[SPEAKER_09]: The bathroom issues at the Medford public schools that were discussed here, as well as many other things over the years.

2779
03:22:13,870 --> 03:22:16,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a proven track record as a council.

2780
03:22:17,775 --> 03:22:20,436
[SPEAKER_21]: On that motion offered by Councilor Camuso, Councilor Knight.

2781
03:22:21,216 --> 03:22:26,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I'd like to say that Medford's no place for hate, and this is a good resolution.

2782
03:22:27,318 --> 03:22:34,261
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the best votes that this council's taken this past year was the ordinance that created the Fair Housing Ordinance in the Human Rights Commission.

2783
03:22:34,321 --> 03:22:40,903
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that this falls in line with the actual past practice of this council and the support that this council's shown for anti-discrimination in the community.

2784
03:22:40,963 --> 03:22:45,525
[SPEAKER_18]: So I support this resolution wholeheartedly, Mr. President, and I ask my colleagues to join me in doing the same.

2785
03:22:46,185 --> 03:22:46,505
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

2786
03:22:47,043 --> 03:22:47,644
[SPEAKER_21]: On that motion.

2787
03:22:47,944 --> 03:22:48,324
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call.

2788
03:22:48,945 --> 03:22:50,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call vote has been requested.

2789
03:22:51,266 --> 03:22:53,508
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

2790
03:22:53,588 --> 03:22:53,928
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2791
03:22:55,369 --> 03:22:55,650
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2792
03:22:56,811 --> 03:22:57,051
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2793
03:22:58,272 --> 03:23:00,373
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2794
03:23:00,794 --> 03:23:02,235
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2795
03:23:03,195 --> 03:23:03,696
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2796
03:23:03,796 --> 03:23:04,076
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2797
03:23:04,176 --> 03:23:07,739
[SPEAKER_21]: With the vote of seven in the affirmative, none negative, the motion carries.

2798
03:23:08,139 --> 03:23:08,960
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations.

2799
03:23:09,640 --> 03:23:10,401
[SPEAKER_21]: The records.

2800
03:23:11,662 --> 03:23:12,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks.

2801
03:23:14,403 --> 03:23:15,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Just if we could.

2802
03:23:15,263 --> 03:23:20,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was last week, or was it two weeks ago, with the airplane noise that myself and Councilor Longo offered.

2803
03:23:21,844 --> 03:23:33,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of that resolution was to get feedback from the current resident that the mayor appointed that sits on the Massport Advisory Board, our methods representative.

2804
03:23:33,667 --> 03:23:37,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got a response back in the packet saying that that person resigned a year ago.

2805
03:23:39,388 --> 03:23:41,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we should ask the administration

2806
03:23:42,340 --> 03:23:47,403
[SPEAKER_06]: if someone's going to be appointed to that very important body, and if so, when?

2807
03:23:49,604 --> 03:23:52,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Mr. President, just a birthday notice.

2808
03:23:54,426 --> 03:23:54,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Not for me.

2809
03:23:54,966 --> 03:24:02,450
[SPEAKER_06]: A very special person, Dolores Carroll, is celebrating a very special birthday, and I just want to wish her well.

2810
03:24:02,490 --> 03:24:07,812
[SPEAKER_06]: She tunes in on the council meetings every Tuesday, and I want to wish her well on her birthday.

2811
03:24:10,433 --> 03:24:20,655
[SPEAKER_21]: And those of us who were present at the memorial ceremonies for the Metropolitan Fire Department got a firsthand experience of the presence of airplanes in our midst.

2812
03:24:22,015 --> 03:24:23,355
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Vice President, do you have anything on that?

2813
03:24:23,375 --> 03:24:28,036
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to say, on the airplane comment, you did throw out the board member's name and number.

2814
03:24:28,096 --> 03:24:28,716
[SPEAKER_15]: I did call.

2815
03:24:28,756 --> 03:24:31,137
[SPEAKER_15]: I left a message to see if she'd come to the council.

2816
03:24:31,297 --> 03:24:31,797
[SPEAKER_15]: He or she?

2817
03:24:31,917 --> 03:24:32,817
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a woman.

2818
03:24:32,957 --> 03:24:33,497
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a woman.

2819
03:24:33,537 --> 03:24:35,237
[SPEAKER_15]: She left a message on the machine.

2820
03:24:35,277 --> 03:24:36,618
[SPEAKER_15]: No wonder why I didn't get a call back.

2821
03:24:37,598 --> 03:24:38,698
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could get another name.

2822
03:24:39,899 --> 03:24:40,759
[SPEAKER_15]: from the mayor's office.

2823
03:24:40,799 --> 03:24:43,140
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure he knows who was appointed on that board.

2824
03:24:43,460 --> 03:24:44,440
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's very important.

2825
03:24:45,500 --> 03:24:56,323
[SPEAKER_15]: I do notice the planes at my house because I live in the heights, but that next weekend, woken up out of a dead sleep at like midnight at night, I mean, it felt like there was a plane landing on my house.

2826
03:24:56,823 --> 03:25:00,184
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's the first time I was woken up at night, but it's getting worse.

2827
03:25:00,624 --> 03:25:05,045
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we need somebody here to answer the questions and figure out what's going on.

2828
03:25:09,796 --> 03:25:13,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ben Everbrook, God bless him, had passed away some time back.

2829
03:25:13,937 --> 03:25:16,197
[SPEAKER_06]: They have not replaced that position.

2830
03:25:16,778 --> 03:25:20,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a very important position when they had the bike rodeo back here.

2831
03:25:20,958 --> 03:25:28,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Everbrook was in charge of selling helmets to kids that used their bicycle in the city.

2832
03:25:28,560 --> 03:25:33,981
[SPEAKER_21]: When we discuss the executive portion of the budget, we'll have an opportunity to ask him all those questions.

2833
03:25:34,621 --> 03:25:36,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, June 20th is the bike rodeo.

2834
03:25:38,224 --> 03:25:41,625
[SPEAKER_07]: The method is doing it with the method by commission.

2835
03:25:43,046 --> 03:25:51,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Out here in the parking lot, the bikes, the hot dogs, the kids, and beverages, and the police will be out here, and the helmets, and bring your bike down, get it tuned up.

2836
03:25:53,570 --> 03:25:54,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I think 9, 10 o'clock tomorrow.

2837
03:25:54,890 --> 03:25:57,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a number, time, but 10 AM.

2838
03:25:57,651 --> 03:25:58,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy rodeo.

2839
03:25:58,752 --> 03:25:59,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring the bike down.

2840
03:25:59,512 --> 03:25:59,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2841
03:26:00,152 --> 03:26:00,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring your bike down.

2842
03:26:01,553 --> 03:26:02,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a hot dog, beverage.

2843
03:26:04,014 --> 03:26:07,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you go to the Magoon Park ceremony and go there, you get two hot dogs?

2844
03:26:14,045 --> 03:26:36,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, while we are making announcements of matters that are going on in the community, I think it's important to point out, and I'm sure Counselor Caviello will agree with me, that Friday the 26th at Anthony's in Malden is the Batter Up for Billy fundraiser for the Challenger League, which provides funding, necessary funding, for the Challenger League, which is a baseball league for individuals with developmental disabilities for which

2845
03:26:37,288 --> 03:26:40,631
[SPEAKER_18]: gone-but-not-forgotten good friend Billy Falasca was a pioneer for.

2846
03:26:41,592 --> 03:26:41,993
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

2847
03:26:42,713 --> 03:26:48,018
[SPEAKER_21]: So the records of the June 2nd, 2015 meeting were passed to Councilor Camuso.

2848
03:26:48,358 --> 03:26:50,300
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Camuso, how did you find those records?

2849
03:26:52,402 --> 03:26:54,304
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion for approval by Councilor Camuso.

2850
03:26:54,344 --> 03:26:55,044
[SPEAKER_21]: All those in favor?

2851
03:26:55,064 --> 03:26:56,005
[SPEAKER_21]: Opposed?

2852
03:26:56,045 --> 03:26:56,666
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion carries.

2853
03:26:57,026 --> 03:27:00,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion for adjournment from Councilor Michael Marx

2854
03:27:03,090 --> 03:27:06,537
[SPEAKER_21]: In memory of Governor Cellucci, all those in favor?

2855
03:27:07,279 --> 03:27:08,120
[SPEAKER_21]: All those opposed?
