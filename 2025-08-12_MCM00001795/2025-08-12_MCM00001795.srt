00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

31
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:46,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryan.

32
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:46,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

33
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:48,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter.

34
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:49,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

35
00:01:50,018 --> 00:01:50,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug.

36
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:51,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

37
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a yes as well.

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes four zero.

40
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryan, you wanna do form Bs?

41
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:03,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I already sent them off, so yes, it's all done.

42
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:07,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, do we need to do a motion for them?

43
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,433
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

44
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:10,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

45
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:16,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, next step on the agenda to receive the demolition application is 10 Irving Street.

46
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:24,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, commissioners, the paperwork was emailed around to you and I will take a motion to accept the application when someone is ready.

47
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:29,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair.

48
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:30,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

49
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:31,377
[SPEAKER_06]: For clarification,

50
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:39,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a conflict of interest with the filing attorney at 10 Irving Street.

51
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:58,121
[SPEAKER_06]: However, because I'm required for the forum of this body and no other members are present at this time, I'm going to vote for it one way or the other, but I would prefer not to make the motion.

52
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:00,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I will make the application.

53
00:03:00,742 --> 00:03:02,183
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, thank you, Doug.

54
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:03,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

55
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:06,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to accept the application.

56
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:06,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

57
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:08,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Peter.

58
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:14,373
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, motion to accept the demolition application for 10 Irving Street.

59
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:16,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And I apologize for those joining us tonight.

60
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:20,556
[SPEAKER_08]: We had two late applications that came in.

61
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:22,777
[SPEAKER_08]: So they are on our agenda.

62
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:24,578
[SPEAKER_08]: They did not make it to the public agenda.

63
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:32,462
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the interest of moving the cases along, we are going to take the applications tonight so we can get the process started for these homeowners.

64
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:39,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a motion on the table to accept the demolition application for 10 Irving Street that has been seconded.

65
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go around for roll call vote.

66
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:43,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryan.

67
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:44,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

68
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:45,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter.

69
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:46,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

70
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:47,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug.

71
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:48,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

72
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:50,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a yes as well.

73
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:53,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So the motion passes four zero.

74
00:03:57,636 --> 00:04:03,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And another late application that came in today is for 173 Arlington street.

75
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And this one is also to receive a demolition application commissioners.

76
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:10,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I will take a motion on this one when you're ready.

77
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

78
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:13,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ryan.

79
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:15,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks Doug.

80
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:16,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

81
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:21,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve the demolition application for 173 Arlington street.

82
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:22,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryan.

83
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

84
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter.

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

86
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:25,641
[SPEAKER_08]: And Doug.

87
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:26,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

88
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:28,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a yes as well.

89
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:35,066
[SPEAKER_08]: So next month we will have significance hearings for all three of these applications.

90
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:39,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and to be continued on those cases.

91
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:48,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

92
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:56,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see any other applications or anything on the agenda.

93
00:04:56,977 --> 00:05:00,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make sure we don't have anything late that came in, Rye, before we move on.

94
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:03,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, nothing late.

95
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:14,021
[SPEAKER_06]: 47 Holton Street, when we get to it down under old business, I sent around architectural plans and we discussed maybe considering lifting the delay.

96
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:19,542
[SPEAKER_06]: They've reverted back, but they're not here right this second.

97
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:24,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, I'd rather let's do that when we get to that item on the agenda.

98
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:24,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

99
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:25,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

100
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:32,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And there will be a representative from to talk about the missing Valley Parkway work will be here.

101
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't expecting you quite so soon.

102
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:35,435
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said 730.

103
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:42,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Teresa's here so we can talk about later down the road at 92 High Street and Doug can talk about the.

104
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:47,456
[SPEAKER_06]: the wayfinding and I don't know if he's got anything for zoning.

105
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:51,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was something that came in for tent 20 Revere Beach Parkway.

106
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's lots of stuff to talk about.

107
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

108
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:56,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

109
00:05:56,861 --> 00:06:01,384
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have nothing else as it pertains to demolition business besides those applications.

110
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:01,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

111
00:06:01,784 --> 00:06:04,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll, we'll go to get the whole and when we get to it.

112
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:09,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there is a series of permits in the review queue, but nothing that looked pressing.

113
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:10,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

114
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:11,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

115
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:17,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the last time we didn't have a significance hearing, or it's been, I think, years.

116
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:18,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been months.

117
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,270
[SPEAKER_03]: A long time, anyway.

118
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:29,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, I mean, we've had, I think, I feel like over the winter we had a couple of light meetings, but it's been a brisk year, so.

119
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:32,974
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, we'll pick back up next month, Doug.

120
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:34,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not worried.

121
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:35,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?

122
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, do we want to talk about Mystic Valley Parkway now or do we want to?

123
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:46,362
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I would prefer to table it until 7.30 until we're ready for it.

124
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:47,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

125
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:53,767
[SPEAKER_08]: The wayfinding project, do we want to jump to that one or we want to jump to zoning?

126
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:55,828
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Doug.

127
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:57,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not take the lead on that.

128
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,890
[SPEAKER_06]: You're attending that meeting or has that already happened?

129
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It has.

130
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:04,653
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened, I think it was Thursday last week.

131
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:15,850
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a group that are, and I think obviously probably Teresa knows about this too, but there's a group trying to improve the wayfinding in the city.

132
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're looking, they kind of reached out to people like myself and Keena Hamill and a few others.

133
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:30,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget the name of the one at the library who was there, Barbara, I think, just to kind of get our take on things.

134
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you explain what wayfinding is?

135
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Teresa, do you want to chime in here?

136
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:40,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I could, but I think you do a better job since you live in this town.

137
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:41,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Pressure is on.

138
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:59,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Wayfinding is essentially a way to publicly advertise directions and ways to get around a city to get to points of interest or particularly important buildings or whatnot.

139
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:03,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not just, Hey, go down this alleyway, take a right.

140
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:05,026
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an interesting house.

141
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:12,148
[SPEAKER_00]: It involves the planning staff so that, um, you know, maximum visibility and everything like that.

142
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:26,093
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's a souped up, but, um, you know, planning driven way of getting folks around the city that plugs into tourism, economic development, um, you know, just trying to get tourism through the city.

143
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:34,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and if I could build on that, we wanted to the big question was tell some stories about Medford that are interesting.

144
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:36,028
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot here, right?

145
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:36,249
[SPEAKER_03]: We're.

146
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:38,814
[SPEAKER_03]: approaching 400 years soon.

147
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:55,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was definitely a desire to kind of not retread kind of the historical figures that have basically been the backbone of kind of Medford's, the way Medford has told history, and to think a little bit bigger about this.

148
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:03,782
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we kicked around ideas like, what would you tell about the immigrant history of Medford to pick up on what was on,

149
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:15,985
[SPEAKER_03]: what's at the Medford Historical Society right now, a display that apparently is incredibly well put together and so far has received a lot of attention, deservedly so.

150
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:29,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was that, there's the, you know, the river, as the river runs through Medford, there was a story, you know, is there some way we could tell about the story about the river, how it evolved with Medford's evolution, how it's changed?

151
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I put on the table

152
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:43,384
[SPEAKER_03]: know, the Brooks Estate walking heritage trail that we did together about 10 years ago as one path, you know, that could lead people and tell a select story in Medford.

153
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:47,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I also put on my graphics board that had all the historical

154
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:55,308
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces of architecture in Medford, mostly buildings, mostly residential buildings, but other buildings as well.

155
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:58,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So this might be an architectural tour of Medford.

156
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're kind of just gathering concepts right now.

157
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:05,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to, I think, propose some ideas to the city.

158
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:08,436
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also the story of slavery in Medford.

159
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:11,198
[SPEAKER_03]: That was another one, obviously.

160
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a significant way to think about the city.

161
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:24,306
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the ideas that we put on the table briefly is we said, whatever we do, we'd want it to be more than just signage.

162
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:27,488
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to see if we could link it to the city's website.

163
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:31,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it be on Google Maps?

164
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you find it?

165
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:35,353
[SPEAKER_03]: The Historical Society has done some walking tours.

166
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:36,513
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on their website.

167
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:40,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's already some beginnings of this.

168
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:42,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're trying to just take it to the next step.

169
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:43,397
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my sense of it.

170
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:45,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Teresa, anything to add to that?

171
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:46,599
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

172
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:49,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're absolutely right.

173
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:57,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, we did a pilot of this, uh, about 18 to 24 months ago in the city.

174
00:10:57,081 --> 00:11:01,164
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, it may look familiar as, you know, you're starting to see it get rolled out.

175
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:05,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the pilot was just almost like some PVC corrugated plastic signage.

176
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:09,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and I have a lot of positive results from that.

177
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it certainly will help in our squares.

178
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:21,338
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to be able to direct people into our neighborhoods or residential neighborhoods to look at interesting spots, but it really will help in our square.

179
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:22,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're excited about it.

180
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,887
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, Doug, for your input on that.

181
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:32,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't known that they were really diving into more of the historical element of that.

182
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:33,312
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good to hear.

183
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:52,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think we just wanted to keep, I think Kina especially is wanting to, some of the history is kind of in dispute all these days, you know, images of historical figures that don't exist, you know, some important people in America, but there actually are no images of them.

184
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:54,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So putting them on a sign is something that is,

185
00:11:55,937 --> 00:12:09,067
[SPEAKER_03]: is challenging when you don't know what they look like, whether it's an enslaved person or even the person from the 18th century where there's actually no rendering of what they used to look like.

186
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:23,679
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to pick up, kind of expand the book, so to speak, a little bit and try to pick up some more interesting stories that tell people about Medford that even if they lived here a long time, they may not know

187
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:27,648
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these layers because it's not obvious.

188
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:34,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where the thing is to bring out some of these stories and show people that there's four centuries of history here.

189
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:35,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if we can explore it.

190
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:40,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

191
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:46,950
[SPEAKER_08]: So, is there a draft of anything that we have to go over, Doug, or we're not there yet?

192
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,211
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're just in the gathering stage right now.

193
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I think their timeline, I don't remember.

194
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's the end of the year.

195
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:59,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they have a few months to kind of put together something and put something in front of the city.

196
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:02,299
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we won't see something until the end of the year or early 2026, I imagine.

197
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:06,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Ryan.

198
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:19,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the sign that they used previously sort of the template or are we creating something new that then is going to be the citywide template for all wayfinding throughout the city?

199
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:25,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they know that yet because I don't think they figured out what they want to express yet.

200
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:33,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I constantly just harp on the idea of some level of standardization to bring all the city squares together.

201
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:45,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's nothing that's been created, look to Somerville, Cambridge, and other communities that try to bring all of their different town squares and little city squares together.

202
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:50,119
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good feedback.

203
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:50,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Ryan.

204
00:13:56,338 --> 00:13:59,040
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's it, Janice, that's my- Okay, all right, great.

205
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:00,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for that update.

206
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:01,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

207
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:04,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Zoning.

208
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:09,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you ever get comments on a draft letter?

209
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,512
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter, the mayor squashed the whole thing.

210
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:13,974
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dead in the water.

211
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:17,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it completely dead?

212
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:21,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing's gonna happen before the election at this point.

213
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:23,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

214
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I wrong, Teresa?

215
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:27,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I feel like the mayor just put the brakes on everything.

216
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know specifics.

217
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:40,937
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my understanding is that I don't I wouldn't say it's dead in the water, but I think that there's just a big massive pause button on this.

218
00:14:42,077 --> 00:14:47,939
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say while I work with the planning department, I'm not a planner there.

219
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:49,779
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a lot of eavesdropping.

220
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,080
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's my understanding is just right now, everybody

221
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:54,770
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pause button.

222
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,811
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.

223
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:57,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll wait.

224
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:58,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that.

225
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:00,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say an indefinite pause.

226
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, a pause until we know who's.

227
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:24,933
[SPEAKER_06]: uh who's coming in and then uh you know what the consultant can do to help the city sort of look back on perhaps all of the ideas and maybe this is something that we should discuss if we should suggest to the city while there's sort of this pause that we look at the areas of

228
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:31,556
[SPEAKER_06]: least impact to historic resources and encourage the, but that would have maximum impact.

229
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:50,765
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, Mystic Ave has limited number of resources, but would have a high impact for development to encourage the city to go to those places first and all of the main streets, things that we said at Salem Street, before they try to even tackle the major neighborhoods, the side streets, just

230
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:58,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think they're only going to even talk about now the commercial districts, the main streets.

231
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:06,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I think, though, even though we, we said we sent the package, obviously about Salem streets, it was.

232
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:10,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, it was late and it was basically ignored.

233
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,206
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think the content was wrong.

234
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:27,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think even though the West Bedford plan has probably will never see the light of day, I still think we want to go through that process of evaluation to think for ourselves what we think is important in that realm.

235
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then you start to see the pattern develop, right?

236
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,442
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's the importance of the historic

237
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:40,577
[SPEAKER_03]: buildings, and areas, and resources that we know about that these plans largely ignored.

238
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:43,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should, I think.

239
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:46,842
[SPEAKER_08]: But isn't a lot of this in the Medford Comprehensive Plan?

240
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:49,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

241
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:55,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the historic buildings, and we might want to look at that again.

242
00:16:55,628 --> 00:17:01,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think we need to look through what's in our surveys, but also what's proposed.

243
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:19,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's Salem Street or West Medford, there's a lot of buildings that could be torn down under this scheme that I think we want to express the quality of life and the character of neighborhood issues as clearly as we can.

244
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:28,488
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it does come back in whatever form, and it could be a different council, it could be, frankly, a different mayor at some point, not this term, obviously.

245
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:34,833
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still think we want to go on the record saying, here's what's important for this neighborhood from our perspective.

246
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:41,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And not react to their plan, but have their plan react to us to the degree possible.

247
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:48,584
[SPEAKER_08]: But should it be neighborhood by neighborhood, or should it be citywide?

248
00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:54,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we could do this for, we've already done it for one quarter, right?

249
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,662
[SPEAKER_03]: We know where the other places would be, right?

250
00:17:57,762 --> 00:18:10,850
[SPEAKER_03]: West Medford, obviously, Haines Square is part of the Salem Street, Mystic Ave, Medford Square, I would say it was still worth taking a look at, you know, like, you know, like, cause we don't know what that plan would be, but you're right.

251
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:18,214
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a little bit of bringing in some stuff about the comprehensive plan, because there is some thoughts there that I think lay the groundwork.

252
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:28,105
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, historic resources, I still think we want to kind of stick up for them in advance rather than react.

253
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:30,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And so here's another thought.

254
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:34,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we be doing this jointly with the district commission?

255
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:45,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And we put together a united front and say, you know, from your city, historical entities,

256
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:53,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Right between, but they live within the district, which are, I don't think are affected by these.

257
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:53,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

258
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:57,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think any, but their role is to create more districts.

259
00:18:57,128 --> 00:19:06,750
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's areas that we would suggest protecting, uh, versus the creation of housing or densification, then they would have a role in that.

260
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Then if that's the, if that's the intent, I would agree with both of you.

261
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:12,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's bring them in.

262
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:15,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, do they have, I mean,

263
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:21,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they have a target list of the next few districts?

264
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:25,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

265
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:26,425
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think anybody.

266
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:57,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And Teresa, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the next logical step would be to have a consultant come in, even just to take them through the process of looking at what we've inventoried, working with us to say, you know, these are the areas we think are critical, and to get the consultant to sort of put together a master plan for creation of historic districts, so that there's no, similar to how we have a survey plan, they need a local historic district creation plan.

267
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:08,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So as their guide, so then they can just reference it back, you know, just like we referenced the survey plan, we do what they're, you know, they're saying, so.

268
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:14,323
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may, through the chair.

269
00:20:15,444 --> 00:20:15,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

270
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:21,185
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been kicking around the idea of perhaps a citywide preservation plan.

271
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:22,986
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been other communities

272
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:26,313
[SPEAKER_00]: at a historical preservation plan.

273
00:20:26,373 --> 00:20:27,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Other communities have done that.

274
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:30,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Salem just implemented one, I believe, last year.

275
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:38,876
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as I was flipping through it, it just seemed like there was a lot of cohesion between all these various bits of little projects.

276
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:43,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say the Historic District Commission is newer with new members.

277
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:46,718
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just had some turnover and reestablishing ourselves.

278
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:51,359
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not currently have a list, to the best of my knowledge, of targets.

279
00:20:52,652 --> 00:21:06,600
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love the idea of taking the surveys together, perhaps, you know, some of the thoughts from the district commission and kind of folding that into a citywide preservation plan, which is a big feat.

280
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,202
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not something that's easy to whip together, but I see that as like an end goal.

281
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:21,328
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, we can certainly have joint conversations between the two commissions about how we can address things immediately, as well as work towards that long-term plan.

282
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:27,166
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great idea.

283
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you and Jen are saying the same things.

284
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:29,587
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.

285
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:33,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're taking it to a more structured.

286
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Would this be entirely volunteer?

287
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think we'd actually have some consultant support to help us do this, to make this happen?

288
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:50,315
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there is a lot of, I think there's an opportunity to bring in consultant works on this.

289
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said,

290
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:56,082
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I'm thinking of in Salem was, I believe, funded by CPA.

291
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:00,867
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some funding there to bring in a professional consultant to help put their plan together.

292
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:09,555
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of been, again, something in the back of my mind on the back burner, but it sounds like maybe it's time to pull it to a front burner.

293
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:14,941
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can certainly look into that and bring it back to this board as the

294
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:21,998
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the record, Teresa Dupont, City of Medford staff, I also staff support the historic district commission.

295
00:22:22,738 --> 00:22:27,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to clarify that for, I have a lot of friends on this board, you know, but it's fun to clarify that.

296
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,461
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it would be good.

297
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:30,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course.

298
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:32,642
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be a good idea.

299
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:40,325
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having a district commission meeting this Thursday, and I will add to it as an agenda item to have a, just to bring that, this concept up there.

300
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:45,267
[SPEAKER_00]: And then perhaps we can have a joint meeting together with the two commissions and kind of iron all

301
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:53,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Our concerns our goals, you know, as we're looking towards modernization and zoning, we definitely want to have a plan.

302
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:59,892
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like what you said, Doug, you have it react to our plan rather than react to theirs.

303
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:02,115
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very much on board with that.

304
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:05,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think we should invite Teresa to all our meetings because she brings money.

305
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:09,349
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's what's great.

306
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:13,150
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring the opportunity for money, not actual cash.

307
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:13,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I give you that.

308
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I stand corrected for the moment.

309
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:17,711
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

310
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:22,892
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will, like I said, I will add that to our agenda item as an agenda item for this week.

311
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:25,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that everybody there, they're all

312
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:27,263
[SPEAKER_00]: historically minded folks as well.

313
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:29,904
[SPEAKER_00]: So I foresee that being an agreeable thing.

314
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,284
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will.

315
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:34,546
[SPEAKER_08]: So then, Doug, what should our next step be?

316
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:47,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Should it be to like sketch out an outline either, you know, by neighborhood or some kind of off the top historic?

317
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:50,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

318
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:51,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know how to start this.

319
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:52,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean,

320
00:23:53,687 --> 00:24:00,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I would like to see some sample plans, maybe, Teresa, to help us think about the structure, think about deliverable.

321
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:10,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Salem is different from Medford, obviously, but size-wise and historic resources-wise, it's actually not bad as a template.

322
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:14,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we saw that, maybe a Somerville one, if there's one.

323
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:16,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a lot of data.

324
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:18,412
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 15 years of survey.

325
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:20,072
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a ton of stuff.

326
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:27,456
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked a lot about potential historic districts.

327
00:24:27,496 --> 00:24:34,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that comes up a lot on our meetings and our Form Bs, but not all of them are created equal, obviously.

328
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:41,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them seem like they're more viable and more real and have more potential for getting over the finish line than others do.

329
00:24:42,387 --> 00:24:49,473
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also the single home districts that we talked about for many meetings for many years, which is a great way to think about saving resources we care about.

330
00:24:52,253 --> 00:24:57,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we add that to a kind of neighborhood analysis from a couple of key places.

331
00:24:57,117 --> 00:25:07,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have, I think, the framework for the beginnings of a plan that we could then write a grant to and look at a consultant for.

332
00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:10,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talk about the current round, right, Teresa?

333
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,727
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a round that's just starting soon.

334
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:16,571
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately for this round, no.

335
00:25:19,173 --> 00:25:20,474
[SPEAKER_00]: But this could qualify.

336
00:25:21,183 --> 00:25:28,265
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for our small grants, you know, I can, I can look, um, look to seeing what we can implement for fiscal 26 here.

337
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:32,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this because you received the eligibility letters?

338
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:32,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

339
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:33,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

340
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:35,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were due at the end of July.

341
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:41,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we can, uh, I'll, I'll look to see what options we can do there.

342
00:25:41,028 --> 00:25:42,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

343
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:42,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

344
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:46,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

345
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:54,673
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Ryan, we should keep this on the agenda for the next few agendas so we don't forget.

346
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:55,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

347
00:25:56,774 --> 00:26:05,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's why I somewhat revised the template for next meeting.

348
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

349
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, do we want to circle back to Mystic Valley Parkway now that it's 7.30?

350
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:16,284
[SPEAKER_06]: That depends on if the consultant is here.

351
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:22,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see David yet.

352
00:26:22,987 --> 00:26:23,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here.

353
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:24,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you are there.

354
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:24,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you are.

355
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:25,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

356
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:26,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

357
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,670
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, David?

358
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:30,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

359
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:36,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me on and having mutual interest in your resource there.

360
00:26:37,574 --> 00:26:38,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's great.

361
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:46,239
[SPEAKER_02]: We were approached a few years ago to do an assessment by a team

362
00:26:47,502 --> 00:27:16,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Halverson tie and bond design, and, uh, our company, um, Commonwealth cultural to highlight the assets and resources of both above and below the ground where it could impact the design of improved walkways, uh, overlook areas for sitting benches, improved access,

363
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:22,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And we came up with, it's quite a long report.

364
00:27:22,102 --> 00:27:25,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to try to bounce around the outer parts.

365
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:29,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want me to zoom in, just holler out and I can kind of zoom in.

366
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:38,796
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically the results of that report gave us this map, which is probably really hard to read.

367
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:40,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I can maybe share my screen.

368
00:27:40,697 --> 00:27:41,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see here.

369
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:48,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I can, yeah, you don't have the ability to share your screen, but I can, I can give it to you.

370
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:50,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look at page 85.

371
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:53,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think I gave you guys the full report.

372
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:00,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you have the, if you have the report, send it over and I'll upload it to the Google drive right now.

373
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:02,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

374
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:04,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, David, what's your last name?

375
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:05,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

376
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:09,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the PNF, but it only included like the first five pages or so.

377
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:12,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

378
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:19,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the information was not for public sharing because of the pre-contact, but that wouldn't include you guys.

379
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:28,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I would hope you'd have full access to all of the pre-contact sites and historic archeology sites.

380
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:29,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

381
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:31,513
[SPEAKER_06]: No, nothing like that.

382
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:35,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

383
00:28:40,758 --> 00:28:42,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, give me a moment and I'll try to send you a link.

384
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:45,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see if you can pull it up.

385
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:46,490
Yep.

386
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:50,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, David, can you tell me your last name?

387
00:28:51,174 --> 00:28:54,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, G-U-T-B-R-O-D.

388
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:57,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you just say it to me, please?

389
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, David Gutrud.

390
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:01,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

391
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:10,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And if somebody wants to give me their email, I will type it in the sharing.

392
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:16,274
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a historical commission at medford-ma.gov.

393
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:21,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Historical with an L, commission, all one word.

394
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

395
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:23,957
[SPEAKER_06]: At medford-ma.gov.

396
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:29,179
[SPEAKER_02]: At Medford- I put it in the chat.

397
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:30,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I put it in the chat.

398
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it in the chat.

399
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:35,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

400
00:29:39,302 --> 00:29:42,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say Medford dash or dot?

401
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:45,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, dash.

402
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:48,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Dash M-A dot gov.

403
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:49,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot gov.

404
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:51,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

405
00:30:22,678 --> 00:30:24,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, did you get that?

406
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:27,699
[SPEAKER_06]: One minute to come through.

407
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:43,042
[SPEAKER_08]: You should also be able to share your screen now if you'd like.

408
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

409
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:50,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that might be easier because I can bounce around a little bit.

410
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:53,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

411
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Entire screen, share.

412
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,253
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

413
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:02,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a little visual for you?

414
00:31:05,276 --> 00:31:05,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, great.

415
00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:07,438
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

416
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:21,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, a report, I don't know if you're familiar with culture resource layout reports, but it basically goes over the impact area and then takes MHC

417
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:31,832
[SPEAKER_02]: data, uh, together with the field review and comes up with an assessment of where sensitivity both above and below the ground.

418
00:31:32,212 --> 00:31:42,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would include historic assets as well as potential native American resources, which are known to exist and also could exist.

419
00:31:44,138 --> 00:31:52,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, if you look at this graphic here and most of the graphics have the Winchester portion, cause this project is actually

420
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:56,712
[SPEAKER_02]: titled the Mystic Lakes segment.

421
00:31:57,772 --> 00:32:01,513
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a West Medford segment that is in earlier stages.

422
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So it hasn't gotten to the point of getting a permit.

423
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:15,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It only has an assessment and some early design path widening conversations and benches and things like that.

424
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:19,097
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Mystic Lakes portion has both Winchester

425
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:24,455
[SPEAKER_02]: and Medford, so every map would have the northern segment as well.

426
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:39,840
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess to keep it closer to home here, the blue boxes are where known historic archaeology sites are.

427
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:47,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you trace this, you can see it lines up with the Middlesex Canal mostly, that section there.

428
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:55,788
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a pre-contact element, which I hope they'll be able to bounce to here.

429
00:32:55,928 --> 00:32:58,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, David, this is being recorded.

430
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,630
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a public meeting.

431
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you want to put anything sensitive on the screen.

432
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:02,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I think not.

433
00:33:03,752 --> 00:33:04,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

434
00:33:04,812 --> 00:33:05,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

435
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:09,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not divulging great amounts of information.

436
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,135
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually pretty large boxes.

437
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:19,919
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you can imagine, since the Mystic Lakes were glacial in origination, they have

438
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:38,937
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of potential for areas that weren't disturbed to have Native American artifacts, potential site habitation along the eastern border where the Mystic Valley Parkway was designed.

439
00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:45,021
[SPEAKER_02]: So our work is to put all that together so

440
00:33:46,512 --> 00:34:00,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the impact overlaying the resources known, and then the resources that have potential to be recovered or impacted, therefore, can we avoid them?

441
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:12,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So we designed a testing strategy based on that, that the MHC

442
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:15,666
[SPEAKER_02]: comments on and then adjusts.

443
00:34:16,446 --> 00:34:25,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we go back and give them a final permit application, which was received on, I think it was July 15th.

444
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:31,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have certain amount of time to perform.

445
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:43,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we, we go 50 by 50 centimeter test pits down to either, uh, at the most,

446
00:34:44,375 --> 00:35:13,790
[SPEAKER_02]: meter but even that is pretty deep it's generally 50 to 70 centimeters and obviously we're encountering a lot of fill soils because of the Olmstead redesigned parkway and landscaped area but areas did have and do have Native American sites known and we've

447
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,246
[SPEAKER_02]: confirm that in the field.

448
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:19,487
[SPEAKER_02]: We have discovered two new ones.

449
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:27,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And ironically, one of them to, I guess my surprise was right where the canal crosses.

450
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:40,056
[SPEAKER_02]: So because it was semi preserved, the towpath, the dirt was not moved as much and there is intact soil there.

451
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:42,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of exciting.

452
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:44,338
[SPEAKER_02]: That one might just be a fine spot.

453
00:35:46,081 --> 00:36:00,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these, I don't know if you're familiar with the Charlestown Dam 1862 to 65.

454
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:12,456
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some portions of that which were kind of intriguing, like this little tunnel entrance on the south side of the lower lake.

455
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:15,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So the upper part of the lower lake

456
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:23,874
[SPEAKER_02]: built right around the Civil War period, has these bars on it, which I was sort of fascinated seeing the construction of that.

457
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:43,643
[SPEAKER_02]: So our strategy is really to do these intervals, come back with, there's a potential ice house, which we found historic mapping of, but nothing on the ground yet.

458
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, an interesting story.

459
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:56,651
[SPEAKER_02]: A gentleman who worked for DCR for many years, I'm not sure if he's still employed, came up to me at 7 a.m.

460
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:02,656
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Michael James, and then he had a third name.

461
00:37:04,317 --> 00:37:13,425
[SPEAKER_02]: He, about 35 years ago, had pulled from the water an ice wedge, ice chisel, about four feet high.

462
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was telling me about it.

463
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:22,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was all excited because I have this map that has a ice house on it, but there's no remains of it.

464
00:37:22,872 --> 00:37:43,017
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no record of it historically beyond this map, except in your town records in 1894 and 1895, there's talk about the large income from corn pond and fresh pond supplying the,

465
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:53,021
[SPEAKER_02]: the Ice King, which was the name of Tudor, who was in charge of this massive world market for supplying ice.

466
00:37:54,302 --> 00:38:07,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And he mentions, or not him, but the Medford town documents mention that they would be interested in pursuing mystic lakes as a potential

467
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:11,663
[SPEAKER_02]: income producing ice house.

468
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:16,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have these pieces to the puzzle, but I don't have it all put together yet.

469
00:38:18,748 --> 00:38:26,093
[SPEAKER_02]: But he comes out to me and he says that he pulled this from the lake in 1990 and he stored it in the Shannon Beach shed.

470
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:37,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I was all excited, we went over there, it's very dark and there's no light in the shed and we're trying to find it and he's going behind some tools and he gives up, he says it's not there.

471
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:40,873
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my heart sunk, I was like, oh, darn.

472
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's keep looking, because it's 7 a.m.

473
00:38:44,275 --> 00:39:05,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, behind one of these lockers that the lifeguards put their equipment in, I got my hand back there, and this metal, four-foot-high chisel, encrusted, rusted chisel, and apparently it has like a leather, hardened leather cracking.

474
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,673
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even tell it's leather.

475
00:39:07,403 --> 00:39:10,326
[SPEAKER_02]: which would have saved your hands from the work.

476
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:14,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was there.

477
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:17,592
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are going to put that into our collection.

478
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:27,160
[SPEAKER_02]: The collection eventually is technically owned by the DCR, but it will go to the Mass Archaeological Society, the Robbins Museum.

479
00:39:28,621 --> 00:39:34,206
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular item, I don't think they're eager to, it's pretty big and it's not in a box.

480
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:50,755
[SPEAKER_02]: We were thinking of, because this was found on the Winchester side of approaching the LOCK, L-O-C-K-E museum, they have a ice house on that property actually.

481
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:58,817
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm getting ahead of myself, that's sort of a DCR answer and we're gonna propose that as a potential but,

482
00:40:00,173 --> 00:40:14,897
[SPEAKER_08]: one of the yeah like if we could circle back to what you need from us anytime interrupt yeah like what what how can we help you so there's a you have filed i'm sorry to interrupt you go ahead

483
00:40:15,295 --> 00:40:20,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I was just going to say, Jen, there's a project notification filed for section 106 review.

484
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,862
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically we get to comment on the project.

485
00:40:22,902 --> 00:40:34,431
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was curious as to just quickly, like what the project was, what they were doing and, um, and how we could be of service commenting on it, you know, providing you guys with any direction.

486
00:40:37,054 --> 00:40:37,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

487
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:42,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this, by the way, did you get that link?

488
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:45,652
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't see it come through.

489
00:40:48,974 --> 00:40:53,498
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty large file, so it should have come through.

490
00:40:53,558 --> 00:41:05,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you send it, Ryan, if we could just make sure we get that, and then we can circulate it to the commissioners, and then we can make comments and get those back to you for your project.

491
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:05,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

492
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:07,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be great.

493
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:07,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

494
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:08,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

495
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,552
[SPEAKER_02]: It's divided up into basically the earliest

496
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:39,270
[SPEAKER_02]: assessment and then the permit application which gets into quite a lot of detail and then the obviously a lot of photos and then the end of it is the design which is only in a working phase of path alignments conceptual improvements and that's where

497
00:41:40,412 --> 00:41:42,754
[SPEAKER_02]: we sort of have our guidelines.

498
00:41:42,794 --> 00:42:03,493
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't propose to the MHC to go test on the East side of the parkway, even though it would be fascinating because of the tow path and, you know, certain parts of the canal may be still intact, but we're, we're sort of tied to where only improvements are being discussed.

499
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:13,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just sent you an email, so if you just reply to that with the link, then you should be able to get it to us and we'll send it around.

500
00:42:13,502 --> 00:42:15,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

501
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

502
00:42:16,543 --> 00:42:16,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

503
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:20,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for coming, and we look forward to commenting on the project.

504
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:21,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

505
00:42:22,527 --> 00:42:23,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for having me.

506
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:24,308
[SPEAKER_08]: You're so welcome.

507
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Rye, you want to update us on the database?

508
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:30,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

509
00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:30,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

510
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, David, you might want to stop your screen share.

511
00:42:36,997 --> 00:42:37,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

512
00:42:37,717 --> 00:42:38,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

513
00:42:38,178 --> 00:42:39,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.

514
00:42:39,218 --> 00:42:51,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I talked with former Commissioner Jess Farrell, who is sort of a IT tech consultant right now, and she told me that

515
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:55,009
[SPEAKER_06]: that we could do a database.

516
00:42:55,229 --> 00:43:08,075
[SPEAKER_06]: We're using the term database, but what she actually sort of wanted to direct us to is like a site wiki that would be able to extract all the information on the MHC inventory forms and make it searchable.

517
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:12,757
[SPEAKER_06]: So MACRIS has a database already, so there's

518
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:15,560
[SPEAKER_06]: no reason for us to recreate the wheel there.

519
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:27,252
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're looking to do is to take all of the inventory forms, make them accessible without going to Macros, but then also be able to make all of that information OCR readable so that then

520
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:43,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Sites like Google and other search engines can then extract that information and have it be referenced so that somebody like, say, David, if he was doing work, he might be able to find references to a specific architect or whatnot in Bedford.

521
00:43:44,993 --> 00:44:11,381
[SPEAKER_06]: she's going to sort of do a test area on the hillside district to sort of see what it would be like in terms of creating a wiki for that small area to get a sense of what it would cost to run us a bigger project but she's intrigued by it she seems to think that it's it's a wiki is much less than an actual database because it doesn't require so much data entry it's just making the data that's already existing

522
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:38,907
[SPEAKER_06]: accessible that's all so uh we'll talk to um we'll talk idea it'll be up to somebody else to take on that idea in that project and make it uh fully functional and accessible because it will not be me that leads that charge so i have i have tapped out on projects so i'm just sort of getting it off the ground and then somebody else can take it from there

523
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:42,726
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

524
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:43,287
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I got.

525
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:44,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

526
00:44:44,368 --> 00:44:44,869
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

527
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:49,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it sounds like there's a good baseline there to potentially start with.

528
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:50,195
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes.

529
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:50,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

530
00:44:50,675 --> 00:44:50,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

531
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:51,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

532
00:44:51,797 --> 00:44:52,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

533
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:54,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

534
00:44:55,341 --> 00:44:59,045
[SPEAKER_08]: We have here 10 dash 20 Revere Beach Parkway discussion and comment.

535
00:45:01,727 --> 00:45:04,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so two things.

536
00:45:04,728 --> 00:45:13,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So both of the buildings that are on that site, Cappies and Monroe Muffler, do we want to have MHC inventory forms for them because they're slated for demolishing?

537
00:45:14,553 --> 00:45:16,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Cappies is kind of an interesting building.

538
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm less inclined to vote Monroe.

539
00:45:17,734 --> 00:45:18,434
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a simple

540
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:20,835
[SPEAKER_06]: concrete block structure.

541
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:35,299
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Cappies building in its day is one of the last remnants of the late deco, early 1960s period in Medford that Wellington was once known for.

542
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:38,560
[SPEAKER_06]: There were so many commercial buildings in that area that are now gone.

543
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:46,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to see it documented before demolition so that at least we can have some information about it.

544
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:50,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, it actually may actually even be covered under our demo review.

545
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:55,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So when that time comes, we can look at it.

546
00:45:55,568 --> 00:45:56,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I would agree with that.

547
00:45:56,409 --> 00:46:05,318
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a building that I think almost everyone who grew up here knows about and has probably entered at one time in their life.

548
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:12,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a building that people just take for granted, but looking at it closely, I think it might have an interesting story to tell.

549
00:46:12,846 --> 00:46:13,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree.

550
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:17,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting a Form B for that building, knowing it's coming down, is a good move.

551
00:46:20,157 --> 00:46:21,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

552
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:28,761
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we've been invited to, like all the other municipal boards, to comment on the proposal for 10 to 20 Revere Beach Parkway.

553
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:35,724
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two nice-ish looking residential high-rises similar to Wellington across the street.

554
00:46:35,884 --> 00:46:41,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I'm inclined to maybe take a look at it, but I didn't have any comments.

555
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:44,088
[SPEAKER_06]: But Doug, you and Peter might

556
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:47,469
[SPEAKER_03]: How much time do we have before we need that letter in?

557
00:46:47,489 --> 00:46:50,170
[SPEAKER_06]: If they do, yes, sent it out yesterday.

558
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,091
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me see what we should have 30 days.

559
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:52,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

560
00:46:55,432 --> 00:46:56,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a look at it.

561
00:46:56,272 --> 00:47:03,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Peter, if you want to take it, just maybe we can talk offline and we can just see if we, if we want to say anything you want me, I have the elevations up here.

562
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:04,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to look?

563
00:47:05,936 --> 00:47:06,136
Sure.

564
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:10,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it says the schedule to be heard at September 17th community development meeting.

565
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:12,919
[SPEAKER_06]: So please submit your written comments by September 5th.

566
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just before next meeting.

567
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:17,787
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, we have about 30 days.

568
00:47:20,868 --> 00:47:22,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where my screen share is now.

569
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:24,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a new, I guess I got an update.

570
00:47:26,672 --> 00:47:30,494
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be right in the middle of the... It says share, but... Yeah.

571
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:31,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there it is.

572
00:47:31,795 --> 00:47:32,175
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

573
00:47:32,315 --> 00:47:32,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

574
00:47:33,776 --> 00:47:34,236
[SPEAKER_04]: You see it?

575
00:47:34,856 --> 00:47:35,037
Yep.

576
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:38,238
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the elevations.

577
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:41,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think there's a rendering in here.

578
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,162
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not keeping anything of Cappy's?

579
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:46,809
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

580
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:49,210
[SPEAKER_04]: They're keeping a building in the corner, I think.

581
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:53,053
[SPEAKER_04]: They're keeping some little thing in here.

582
00:47:53,093 --> 00:47:55,134
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the tattoo parlor.

583
00:47:55,394 --> 00:47:56,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they don't own that.

584
00:47:57,315 --> 00:47:58,776
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a site plan there somewhere.

585
00:47:58,796 --> 00:48:02,518
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a site plan and there is, I think there's a 3D.

586
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:06,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was like a 3D rendering that showed like.

587
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I saw it somewhere, but now I can't find it.

588
00:48:12,486 --> 00:48:15,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that's a tattoo parlor right there.

589
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:20,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the clubhouse for the for the.

590
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,531
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be.

591
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to look kind of odd, I think.

592
00:48:27,093 --> 00:48:31,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they could just give them a new tattoo parlor inside the building or something.

593
00:48:32,016 --> 00:48:35,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, they, they, so I, I see the game plan, right?

594
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:42,444
[SPEAKER_06]: So the game plan is they'll let them build this up and then they'll complain about lack of sunlight and everything else.

595
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:47,687
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll take a hit and then they'll sell that building and then it will be demolished and either become more parking or more building.

596
00:48:48,288 --> 00:48:54,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I, or, or ultimately they'll complain enough that it'll become a part of this project eventually.

597
00:48:55,173 --> 00:48:55,353
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

598
00:48:56,772 --> 00:48:57,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you get the idea.

599
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:07,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't find that rendering, but if I find it, I can get back there.

600
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it doesn't look too bad of a building.

601
00:49:11,062 --> 00:49:17,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's the right spot for residential with that close to the T. It makes sense.

602
00:49:18,441 --> 00:49:31,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's the area that we're trying to encourage development areas that are underutilized like that in Wellington Circle and the Wellington Station before they have it.

603
00:49:32,093 --> 00:49:44,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Just if people want to look at the rendering, it's on page 14 of the formal application paperwork, which is attachment,

604
00:49:46,362 --> 00:49:47,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like their cover letter.

605
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:49,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It's down at the very bottom.

606
00:49:51,465 --> 00:49:52,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Appendices.

607
00:49:52,486 --> 00:49:54,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So page 14 are the appendices.

608
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:01,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we'll send comments in for that.

609
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:02,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

610
00:50:02,512 --> 00:50:04,594
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what about 92 High Street?

611
00:50:05,995 --> 00:50:07,916
[SPEAKER_06]: They're proposing some preservation work.

612
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:14,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Teresa, that's your... Okay, I got the rendering now, finally.

613
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to see it?

614
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, pull it up real quick.

615
00:50:17,592 --> 00:50:25,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

616
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:28,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, with the ghost building in the front.

617
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:45,870
[SPEAKER_06]: They're required to, the Mystic Valley Parkway, and I think the other side street, which I think is Middlesex Ave, have sizable street setbacks, so they're pretty far off the street, so they'll have some nice green space.

618
00:50:47,051 --> 00:50:48,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a future pocket park.

619
00:50:49,272 --> 00:50:50,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

620
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Building formerly known as Tattoo Parlor.

621
00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:06,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, 92 High Street.

622
00:51:08,492 --> 00:51:10,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, yes, so again, Teresa DuPont.

623
00:51:11,054 --> 00:51:14,296
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an addition to staff support to the Historic District Commission.

624
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:17,358
[SPEAKER_00]: My day job is I'm the Community Preservation Act Manager for the city.

625
00:51:17,378 --> 00:51:18,378
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a grant position.

626
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:30,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here just to kind of lightly introduce that 92 High Street, which is the Medford Armory building, will be going through some exterior restoration work, some emergency restoration work.

627
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:32,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Their facade is,

628
00:51:33,521 --> 00:51:36,103
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, everybody should be familiar with it.

629
00:51:36,123 --> 00:51:39,565
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big, very prominent building.

630
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:46,689
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Light Guard Armory, but it was built, I believe, late 1900s.

631
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:53,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I just wanted to get that date right, I apologize.

632
00:51:53,492 --> 00:52:03,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, but regardless, it's well over 130 years old at this point and is in need of some restoration work to its facade.

633
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,312
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all cut granite slabs that are just now starting to fail.

634
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:19,819
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had some water inundation in the building, and so I just wanted to bring to your attention that that building is getting some emergency restoration work that we probably will start seeing in the next few weeks here.

635
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:29,784
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could add on to that, we had a very robust few meetings with some of the representatives from this building.

636
00:52:30,985 --> 00:52:31,245
[SPEAKER_03]: It is 1891.

637
00:52:33,623 --> 00:52:37,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I just looked up the date, I happen to have it nearby on my handy dandy poster.

638
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:47,494
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things that made this a little different than most of them is this is a privately owned building, obviously, it's a bunch of condo owners.

639
00:52:49,696 --> 00:53:02,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have millions of dollars of need, but we wanted to kickstart the process, but we're not gonna be that bank for them because we have, obviously the CPC has,

640
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:12,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Many, many needs, many of them non-profits, many of them think of Royal House and a lot of buildings in Manfred, historic churches, et cetera, that qualify.

641
00:53:14,301 --> 00:53:16,443
[SPEAKER_03]: But we thought it was important to get

642
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:38,707
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a public access component of this project that they committed to that made it, I think, more attractive, which is opening up that building, I think, a couple of times a year, I came with Teresa, to the public so that people can get in there and have a reason to go there because they actually have, obviously, an amazing history to tell.

643
00:53:38,747 --> 00:53:42,531
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have some nice spaces there that the public should see.

644
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,553
[SPEAKER_03]: And that made it very attractive.

645
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:46,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

646
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a functioning elevator that I believe was also put in in 1891.

647
00:53:51,683 --> 00:53:52,944
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very cool.

648
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:54,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Open air elevator.

649
00:53:54,324 --> 00:54:03,490
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the basement there used to be flooded back whenever the Mystic River was titled, they would flood it and then launch the boats out onto the river.

650
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:08,253
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very cool, very unique building that, you know, they take pride of ownership in.

651
00:54:09,174 --> 00:54:13,997
[SPEAKER_00]: They've definitely kept up on the inside and now it's just time for the outside to get some love.

652
00:54:15,992 --> 00:54:18,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, can I just hop in and clarify?

653
00:54:21,578 --> 00:54:22,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Apologies for jumping.

654
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea where the 1891 or 92 date came from.

655
00:54:26,823 --> 00:54:29,345
[SPEAKER_06]: The date of this building is 1900 on the dot.

656
00:54:29,925 --> 00:54:32,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's 1900 to 1902 is the date of construction.

657
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:38,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I worked on the building for four and a half years, but also Bacchus has it, has the correct date.

658
00:54:38,913 --> 00:54:45,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where the wiki information came from that has that date, but the National Register has it right.

659
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:46,119
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 1900 to 1902.

660
00:54:48,103 --> 00:54:54,523
[SPEAKER_03]: You check the site register as well, because I think there was a link on the city's, there might be a few other dates floating around there.

661
00:54:54,975 --> 00:55:04,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Department of Public Safety records, which are the date that they reviewed the construction, they have the physical construction plans.

662
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:11,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the dates that usually when they submit them, they're submitting for a building permit and application to Occupy.

663
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:13,362
[SPEAKER_06]: And the date of that is July 1900.

664
00:55:14,023 --> 00:55:14,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the construction

665
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:24,254
[SPEAKER_06]: dates according to John are two years following that.

666
00:55:24,895 --> 00:55:30,960
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and it's a Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge, which is the successor firm to H.H.

667
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Richardson.

668
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a really, it's a really important building for Medford.

669
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:36,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

670
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we got two Therese's here.

671
00:55:40,668 --> 00:55:41,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we did.

672
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:42,850
[SPEAKER_03]: My Zoom is haunted.

673
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:49,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for clarifying, Ryan.

674
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for the wrong date.

675
00:55:50,483 --> 00:55:54,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where I got it, but it's, it's so the right, it was finished in 1902.

676
00:55:54,365 --> 00:55:55,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

677
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:56,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

678
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:56,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

679
00:55:56,687 --> 00:56:04,712
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the, the plaque that's on the inside and it's, um, it's, uh, all sorts of, um, all sorts of dates.

680
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:07,094
[SPEAKER_06]: The date that Macross has it is 90 high street.

681
00:56:07,174 --> 00:56:10,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the actual address today is 92 high street.

682
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:13,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, at least that's the address that we always used.

683
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, um,

684
00:56:17,872 --> 00:56:26,158
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't know where that 1892 date came from, but the modern form has it at least, so.

685
00:56:35,284 --> 00:56:36,165
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, good.

686
00:56:38,006 --> 00:56:40,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any other new business before we move on to old business?

687
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:44,771
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

688
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:50,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we have any updates on our vacant seats.

689
00:56:50,852 --> 00:56:57,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I reached out to one of the HTC potential candidates who didn't get chosen for the HTC.

690
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:58,533
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

691
00:56:58,553 --> 00:57:03,194
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a Medford, Somerville school teacher who lives in Medford, very interested in local history.

692
00:57:04,614 --> 00:57:10,355
[SPEAKER_06]: He lives in South Medford in the district that they proposed.

693
00:57:11,175 --> 00:57:15,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But if he's interested in historic district, I'm hoping he's interested in commission so we can have a full seat.

694
00:57:16,844 --> 00:57:17,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

695
00:57:20,026 --> 00:57:23,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, and I'll try to do some posts around that too.

696
00:57:26,871 --> 00:57:28,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Try to recruit your friends, people.

697
00:57:29,052 --> 00:57:31,854
[SPEAKER_06]: All your friends were a lot of fun.

698
00:57:32,294 --> 00:57:32,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

699
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Any update on the preservation ordinance, Ry?

700
00:57:38,778 --> 00:57:40,199
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we were going to sit tight on that.

701
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

702
00:57:41,721 --> 00:57:46,762
[SPEAKER_06]: based on our last discussion to see how many buildings come in and see how administration goes.

703
00:57:46,882 --> 00:57:52,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, we'll look at Arlington Street, that's a pre-1900 building.

704
00:57:53,384 --> 00:57:56,484
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll look at Irving Street, also a pre-1900 building.

705
00:57:57,825 --> 00:58:01,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Pinker Street is 20th century, but I don't know what the deal with that will be, so.

706
00:58:02,426 --> 00:58:06,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

707
00:58:07,887 --> 00:58:11,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Any update on the Oak Grove access road and stormwater assessment?

708
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:19,011
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I was going to follow up with them because they were supposed to have their plan sort of loosely together now.

709
00:58:19,171 --> 00:58:22,853
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can follow up and see what they've come up with for recommendations.

710
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:34,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the cemetery is also looking at the seven acres project, right, Doug, for the Brooks Estate.

711
00:58:35,881 --> 00:58:36,241
[SPEAKER_03]: They are.

712
00:58:36,801 --> 00:58:39,723
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a meeting this week that I'm going to be attending.

713
00:58:40,371 --> 00:58:51,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I did just the information that I just sent that just I will upload to our Google Drive for the DCR project has some relevant information to that.

714
00:58:52,317 --> 00:58:54,778
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will point that out in a direct email to you both.

715
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:56,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

716
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:56,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

717
00:59:03,186 --> 00:59:06,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, nothing on the state historic preservation law changes.

718
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:11,828
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think those are those are tabled until, you know, I think we can remove those off of there.

719
00:59:12,648 --> 00:59:12,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

720
00:59:13,568 --> 00:59:14,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And cross street cemetery.

721
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:19,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, I'm just going to meet with Stacey Clayton to review the file application.

722
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:23,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it's going to go to Teresa and then from Teresa, it'll go to the board.

723
00:59:24,011 --> 00:59:25,271
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll be Doug's hands.

724
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:44,092
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about $125,000 worth of work, which includes all the rest of the stones, the cleaning of the exterior stonewall fence, and the recreation of the metal gates that were at the front.

725
00:59:45,153 --> 00:59:46,033
[SPEAKER_06]: We're missing one.

726
00:59:46,134 --> 00:59:47,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where it went.

727
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:51,198
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to just recreate both of them.

728
00:59:51,218 --> 00:59:52,539
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be easier to do it that way.

729
00:59:54,821 --> 00:59:54,861
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

730
00:59:58,381 --> 00:59:58,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

731
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:04,446
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, properties under demo delay, 47 Holton Street.

732
01:00:06,827 --> 01:00:10,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you guys discussed this in subcommittee?

733
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent it around, but I only heard back from Peter.

734
01:00:14,413 --> 01:00:22,920
[SPEAKER_06]: So I took that as we should send it to the entire board because the plan is that the owners have

735
01:00:24,484 --> 01:00:28,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I talked with him just this afternoon.

736
01:00:28,328 --> 01:00:37,255
[SPEAKER_06]: According to the owners, they have withdrawn their plans from the zoning board, or at least have instructed their attorney to withdraw their plans from the zoning board.

737
01:00:37,376 --> 01:00:40,859
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I last talked with Dennis, it was sort of in building department limbo.

738
01:00:41,379 --> 01:00:46,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if it still has formally gotten kicked off of the agenda, but, um,

739
01:00:47,104 --> 01:00:49,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just sort of watching this project.

740
01:00:49,485 --> 01:00:55,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So the plan is no longer demolition, but rather to renovate the existing building.

741
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:59,288
[SPEAKER_06]: And the owners would just like to move forward with the plans that they submitted.

742
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:06,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're just doing a single house, single family building.

743
01:01:06,751 --> 01:01:10,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm perfectly fine with that.

744
01:01:10,252 --> 01:01:10,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I just,

745
01:01:11,764 --> 01:01:17,308
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're not, you know, it's a basically proposed gut rehab, it seems.

746
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,650
[SPEAKER_06]: So all new materials on the outside.

747
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:29,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like the form, you know, there's no change in massing, I believe.

748
01:01:29,918 --> 01:01:30,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

749
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:32,279
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not proposing any additions or anything.

750
01:01:32,299 --> 01:01:33,721
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just simply renovating.

751
01:01:33,761 --> 01:01:39,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks like they just made some changes like around the front door to sort of highlight the porch.

752
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:40,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's about it.

753
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:51,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if we don't have any changes and we believe that this plan is okay and avoids demolition, we can release the demo contingent on that they move forward with this plan.

754
01:01:51,478 --> 01:01:56,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want any sort of, and this is not an accusation, I don't want any sort of bait and switch.

755
01:01:56,742 --> 01:02:02,887
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, you know, contingent that they file these plans and move forward with this plan.

756
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:16,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because I think if they had just applied for a renovation permit and we got this in the permitting system and we saw this, we'd be like, yeah, OK, good to go.

757
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:17,723
[SPEAKER_08]: But I agree with you.

758
01:02:17,783 --> 01:02:31,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it has to be all the other things have to be satisfied, like removed from zoning agenda and plans uploaded and all of that before we lift it.

759
01:02:31,406 --> 01:02:33,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

760
01:02:34,295 --> 01:02:35,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So any questions, anything from Doug?

761
01:02:37,896 --> 01:02:38,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

762
01:02:39,937 --> 01:02:41,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think it looks good.

763
01:02:41,878 --> 01:02:46,119
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to see that it will be renovated.

764
01:02:46,879 --> 01:02:53,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's staying a single, so that'll be a nice single in this neighborhood.

765
01:02:55,124 --> 01:03:16,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, then in that case, I will make a motion to release the demolition delay on 47 Holton street, provided that, uh, they withdraw their application from the ZBA and that they proceed with filing these plans with the building department, um, and proceed with this project.

766
01:03:17,075 --> 01:03:23,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And that any alteration or deviation from this project will require our review otherwise.

767
01:03:27,793 --> 01:03:28,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

768
01:03:31,637 --> 01:03:31,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

769
01:03:33,438 --> 01:03:34,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a motion on the table.

770
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:41,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to repeat everything Ryan said with regards to lifting the demolition demolition delay at 47 Holden Street.

771
01:03:44,337 --> 01:04:10,230
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah i'm writing okay so contingent upon withdrawing application from zba and when was like were they was that going to go before the august meeting no was that a july meeting no it wasn't july it was later than that i think it was pushed way back into september because it was like in building department limbo dennis can correct me if i'm wrong but i believe that

772
01:04:10,885 --> 01:04:20,092
[SPEAKER_06]: that the building commissioner needed to sign off on something and it was on the agenda, but I think they had pulled it.

773
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we never actually... I don't know if you can hear me.

774
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:25,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, go ahead.

775
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

776
01:04:27,305 --> 01:04:27,485
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

777
01:04:27,785 --> 01:04:33,611
[SPEAKER_01]: So it never actually even went forward to being put on the agenda because the building commissioner placed a hold on it.

778
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:44,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what happens when... Just to give a little... When a zoning application comes in, I review it first, and then I just do a cursory review, and then it goes up to Scott.

779
01:04:44,742 --> 01:04:49,526
[SPEAKER_01]: and Danielle in my office, and they both review it for, Danielle reviews it to see if there's any CD board issues with it.

780
01:04:50,007 --> 01:04:53,029
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Scott reviews it just to put to a full zoning thing.

781
01:04:53,049 --> 01:04:56,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And either of them, they both have to agree to put it forward.

782
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And Scott didn't put it forward.

783
01:04:57,754 --> 01:05:00,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott put a hold on it and had some questions for the applicant.

784
01:05:00,576 --> 01:05:04,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's when they decided to just not move forward.

785
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:05,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

786
01:05:05,901 --> 01:05:11,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just deny the building permit in order to get it on the

787
01:05:12,503 --> 01:05:19,529
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, that's basically, it's sort of, it's kind of like what you all are sometimes doing when you're sort of like skipping the first step.

788
01:05:19,869 --> 01:05:27,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, they're telling folks, you know, when they come in to file for a permit, they're like, this is going to get denied, just apply for the variance now.

789
01:05:28,096 --> 01:05:31,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then sort of get the process started right away.

790
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:33,401
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

791
01:05:33,421 --> 01:05:33,861
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that

792
01:05:39,165 --> 01:05:54,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Dennis, we should get emails Ryan from Dennis as ZBA rep and Scott as building commissioner that, you know, just confirmation that this project, you know, the any demolition or whatever is kind of.

793
01:05:55,438 --> 01:05:58,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate, this is like the third time tonight I've said dead in the water, but.

794
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:01,219
[SPEAKER_06]: That the application has been.

795
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:02,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

796
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Formerly removed from.

797
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:04,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

798
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,401
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, formally withdrawn.

799
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:21,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and then once we have confirmation that, you know, that the permit has been applied for and the plans are uploaded for this project, then we can approve them like we would anything else.

800
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:23,345
Okay.

801
01:06:26,138 --> 01:06:27,323
[SPEAKER_08]: So Peter, we have that.

802
01:06:28,649 --> 01:06:29,010
[SPEAKER_08]: You have.

803
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,175
[SPEAKER_08]: You want me to have that?

804
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:37,392
[SPEAKER_04]: As part of the motion that the zoning and building department emails must be received, whatever.

805
01:06:37,992 --> 01:06:38,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

806
01:06:38,773 --> 01:06:39,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

807
01:06:39,093 --> 01:06:56,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I think just to have an official record from them, um, that this is no longer moving forward and that it's a straight renovation of an existing property stating that the zoning application has been withdrawn from those two or that it was never even, you know, never proceeded.

808
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:56,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

809
01:07:02,443 --> 01:07:02,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

810
01:07:03,063 --> 01:07:03,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

811
01:07:03,424 --> 01:07:05,625
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a motion on the table that has been seconded.

812
01:07:05,645 --> 01:07:07,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go around for roll call vote.

813
01:07:07,967 --> 01:07:08,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryan.

814
01:07:08,807 --> 01:07:09,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

815
01:07:10,088 --> 01:07:10,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter.

816
01:07:11,169 --> 01:07:11,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

817
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:12,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug.

818
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:13,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

819
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:15,572
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm also a yes.

820
01:07:18,194 --> 01:07:18,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

821
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:25,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

822
01:07:28,481 --> 01:07:28,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

823
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:43,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I did talk with Sid, they are not interested in coming to the table, even letting them know that we would be willing to support a project perhaps in advance of zoning, but they're not coming to the table.

824
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:47,221
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for Manning Street.

825
01:07:47,882 --> 01:07:53,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're going to hold out on that one.

826
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:56,329
[SPEAKER_08]: And no word from our friends on Allmont?

827
01:07:59,248 --> 01:07:59,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

828
01:08:00,048 --> 01:08:01,729
[SPEAKER_08]: That is our demolition delay update.

829
01:08:03,249 --> 01:08:06,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I, we have no update on Thomas Brooks park.

830
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:07,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

831
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:08,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

832
01:08:09,692 --> 01:08:21,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, surveys, Hastings, uh, Teresa and I attended the opening meeting, um, in typical, it was long and governmenty and, uh, boring.

833
01:08:21,436 --> 01:08:24,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we're trying to get them to move forward.

834
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:25,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

835
01:08:28,107 --> 01:08:28,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

836
01:08:28,807 --> 01:08:30,588
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for Hastings.

837
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:31,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

838
01:08:37,511 --> 01:08:38,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

839
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:44,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any other business for tonight before we move to the meeting minutes, approving meeting minutes?

840
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:47,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody have anything else?

841
01:08:49,817 --> 01:08:50,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

842
01:08:50,197 --> 01:08:56,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter sent around the meeting minutes from last month and I will take a motion when someone is ready.

843
01:08:57,646 --> 01:08:58,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Move to approve.

844
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:00,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ryan.

845
01:09:04,247 --> 01:09:04,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

846
01:09:05,367 --> 01:09:05,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Doug.

847
01:09:07,928 --> 01:09:11,048
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, motion to approve the meeting minutes from July 2025.

848
01:09:11,268 --> 01:09:12,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryan.

849
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:13,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

850
01:09:14,889 --> 01:09:15,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter.

851
01:09:15,789 --> 01:09:16,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

852
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:17,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug.
