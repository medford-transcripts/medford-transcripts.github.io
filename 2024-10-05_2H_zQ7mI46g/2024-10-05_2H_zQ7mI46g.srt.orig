52
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:47,430
[SPEAKER_15]: As a reminder, this is the proposed plan development district which is something that came to be in the zoning required application that was passed last March, just ago, last March, last March, March 23 to, sorry, it's all blurring together.

53
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:51,691
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is, I believe this is the first one to come before us at this stage.

54
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:58,077
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm gonna hand it over to Director Hunt first, just to tell us a little bit more about the project and the process before us.

55
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:04,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability for the City of Medford.

57
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:10,028
[SPEAKER_00]: The city retained Attorney Silverstein on this matter.

58
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:14,812
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I would like to have him introduce sort of the whole process here.

59
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:25,430
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are in this process and what are the next steps so that you have the framing and the applicant for this is available on Zoom and is prepared to share some information as well.

60
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much, Madam President, members of the Council.

61
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:33,098
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Jonathan Silverstein.

62
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:36,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I am special counsel, as Director Hunt indicated on this matter.

63
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:48,996
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been working with planning staff and the applicant for several months on the zoning amendment that is before you tonight for public hearing.

64
00:05:49,536 --> 00:06:00,526
[SPEAKER_11]: It's undergone a number of changes, been a very cooperative process, just to remind the council process-wise how we got here and what comes next.

65
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:01,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Under the

66
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:09,630
[SPEAKER_11]: zoning recodification and the new PDD zoning provision in section 9.2.

67
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:29,542
[SPEAKER_11]: The process began with an application from the proposed developer that was vetted in great detail by planning staff and ultimately came before the community development board for a public hearing.

68
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:33,168
[SPEAKER_11]: before it ever came to this body.

69
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:58,693
[SPEAKER_11]: That public hearing took place in April, and as a result of that public hearing, there was a draft amendment, zoning amendment, that was presented to the council last month, I believe, or maybe, no, in June, for referral to the Community Development Board, because under state law, under the State Zoning Act, Chapter 48, Section 5,

70
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:08,336
[SPEAKER_11]: A second public hearing was required at that point from the Community Development Board after the council referred it to that board.

71
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:12,559
[SPEAKER_11]: The Community Development Board held its public hearing.

72
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:26,828
[SPEAKER_11]: on August 2nd and unanimously voted to recommend that the council approve the amendment with the minor modifications that had been made since it was last before you.

73
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:35,015
[SPEAKER_11]: I did on August 9 prepare a brief memorandum to the council just summarizing some of those changes.

74
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:35,996
[SPEAKER_11]: They're really very minor.

75
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:42,760
[SPEAKER_11]: and of a clarifying nature, nothing about the project as proposed has changed.

76
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:48,303
[SPEAKER_11]: And so before you tonight is the proposed zoning amendment.

77
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:54,466
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to emphasize what approval of the zoning amendment tonight would do.

78
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:55,887
[SPEAKER_11]: It would not approve the project.

79
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:59,229
[SPEAKER_11]: It would approve the zoning amendment.

80
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,970
[SPEAKER_11]: It would create the first

81
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:14,460
[SPEAKER_11]: plan development district in the city, and that would allow the applicant to submit a special permit application and a site plan review application to the council.

82
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,123
[SPEAKER_11]: It would go through the normal process at that point, and the council would have all the discretion it normally would with respect to any special permit.

83
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:28,405
[SPEAKER_11]: And there'll be, of course, a special permit public hearing

84
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:39,615
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be at that public hearing that the details of the project and potential impacts of the project would be discussed, vetted by the council.

85
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:51,259
[SPEAKER_11]: The council would have all of the typical ability to hire peer review consultants and obtain department head input and advice, impose any conditions that it felt appropriate.

86
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:54,020
[SPEAKER_11]: So tonight is really just about the

87
00:08:55,217 --> 00:09:03,060
[SPEAKER_11]: legislative framework creating the plane development district that would allow the applicant to follow through with that next step.

88
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:14,746
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that procedural summary, I'm happy to walk the council through the amendment and answer any questions that counselors may have.

89
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:16,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

90
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:18,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any questions from counselors at this time?

91
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:21,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Attorney Silverstein.

92
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:25,688
[SPEAKER_15]: And will we also be getting a presentation from the petitioner as well, or you'll be serving as that?

93
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:32,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that the applicant is on zoom and prepared to make a presentation.

94
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:32,773
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, great.

95
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,935
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll hear from you first and then we'll go to them or.

96
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think obviously, uh, it's up to the council.

97
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:39,653
[SPEAKER_11]: What order?

98
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:48,119
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it would make sense if the council has no questions for me at that this time to give the applicant an opportunity to present.

99
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:51,561
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, I'll stay here for any questions you may have afterwards.

100
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:53,623
[SPEAKER_15]: I do see Adam Barnosky.

101
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:57,546
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

102
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:00,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

103
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Attorney Silverstein.

104
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:06,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, Madam President, members of the City Council.

105
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me all right?

106
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:08,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

107
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:10,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

108
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:11,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

109
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:18,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm an attorney for 96-102 Winchester Street LLC, which is the property owner and post developer.

110
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:31,043
[SPEAKER_07]: developer Nardone, Peter Quinn, the project architect, as well as my co-counsel, Michael Brown, all available today via Zoom.

111
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:37,327
[SPEAKER_07]: As Attorney Silverstein mentioned, we are here relative to a new plan development district pursuant to section 9.2 of the zoning ordinance.

112
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:39,429
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very excited about this proposal.

113
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:40,990
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been a long time in development.

114
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:49,177
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the PDD process being new to the city, we do appreciate all the efforts by all parties at the city to date.

115
00:10:50,097 --> 00:11:12,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to provide the council with an overview of the property and the proposed zoning and pursuant to the scope of the hearing and as mentioned by Attorney Silverstein, I will limit my presentation to the zoning components of the application, but we do have the ability to discuss any components of the underlying project if any members of the council are interested in hearing at this time.

116
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:17,580
[SPEAKER_07]: As a way of a background, this PDD has been through extensive process.

117
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,801
[SPEAKER_07]: and outreach with community development, including preliminary meetings.

118
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:27,982
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a community outreach meeting and several public appearances before the Community Development Board.

119
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:32,663
[SPEAKER_07]: And this application does come before you with unanimous support of that board.

120
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:35,203
[SPEAKER_07]: So first about the property.

121
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:41,764
[SPEAKER_07]: The proposed PDE site is located on the southern portion of Winchester Street, due east from the Ball Square T-stop.

122
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:45,545
[SPEAKER_07]: The site consists of three lots measuring just under 50,000 square feet.

123
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:55,362
[SPEAKER_07]: The two lots located at 96-102 Winchester Street are contiguous through lots with frontage on Winchester and Alfred Street.

124
00:11:56,343 --> 00:12:01,407
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been used for many years as a mix of commercial space for offices, garage, and outdoor vehicle storage.

125
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:08,634
[SPEAKER_07]: The lot located at 104 Winchester Street is a corner lot with frontage on Winchester and Albion Streets.

126
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:10,956
[SPEAKER_07]: 104 is improved with a two-story

127
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,689
[SPEAKER_07]: for the pursuit of historical permission.

128
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:26,536
[SPEAKER_07]: The site is located predominantly in the general residential zoning district with a small portion in the commercial C1 zoning district.

129
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:35,583
[SPEAKER_07]: The team thought that this property would be an appropriate location for the PDE because of its size and its current use within the zoning district.

130
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:39,387
[SPEAKER_07]: and its alignment with the city's recently adopted comprehensive plan.

131
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:51,075
[SPEAKER_07]: It lends itself to a use that's more consistent with the residential nature of the neighborhood and in relation to the multifamily projects that have been developed in recent years in the surrounding area.

132
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:56,699
[SPEAKER_07]: It is worth noting that the PDD was developed with specific uses and structure in mind, and as such,

133
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,081
[SPEAKER_07]: the proposed zoning is specific to this PDD and to a specific project.

134
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:23,572
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it's worth noting the process here as the council is aware that if this PDD is approved and adopted by this city council, we will then come back before both community development board and this city council to discuss all of the intricacies as far as the design of the building goes and the uses that are contained there.

135
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:31,979
[SPEAKER_07]: So as tonight's hearing only relates to the approval of the PDD and not regarding any projects I wanted to get into into some of the zoning.

136
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have a draft zoning amendment before you, which is listed in the proposed section 94 dash 9.

137
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,409
[SPEAKER_07]: to a five of the zoning ordinance.

138
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,910
[SPEAKER_07]: It details the proposed uses and the proposed dimensional requirements under the overlay.

139
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:52,411
[SPEAKER_07]: We tailored the use table to be more in line with the intended uses for the property.

140
00:13:52,491 --> 00:14:00,173
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crafted to be consistent with the surrounding area that is primarily residential with ancillary low impact commercial.

141
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:04,834
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the uses and the use table as you look through it is

142
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,342
[SPEAKER_07]: and the uses contained are consistent with a multifamily dwelling.

143
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:33,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Dimensionally, the dimensional elements are intended to blend the underlying district's requirements with certain modifications to accommodate the scale without disrupting the neighborhood and to allow room to modify in the event that there are certain requests that are made by boards later on during the special permit process.

144
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:51,252
[SPEAKER_07]: As currently drafted, this PDD has proposed heights in line with recent developments in the area along Broadway, setbacks similar to existing conditions at neighboring properties, below-grade parking in excess of underlying requirements, and reasonable open space and lot coverage requirements for the area.

145
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:56,013
[SPEAKER_07]: In a broader context, the proposed PDD is intended to create

146
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,223
[SPEAKER_07]: between the zoning district along Broadway into the GR zoning district of the subject.

147
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:12,547
[SPEAKER_07]: But as I mentioned, while the project is primarily located in the GR, it abuts and is partially located in the C1.

148
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:24,300
[SPEAKER_07]: As this Council is aware, the commercial district along Broadway is now becoming even more typified by mixed-use development, multifamily development, and a continuation of commercial uses.

149
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:35,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the site and the PDD, we believe, fit within the broader transition of the area and of the city, particularly in relation to the district's proximity to the GLX and Ball Square stations.

150
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:46,232
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we're happy to walk through any particular part of the zoning ordinance or answer any questions that the board may have.

151
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:53,838
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I mentioned before, we do have the design team ownership, my co counsel on the line to answer any questions you might have.

152
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:54,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

153
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

154
00:15:58,022 --> 00:15:58,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you counselor.

155
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,597
[SPEAKER_13]: You made a great presentation for the city of Somerville.

156
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,280
[SPEAKER_13]: You said Broadway five times.

157
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:18,172
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is what we've been talking about here in Medford, with the lack of the movement with our zoning.

158
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,792
[SPEAKER_13]: consultant to look at what Medford wants to do.

159
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:43,220
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I just think that you said some things with the neighborhood, but I know the neighborhood on the Medford side has a real problem with this area right now because of some fears and because of lack of true understanding where we're going in our community.

160
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,822
[SPEAKER_13]: The spot development, we're seeing that happen all over the city.

161
00:16:47,829 --> 00:17:03,132
[SPEAKER_13]: But these are the issues that I find being a problem when the council for the projects has mentioned how it appeals to Broadway, which isn't Medford.

162
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:08,634
[SPEAKER_13]: So I tend to be a little leery, that's all.

163
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:09,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

164
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:10,634
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Fevella.

165
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:13,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions from our councilors at this time?

166
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, as this is a public, or Attorney Solicitor, did you wanna come up and add anything else about the process?

167
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:25,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Or I was gonna open the public hearing and go from there.

168
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:26,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at this time, Madam President.

169
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:27,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

170
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, as this is a public hearing, I do need to open it up.

171
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,101
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll open up the public hearing.

172
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper?

173
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:41,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I assume folks who are petitioners for this project would wanna speak in favor, either on Zoom or in person.

174
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,631
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're on Zoom, please raise your hand

175
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:47,709
[SPEAKER_15]: flag me down, I'd like to speak in favor of this paper.

176
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:58,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Attorney Barnard-Scaston, is there at least one person who wants to speak in favor of this, or you are in favor of this paper?

177
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:05,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm sorry, was that a question for me, Madam President?

178
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:09,536
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just asking for anyone to speak in favor, and generally the petitioner is...

179
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:14,545
[SPEAKER_15]: is in favor of the paper, so it's the procedural way of the public hearing.

180
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:15,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, thank you.

181
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:16,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

182
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:22,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone else on the call who would like to speak in favor of this paper before us, or anyone in person?

183
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:30,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

184
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:36,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the paper before us, either in person or on Zoom?

185
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:46,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

186
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:51,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have any further discussion from the council or a motion?

187
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:57,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to waive the six day public comment period and approve.

188
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:05,199
[SPEAKER_15]: of emotion, price and affairs to waive the six day public comment period and approve councilor Scarpelli.

189
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:17,981
[SPEAKER_13]: I would really, again, when you're talking about a project like this and what it affects and when we're doing it, where we're not having meetings, I think that's a slippery slope again, councilor.

190
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I would recommend that you wouldn't do that.

191
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:21,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I withdraw the motion.

192
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:24,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I would move to approve pending the six day public comment period.

193
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,203
[SPEAKER_09]: My apologies, I read it wrong.

194
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:33,893
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a motion from Vice President Behrs to approve pending the six day public comment period seconded by Councilor Collins.

195
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:35,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_15]: As the Community Development Board voted unanimously to submit the proposed zoning amendment per Medford Zoning Ordinance Section 94-9.2.3.2 to the City Council to initiate the statutory requirements for amending zoning.

207
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:52,283
[SPEAKER_15]: per MGL chapter 48, section five, the zoning amendment now must be referred from city council to the community development board, who will hold a duly noticed public hearing.

208

[SPEAKER_15]: The city council will hold a subsequent public hearing for this amendment after a report with recommendations by the community development board has been submitted to the council.

209
00:21:59,748 --> 00:22:03,351
[SPEAKER_15]: We thank you for your view of this matter and are happy to provide additional information.

210
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:09,996

211
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:12,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam president, thank you.

212
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:19,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just sort of iterate, this is actually the same process that was just explained to you by Attorney Silverstein.

213
00:22:19,632 --> 00:22:21,453
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just earlier in the process here.

214
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,375
[SPEAKER_00]: So this development came to us.

215
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:27,217
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in front of the CD board.

216
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:30,399
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we hired a different attorney to work with them.

217
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:37,384
[SPEAKER_00]: So Attorney Gareth Osmond of Pierce Atwood is, Osmond, sorry, is the attorney of record.

218
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:40,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, he couldn't be, he's not available this evening.

219
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:45,698
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did not want to make the applicant wait several more weeks for this step in the process.

220
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:51,703
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has been working with them, the applicant and the CD board to draft a zoning.

221
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:57,607
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the step where there is a required legal referral from this council to the CD board.

222
00:22:58,147 --> 00:23:02,691
[SPEAKER_00]: The CD board will then hold a hearing and then it will come back in front of this council for review.

223
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:08,655
[SPEAKER_00]: But this step this evening is the earlier step where the city council must refer it to the CD board.

224
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,041
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm available and actually I will let you know that the applicant is here this evening in the chambers.

225
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:21,984
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not planning to have them present the project, but if there were any clarifying questions or anything, they are available this evening.

226
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:22,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

227
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions from councilors discussion at this time?

228
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:39,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, you know, I'm happy to just motion to refer this community development board but I do, given that they did come in person if they want to say anything I want to give them a chance to say something before we move on.

229
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,627
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't have to, you don't have to, I just don't want.

230
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:49,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't want you to feel like we rushed you out of the room.

231
00:23:49,437 --> 00:23:51,078
[SPEAKER_15]: And just name and address for the record, please.

232
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Madam Chair.

233

234
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm an attorney for the applicant, Varen Bio.

235
00:23:57,143 --> 00:23:59,005
[SPEAKER_08]: And just thank you for hearing this.

236
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:03,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you heard before, we're kind of two steps behind.

237
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:07,572
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll be seeing you again at least two more times at public hearings.

238
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:12,556
[SPEAKER_08]: So look forward to presenting it in further detail.

239
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:14,078
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for hearing us tonight.

240
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:15,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

241

00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:07,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

266
00:25:08,532 --> 00:25:09,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm new to this process.

267

00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be running as it is.

270
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,021
[SPEAKER_13]: What is it?

271
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:25,281
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a convenience store.

272
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:27,182
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're taking over the boils?

273
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:27,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

274
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:28,382
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

275
00:25:29,423 --> 00:25:32,184
[SPEAKER_13]: So Madam President, I see everything in place.

276
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Before I open up, there is one question.

277
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:37,066
[SPEAKER_13]: You were applying for workman's comp.

278
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:37,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that completed?

279
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:39,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry?

280
00:25:40,194 --> 00:25:44,336
[SPEAKER_13]: It says that you were going to apply for your insurance.

281
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I did.

282
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:47,697
[SPEAKER_14]: You have that?

283
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:50,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

284
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President to the clerk, if the gentleman could just forward you that.

285
00:25:56,081 --> 00:26:02,023
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would move in favor, as long as you have that document in hand tomorrow.

286
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:10,775
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to hold it up, but if we can do that, if you said you have it, just send a copy, then my recommendation would be to move and approve.

287
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:17,121
[SPEAKER_13]: And as long as the clerk has that tomorrow.

288
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:17,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that okay?

289
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:18,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

290
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:18,722
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

291
00:26:18,802 --> 00:26:19,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

292
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:19,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

293
00:26:20,264 --> 00:26:22,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions, discussion from the council?

294
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:26,370
[SPEAKER_15]: So the motion from Councilor Scarpelli is to approve pending receiving the

295
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:33,665
[SPEAKER_15]: was just tomorrow, right, seconded by Carvello all those in favor.

296
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:35,365
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed.

297
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:36,526
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

298
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:38,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that was good.

299
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:52,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Good luck to three dash three or five petition for common mixers licensed by Christopher Baum and Fernando Cruz for T pizza doing business as dominoes 199 C mystic of masco 2155.

300
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:53,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have the petitioner.

301
00:26:58,731 --> 00:27:02,232
[SPEAKER_16]: or may have been the gentleman before.

302
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:15,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Is anyone here on Zoom representing Domino's?

303
00:27:27,577 --> 00:27:41,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Next week, we will motion from cancer Carviello to table this paper second by second, I was in favor of the codes which passes, and if that person if you are from dominoes, you end up doing the call you are in the call you stepped away.

304
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:44,465
[SPEAKER_15]: flag is down tonight.

305
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,349
[SPEAKER_15]: motions orders and resolutions.

306
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:51,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, can we just dismiss 23 dash 386 please.

307
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, going on to 23-37 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

308
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:08,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the City Council invite the Director of the Health Department to discuss ongoing concerns of rat infestation around the city.

309
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:10,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

310
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

311
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:15,598
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure that everybody's heard and everybody's, it's not just in Medford.

312
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:22,822
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a pretty severe issue, all over the Commonwealth.

313
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:23,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you're hearing

314
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:35,236
[SPEAKER_13]: you're hearing that now that you're seeing this rat infestation, not just in where they traditionally would find them, you know, close to restaurants or close to water.

315
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:43,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you're finding them in areas like the Heights where most of the homes there are ledge.

316
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,522
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's starting to become even more disturbing.

317
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:54,145
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know that the Board of Health is super busy, but I think we need to find

318
00:28:55,266 --> 00:29:03,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, an avenue where we're putting together a serious team that's devoted to this issue right now.

319
00:29:03,796 --> 00:29:06,119
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's what we're seeing right now.

320
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:09,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, residents contacting us.

321
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:13,329
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I know that the Board of Health is responding

322
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:32,031
[SPEAKER_13]: piece mail, I know that something was sent out, and it was forwarded by one of the residents, one of the residents that reached out to me, and who requested this resolution be brought up that now the what we've been talking about for a while is having the possibility of

323
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:41,657
[SPEAKER_13]: The Board of Health, as long as the homeowner is willing to allow them on their property, they're willing to do some abatement on private property.

324
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:43,398
[SPEAKER_13]: In the past, that's been an issue.

325
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:57,347
[SPEAKER_13]: I know this council moved forward to try to find a solution where we have the Board of Health work together with residents because one of the questions back maybe two years ago was that you could see the nest

326
00:29:58,386 --> 00:30:08,153
[SPEAKER_13]: but unfortunately the exterminating company couldn't go one foot to that nest that had the issue because it was on private property.

327
00:30:08,253 --> 00:30:17,939
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we need to do a better job communicating with not just people that are complaining, but I think the community as a whole.

328
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And then really look at some sort of a plan.

329
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:21,822
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that,

330
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:26,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's saying that, well, some of it's development, the movement of the streets.

331
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:33,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing, we haven't done much development and we haven't really fixed many streets and sidewalks.

332
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:39,886
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you're seeing projects like tonight that are coming up, we're gonna see some more movement.

333
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:48,431
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna see some more, we're gonna see greater projects and we're gonna see the earth being moved in a greater capacity, which means

334
00:30:49,572 --> 00:30:57,056
[SPEAKER_13]: more of that rat infestation moving from, you know, from one area to the rest of the community.

335
00:30:57,136 --> 00:30:59,777
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, we do have a problem.

336
00:30:59,937 --> 00:31:12,563
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that the resident that contacted me, that the Board of Health moved to support that neighborhood, but once we heard that,

337
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,801
[SPEAKER_13]: the feedback I got was this isn't just in one neighborhood.

338
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,421
[SPEAKER_13]: This neighborhood was in the Heights, by the way.

339
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:33,624
[SPEAKER_13]: But then I got phone calls when I put this resolution up, I had phone calls with, I had phone calls South Medford, I had phone calls West Medford, the Hillside, I had phone calls in the Wellington area.

340
00:31:33,704 --> 00:31:39,685
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was, it really stirred the nest, to say the least.

341
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:41,245
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we really need to,

342
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:43,751
[SPEAKER_13]: really be proactive right now.

343
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:48,583
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, when you're talking about the summer, in a few months,

344
00:31:50,989 --> 00:32:02,179
[SPEAKER_13]: rodents are going to leave the exterior of our neighborhoods and now try to find homes and businesses to infiltrate.

345
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:14,590
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think if we can, I know that we put it out there, I would make a motion that we have a meeting with the Board of Health and any other department that needs to be involved.

346
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:15,171
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that

347
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:27,956
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, whether it's DPW or code enforcement that we bring all the parties together to try to find a way to put a program in place.

348
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:42,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I'm not gonna, I know neighboring communities, I've talked to neighboring communities and they've had remediation plans that don't, that go, they're pretty deep.

349
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:43,342
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't look at just,

350
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:57,472
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, baiting catch basins and putting in traps, they're really looking with different entities to bring in to help us stop the reproduction of the rats in their nests.

351
00:32:57,492 --> 00:33:03,657
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, I know it was a little winded, but I think this is serious.

352
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:09,982
[SPEAKER_13]: This is something that it's coming up a lot and we don't hear any solutions.

353
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:12,624
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would make the motion that we,

354
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:30,604
[SPEAKER_13]: contact the board of health, the code enforcement, the DPW department, and someone from the mayor's office for communications to try to find a way that we send out a detailed plan and try to at least get the information that's needed to help this process along.

355
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,085
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

356
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:32,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

357
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:33,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

358
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:33,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

359
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:33,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

360
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:34,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

361
00:33:34,434 --> 00:33:34,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

362
00:33:34,674 --> 00:33:34,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

363
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:35,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

364
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:36,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

365
00:33:36,396 --> 00:33:36,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

366
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:37,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

367
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:37,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

368
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:38,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

369
00:33:38,338 --> 00:33:38,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

370
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:39,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

371
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:40,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

372
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

373
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:41,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

374
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:41,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

375
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:42,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

376
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:42,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

377
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:42,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

378
00:33:43,002 --> 00:33:44,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

379
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:44,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

380
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:45,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

381
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:45,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

382
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:45,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

383
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:46,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

384
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:46,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

385
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:46,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

386
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:47,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

387
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:47,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

388
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think we need to do a lot better.

389
00:33:57,629 --> 00:34:02,612
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be doing a lot better on trying to get rid of this rat devastation.

390
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:08,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like I said, pretty soon your projects are going to be starting around and the earth's going to get moved again.

391
00:34:09,636 --> 00:34:12,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rat's going to keep coming out.

392
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:17,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are in all neighborhoods with its homes and residents.

393
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:21,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a little hesitant about the garbage thing.

394
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:35,240
[SPEAKER_01]: on the composting of the new plan there, I'm hearing a lot of feedback from residents that they're a little concerned that we're separating the food for the rats.

395
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:51,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think before we get into that, I think we need to have a little more discussion with the composting program too, to see how that's gonna work and how that's worked in other communities with rat infestation.

396
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:52,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

397
00:34:54,482 --> 00:34:54,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

398
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:59,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, thank you, Councillor Scarpelli for putting forward this resolution.

399
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I am sure we've all heard a lot about the rats.

400
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I've been bringing up the rats a lot in the last few last few months as well.

401
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:13,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I, I think it'd be a great idea to meet with the BOH and with the director of the health department.

402
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:26,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Particularly because a few months ago we had heard during the budget committee of the holes were director O'Connor came up to us, she detailed some of her plans

403
00:35:27,587 --> 00:35:33,133
[SPEAKER_06]: what the department's currently working on and what they would like to get in place but haven't gotten in place yet.

404
00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:44,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think Councilor Scarpelli alluded to this, but we do have a contract with Yankee Pest who will come in and treat burrows and nests on private property.

405
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:48,488
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll come in once for inspection and a second time to treat.

406
00:35:51,158 --> 00:36:02,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Director O'Connor also mentioned that they're looking at doing what Malden and Somerville are doing with regards to catching and killing rats.

407
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:09,110
[SPEAKER_06]: The rat trap boxes that they have in Malden and Somerville, she said that that was maybe an option.

408
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:14,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we have that in that for right now, so it'd be great to get progress on that.

409
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:15,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that

410
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:20,637
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be good just to go in depth about rat treatment and infestation.

411
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:32,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And with regards to the trash program, I think residents might have concerns, but we do have numbers with regards to which types of cans and bins are being eaten into.

412
00:36:32,987 --> 00:36:37,010
[SPEAKER_06]: And ones with locks are just much stronger than ones without.

413
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

414
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:38,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

415
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:39,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins.

416
00:36:40,804 --> 00:36:41,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

417
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:55,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that Councilor Sang covered most of what I was going to say relating to locking bins being actually shown to be a really secure way to rat proof containers, just you know, I think it's a common misconception that composting can increase

418
00:36:56,642 --> 00:37:03,103
[SPEAKER_10]: rat problems, I think that's actually not necessarily the case, which is great for the city on a lot of fronts because of those locking containers can actually keep rats out better.

419
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:10,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the bigger picture that we're all really concerned about, we all hear about all the time is that everybody's seeing rats everywhere all the time, and it's a problem.

420
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:25,127
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is something that we need to start being proactive about so that we don't have to resort to those rat extermination measures that I think nobody wants to use that are also a threat to other beloved parts of our ecosystem, like the bald eagles along the Mr. River watershed.

421
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:34,854
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think this is something that comes up a lot on the city council this is, you know, to really attack this in a proactive way takes money that we don't currently have in our operating budget.

422
00:37:36,872 --> 00:37:42,514
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be great if we can align with our department heads and make sure that we're doing everything that we can be doing with our current resources.

423
00:37:43,914 --> 00:37:50,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need to be pushing for that future operational budget so that we can have, you know, I think Councillor Scarpelli makes a great point.

424
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:58,718
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to have a standing working committee, working group, whatever that looks like, so that we're really addressing this problem and not letting it continue to boil over.

425
00:37:58,898 --> 00:37:59,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

426
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:13,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And another quick point I think should be made, and this might be beating a dead drum, but there are good ideas out there that are being tested and implemented, even in municipalities around us, like Councilor Scarpelli said.

427
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:21,252
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of it just requires money and resources, and we need to figure out how we're gonna fund all these programs.

428
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:25,573
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's the perennial challenge of our city.

429
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:30,095
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot facing us in the next budget season, and we need a concrete plan to do that.

430
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:37,894
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

431
00:38:37,954 --> 00:38:38,574
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

432
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:40,094
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

433
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:40,814
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

434
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:43,575
[SPEAKER_15]: The gentleman from Domino's is on the call.

435
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,576
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll mention that if anyone wants to do anything.

436
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:47,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

437
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:49,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

438
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:57,538
[SPEAKER_17]: So a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to take 23-385 off the table.

439
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Second by Councilor Cabrillo.

440
00:39:01,692 --> 00:39:02,592
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

441
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Opposed?

442
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:04,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Passes.

443
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:10,960
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll go back to 23205 petition for a common pitchers license by Christopher Baum and Fernando Cruz for T.E.

444
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Pizza doing good says Domino's 199C Mystic Ave, Medford, Mass.

445
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:17,607
[SPEAKER_15]: I will turn over to you on Zoom.

446
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:23,052
[SPEAKER_15]: If you could just give a name and address and just a brief history of what the business is.

447
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:28,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello everyone, I'm sorry, I have some technical issues.

448
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:29,968
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Berenice Silva.

449
00:39:30,188 --> 00:39:35,932
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here representing Domino's, D-E-P-I-T-O, D-B-A, Domino's.

450
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:40,295
[SPEAKER_12]: We are located at 199C Mystic Avenue in Medford.

451
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:44,718
[SPEAKER_12]: My current office is 77 Mammoth Road in Lowell, Massachusetts.

452
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:46,304
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

453
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,606
[SPEAKER_15]: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli, Chair of the License Committee.

454
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:51,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for being here.

455
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:55,448
[SPEAKER_13]: As I'm going through the, everything looks good.

456
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:57,849
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that, what are your hours of operations?

457
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,632
[SPEAKER_13]: We're keeping the same operation hours as current.

458
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,312
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that that's my question, my fellow councilors.

459
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:16,618
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that when we allow a special permit for extended hours, it goes, is it, do we see any restrictions with that?

460
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:18,099
[SPEAKER_13]: I, cause I don't.

461
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:21,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Your requested hours here is from seven to 11, so.

462
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:23,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, so seven o'clock to 11 o'clock, is that?

463
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:25,064
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

464
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:32,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, so that's the issue, cause we allow a certain,

465
00:40:33,905 --> 00:40:47,929
[SPEAKER_13]: hourly certain hours and then to go to the two o'clock request at 1030 to 10am 1030am to two you have it stretched off and the requested hours that asked you have to come back for a special permit for that.

466
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:58,793
[SPEAKER_13]: So, as we approve this, the hours have to change so 11 o'clock until the special permit is heard is on the petition.

467
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,909
[SPEAKER_13]: It says requested hours 10 30 a.m.

468
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it's crossed out.

469
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,431
[SPEAKER_13]: You had two a.m.

470
00:41:05,451 --> 00:41:07,452
[SPEAKER_13]: And then below it is seven a.m.

471
00:41:07,492 --> 00:41:07,612
[SPEAKER_13]: to 11.

472
00:41:12,254 --> 00:41:17,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, that that wasn't as our operation over 10 30 a.m.

473
00:41:17,217 --> 00:41:21,999
[SPEAKER_12]: to one in the morning and then Friday and Saturday on the weekends.

474
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,860
[SPEAKER_12]: We close at two in the morning.

475
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:25,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

476
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:29,183
[SPEAKER_13]: What I'm telling you, you can't do that until

477
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:33,697
[SPEAKER_13]: The permit that's requested in front of us is a request from 7 a.m.

478
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:33,857
[SPEAKER_13]: to 11.

479
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:43,486
[SPEAKER_13]: To extend those hours, you have to come in front of us with a special permit for extended hours use.

480
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:46,508
[SPEAKER_13]: By changing over, the ownership changes.

481
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:53,195
[SPEAKER_13]: The vote that was taken in the past is dismissed, and now it starts again.

482
00:41:55,276 --> 00:42:04,438
[SPEAKER_12]: I see, and I would just have to go on the website to request a special permit or how would I go about getting this special permit for the extended hours?

483
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,319
[SPEAKER_15]: You can call the clerk's office and they can help with that.

484
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,160
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can vote tonight.

485
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:09,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

486
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,920
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, till 11.

487
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,041
[SPEAKER_15]: You just need to then request to get those extended hours.

488
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:14,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, if we could do that.

489
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:15,821
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't wanna hurt you.

490
00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:21,383
[SPEAKER_13]: We just wanna make sure this is, you get everything you need in place so there isn't an issue later.

491
00:42:22,104 --> 00:42:23,884
[SPEAKER_12]: because I appreciate it.

492
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:25,465
[SPEAKER_13]: I would move forward.

493
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:35,027
[SPEAKER_13]: I would move forward with the petitions request right now in favor and the petitioner contact the clerk in the morning for the extended hours.

494
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:40,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

495
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, sir.

496
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:47,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we have a question from one of the counselors if you can hear him.

497
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, are you still there?

498
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.

499
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:56,032
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, you know, I frequent that area a lot.

500
00:42:57,192 --> 00:43:02,335
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do notice from from your drivers and from the day is a lot of a lot of litter in that parking lot.

501
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,456
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all dominoes receipts and things like that.

502
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:07,977
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could stay on top of that and clean them up.

503
00:43:08,317 --> 00:43:11,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's not fit to the other people in that in that strip.

504
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:15,500
[SPEAKER_01]: That's clean up all the receipts and things that are left out there every night.

505
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,341
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they come in in the morning, they're there.

506
00:43:17,941 --> 00:43:23,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate if you would rub an eye at it and have your drivers not leave their stuff in the parking lot.

507
00:43:24,386 --> 00:43:24,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

508
00:43:24,806 --> 00:43:26,067
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be taking care of that.

509
00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:28,349
