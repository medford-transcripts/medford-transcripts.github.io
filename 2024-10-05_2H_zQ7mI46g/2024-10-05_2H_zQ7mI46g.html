    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=298.678s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=300.499s">Alicia</a>  Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=305.644s">The</a>  city retained Attorney Silverstein on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=310.048s">And</a>  actually, I would like to have him introduce sort of the whole process here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=315.279s">where</a>  we are in this process and what are the next steps so that you have the framing and the applicant for this is available on Zoom and is prepared to share some information as well.</p>

    <p>[Silverstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=329.694s">Thank</a>  you so much, Madam President, members of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=331.736s">My</a>  name is Jonathan Silverstein. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=333.118s">I</a>  am special counsel, as Director Hunt indicated on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=339.447s">I've</a>  been working with planning staff and the applicant for several months on the zoning amendment that is before you tonight for public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=349.536s">It's</a>  undergone a number of changes, been a very cooperative process, just to remind the council process-wise how we got here and what comes next. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=361.307s">Under</a>  the <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=364.327s">zoning</a>  recodification and the new PDD zoning provision in section 9.2. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=371.431s">The</a>  process began with an application from the proposed developer that was vetted in great detail by planning staff and ultimately came before the community development board for a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=390.828s">before</a>  it ever came to this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=394.029s">That</a>  public hearing took place in April, and as a result of that public hearing, there was a draft amendment, zoning amendment, that was presented to the council last month, I believe, or maybe, no, in June, for referral to the Community Development Board, because under state law, under the State Zoning Act, Chapter 48, Section 5, <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=420.17s">A</a>  second public hearing was required at that point from the Community Development Board after the council referred it to that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=429.557s">The</a>  Community Development Board held its public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=435.658s">on</a>  August 2nd and unanimously voted to recommend that the council approve the amendment with the minor modifications that had been made since it was last before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=447.228s">I</a>  did on August 9 prepare a brief memorandum to the council just summarizing some of those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=455.055s">They're</a>  really very minor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=456.936s">and</a>  of a clarifying nature, nothing about the project as proposed has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=464.221s">And</a>  so before you tonight is the proposed zoning amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=469.063s">And</a>  I just want to emphasize what approval of the zoning amendment tonight would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=474.506s">It</a>  would not approve the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=476.788s">It</a>  would approve the zoning amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=479.269s">It</a>  would create the first <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=481.856s">plan</a>  development district in the city, and that would allow the applicant to submit a special permit application and a site plan review application to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=494.72s">It</a>  would go through the normal process at that point, and the council would have all the discretion it normally would with respect to any special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=501.803s">And</a>  there'll be, of course, a special permit public hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=508.892s">It</a>  would be at that public hearing that the details of the project and potential impacts of the project would be discussed, vetted by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=519.655s">The</a>  council would have all of the typical ability to hire peer review consultants and obtain department head input and advice, impose any conditions that it felt appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=532.219s">So</a>  tonight is really just about the <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=535.217s">legislative</a>  framework creating the plane development district that would allow the applicant to follow through with that next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=544.041s">So</a>  with that procedural summary, I'm happy to walk the council through the amendment and answer any questions that Councilors may have.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=556.446s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=556.726s">Are</a>  there any questions from Councilors at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=560.605s">Thank</a>  you, Attorney Silverstein. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=561.446s">And</a>  will we also be getting a presentation from the petitioner as well, or you'll be serving as that?</p>

    <p>[Silverstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=565.789s">I</a>  believe that the applicant is on zoom and prepared to make a presentation.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=572.353s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=572.833s">So</a>  we'll hear from you first and then we'll go to them or.</p>

    <p>[Silverstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=575.59s">Yeah,</a>  I think obviously, uh, it's up to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=579.073s">What</a>  order? <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=579.873s">But</a>  I think it would make sense if the council has no questions for me at that this time to give the applicant an opportunity to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=588.199s">And</a>  then, of course, I'll stay here for any questions you may have afterwards.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=591.902s">I</a>  do see Adam Barnosky. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=596.145s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=600.028s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=602.209s">Thank</a>  you, Attorney Silverstein. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=604.557s">Good</a>  evening, Madam President, members of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=606.719s">Can</a>  you hear me all right?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=608.622s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=609.783s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=611.105s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=611.725s">So</a>  I'm an attorney for 96-102 Winchester Street LLC, which is the property owner and post developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=623.937s">developer</a>  Nardone, Peter Quinn, the project architect, as well as my co-counsel, Michael Brown, all available today via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=631.603s">As</a>  Attorney Silverstein mentioned, we are here relative to a new plan development district pursuant to section 9.2 of the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=637.908s">We're</a>  very excited about this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=639.449s">It</a>  has been a long time in development. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=641.591s">And</a>  with the PDD process being new to the city, we do appreciate all the efforts by all parties at the city to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=650.097s">So</a>  I want to provide the council with an overview of the property and the proposed zoning and pursuant to the scope of the hearing and as mentioned by Attorney Silverstein, I will limit my presentation to the zoning components of the application, but we do have the ability to discuss any components of the underlying project if any members of the council are interested in hearing at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=673.036s">As</a>  a way of a background, this PDD has been through extensive process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=678.22s">and</a>  outreach with community development, including preliminary meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=681.841s">We</a>  had a community outreach meeting and several public appearances before the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=688.722s">And</a>  this application does come before you with unanimous support of that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=694.043s">So</a>  first about the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=695.723s">The</a>  proposed PDE site is located on the southern portion of Winchester Street, due east from the Ball Square T-stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=702.444s">The</a>  site consists of three lots measuring just under 50,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=708.275s">The</a>  two lots located at 96-102 Winchester Street are contiguous through lots with frontage on Winchester and Alfred Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=716.343s">They've</a>  been used for many years as a mix of commercial space for offices, garage, and outdoor vehicle storage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=722.368s">The</a>  lot located at 104 Winchester Street is a corner lot with frontage on Winchester and Albion Streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=729.334s">104</a>  is improved with a two-story <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=734.667s">for</a>  the pursuit of historical permission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=738.73s">The</a>  site is located predominantly in the general residential zoning district with a small portion in the commercial C1 zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=747.457s">The</a>  team thought that this property would be an appropriate location for the PDE because of its size and its current use within the zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=756.145s">and</a>  its alignment with the city's recently adopted comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=760.128s">It</a>  lends itself to a use that's more consistent with the residential nature of the neighborhood and in relation to the multifamily projects that have been developed in recent years in the surrounding area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=771.095s">It</a>  is worth noting that the PDD was developed with specific uses and structure in mind, and as such, <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=777.039s">the</a>  proposed zoning is specific to this PDD and to a specific project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=781.121s">However,</a>  it's worth noting the process here as the council is aware that if this PDD is approved and adopted by this city council, we will then come back before both community development board and this city council to discuss all of the intricacies as far as the design of the building goes and the uses that are contained there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=804.928s">So</a>  as tonight's hearing only relates to the approval of the PDD and not regarding any projects I wanted to get into into some of the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=812.72s">So</a>  you have a draft zoning amendment before you, which is listed in the proposed section 94 dash 9. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=819.389s">to</a>  a five of the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=822.05s">It</a>  details the proposed uses and the proposed dimensional requirements under the overlay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=827.891s">We</a>  tailored the use table to be more in line with the intended uses for the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=832.491s">It's</a>  crafted to be consistent with the surrounding area that is primarily residential with ancillary low impact commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=841.613s">So</a>  that's the uses and the use table as you look through it is <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=847.8s">and</a>  the uses contained are consistent with a multifamily dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=854.943s">Dimensionally,</a>  the dimensional elements are intended to blend the underlying district's requirements with certain modifications to accommodate the scale without disrupting the neighborhood and to allow room to modify in the event that there are certain requests that are made by boards later on during the special permit process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=873.727s">As</a>  currently drafted, this PDD has proposed heights in line with recent developments in the area along Broadway, setbacks similar to existing conditions at neighboring properties, below-grade parking in excess of underlying requirements, and reasonable open space and lot coverage requirements for the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=892.652s">In</a>  a broader context, the proposed PDD is intended to create <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=900.78s">between</a>  the zoning district along Broadway into the GR zoning district of the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=905.323s">But</a>  as I mentioned, while the project is primarily located in the GR, it abuts and is partially located in the C1. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=914.469s">As</a>  this Council is aware, the commercial district along Broadway is now becoming even more typified by mixed-use development, multifamily development, and a continuation of commercial uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=924.92s">So,</a>  the site and the PDD, we believe, fit within the broader transition of the area and of the city, particularly in relation to the district's proximity to the GLX and Ball Square stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=937.465s">So,</a>  we're happy to walk through any particular part of the zoning ordinance or answer any questions that the board may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=946.492s">And</a>  as I mentioned before, we do have the design team ownership, my co counsel on the line to answer any questions you might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=954.239s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1083.534s">Yeah,</a>  I'm sorry, was that a question for me, Madam President?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1086.535s">I'm</a>  just asking for anyone to speak in favor, and generally the petitioner is... <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1090.624s">is</a>  in favor of the paper, so it's the procedural way of the public hearing.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1679.41s">Okay,</a>  going on to 23-37 offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1682.692s">Be</a>  it resolved that the City Council invite the Director of the Health Department to discuss ongoing concerns of rat infestation around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1688.995s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1690.155s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1691.136s">I'm</a>  sure that everybody's heard and everybody's, it's not just in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1696.178s">This</a>  is a pretty severe issue, all over the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1702.862s">I</a>  mean, you're hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1705.172s">you're</a>  hearing that now that you're seeing this rat infestation, not just in where they traditionally would find them, you know, close to restaurants or close to water. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1715.797s">Now</a>  you're finding them in areas like the Heights where most of the homes there are ledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1724.26s">And</a>  so it's starting to become even more disturbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1728.642s">So</a>  I know that the Board of Health is super busy, but I think we need to find <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1735.266s">Um,</a>  an avenue where we're putting together a serious team that's devoted to this issue right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1743.796s">I</a>  think that's what we're seeing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1746.941s">Um,</a>  residents contacting us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1749.864s">And</a>  then I know that the Board of Health is responding <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1754.435s">piece</a>  mail, I know that something was sent out, and it was forwarded by one of the residents, one of the residents that reached out to me, and who requested this resolution be brought up that now the what we've been talking about for a while is having the possibility of <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1774.252s">The</a>  Board of Health, as long as the homeowner is willing to allow them on their property, they're willing to do some abatement on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1781.677s">In</a>  the past, that's been an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1783.458s">I</a>  know this council moved forward to try to find a solution where we have the Board of Health work together with residents because one of the questions back maybe two years ago was that you could see the nest <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1798.386s">but</a>  unfortunately the exterminating company couldn't go one foot to that nest that had the issue because it was on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1808.253s">So</a>  I think we need to do a better job communicating with not just people that are complaining, but I think the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1819.28s">And</a>  then really look at some sort of a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1821.401s">I</a>  know that, <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1823.114s">Everybody's</a>  saying that, well, some of it's development, the movement of the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1827.497s">Here's</a>  the thing, we haven't done much development and we haven't really fixed many streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1833.861s">And</a>  when you're seeing projects like tonight that are coming up, we're gonna see some more movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1839.946s">We're</a>  gonna see some more, we're gonna see greater projects and we're gonna see the earth being moved in a greater capacity, which means <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1849.572s">more</a>  of that rat infestation moving from, you know, from one area to the rest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1857.136s">So,</a>  you know, we do have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1859.937s">I</a>  know that the resident that contacted me, that the Board of Health moved to support that neighborhood, but once we heard that, <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1872.96s">the</a>  feedback I got was this isn't just in one neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1876.641s">This</a>  neighborhood was in the Heights, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1878.981s">But</a>  then I got phone calls when I put this resolution up, I had phone calls with, I had phone calls South Medford, I had phone calls West Medford, the Hillside, I had phone calls in the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1893.704s">So</a>  it was, it really stirred the nest, to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1899.745s">So</a>  I think we really need to, <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1902.187s">really</a>  be proactive right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1903.991s">I</a>  mean, when you're talking about the summer, in a few months, <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1910.989s">rodents</a>  are going to leave the exterior of our neighborhoods and now try to find homes and businesses to infiltrate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1922.239s">So</a>  I think if we can, I know that we put it out there, I would make a motion that we have a meeting with the Board of Health and any other department that needs to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1934.671s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1936.312s">you</a>  know, whether it's DPW or code enforcement that we bring all the parties together to try to find a way to put a program in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1950.197s">Again,</a>  I'm not gonna, I know neighboring communities, I've talked to neighboring communities and they've had remediation plans that don't, that go, they're pretty deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1962.081s">It</a>  doesn't look at just, <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1963.882s">you</a>  know, baiting catch basins and putting in traps, they're really looking with different entities to bring in to help us stop the reproduction of the rats in their nests. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1977.492s">So</a>  again, I know it was a little winded, but I think this is serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1983.757s">This</a>  is something that it's coming up a lot and we don't hear any solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1990.802s">So</a>  I would make the motion that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=1993.663s">contact</a>  the board of health, the code enforcement, the DPW department, and someone from the mayor's office for communications to try to find a way that we send out a detailed plan and try to at least get the information that's needed to help this process along. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2010.624s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2094.482s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2095.183s">Um,</a>  thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for putting forward this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2099.867s">Um,</a>  I am sure we've all heard a lot about the rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2102.71s">I</a>  know I've been bringing up the rats a lot in the last few last few months as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2106.934s">Um,</a>  I, I think it'd be a great idea to meet with the BOH and with the director of the health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2115.96s">Particularly</a>  because a few months ago we had heard during the budget committee of the holes were director O'Connor came up to us, she detailed some of her plans <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2127.587s">what</a>  the department's currently working on and what they would like to get in place but haven't gotten in place yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2133.273s">And</a>  so I think Councilor Scarpelli alluded to this, but we do have a contract with Yankee Pest who will come in and treat burrows and nests on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2145.165s">They'll</a>  come in once for inspection and a second time to treat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2151.158s">Director</a>  O'Connor also mentioned that they're looking at doing what Malden and Somerville are doing with regards to catching and killing rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2164.146s">The</a>  rat trap boxes that they have in Malden and Somerville, she said that that was maybe an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2170.07s">I</a>  don't think we have that in that for right now, so it'd be great to get progress on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2174.453s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2176.233s">It</a>  would be good just to go in depth about rat treatment and infestation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2181.277s">And</a>  with regards to the trash program, I think residents might have concerns, but we do have numbers with regards to which types of cans and bins are being eaten into. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2192.987s">And</a>  ones with locks are just much stronger than ones without. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2197.03s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2198.391s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2198.771s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2200.804s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2201.124s">I</a>  think that Councilor Tseng covered most of what I was going to say relating to locking bins being actually shown to be a really secure way to rat proof containers, just you know, I think it's a common misconception that composting can increase <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2216.642s">rat</a>  problems, I think that's actually not necessarily the case, which is great for the city on a lot of fronts because of those locking containers can actually keep rats out better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2223.443s">I</a>  think that the bigger picture that we're all really concerned about, we all hear about all the time is that everybody's seeing rats everywhere all the time, and it's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2232.005s">And</a>  this is something that we need to start being proactive about so that we don't have to resort to those rat extermination measures that I think nobody wants to use that are also a threat to other beloved parts of our ecosystem, like the bald eagles along the Mr. River watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2246.248s">You</a>  know, I think this is something that comes up a lot on the city council this is, you know, to really attack this in a proactive way takes money that we don't currently have in our operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2256.872s">I</a>  think it would be great if we can align with our department heads and make sure that we're doing everything that we can be doing with our current resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2263.914s">And</a>  we need to be pushing for that future operational budget so that we can have, you know, I think Councilor Scarpelli makes a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2270.896s">We</a>  need to have a standing working committee, working group, whatever that looks like, so that we're really addressing this problem and not letting it continue to boil over. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2278.898s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2281.665s">And</a>  another quick point I think should be made, and this might be beating a dead drum, but there are good ideas out there that are being tested and implemented, even in municipalities around us, like Councilor Scarpelli said. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2294.349s">A</a>  lot of it just requires money and resources, and we need to figure out how we're gonna fund all these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2302.652s">You</a>  know, that's the perennial challenge of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2306.334s">We</a>  have a lot facing us in the next budget season, and we need a concrete plan to do that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2311.432s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2317.954s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2319.354s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2320.134s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2320.914s">The</a>  gentleman from Domino's is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2323.655s">I'll</a>  mention that if anyone wants to do anything.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2389.666s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2392.447s">As</a>  I'm going through the, everything looks good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2395.508s">I</a>  think that, what are your hours of operations? <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2399.63s">We're</a>  keeping the same operation hours as current. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2406.01s">I</a>  think that that's my question, my fellow councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2408.352s">I</a>  believe that when we allow a special permit for extended hours, it goes, is it, do we see any restrictions with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2417.318s">I,</a>  cause I don't.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2418.759s">Your</a>  requested hours here is from seven to 11, so.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2421.641s">Right,</a>  so seven o'clock to 11 o'clock, is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2424.864s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2426.265s">Right,</a>  so that's the issue, cause we allow a certain, <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2433.905s">hourly</a>  certain hours and then to go to the two o'clock request at 1030 to 10am 1030am to two you have it stretched off and the requested hours that asked you have to come back for a special permit for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2449.35s">So,</a>  as we approve this, the hours have to change so 11 o'clock until the special permit is heard is on the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2459.648s">It</a>  says requested hours 10 30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2461.929s">And</a>  then it's crossed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2463.83s">You</a>  had two a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2465.451s">And</a>  then below it is seven a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2467.492s">to</a>  11.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2472.254s">Okay,</a>  that that wasn't as our operation over 10 30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2477.217s">to</a>  one in the morning and then Friday and Saturday on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2482.54s">We</a>  close at two in the morning.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2485.081s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2485.701s">What</a>  I'm telling you, you can't do that until <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2489.893s">The</a>  permit that's requested in front of us is a request from 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2493.737s">to</a>  11. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2494.958s">To</a>  extend those hours, you have to come in front of us with a special permit for extended hours use. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2503.586s">By</a>  changing over, the ownership changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2507.65s">The</a>  vote that was taken in the past is dismissed, and now it starts again.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2515.276s">I</a>  see, and I would just have to go on the website to request a special permit or how would I go about getting this special permit for the extended hours?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2525.479s">You</a>  can call the clerk's office and they can help with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2527.359s">So</a>  we can vote tonight.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2529.48s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2530.12s">You</a>  know, till 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2531.38s">You</a>  just need to then request to get those extended hours.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2534.121s">Right,</a>  if we could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2535.041s">We</a>  don't wanna hurt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2535.841s">We</a>  just wanna make sure this is, you get everything you need in place so there isn't an issue later.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2542.104s">because</a>  I appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2544.605s">I</a>  would move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2545.485s">I</a>  would move forward with the petitions request right now in favor and the petitioner contact the clerk in the morning for the extended hours.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2557.027s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2560.788s">Excuse</a>  me, sir.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2565.249s">Yeah,</a>  we have a question from one of the Councilors if you can hear him.</p>
