20
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,019

22

As this is a public hearing, I do need to open it up.

So we'll open the public hearing, but then we do have a request to continue the public hearing, crisis and barriers.

51
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:30,413
We do have a, we have attorney Silverstein here as well as director hot who's going to give us an update on what's before us.

52
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:47,430
As a reminder, this is the proposed plan development district which is something that came to be in the zoning required application that was passed last March, just ago, last March, last March, March 23 to, sorry, it's all blurring together.

53
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:51,691
And this is, I believe this is the first one to come before us at this stage.

54
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:58,077
So I'm gonna hand it over to Director Hunt first, just to tell us a little bit more about the project and the process before us.

55
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,059
Thank you, Madam President.

56
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:04,803
Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability for the City of Medford.

57
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:10,028
The city retained Attorney Silverstein on this matter.

58
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:14,812
And actually, I would like to have him introduce sort of the whole process here.

59
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:25,430
where we are in this process and what are the next steps so that you have the framing and the applicant for this is available on Zoom and is prepared to share some information as well.

60
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,716
Thank you so much, Madam President, members of the Council.

61
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:33,098
My name is Jonathan Silverstein.

62
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:36,982
I am special counsel, as Director Hunt indicated on this matter.

63
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:48,996
I've been working with planning staff and the applicant for several months on the zoning amendment that is before you tonight for public hearing.

64
00:05:49,536 --> 00:06:00,526
It's undergone a number of changes, been a very cooperative process, just to remind the council process-wise how we got here and what comes next.

65
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:01,827
Under the

66
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:09,630
zoning recodification and the new PDD zoning provision in section 9.2.

67
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:29,542
The process began with an application from the proposed developer that was vetted in great detail by planning staff and ultimately came before the community development board for a public hearing.

68
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:33,168
before it ever came to this body.

69
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:58,693
That public hearing took place in April, and as a result of that public hearing, there was a draft amendment, zoning amendment, that was presented to the council last month, I believe, or maybe, no, in June, for referral to the Community Development Board, because under state law, under the State Zoning Act, Chapter 48, Section 5,

70
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:08,336
A second public hearing was required at that point from the Community Development Board after the council referred it to that board.

71
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:12,559
The Community Development Board held its public hearing.

72
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:26,828
on August 2nd and unanimously voted to recommend that the council approve the amendment with the minor modifications that had been made since it was last before you.

73
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:35,015
I did on August 9 prepare a brief memorandum to the council just summarizing some of those changes.

74
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:35,996
They're really very minor.

75
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:42,760
and of a clarifying nature, nothing about the project as proposed has changed.

76
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:48,303
And so before you tonight is the proposed zoning amendment.

77
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:54,466
And I just want to emphasize what approval of the zoning amendment tonight would do.

78
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:55,887
It would not approve the project.

79
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:59,229
It would approve the zoning amendment.

80
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,970
It would create the first

81
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:14,460
plan development district in the city, and that would allow the applicant to submit a special permit application and a site plan review application to the council.

82
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,123
It would go through the normal process at that point, and the council would have all the discretion it normally would with respect to any special permit.

83
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:28,405
And there'll be, of course, a special permit public hearing

84
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:39,615
It would be at that public hearing that the details of the project and potential impacts of the project would be discussed, vetted by the council.

85
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:51,259
The council would have all of the typical ability to hire peer review consultants and obtain department head input and advice, impose any conditions that it felt appropriate.

86
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:54,020
So tonight is really just about the

87
00:08:55,217 --> 00:09:03,060
legislative framework creating the plane development district that would allow the applicant to follow through with that next step.

88
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:14,746
So with that procedural summary, I'm happy to walk the council through the amendment and answer any questions that counselors may have.

89
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:16,686
Thank you.

90
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:18,467
Are there any questions from counselors at this time?

91
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:21,426
Thank you, Attorney Silverstein.

92
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:25,688
And will we also be getting a presentation from the petitioner as well, or you'll be serving as that?

93
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:32,213
I believe that the applicant is on zoom and prepared to make a presentation.

94
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:32,773
OK, great.

95
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,935
So we'll hear from you first and then we'll go to them or.

96
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,992
Yeah, I think obviously, uh, it's up to the council.

97
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:39,653
What order?

98
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:48,119
But I think it would make sense if the council has no questions for me at that this time to give the applicant an opportunity to present.

99
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:51,561
And then, of course, I'll stay here for any questions you may have afterwards.

100
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:53,623
I do see Adam Barnosky.

101
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:57,546
All right.

102
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:00,288
Yes.

103
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,150
Thank you, Attorney Silverstein.

104
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:06,539
Good evening, Madam President, members of the City Council.

105
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,480
Can you hear me all right?

106
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:08,822
Yes.

107
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:10,023
Okay.

108
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:11,505
Thank you.

109
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:18,534
So I'm an attorney for 96-102 Winchester Street LLC, which is the property owner and post developer.

110
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:31,043
developer Nardone, Peter Quinn, the project architect, as well as my co-counsel, Michael Brown, all available today via Zoom.

111
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:37,327
As Attorney Silverstein mentioned, we are here relative to a new plan development district pursuant to section 9.2 of the zoning ordinance.

112
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:39,429
We're very excited about this proposal.

113
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:40,990
It has been a long time in development.

114
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:49,177
And with the PDD process being new to the city, we do appreciate all the efforts by all parties at the city to date.

115
00:10:50,097 --> 00:11:12,896
So I want to provide the council with an overview of the property and the proposed zoning and pursuant to the scope of the hearing and as mentioned by Attorney Silverstein, I will limit my presentation to the zoning components of the application, but we do have the ability to discuss any components of the underlying project if any members of the council are interested in hearing at this time.

116
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:17,580
As a way of a background, this PDD has been through extensive process.

117
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,801
and outreach with community development, including preliminary meetings.

118
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:27,982
We had a community outreach meeting and several public appearances before the Community Development Board.

119
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:32,663
And this application does come before you with unanimous support of that board.

120
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:35,203
So first about the property.

121
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:41,764
The proposed PDE site is located on the southern portion of Winchester Street, due east from the Ball Square T-stop.

122
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:45,545
The site consists of three lots measuring just under 50,000 square feet.

123
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:55,362
The two lots located at 96-102 Winchester Street are contiguous through lots with frontage on Winchester and Alfred Street.

124
00:11:56,343 --> 00:12:01,407
They've been used for many years as a mix of commercial space for offices, garage, and outdoor vehicle storage.

125
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:08,634
The lot located at 104 Winchester Street is a corner lot with frontage on Winchester and Albion Streets.

126
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:10,956
104 is improved with a two-story

127
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,689
for the pursuit of historical permission.

128
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:26,536
The site is located predominantly in the general residential zoning district with a small portion in the commercial C1 zoning district.

129
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:35,583
The team thought that this property would be an appropriate location for the PDE because of its size and its current use within the zoning district.

130
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:39,387
and its alignment with the city's recently adopted comprehensive plan.

131
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:51,075
It lends itself to a use that's more consistent with the residential nature of the neighborhood and in relation to the multifamily projects that have been developed in recent years in the surrounding area.

132
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:56,699
It is worth noting that the PDD was developed with specific uses and structure in mind, and as such,

133
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,081
the proposed zoning is specific to this PDD and to a specific project.

134
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:23,572
However, it's worth noting the process here as the council is aware that if this PDD is approved and adopted by this city council, we will then come back before both community development board and this city council to discuss all of the intricacies as far as the design of the building goes and the uses that are contained there.

135
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:31,979
So as tonight's hearing only relates to the approval of the PDD and not regarding any projects I wanted to get into into some of the zoning.

136
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,847
So you have a draft zoning amendment before you, which is listed in the proposed section 94 dash 9.

137
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,409
to a five of the zoning ordinance.

138
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,910
It details the proposed uses and the proposed dimensional requirements under the overlay.

139
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:52,411
We tailored the use table to be more in line with the intended uses for the property.

140
00:13:52,491 --> 00:14:00,173
It's crafted to be consistent with the surrounding area that is primarily residential with ancillary low impact commercial.

141
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:04,834
So that's the uses and the use table as you look through it is

142
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,342
and the uses contained are consistent with a multifamily dwelling.

143
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:33,130
Dimensionally, the dimensional elements are intended to blend the underlying district's requirements with certain modifications to accommodate the scale without disrupting the neighborhood and to allow room to modify in the event that there are certain requests that are made by boards later on during the special permit process.

144
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:51,252
As currently drafted, this PDD has proposed heights in line with recent developments in the area along Broadway, setbacks similar to existing conditions at neighboring properties, below-grade parking in excess of underlying requirements, and reasonable open space and lot coverage requirements for the area.

145
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:56,013
In a broader context, the proposed PDD is intended to create

146
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,223
between the zoning district along Broadway into the GR zoning district of the subject.

147
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:12,547
But as I mentioned, while the project is primarily located in the GR, it abuts and is partially located in the C1.

148
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:24,300
As this Council is aware, the commercial district along Broadway is now becoming even more typified by mixed-use development, multifamily development, and a continuation of commercial uses.

149
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:35,772
So, the site and the PDD, we believe, fit within the broader transition of the area and of the city, particularly in relation to the district's proximity to the GLX and Ball Square stations.

150
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:46,232
So, we're happy to walk through any particular part of the zoning ordinance or answer any questions that the board may have.

151
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:53,838
And as I mentioned before, we do have the design team ownership, my co counsel on the line to answer any questions you might have.

152
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:54,559
Thank you.

153
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,962
Thank you.

154
00:15:58,022 --> 00:15:58,743
Thank you counselor.

155
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,597
You made a great presentation for the city of Somerville.

156
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,280
You said Broadway five times.

157
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:18,172
And this is what we've been talking about here in Medford, with the lack of the movement with our zoning.

158
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,792
consultant to look at what Medford wants to do.

159
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:43,220
And so I just think that you said some things with the neighborhood, but I know the neighborhood on the Medford side has a real problem with this area right now because of some fears and because of lack of true understanding where we're going in our community.

160
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,822
The spot development, we're seeing that happen all over the city.

161
00:16:47,829 --> 00:17:03,132
But these are the issues that I find being a problem when the council for the projects has mentioned how it appeals to Broadway, which isn't Medford.

162
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:08,634
So I tend to be a little leery, that's all.

163
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:09,334
Thank you.

164
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:10,634
Thank you, Councilor Fevella.

165
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:13,535
Any other questions from our councilors at this time?

166
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,572
Seeing none, as this is a public, or Attorney Solicitor, did you wanna come up and add anything else about the process?

167
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:25,075
Or I was gonna open the public hearing and go from there.

168
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:26,756
Not at this time, Madam President.

169
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:27,497
Thank you.

170
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,119
Okay, as this is a public hearing, I do need to open it up.

171
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,101
So we'll open up the public hearing.

172
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,764
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper?

173
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:41,009
I assume folks who are petitioners for this project would wanna speak in favor, either on Zoom or in person.

174
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,631
If you're on Zoom, please raise your hand

175
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:47,709
flag me down, I'd like to speak in favor of this paper.

176
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:58,993
Attorney Barnard-Scaston, is there at least one person who wants to speak in favor of this, or you are in favor of this paper?

177
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:05,955
Yeah, I'm sorry, was that a question for me, Madam President?

178
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:09,536
I'm just asking for anyone to speak in favor, and generally the petitioner is...

179
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:14,545
is in favor of the paper, so it's the procedural way of the public hearing.

180
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:15,745
Yes, thank you.

181
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:16,965
Thank you.

182
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:22,686
Is there anyone else on the call who would like to speak in favor of this paper before us, or anyone in person?

183
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:30,028
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

184
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:36,189
Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the paper before us, either in person or on Zoom?

185
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:46,657
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

186
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:51,003
Do we have any further discussion from the council or a motion?

187
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:57,433
Motion to waive the six day public comment period and approve.

188
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:05,199
of emotion, price and affairs to waive the six day public comment period and approve councilor Scarpelli.

189
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:17,981
I would really, again, when you're talking about a project like this and what it affects and when we're doing it, where we're not having meetings, I think that's a slippery slope again, councilor.

190
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,142
I would recommend that you wouldn't do that.

191
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:21,122
I withdraw the motion.

192
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:24,623
I would move to approve pending the six day public comment period.

193
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,203
My apologies, I read it wrong.

194
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:33,893
So we have a motion from Vice President Behrs to approve pending the six day public comment period seconded by Councilor Collins.

195
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:35,915
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

196
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:04,849
Yes.

197
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:11,334
Yes, five in the affirmative one in the negative one absent the papers approved pending the six day public comment period.

198
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:26,645
Going to 23 dash petitions presentations and similar papers 23 dash 332 City Council President Nicole Merlin on board members of the Medford City Council from the Office of Planning Development Sustainability regarding the proposed plan development district

199
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:34,191
two ordinance amendment for 253 Mystic Avenue, Medford-Mass 02155, parcel map T-10-70B.

200
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:53,744
For the procedures outlined in section 94-9.2 PDD of the Medford zoning ordinance, the applicant 243 Mystic Ave LLC submitted a proposed amendment PDD for the site located at 243 Mystic Ave, Medford-Mass 02155, assessor's map T-10-70B as shown on the locus map PDD2.

201
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:57,989
The property is located in a commercial 2C2 zoning district.

202
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:05,755
The applicant proposes zoning to align with prospective project, which would include an eight-story structure with life science lab and office uses.

203
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:13,241
The Community Development Board has held a public hearing on August 2nd, 2023, notice in accordance with MGL Chapter 40A, Section 11.

204
00:21:13,621 --> 00:21:19,266
Though not required, a courtesy notice was sent out to abutters within 400 feet of the site in accordance with MGL Chapter 44, Section 53G,

205
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:32,491
and the Community Development Board rule regarding consultant fees, the City retained legal counsel, Attorney Gareth Orsmond of Pierce Atwood LLC, to prepare the text of the amendment and provide associated legal support to staff and the board.

206
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:44,442
As the Community Development Board voted unanimously to submit the proposed zoning amendment per Medford Zoning Ordinance Section 94-9.2.3.2 to the City Council to initiate the statutory requirements for amending zoning.

207
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:52,283
per MGL chapter 48, section five, the zoning amendment now must be referred from city council to the community development board, who will hold a duly noticed public hearing.

208
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:59,388
The city council will hold a subsequent public hearing for this amendment after a report with recommendations by the community development board has been submitted to the council.

209
00:21:59,748 --> 00:22:03,351
We thank you for your view of this matter and are happy to provide additional information.

210
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:09,996
As this came from the office of planning and sustainability, I will go to director Hunt for any additional information.

211
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:12,178
Madam president, thank you.

212
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:19,572
I would just sort of iterate, this is actually the same process that was just explained to you by Attorney Silverstein.

213
00:22:19,632 --> 00:22:21,453
We're just earlier in the process here.

214
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,375
So this development came to us.

215
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:27,217
They were in front of the CD board.

216
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:30,399
In this case, we hired a different attorney to work with them.

217
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:37,384
So Attorney Gareth Osmond of Pierce Atwood is, Osmond, sorry, is the attorney of record.

218
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:40,366
Unfortunately, he couldn't be, he's not available this evening.

219
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:45,698
but we did not want to make the applicant wait several more weeks for this step in the process.

220
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:51,703
So he has been working with them, the applicant and the CD board to draft a zoning.

221
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:57,607
This is the step where there is a required legal referral from this council to the CD board.

222
00:22:58,147 --> 00:23:02,691
The CD board will then hold a hearing and then it will come back in front of this council for review.

223
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:08,655
But this step this evening is the earlier step where the city council must refer it to the CD board.

224
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,041
So I'm available and actually I will let you know that the applicant is here this evening in the chambers.

225
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:21,984
We're not planning to have them present the project, but if there were any clarifying questions or anything, they are available this evening.

226
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:22,864
Thank you.

227
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,705
Any questions from councilors discussion at this time?

228
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:39,503
Just, you know, I'm happy to just motion to refer this community development board but I do, given that they did come in person if they want to say anything I want to give them a chance to say something before we move on.

229
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,627
If you don't have to, you don't have to, I just don't want.

230
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:49,030
Don't want you to feel like we rushed you out of the room.

231
00:23:49,437 --> 00:23:51,078
And just name and address for the record, please.

232
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,079
Yes, Madam Chair.

233
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,701
Attorney Jim Heffernan at Rich May.

234
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,823
I'm an attorney for the applicant, Varen Bio.

235
00:23:57,143 --> 00:23:59,005
And just thank you for hearing this.

236
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:03,569
Like you heard before, we're kind of two steps behind.

237
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:07,572
So we'll be seeing you again at least two more times at public hearings.

238
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:12,556
So look forward to presenting it in further detail.

239
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:14,078
And thank you for hearing us tonight.

240
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:15,659
Great, thank you.

241
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:18,475
Thank you, I'd move to refer to Community Development.

242
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:18,835
Second.

243
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:23,219
On the motion of Vice Mayor Behrs to refer to Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Sang.

244
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:24,020
All those in favor?

245
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,440
Aye.

246
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:26,662
Oh, it's a roll call.

247
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:29,445
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

248
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:31,307
Mr. President.

249
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:32,087
Yes.

250
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,368
Councilor Kerrio.

251
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:33,709
Yes.

252
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:34,770
Councilor Collins.

253
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,030
Yes.

254
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:35,791
Councilor Ntuk.

255
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:36,071
Yes.

256
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:37,552
Councilor Scarpella.

257
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:38,193
Yes.

258
00:24:38,753 --> 00:24:39,234
Councilor Sang.

259
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:39,454
Yes.

260
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:44,508
Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

261
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:53,489
23-384, petition for common bichelor's license by Misioner R. Joel for Mystic Market, 199 Mystic Avenue, Medford, Mass, 02155.

262
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,510
Do we have the petitioner either?

263
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,090
Great.

264
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:03,831
If you wanna come up and just tell us a little bit about what you're looking for here.

265
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:07,031
Good evening.

266
00:25:08,532 --> 00:25:09,512
I'm new to this process.

267
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:15,237
Sure, if you want to just talk a little bit about the business, and then we'll take it from there.

268
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:19,259
I'm taking over from the person who owns now.

269
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,400
I'll be running as it is.

270
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,021
What is it?

271
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:25,281
It's a convenience store.

272
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:27,182
So you're taking over the boils?

273
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:27,722
Yes.

274
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:28,382
OK.

275
00:25:29,423 --> 00:25:32,184
So Madam President, I see everything in place.

276
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,525
Before I open up, there is one question.

277
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:37,066
You were applying for workman's comp.

278
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:37,786
Is that completed?

279
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:39,747
Sorry?

280
00:25:40,194 --> 00:25:44,336
It says that you were going to apply for your insurance.

281
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,376
Yes, I did.

282
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:47,697
You have that?

283
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:50,538
Yes.

284
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,160
Madam President to the clerk, if the gentleman could just forward you that.

285
00:25:56,081 --> 00:26:02,023
So I would move in favor, as long as you have that document in hand tomorrow.

286
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:10,775
I don't want to hold it up, but if we can do that, if you said you have it, just send a copy, then my recommendation would be to move and approve.

287
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:17,121
And as long as the clerk has that tomorrow.

288
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:17,962
Is that okay?

289
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:18,202
Sure.

290
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:18,722
All right.

291
00:26:18,802 --> 00:26:19,523
Thank you, Madam President.

292
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:19,803
Thank you.

293
00:26:20,264 --> 00:26:22,186
Any other questions, discussion from the council?

294
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:26,370
So the motion from Councilor Scarpelli is to approve pending receiving the

295
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:33,665
was just tomorrow, right, seconded by Carvello all those in favor.

296
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:35,365
All those opposed.

297
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:36,526
The motion passes.

298
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:38,627
Yeah, that was good.

299
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:52,494
Good luck to three dash three or five petition for common mixers licensed by Christopher Baum and Fernando Cruz for T pizza doing business as dominoes 199 C mystic of masco 2155.

300
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:53,534
Do we have the petitioner.

301
00:26:58,731 --> 00:27:02,232
or may have been the gentleman before.

302
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:15,915
Is anyone here on Zoom representing Domino's?

303
00:27:27,577 --> 00:27:41,286
Next week, we will motion from cancer Carviello to table this paper second by second, I was in favor of the codes which passes, and if that person if you are from dominoes, you end up doing the call you are in the call you stepped away.

304
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:44,465
flag is down tonight.

305
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,349
motions orders and resolutions.

306
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:51,752
Madam President, can we just dismiss 23 dash 386 please.

307
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,131
Okay, going on to 23-37 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

308
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:08,895
Be it resolved that the City Council invite the Director of the Health Department to discuss ongoing concerns of rat infestation around the city.

309
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:10,115
Councilor Scarpelli.

310
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,076
Thank you, Madam President.

311
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:15,598
I'm sure that everybody's heard and everybody's, it's not just in Medford.

312
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:22,822
This is a pretty severe issue, all over the Commonwealth.

313
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:23,542
I mean, you're hearing

314
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:35,236
you're hearing that now that you're seeing this rat infestation, not just in where they traditionally would find them, you know, close to restaurants or close to water.

315
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:43,520
Now you're finding them in areas like the Heights where most of the homes there are ledge.

316
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,522
And so it's starting to become even more disturbing.

317
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:54,145
So I know that the Board of Health is super busy, but I think we need to find

318
00:28:55,266 --> 00:29:03,696
Um, an avenue where we're putting together a serious team that's devoted to this issue right now.

319
00:29:03,796 --> 00:29:06,119
I think that's what we're seeing right now.

320
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:09,183
Um, residents contacting us.

321
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:13,329
And then I know that the Board of Health is responding

322
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:32,031
piece mail, I know that something was sent out, and it was forwarded by one of the residents, one of the residents that reached out to me, and who requested this resolution be brought up that now the what we've been talking about for a while is having the possibility of

323
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:41,657
The Board of Health, as long as the homeowner is willing to allow them on their property, they're willing to do some abatement on private property.

324
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:43,398
In the past, that's been an issue.

325
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:57,347
I know this council moved forward to try to find a solution where we have the Board of Health work together with residents because one of the questions back maybe two years ago was that you could see the nest

326
00:29:58,386 --> 00:30:08,153
but unfortunately the exterminating company couldn't go one foot to that nest that had the issue because it was on private property.

327
00:30:08,253 --> 00:30:17,939
So I think we need to do a better job communicating with not just people that are complaining, but I think the community as a whole.

328
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,341
And then really look at some sort of a plan.

329
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:21,822
I know that,

330
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:26,636
Everybody's saying that, well, some of it's development, the movement of the streets.

331
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:33,521
Here's the thing, we haven't done much development and we haven't really fixed many streets and sidewalks.

332
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:39,886
And when you're seeing projects like tonight that are coming up, we're gonna see some more movement.

333
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:48,431
We're gonna see some more, we're gonna see greater projects and we're gonna see the earth being moved in a greater capacity, which means

334
00:30:49,572 --> 00:30:57,056
more of that rat infestation moving from, you know, from one area to the rest of the community.

335
00:30:57,136 --> 00:30:59,777
So, you know, we do have a problem.

336
00:30:59,937 --> 00:31:12,563
I know that the resident that contacted me, that the Board of Health moved to support that neighborhood, but once we heard that,

337
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,801
the feedback I got was this isn't just in one neighborhood.

338
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,421
This neighborhood was in the Heights, by the way.

339
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:33,624
But then I got phone calls when I put this resolution up, I had phone calls with, I had phone calls South Medford, I had phone calls West Medford, the Hillside, I had phone calls in the Wellington area.

340
00:31:33,704 --> 00:31:39,685
So it was, it really stirred the nest, to say the least.

341
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:41,245
So I think we really need to,

342
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:43,751
really be proactive right now.

343
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:48,583
I mean, when you're talking about the summer, in a few months,

344
00:31:50,989 --> 00:32:02,179
rodents are going to leave the exterior of our neighborhoods and now try to find homes and businesses to infiltrate.

345
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:14,590
So I think if we can, I know that we put it out there, I would make a motion that we have a meeting with the Board of Health and any other department that needs to be involved.

346
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:15,171
I think that

347
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:27,956
you know, whether it's DPW or code enforcement that we bring all the parties together to try to find a way to put a program in place.

348
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:42,021
Again, I'm not gonna, I know neighboring communities, I've talked to neighboring communities and they've had remediation plans that don't, that go, they're pretty deep.

349
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:43,342
It doesn't look at just,

350
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:57,472
you know, baiting catch basins and putting in traps, they're really looking with different entities to bring in to help us stop the reproduction of the rats in their nests.

351
00:32:57,492 --> 00:33:03,657
So again, I know it was a little winded, but I think this is serious.

352
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:09,982
This is something that it's coming up a lot and we don't hear any solutions.

353
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:12,624
So I would make the motion that we,

354
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:30,604
contact the board of health, the code enforcement, the DPW department, and someone from the mayor's office for communications to try to find a way that we send out a detailed plan and try to at least get the information that's needed to help this process along.

355
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,085
So thank you.

356
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:32,773
Thank you.

357
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:33,093
Thank you.

358
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:33,573
Thank you.

359
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:33,894
Thank you.

360
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:34,414
Thank you.

361
00:33:34,434 --> 00:33:34,654
Thank you.

362
00:33:34,674 --> 00:33:34,935
Thank you.

363
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:35,675
Thank you.

364
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:36,276
Thank you.

365
00:33:36,396 --> 00:33:36,937
Thank you.

366
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:37,317
Thank you.

367
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:37,777
Thank you.

368
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:38,318
Thank you.

369
00:33:38,338 --> 00:33:38,658
Thank you.

370
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:39,939
Thank you.

371
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:40,780
Thank you.

372
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,081
Thank you.

373
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:41,381
Thank you.

374
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:41,781
Thank you.

375
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:42,061
Thank you.

376
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:42,482
Thank you.

377
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:42,882
Thank you.

378
00:33:43,002 --> 00:33:44,524
Thank you.

379
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:44,804
Thank you.

380
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:45,044
Thank you.

381
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:45,405
Thank you.

382
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:45,745
Thank you.

383
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:46,005
Thank you.

384
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:46,306
Thank you.

385
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:46,566
Thank you.

386
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:47,126
Thank you.

387
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:47,387
Thank you.

388
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,589
Again, I think we need to do a lot better.

389
00:33:57,629 --> 00:34:02,612
We should be doing a lot better on trying to get rid of this rat devastation.

390
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:08,915
Because like I said, pretty soon your projects are going to be starting around and the earth's going to get moved again.

391
00:34:09,636 --> 00:34:12,357
And the rat's going to keep coming out.

392
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:17,500
And these are in all neighborhoods with its homes and residents.

393
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:21,263
And I'm a little hesitant about the garbage thing.

394
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:35,240
on the composting of the new plan there, I'm hearing a lot of feedback from residents that they're a little concerned that we're separating the food for the rats.

395
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:51,291
So I think before we get into that, I think we need to have a little more discussion with the composting program too, to see how that's gonna work and how that's worked in other communities with rat infestation.

396
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:52,852
Thank you.

397
00:34:54,482 --> 00:34:54,883
Thank you.

398
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:59,147
Um, thank you, Councillor Scarpelli for putting forward this resolution.

399
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,630
Um, I am sure we've all heard a lot about the rats.

400
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,213
I know I've been bringing up the rats a lot in the last few last few months as well.

401
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:13,940
Um, I, I think it'd be a great idea to meet with the BOH and with the director of the health department.

402
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:26,993
Particularly because a few months ago we had heard during the budget committee of the holes were director O'Connor came up to us, she detailed some of her plans

403
00:35:27,587 --> 00:35:33,133
what the department's currently working on and what they would like to get in place but haven't gotten in place yet.

404
00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:44,665
And so I think Councilor Scarpelli alluded to this, but we do have a contract with Yankee Pest who will come in and treat burrows and nests on private property.

405
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:48,488
They'll come in once for inspection and a second time to treat.

406
00:35:51,158 --> 00:36:02,505
Director O'Connor also mentioned that they're looking at doing what Malden and Somerville are doing with regards to catching and killing rats.

407
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:09,110
The rat trap boxes that they have in Malden and Somerville, she said that that was maybe an option.

408
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:14,133
I don't think we have that in that for right now, so it'd be great to get progress on that.

409
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:15,014
I think that

410
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:20,637
It would be good just to go in depth about rat treatment and infestation.

411
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:32,666
And with regards to the trash program, I think residents might have concerns, but we do have numbers with regards to which types of cans and bins are being eaten into.

412
00:36:32,987 --> 00:36:37,010
And ones with locks are just much stronger than ones without.

413
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,911
Thanks.

414
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:38,731
Thank you.

415
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:39,332
Councilor Collins.

416
00:36:40,804 --> 00:36:41,084
Thank you.

417
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:55,637
I think that Councilor Sang covered most of what I was going to say relating to locking bins being actually shown to be a really secure way to rat proof containers, just you know, I think it's a common misconception that composting can increase

418
00:36:56,642 --> 00:37:03,103
rat problems, I think that's actually not necessarily the case, which is great for the city on a lot of fronts because of those locking containers can actually keep rats out better.

419
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:10,224
I think that the bigger picture that we're all really concerned about, we all hear about all the time is that everybody's seeing rats everywhere all the time, and it's a problem.

420
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:25,127
And this is something that we need to start being proactive about so that we don't have to resort to those rat extermination measures that I think nobody wants to use that are also a threat to other beloved parts of our ecosystem, like the bald eagles along the Mr. River watershed.

421
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:34,854
You know, I think this is something that comes up a lot on the city council this is, you know, to really attack this in a proactive way takes money that we don't currently have in our operating budget.

422
00:37:36,872 --> 00:37:42,514
I think it would be great if we can align with our department heads and make sure that we're doing everything that we can be doing with our current resources.

423
00:37:43,914 --> 00:37:50,876
And we need to be pushing for that future operational budget so that we can have, you know, I think Councillor Scarpelli makes a great point.

424
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:58,718
We need to have a standing working committee, working group, whatever that looks like, so that we're really addressing this problem and not letting it continue to boil over.

425
00:37:58,898 --> 00:37:59,118
Thank you.

426
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:13,549
And another quick point I think should be made, and this might be beating a dead drum, but there are good ideas out there that are being tested and implemented, even in municipalities around us, like Councilor Scarpelli said.

427
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:21,252
A lot of it just requires money and resources, and we need to figure out how we're gonna fund all these programs.

428
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:25,573
You know, that's the perennial challenge of our city.

429
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:30,095
We have a lot facing us in the next budget season, and we need a concrete plan to do that.

430
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:37,894
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

431
00:38:37,954 --> 00:38:38,574
All those in favor?

432
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:40,094
All those opposed?

433
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:40,814
Motion passes.

434
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:43,575
The gentleman from Domino's is on the call.

435
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,576
I'll mention that if anyone wants to do anything.

436
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:47,896
Councilor Scarpelli.

437
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:49,396
Sure.

438
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:57,538
So a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to take 23-385 off the table.

439
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,151
Second by Councilor Cabrillo.

440
00:39:01,692 --> 00:39:02,592
All those in favor?

441
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,314
Opposed?

442
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:04,754
Passes.

443
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:10,960
So we'll go back to 23205 petition for a common pitchers license by Christopher Baum and Fernando Cruz for T.E.

444
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,464
Pizza doing good says Domino's 199C Mystic Ave, Medford, Mass.

445
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:17,607
I will turn over to you on Zoom.

446
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:23,052
If you could just give a name and address and just a brief history of what the business is.

447
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:28,487
Hello everyone, I'm sorry, I have some technical issues.

448
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:29,968
My name is Berenice Silva.

449
00:39:30,188 --> 00:39:35,932
I'm here representing Domino's, D-E-P-I-T-O, D-B-A, Domino's.

450
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:40,295
We are located at 199C Mystic Avenue in Medford.

451
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:44,718
My current office is 77 Mammoth Road in Lowell, Massachusetts.

452
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:46,304
Thank you.

453
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,606
I will go to Councilor Scarpelli, Chair of the License Committee.

454
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:51,867
Thank you for being here.

455
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:55,448
As I'm going through the, everything looks good.

456
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:57,849
I think that, what are your hours of operations?

457
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,632
We're keeping the same operation hours as current.

458
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,312
I think that that's my question, my fellow councilors.

459
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:16,618
I believe that when we allow a special permit for extended hours, it goes, is it, do we see any restrictions with that?

460
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:18,099
I, cause I don't.

461
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:21,261
Your requested hours here is from seven to 11, so.

462
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:23,963
Right, so seven o'clock to 11 o'clock, is that?

463
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:25,064
No.

464
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:32,709
Right, so that's the issue, cause we allow a certain,

465
00:40:33,905 --> 00:40:47,929
hourly certain hours and then to go to the two o'clock request at 1030 to 10am 1030am to two you have it stretched off and the requested hours that asked you have to come back for a special permit for that.

466
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:58,793
So, as we approve this, the hours have to change so 11 o'clock until the special permit is heard is on the petition.

467
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,909
It says requested hours 10 30 a.m.

468
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,810
And then it's crossed out.

469
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,431
You had two a.m.

470
00:41:05,451 --> 00:41:07,452
And then below it is seven a.m.

471
00:41:07,492 --> 00:41:07,612
to 11.

472
00:41:12,254 --> 00:41:17,137
Okay, that that wasn't as our operation over 10 30 a.m.

473
00:41:17,217 --> 00:41:21,999
to one in the morning and then Friday and Saturday on the weekends.

474
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,860
We close at two in the morning.

475
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:25,301
Right.

476
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:29,183
What I'm telling you, you can't do that until

477
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:33,697
The permit that's requested in front of us is a request from 7 a.m.

478
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:33,857
to 11.

479
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:43,486
To extend those hours, you have to come in front of us with a special permit for extended hours use.

480
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:46,508
By changing over, the ownership changes.

481
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:53,195
The vote that was taken in the past is dismissed, and now it starts again.

482
00:41:55,276 --> 00:42:04,438
I see, and I would just have to go on the website to request a special permit or how would I go about getting this special permit for the extended hours?

483
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,319
You can call the clerk's office and they can help with that.

484
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,160
So we can vote tonight.

485
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:09,720
Right.

486
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,920
You know, till 11.

487
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,041
You just need to then request to get those extended hours.

488
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:14,781
Right, if we could do that.

489
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:15,821
We don't wanna hurt you.

490
00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:21,383
We just wanna make sure this is, you get everything you need in place so there isn't an issue later.

491
00:42:22,104 --> 00:42:23,884
because I appreciate it.

492
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:25,465
I would move forward.

493
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:35,027
I would move forward with the petitions request right now in favor and the petitioner contact the clerk in the morning for the extended hours.

494
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:40,728
Thank you, Mr. President.

495
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,308
Excuse me, sir.

496
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:47,729
Yeah, we have a question from one of the counselors if you can hear him.

497
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,450
Hi, are you still there?

498
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,811
Yes, sir.

499
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:56,032
My question is, you know, I frequent that area a lot.

500
00:42:57,192 --> 00:43:02,335
What I do notice from from your drivers and from the day is a lot of a lot of litter in that parking lot.

501
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,456
And they're all dominoes receipts and things like that.

502
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:07,977
If you could stay on top of that and clean them up.

503
00:43:08,317 --> 00:43:11,318
It's not it's not fit to the other people in that in that strip.

504
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:15,500
That's clean up all the receipts and things that are left out there every night.

505
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,341
So when they come in in the morning, they're there.

506
00:43:17,941 --> 00:43:23,105
I appreciate if you would rub an eye at it and have your drivers not leave their stuff in the parking lot.

507
00:43:24,386 --> 00:43:24,706
Thank you.

508
00:43:24,806 --> 00:43:26,067
We'll be taking care of that.

509
00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:28,349
Thank you.

510
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:33,452
So we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve tonight with the regular hours.

511
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:34,573
So that would go to 11.

512
00:43:35,534 --> 00:43:39,097
And then you call the clerk's office and they can help you with the application for the special permit.

513
00:43:39,177 --> 00:43:42,339
So motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

514
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:43,460
All those in favor?

515
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:45,493
All those opposed, motion passes.

516
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:49,695
Again, this is approved for the 11 o'clock time and you can call the clerk tomorrow and he'll help you out with that.

517

Thank you.

518
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:51,936
I just have one more question.

519
00:43:51,956 --> 00:43:53,196
Sure.

520
00:43:53,977 --> 00:43:57,498

Thank you.

Great, thank you.

544
00:45:55,343 --> 00:46:05,030
If I can, were there any other clauses that aren't in this that any stipends or anything else that was added to this that we're not seeing?

545
00:46:07,571 --> 00:46:08,632
COVID money or?

546
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,994
Oh, sorry.

547
00:46:13,014 --> 00:46:14,715

549
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:24,119

00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,161
We'll do it in one $1,500 bucket.

551
00:46:29,022 --> 00:46:31,843
There were some longevity.

552
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:33,564
We didn't touch the longevity.

553
00:46:34,078 --> 00:46:42,061
There were a few stipends that I think we may have gone up $25 on, so I can get whatever figures you're looking for.

554
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:44,002
No, it's okay, I just, I trust you.

555
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:47,024
And then we have the retro, that's involved as well?

00:46:47,244 --> 00:46:48,704
Retro is also involved, correct.

557
00:46:49,245 --> 00:46:52,746
Madam President, I would waive any time restraints.

558
00:46:52,826 --> 00:47:00,429
I think these employees have waited long enough that we move forward and move this through as fast as we can.

559
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:01,770
So I move approval, thank you.

560
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:03,240
Okay.

562
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:53,505

563
00:47:55,986 --> 00:47:57,186
Yes.

564
00:47:57,226 --> 00:47:57,446
Yes.

565
00:47:58,846 --> 00:47:59,126
Yes.

566
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:03,367
Yes.

567
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:03,927

00:48:38,768 --> 00:48:38,988
Yes.

571
00:48:39,808 --> 00:48:42,029
Yes.

572
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:42,589
Yes.

573
00:48:43,409 --> 00:48:43,989
Yes.

574
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:44,889
Yes.

575
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:45,469
Yes.

576
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:49,370

577
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:51,611
Public participation.

00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:52,291
Thank you so much.

579
00:48:52,951 --> 00:48:53,771
Public participation.

580
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:57,472
Is there anyone here in person or on zoom would like to speak for public participation?

581
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:05,961
Seeing none, that is the end of our regular agenda, Vice President Ferris.

582
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:12,645
Madam President, motion to take paper 21-422 off the table and receive in place on file.

583
00:49:13,305 --> 00:49:19,389
On the motion, Vice President Ferris to take 21-422 off the table and receive in place on file.

584
00:49:19,729 --> 00:49:25,693
I can provide slightly more information if anyone wants it, which is that this was Citizens Bank in Haines Square.

585
00:49:25,753 --> 00:49:30,756
They came to us asking to do ADA upgrades and do it outside on the public sidewalk.

586
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:41,732
create a ramp on the public sidewalk, they did it inside in their own space, which I think is much better use of public space, and it is now accessible to get into that lobby from the internal thing.

587
00:49:41,852 --> 00:49:43,214
So, thank you.

588
00:49:43,634 --> 00:49:46,438
Much of my surveyors second right that's a real favorite.

589
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:54,069
All right, I suppose she passes on a motion of counselor Carla counselor Collins to adjourn.

590
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:57,634
Second by saying all those in favor.
