    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=124.947s">attorney</a>  Adam Dash, 48 Grove Street in Somerville with me are Jerry and Janet Alves back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=132.453s">We</a>  have been working on a draft agreement with staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=136.236s">I</a>  would note that the, I believe that the substance is pretty much all set and I'm gonna tell you what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=142.261s">I</a>  don't, from talking to staff just before tonight, I was told that it is not in final form. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=148.306s">So</a>  a little disappointing, but that is where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=150.608s">If</a>  staff are on on the call, they can probably weigh in on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=154.152s">I</a>  did want to note that I do want to at least explain it to you 1 last time, because I know a lot of you put a lot of time into this and been very gracious to have us here and won't be here going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=163.621s">So</a>  just give you 1 last opportunity on this that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=167.785s">The</a>  amendment was to allow the offices to seek to build three units on the property that would be subdivided into two lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=175.938s">Currently,</a>  the city has a deed restriction preventing any new units or any subdivisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=180.447s">Again,</a>  this amendment would not allow any further subdivision. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=183.409s">It</a>  would not allow any further units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=185.03s">It</a>  would just be one subdivision, three units, and the restriction would continue on in all of their forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=190.955s">The</a>  amendment does not mean that the office is gonna actually build anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=194.537s">It</a>  just allows them to go through the normal permitting process like everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=198.0s">There'll</a>  be public hearings and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=199.901s">And</a>  maybe they get the permits, maybe they don't, but they can't even do that unless the amendment and the restriction is amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=206.946s">In</a>  exchange for the restriction, the Alvarez's would pay an amount to the city in lieu of providing the affordable unit on site so the city could build affordable housing elsewhere so the Alvarez's disabled son and the sister-in-law themselves could live in the new units as they may not legally qualify or win the lottery to get the units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=225.558s">So</a>  the amount in payment in lieu, we did work talk to the city and it is in this agreement draft would be the difference between the fair market value of a three bedroom unit <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=235.023s">and</a>  the value of that unit as an 80% affordable, and that delta would be the payment, so that there's no profit from the unit going to the offices, and then that money would go to the city for building affordable housing elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=247.466s">That</a>  is not in contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=250.807s">So</a>  I suppose one thing one could do is, and I'm not pushing for anything, but if one wanted to, I suppose, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=257.791s">the</a>  council could vote to approve this pending this working out a deal working out the finality of the agreement with the staff or could kick it to January. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=267.543s">I</a>  sort of leave it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=268.863s">I</a>  would just like to, obviously, since you've all been involved in this, to explain it to a whole bunch of new people is not really what I would like to do, but we will, obviously, if that's your pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=277.546s">And</a>  I guess this just came up before pretty much I went to dinner and came over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=281.006s">So</a>  I don't really have a whole lot more to say other than that, but that's where we are with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=285.747s">I</a>  think the substance is pretty much done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=287.788s">The</a>  main detail I think outstanding is the timing of the payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=292.543s">is</a>  that the certificate of issuance of certificate of occupancy, they won't have any money because they won't have sold a unit to get the money to pay the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=299.771s">So</a>  certificate of occupancy doesn't really do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=302.274s">On</a>  the other hand, I understand the city's position, which is, if we if you wait till they sell the unit, what if they never sold a unit forever in the city would never get the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=310.042s">I</a>  get everyone gets each other's point here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=312.304s">And</a>  there's got to be a solution here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=313.726s">I</a>  can't <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=314.907s">today,</a>  this afternoon, tell you what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=317.548s">But</a>  that is if anyone has a bright idea, I'm happy to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=319.748s">But</a>  that is the situation that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=321.849s">And</a>  as far as I understand, that is, in my mind, the only thing that's left unless staff has another issue that I'm not picking up on.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=328.39s">Thank</a>  you, Attorney Dash. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=329.05s">We</a>  do have Director Hunt on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=330.991s">I</a>  just want to offer that perspective or any comments.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=337.5s">Thank</a>  you, madam president. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=340.446s">So,</a>  basically, we do think that there is a place here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=343.692s">We</a>  can come to an agreement where there would be a payment to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=348.187s">to</a>  the Affordable Housing Trust in lieu of actually creating an affordable unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=353.772s">We</a>  think that the logistics, everything of that would be easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=356.935s">We</a>  have not yet worked out exactly how much that payment would be, what the terms, at what point in the process that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=364.943s">In</a>  my mind, that is really important to <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=368.766s">approving</a>  this is that we have to have this fully worked out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=372.948s">He</a>  is correct that this doesn't permit anything to actually get built, but we can't condition any of the permitting pieces on this kind of a payment in lieu of an affordable housing unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=386.276s">It</a>  would be pretty significant, whereas we can condition the lifting of the waiver or lifting of the requirement for the restriction, sorry, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=397.262s">That</a>  is actually a very reasonable thing to condition the lifting of the restriction on a payment like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=404.932s">I</a>  will mention that senior planner Danielle Evans is waiting to get let in the Zoom room. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=410.979s">She's</a>  actually the one who's been working on this the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=415.08s">and</a>  has previous experience with things like this from other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=420.203s">I</a>  honestly don't see that there's very much to inform other Councilors on the new Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=425.625s">I</a>  think a lot of them are very familiar with this already. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=429.307s">And</a>  I would be more comfortable having the council vote once we have a fully negotiated agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=437.491s">I</a>  will point out that the agreement we're looking at has to have the mayor's signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=441.793s">And</a>  we have not yet had a chance to bring the mayor up to speed on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=446.537s">She</a>  was waiting to see what details we could work out before she sort of dug into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=451.721s">So</a>  she hasn't seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=452.922s">I</a>  did send her the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=455.184s">I</a>  should say I haven't heard back from her. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=457.987s">So</a>  I assume she hasn't yet had a chance to see it since I sent it to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=463.119s">So</a>  my preference would be for the council to table this and to vote with the new council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=468.442s">I</a>  think you'll have the same turnout, but we would actually have a fully written out documented agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=476.567s">We</a>  also have attorney Sharon Everett on the line who has been our <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=482.691s">attorney</a>  on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=483.471s">I</a>  don't know if she has anything additional to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=485.692s">So</a>  I certainly asked her about the portion that this is a public hearing and the members of the council will be turning over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=493.175s">But</a>  we do not need a public hearing in order to approve the changing of the restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=500.678s">It's</a>  just a simple majority vote of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=503.92s">So</a>  thanks.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=505.64s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=506.821s">Vice</a>  Mayor and Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=509.639s">I'd</a>  just like to ask Attorney Dash, how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=511.16s">Good</a>  to see you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=513.101s">How</a>  long have the process has been for the applicants from start to recount? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=516.683s">How</a>  long ago did they initiate this process?</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=519.405s">Four</a>  years or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=520.946s">Can</a>  you say that again?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=521.866s">Four</a>  years?</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=522.407s">About</a>  four years we've been working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=524.148s">We</a>  tried to do a lot of research with the city to figure out why the restriction existed in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=529.771s">And</a>  we put in some public records requests and I got a bunch of documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=533.153s">There</a>  is no answer to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=535.394s">Nobody</a>  I've talked to, retired people in the city who were there at the time, people I've been referred to from people I've been referred to from people I've been referred to in various departments, all the documents that I've gotten, speaking with the law department when there was a city solicitor, nobody had an answer as to why this restriction existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=552.202s">Because</a>  before I came to you, I wanted to know why it was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=555.344s">So</a>  that would certainly inform how we proceeded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=558.886s">And</a>  then that took us a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=561.707s">And</a>  then we did circle through with the mayor's staff and made sure that if the mayor conceptually was on board with this, because if the mayor was not conceptually on board with this idea, we weren't going to bother you with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=570.99s">So</a>  we got sort of that green light to go forward with the understanding she, of course, hasn't seen the final document. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=577.122s">So,</a>  yeah, this all took a lot of time.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=579.583s">Have</a>  there been any significant delays coming relative to the legal aspect of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=583.385s">Because</a>  we don't have legal counsel or city solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=585.666s">Well,</a>  we were... You've got to wait three days to get somebody to call you back, four days, five days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=589.867s">I</a>  mean, ultimately what I'm hearing is that they started the process four years ago, and at some point it's going to present some sort of economic hardship. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=597.094s">And,</a>  you know, we can only hold people over a barrel for so long as they try to shake them down in a negotiation going on in another department over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=604.139s">But</a>  if this is just an issue, whether or not the council feels they should change the deed of restriction, I don't see why we should be the ones to hold them.</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=614.347s">Well,</a>  we're almost there, to at least this point, in that we're <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=619.704s">And</a>  that, since Attorney Everett's been on here, we've been making progress, as you can see.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=623.829s">In</a>  full disclosure, I live on Movement Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=625.812s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=626.413s">I</a>  live at number 200. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=627.354s">I'm</a>  probably three football fields, four football fields away. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=630.959s">I'm</a>  not a direct butterer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=631.86s">I'm</a>  not a butterer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=632.38s">I'm</a>  not a butterer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=633.181s">But,</a>  you know, just in the interest of disclosure, I'd like to say that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=636.025s">Is</a>  that a motion?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=637.196s">It's</a>  not a motion, it's more of a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=638.457s">I</a>  mean, at this point, Councilor, this is my last meeting, I'm a lame duck Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=641.46s">I'm</a>  not going to bring any racial items forward at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=644.322s">But,</a>  you know, I just kind of find it curious that, you know, it's taken these hardworking individuals in this community four years to get this process really rolling.</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=655.171s">I</a>  would say COVID delayed us a little bit too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=657.688s">May</a>  I give you that line, too?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=661.87s">I</a>  would motion to, well, I don't want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=664.612s">I'll</a>  let you speak, but after you speak, I'm going to motion to table to a date, sir.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=673.072s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=673.472s">Councilor</a>  Dasch, I know that one of the questions that was brought forth was the turnaround for the fire truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=678.293s">That</a>  was a big issue, but that was resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=680.654s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=681.134s">So</a>  again, I think the biggest issue is really moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=684.455s">Something</a>  that I believe what the family had mentioned at the beginning, that it was a hardship due to a family member. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=691.557s">And</a>  that's the reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=692.477s">And</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=695.885s">I</a>  know my fellow counsel is going to table it, so he allowed me to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=700.29s">I</a>  would move it on the vote, but obviously I don't think it will have the vote, so I just think that we have a new council coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=710.501s">I</a>  think that if we can bring them up to speed and <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=715.464s">hope</a>  for the first meeting in January we get this passed, because this is, I still don't, I don't see why it's an issue that we can't move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=723.471s">Because</a>  it seems like in good faith, we're, we're, we're going above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=727.575s">You</a>  know, I look at this in a sense that we're kind of holding the Alps hostage here, in a sense that we're, you know, what we're asking them to do, we're going above and beyond right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=738.244s">And</a>  it seems like the city has really, really just <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=743.192s">waste</a>  a lot of people's time not getting the answers to the right people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=747.578s">To</a>  hear the fact the mayor hasn't even seen this yet is a little bothersome to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=751.924s">That</a>  to me is just, you know, no disrespect in any way, but <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=756.483s">attorneys</a>  are expensive, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=758.744s">And</a>  everybody has to make a living. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=761.024s">But</a>  we're talking about amount of time that's being spent by the Alice family to try to get this push forward for a good reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=767.946s">And</a>  in even having the open dialogue and doing something that I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't, you know, allow myself to sort of be bullied to try to make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=779.109s">This</a>  should be something our community should be looking to assist each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=783.071s">And</a>  so, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=785.925s">know,</a>  I just I'm a little confused why we can't move this forward in the sense of a time sensitive situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=791.968s">So,</a>  but I'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=794.19s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=794.81s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=797.131s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=798.132s">Thank</a>  you for being before us again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=799.733s">We</a>  always appreciate you keeping us updated meeting after meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=804.188s">I</a>  would second the motion to table this to a date certain, and I certainly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=807.611s">I</a>  know you've put time into keeping us briefed on where negotiations and putting together the agreement is at. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=813.896s">I</a>  think you've done a wonderful job of putting the project into scope pretty efficiently for us in the past, and it's my hope that if we meet on this at our first or second regular meeting in January with those final details ironed out, hopefully we can approve this and dispense with it and get you and the offices on to the next step.</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=832.298s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=832.959s">I</a>  would note and also for the record that I think staff and everybody in the city has been working in good faith on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=837.302s">As</a>  you can see, it's just. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=839.063s">It's</a>  an unusual request, and there's not a whole lot of there's no playbook for this, so it's been a little difficult to figure out how to proceed, but we're almost there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=848.351s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=848.671s">I</a>  would make the motion to table to January 9th our date certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=853.607s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=854.548s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=855.409s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=856.51s">I</a>  wanted to thank you, Attorney Dashin, to the Alves family for being so patient and negotiating in good faith with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=866.198s">If</a>  I were the family, I'd feel super frustrated with how long this has taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=872.724s">I</a>  don't want to accidentally undercut the Planning Department's positions on any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=877.088s">I</a>  know this is new territory for you all to chart, so I would like to know if January 9th is a realistic date, because I would want to vote this out by then.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=891.48s">Do</a>  you think January 9th is a realistic date?</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=892.901s">It</a>  is for me, because I can hop on as quick as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=895.621s">I</a>  suppose that's more a question for Director Hunt and her staff.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=899.363s">We</a>  do have Planner Evans on the call as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=902.043s">Danielle,</a>  is there anything you'd like to add?</p>

    <p>[Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=910.726s">Yeah,</a>  so we are working on a cash payment calculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=919.699s">and</a>  the timing of when it would need to be made, and we're still trying to iron out those details. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=926.223s">I</a>  think we are very close, but we want it to be a nice, clean boat. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=933.889s">Basically,</a>  there was an RFP to develop this when the city was <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=942.273s">selling</a>  the property, and even that cannot be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=945.955s">So</a>  it might be somewhere, but I know Attorney Dash has been unable to find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=952.677s">So</a>  I'm trying to have as few pieces of paper and votes floating around. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=957.159s">It</a>  could be one clean vote, then it'd be easier to track. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=961.701s">So</a>  that is our preference.</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=967.432s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=967.812s">I</a>  suppose if staff feels that we can wrap it up by January 9th week on our end, we certainly can.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=971.894s">So</a>  we have a motion to table to January 9th for vices affair, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=979.619s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=980.979s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=981.76s">Motion</a>  passes, table to January 9th.</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=983.661s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=984.041s">Thank</a>  you again.</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=984.682s">And</a>  thank you for your service for those of you who are not continuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=987.303s">You've</a>  done a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=988.704s">I</a>  know it's difficult.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=990.004s">Yeah,</a>  and you know how difficult it can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=992.386s">Have</a>  a good night. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=992.926s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="../resolutions/23-474.pdf"><font color="green">23-474</font></a>, correct? <a href="../resolutions/23-474.pdf"><font color="green">23-474</font></a>.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1006.536s">offered</a>  by vices and bears, whereas the election commission voted 3-1 to postpone discussion of the council's request for a report on the 2023 election issues to the commission's January 2024 meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1016.583s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that a report be placed on the reports due slash deadline section of the council agenda titled 2023 Municipal Election Process Errors and Accountability Report with the deadline of the January 23rd, 2024 regular meeting for a presentation by elections manager Ripley and election commissioner chairperson Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1036.776s">be</a>  it further resolved that the council adds the following requests to that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1040.579s">One,</a>  any issues with the process for filing for a recount and why it took so long for the candidates and the public to be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1046.604s">Two,</a>  any process issues in preparation for the recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1049.586s">And</a>  three, what systems will be put in place to ensure prompt and timely notification of any issues or errors to the public to ensure trust is maintained when errors are made. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1058.893s">Vice</a>  Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1059.613s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1060.854s">This</a>  is an amendment or addendum to the previous resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1065.287s">from</a>  November 14th that we joined with Councilor Scarpelli as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1068.81s">There</a>  was one from Councilor Caraviello, President Morell and I, one from Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1073.594s">Those</a>  were referred to the Elections Commission and the Elections Commission voted 3 to 1 to postpone their discussion of the item until their January meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1084.064s">So</a>  I'm not particularly happy that that decision was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1089.408s">I</a>  don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1091.004s">I</a>  don't think this should be something that waits. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1094.026s">Many</a>  of us here spent some time at City Hall on December 9th for the first and what happened to be the only day of the recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1105.874s">While</a>  the results of the recount did not change in any way the results of the election, I think what was found to be inaccurate was significant and concerning in the sense that if the election had been close or if any of the races had been close, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1121.638s">Those</a>  numbers could have changed the results of an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1128.945s">almost</a>  130 ballots in one precinct that somehow didn't get counted in the unofficial count, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1134.046s">So</a>  in addition to everything that was in the resolution that we passed November 14th, which had to do with all of the things that happened that we knew at the time had happened up until election day and on election night, the recount also did expose a couple of other items for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1153.591s">And</a>  that's incredibly important to the community that <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1158.832s">We</a>  have answers to those questions and answers to the process and fixes to the process and staffing and resources in that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1166.479s">So</a>  that we have confidence that, number one, mistakes that were made in the past aren't going to be made again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1171.703s">And</a>  number two, when mistakes happen, which in any human endeavor is inevitable that there will be things that go wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1179.841s">the</a>  public is made aware and the candidates are made aware right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1183.484s">I</a>  think that's really the most important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1185.245s">I</a>  know in the past when issues did occur, you know, and I haven't been involved as long as some other folks here, but Sandy Gale, Clark Hurtubise, others really did try to get the word out right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1199.437s">We</a>  had this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1200.278s">We</a>  want you to know what the issue was. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1201.739s">We</a>  want you to know <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1203.24s">how</a>  we tried to address it, or who we brought in to help address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1206.022s">I</a>  know that Finn had done similar things as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1209.085s">And</a>  that has to be how our elections offices operate, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1213.248s">If</a>  there is an issue, you get the word out right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1216.871s">The</a>  operating procedure can't be that if there's an issue, you try to fix it without anyone noticing, because that just does not bring trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1224.318s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1225.939s">putting</a>  this on, formally putting on an item for this report to be on our agenda with the deadline of January 23rd, which is our first regular meeting after the next election commission meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1236.425s">But</a>  I am disappointed that the election commission, I believe their rationale was that they had to plan for the recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1242.028s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1242.869s">I</a>  wish they had had, uh, that they had considered an issue to response to this report in a more timely manner because there's an election in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1251.293s">The</a>  presidential primaries in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1253.755s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1255.043s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1255.403s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1257.425s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and I appreciate you bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1259.927s">Vice</a>  President Bears, we've spoken at length already in previous council meetings about the original reasons for bringing forward the request for an election postmortem and report, the errors and mishandlings that happened on election day, which again, were addressed, which should not have happened, and we need to know exactly how they won't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1284.144s">And</a>  then the issues and mishandlings that happened leading up to the recount and needing a full accounting of why those happened and how exactly we'll know they won't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1294.989s">To</a>  me, this is on the institutional scale, an example of people don't plan to fail, they fail to plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1306.374s">We've</a>  discussed how going into this election, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1309.147s">There</a>  were serious concerns about the capacity of the elections department because its staffing had dropped so low below its previous levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1319.554s">And</a>  I think we really need to see, we need to see the diagnostic of what exactly happened and why. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1324.597s">And</a>  we need to investigate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1326.411s">First,</a>  the Elections Commission, the Elections Department, and then as a community, as a council, we need to investigate what needs to happen so that we can go into our three very consequential elections in 2024 with the Elections Office and the Elections Commission feeling professional and organized and competent so that every voter and every resident in Medford can feel confident. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1346.89s">about</a>  the three, again, very consequential elections that we will have in 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1351.512s">And</a>  I do think it bears emphasizing that by the time that we hear back from the Elections Commission at our January meeting, it will be less than two months until the first of those three elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1364.636s">So</a>  I think everybody shares a sense of disappointment that it's necessary to have this conversation at all, that it's necessary to put a deadline on it because we haven't gotten a <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1376.004s">really</a>  any response so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1379.326s">But</a>  if it takes imposing accountability at the outset until this commission and the department can be imposing accountability from within, it's non-negotiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1389.792s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1391.654s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1392.594s">Any</a>  further discussion from councilors?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1446.035s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1446.495s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1447.636s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1448.836s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1450.237s">The</a>  coverup is always worse than the crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1453.518s">And</a>  Councilor Bearsley is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1454.938s">Trust</a>  in the public process is paramount, especially when it comes to elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1459.12s">So</a>  why is it that we have an elections commission that's going to go hide under their bed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1463.442s">when</a>  the largest issue in this community has come up in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1467.845s">I</a>  don't understand how an election commission can vote 3 to 1 to postpone reporting back to this community the flaws and errors that occurred during their mismanagement and incompetency following that election. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1480.433s">I</a>  sat up here the evening of the election, and I heard them read off the figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1487.257s">I</a>  heard them read off the total vote count. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1490.059s">And</a>  I said to myself, you're missing <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1493.427s">like</a>  4,000 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1494.828s">You're</a>  wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1495.909s">You</a>  don't know what you're talking about, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1497.41s">You</a>  don't know what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1499.271s">I</a>  know one plus one equals two. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1502.073s">I</a>  know one plus one equals two. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1503.414s">The</a>  way that election was handled was the most embarrassing sight I've seen in a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1508.317s">I</a>  worked on political campaigns since I was seven years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1513.16s">I've</a>  never seen anything handled like that before in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1515.382s">The</a>  elections manager was not in this room the whole entire night. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1519.265s">I</a>  was here from 8.05 until almost one o'clock in the morning <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1523.433s">And</a>  the elections manager was nowhere to be seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1526.856s">All</a>  the vote totals in bags, unattended, all over this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1531.62s">Individual</a>  members of the election commission, unsupervised, alone, going through the bags, looking through them, rifling through them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1538.246s">And</a>  you wonder why stuff is going missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1540.328s">You</a>  wonder why we can't put it together, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1542.81s">That</a>  was the biggest embarrassment I've ever seen in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1547.253s">Now,</a>  shockingly, we do have a CEO in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1552.244s">who's</a>  been extremely quiet, extremely quiet about what happened during this election. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1561.75s">Which</a>  leads me to believe that this behavior is something that's acceptable with this current administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1568.494s">Because</a>  I know if it were me, and the integrity of my election would be brought into question, I'd be sure that the department heads and the board members <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1581.226s">by</a>  way of which I appointed personally, because I'm the mayor, would have their heads rolling down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1588.873s">The</a>  way that they treated election day volunteers, people that wanted to participate in the process and be involved, was shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1598.121s">And</a>  for them to now vote, to postpone the discussion, just tells you what kind of culture we have here at City Hall, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1610.728s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1611.409s">I</a>  think the council to bring this people.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1614.713s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1615.213s">If</a>  Council Vice President would entertain, could we add something to the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1624.284s">I'd</a>  like to get the attendance record for all of the members on the Election Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1629.923s">I</a>  think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1630.583s">Because</a>  I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1632.564s">Um,</a>  from what I gather, we don't have too many members that are actually committed to that commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1638.326s">And</a>  I don't think we're taking it as serious as we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1641.447s">My</a>  biggest piece with this situation is accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1645.268s">We've</a>  seen very, very good people be marched out that door. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1649.669s">But</a>  not even a quarter of the concerns that we've we've <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1658.979s">or</a>  understand any process that has gone on is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1665.064s">I</a>  haven't heard from one commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1667.306s">I</a>  haven't heard from anybody except for the coordinator who sent us a message saying that the election is now certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1679.977s">And</a>  like Councilor Caraviello said, my biggest problem is when I was a young man, when I was in high school, everybody had a mandatory class called civics. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1693.313s">And</a>  you learned about our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1694.595s">You</a>  learned about the respect you should give this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1702.031s">I</a>  still remember my son just left a minute ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1704.573s">We</a>  talked about how Mrs. Lasky ran the fourth grade presidential election in her classroom and how important everything was and how organized everything should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1716.141s">I</a>  wish Mrs. Lasky ran this last election because Councilor Caraviello again is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1722.325s">When</a>  people don't want to vote, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1724.636s">good</a>  people, good hardworking people that took pride in coming to that ballot box every municipal election. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1733.5s">They've</a>  looked me in the eye and said, they'll never vote again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1736.442s">They</a>  have no faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1738.462s">And</a>  I truly thought that maybe coming out ahead of this could have helped that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1744.085s">But</a>  instead, we just fed into the rhetoric. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1747.227s">And</a>  I said it the day that we had the first issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1749.788s">I</a>  said, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1750.868s">I</a>  said, be careful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1752.881s">because</a>  perception is reality and it's exactly what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1759.284s">So</a>  moving forward, I know that we'll have a new council, but I think as this council looks to move people forward and look at our budgetary processes, we have to start looking for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1773.07s">If</a>  the city administration is not going to hold people accountable, then we're going to have to make sure that they <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1778.442s">that</a>  they know that this council is going to be strong enough to make sure they hold their people to the feet of the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1784.827s">Because</a>  this has been an absolute laughingstock across the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1790.811s">And</a>  the fact, I'll be honest with you, I'm disgusted with the Secretary of State's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1797.737s">Reached</a>  out to them, haven't heard anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1802.14s">This</a>  is what they're all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1804.915s">If</a>  this is what the Secretary of State and our governor sees that that's appropriate, look what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1812.808s">It's</a>  a trickle-down effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1813.91s">Now,</a>  who knows how many people aren't going to come out for the next elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1819.622s">And</a>  why? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1820.062s">No</a>  one's told us anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1821.924s">No</a>  one's even talked to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1823.144s">I</a>  got a bunch of fluffy, I'm getting a lot of emails, fluffy emails, you know, wishing me luck, a happy birthday, a congratulations, but no one is still from that commission's talked to me about, George, this is what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1838.795s">And</a>  they're good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1842.557s">And</a>  then for the recount, I know I wasn't there, but I, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1847.188s">I</a>  talked to a few people that came here, gave their time to help with the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1853.151s">And</a>  I heard our coordinator, our elections coordinator was verbally getting in people's faces and disrespecting people to the point where the attorney from the from the candidate side had to step in and say, Please do not address any of our people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1872.502s">Talk</a>  to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1874.123s">That's</a>  a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1878.615s">So</a>  there's a lot more that's going to go on in that meeting when they come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1882.196s">But</a>  my biggest thing right now is, and a lot of people that have talked to him on every side, every side, this isn't just, you know, the George Scarpelli side, this is every side. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1893.861s">Everybody's</a>  watching to see where the accountability pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1898.883s">That's</a>  what everybody's waiting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1901.744s">And</a>  if you want to give them benefit of the doubt until the January 29. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1904.025s">So</a>  be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1907.705s">But</a>  if you're gonna come up to that podium on January 29th and give us fluff, be prepared, because this one Councilor is gonna ask some serious questions, and I'm gonna be calling people out directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1922.189s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President, and I rest my case.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1986.696s">This</a>  is something... <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1998.506s">I</a>  didn't call for participation, but no, I didn't know, but you always can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2005.091s">I</a>  mean, if you want to wait for participation or Councilors, I know we, yeah, we'll get, yeah, we'll, we'll go back to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2012.978s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="../resolutions/23-475.pdf"><font color="green">23-475</font></a>, offered by President Morell, be it so resolved that the council explore and consider language for an ordinance regulating blasting and earth removal within the city.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2022.945s">This</a>  is something I already introduced, but apparently I didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2026.968s">This</a>  was originally kicked off, of course, by the giant hole that exists, continues to exist, that's still not houses, on Winthrop Street, that we had myriad complaints about, lots of issues, and then I think was kicked off again as <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2040.979s">the</a>  we're looking at that deed restriction understanding there's a lot of ledge in that area my intention in this is not to this is obviously for the future my intention is not to say hey there's no blasting but just understanding that a lot of the issues relating from the Winthrop Street project is that we have nothing on the books as far as regulations and permits and steps that people have to follow when they're actually doing that so making sure we have some steps that make sure that our the <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2065.345s">residents</a>  and neighbors in the area aren't disturbed in the way that they were with the Winthrop Street project and it's done in a completely different way that respects our residents and make sure that we have permits approvals and process in place to make this a much better experience should it go forward in any place in the city than what happened on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2084.343s">So,</a>  go ahead Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2086.104s">Thank</a>  you President Morell for introducing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2090.274s">As</a>  you might know, I'm very excited about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2092.876s">I</a>  am very much looking forward to helping lead on this in the new council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2098.501s">What</a>  we saw with Winthrop Street is not acceptable to the residents of the city, and we need more safeguards for future action. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2107.367s">We</a>  know that the housing market is hot, and it's becoming more profitable to blast off ledge and build more housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2117.659s">We</a>  just need more community engagement, more community conversations about what that process looks like, informing residents of what to expect, having regulations of best practices, basically taking lessons that we've learned from the Winthrop Street Project to future projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2134.663s">And</a>  so I'm very grateful that you introduced this.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2137.424s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2137.724s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2315.116s">Hi,</a>  Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2319.66s">I'm</a>  actually one of the candidates that requested the recount of the recent election, and I just want to recognize and appreciate Councilor Bears for adding those additions to the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2335.546s">I</a>  think it's really important that we have integrity in our elections and that they're accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2342.708s">In</a>  addition, I would like it noted that <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2346.981s">you</a>  know, after the election, there was a lot of discussion about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2351.984s">And</a>  though each one of these city council members agreed that there was an issue with the process, you all agreed that there was no change in the accuracy of the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2361.292s">Well,</a>  the election was not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2364.114s">The,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2366.991s">The</a>  outcomes may have not changed, but the accuracy was not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2371.033s">We</a>  missed over 130 ballots that were not counted, which Councilor Bears had mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2378.356s">But</a>  in addition, and I think this is something that should be addressed, is that there was tabulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2383.078s">There</a>  were several precincts that had tabulations where there were more ballots counted than actually tallied than there were counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2391.762s">In</a>  two precincts, there was 40 ballots <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2395.183s">more</a>  that were tallied than what was actually counted during the blocking process, and there was another precinct that had 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2401.528s">In</a>  addition, there were others that had smaller amounts of 11 and 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2407.514s">But</a>  that, to me, is a serious issue with the tabulation machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2411.977s">So</a>  my hope is that somehow those will be addressed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2417.702s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2418.243s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2444.97s">No,</a>  if you're up to say nice words about Councilors, we're gonna do that next.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2448.311s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2448.951s">Or</a>  words, or words. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2449.851s">No,</a>  but other things too, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2452.172s">No,</a>  I was just gonna give him some, cause he was gonna end this before I could talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2456.638s">Transparency</a>  seems to be like a common theme here among my years in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2461.463s">I've</a>  been here since 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2464.4s">This</a>  council was actually very much a proponent of trying to bring transparency back to a process with the 61 Locust Street project, to which I commend the council at the time, and some of you were still a part of that, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2476.782s">So</a>  then I find out that through the grapevine that there's a potential for having 50 to 75 migrant families directly across the street from my house, sorry, diagonally across the street from my house on Riverside F in a commercial project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2493.026s">Haven't</a>  heard anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2495.017s">So</a>  the good councilor Scarpelli's point about no transparency or lack of transparency from folks in the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2503.124s">We</a>  have the CEO who was part of the council at that time of the 61 Locust Street project, who was very much a proponent of transparency from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2511.631s">So</a>  I got to ask like, what is going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2514.153s">And</a>  can someone please make public the rumors that have been talked about? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2519.838s">Because</a>  as a resident in an adjacent building, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2523.464s">and</a>  a neighborhood, and I know that my neighbors know nothing about this, it's kind of a big deal, especially because these sorts of things are also on the news, especially in New York City, where they can't handle what's happening to their properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2537.991s">So</a>  this, I guess, is a commercial property that now we're going to all of a sudden start housing people in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2543.213s">And</a>  I just want to know what's going on because I live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2545.934s">I</a>  know some of you don't, and it's not in your neighborhoods, but it is in mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2549.716s">And</a>  I have two small kids at home, and so I'm concerned about things like safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2554.179s">That's</a>  my number one thing that I'm concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2556.78s">I</a>  don't have a good feel either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2558.401s">It's</a>  not that I'm opposed to it, but with no information, it seems like it's kind of underhanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2562.764s">And</a>  it's kind of a theme that I'm seeing in this city's government to the point of two topics ago between elections and zoning, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2571.449s">So</a>  I'd really appreciate some answers if someone can give it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2574.251s">And</a>  let's make this for the public record instead of just rumors.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2615.206s">It</a>  says, temporary shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2616.367s">Hello,</a>  representatives, senators, members of Medford City Council, Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2620.669s">I</a>  wanted to give you all a heads up on an ever-evolving matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2624.23s">At</a>  the end of last week, I was informed that 400 Riverside Ave was being explored. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2629.572s">as</a>  a possible temporary winter emergency shelter for migrant families on the wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2634.674s">The</a>  state was only going to pick one site from my recollection on a phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2640.555s">The</a>  families would only each stay a few nights before they would be transitioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2645.736s">The</a>  shelter was going to run through April and start with those families currently staying at 10 Park Plaza and may build up to no more than 75 families. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2656.55s">The</a>  state, excuse me, 75, the state asked for a walkthrough today, and at the time, the Commissioner Rice relayed different terms to us, all regarding capacity and length of stay through June. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2669.124s">He</a>  also said that this was the site they plan to try to move forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2674.026s">I</a>  have another call with the state tomorrow to try to get more clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2679.389s">This</a>  is 110,000 square foot site that meets the needs of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2684.111s">And</a>  I'm worried about the burden it will cause with city staff, the school department, and et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2690.473s">It</a>  reaches the capacity that we are unable to handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2694.429s">I</a>  will follow up with you when we have more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2697.912s">That</a>  was on 12-5. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2699.794s">So</a>  this is, I thought this was public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2702.536s">I</a>  didn't realize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2703.277s">I</a>  didn't know that no one else knew it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2705.378s">It's</a>  the first time that I heard that no one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2706.78s">I</a>  mean, I'm sorry, I don't have Facebook, but yeah, this isn't Facebook, but I would assume diagonally across. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2711.644s">Yeah,</a>  I would assume we should have a. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2714.486s">We</a>  should call for a community meeting immediately, maybe somewhere in that area that we can let our neighbors know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2721.892s">Because</a>  from what I gather, it doesn't sound like the mayor's supporting this either. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2726.476s">So</a>  if this is something on the state level, I think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2730.299s">That's</a>  the biggest thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2732.281s">When</a>  I heard this, I talked to a couple of teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2736.865s">And</a>  they were confused because they <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2739.747s">the</a>  increase in numbers in the elementary school, especially kindergarten level, I guess they've added an extra kindergarten to every single school already. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2747.631s">And</a>  there was some thought that we've already let families in, and that's the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2753.094s">But</a>  if that isn't the issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2754.909s">the</a>  fear from our educators that any influx, now remember, anybody that moves into our community as a child, they have every right to go to school in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2766.193s">And</a>  this is gonna put a huge burden, a burden that I don't think that can meet the capacity <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2771.935s">that</a>  we offer right now, both at the McGlynn and the Roberts for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2775.837s">I</a>  don't know if the other schools have space from what I was told that there aren't many places. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2781.94s">Now,</a>  the other issue we heard was with the closure of the Salem Street Fire Station back in our area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2789.183s">I</a>  say our area because we grew up in North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2791.324s">The</a>  idea of <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2793.723s">any</a>  more an influx of this magnitude with only one true station that's on that side, really, other than coming from the main station and then the heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2804.909s">It's</a>  really going to play an impact with public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2807.971s">So</a>  there's a lot of issues here that I appreciate you bringing this forward today because I think that it's scary at many different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2815.495s">And</a>  again, like I said, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2818.339s">But</a>  when I gather the mayor is really confused with this whole situation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2822.921s">So</a>  not to support her in any way and understanding it, but this is something that one thing we should do is have community meeting or something should go out saying what she just said in this email that I personally thought because this is a public record, I thought it was already out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2840.05s">So</a>  I didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2841.371s">So</a>  I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2842.552s">I</a>  wish I knew.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2843.852s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2846.906s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2848.167s">I</a>  appreciate you asking the question in a public forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2851.629s">My</a>  impression is that nothing is certain here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2855.371s">We</a>  got this heads up that Councilor Scarpelli, thank you for sharing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2859.073s">My</a>  impression from receiving that same communication a couple weeks ago is that this is still in flux and the mayor is still <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2867.375s">in</a>  conversation with state partners who is in conversation with this landlord to determine when the state picks a site, will it be this one or will it be another one? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2876.738s">And</a>  I think in this case, no news really is no news. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2881.579s">So</a>  I just don't want us to get ahead of ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2883.679s">It's</a>  also, and again, I think if this were to go forward, we should get solid answers from the people who really know for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2891.241s">But</a>  I think the conception of this temporary shelter is not to be a months long <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2897.664s">for</a>  any of these migrant families. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2899.145s">It's</a>  more like away station families would stay for a couple of nights, so I don't think it's in any way certain that this would cause a burden on our public school system because we're not going to.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2911.24s">And</a>  this is why it's an issue, because I took that as that they changed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2918.024s">The</a>  original phone call was for temporary, and then it was extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2922.867s">So</a>  I'm looking at it totally different. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2924.308s">So</a>  I think that's why, I think having some clarity, I think that's why really just having some clarity from the main office I think would be important.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2932.301s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2932.761s">And</a>  yeah, I think it's certainly, certainly be great to circle back with the executive office to ask the question of what's the status? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2938.826s">Is</a>  this going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2939.767s">I</a>  interpreted that email as not, we're extending this so that families, any given family will stay through June, but rather this will remain a way station for two or three nights at a time, just for a couple more months. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2951.237s">So</a>  certainly appreciate all the questions asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2954.119s">My</a>  assumption is that this is just certainly still up in the air as many, you know, large infrastructural, you know, sure social infrastructural or if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2961.61s">I</a>  also think that, you know, certainly asking for an update I'm sure that, you know, trying to sort this out at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2972.11s">but</a>  sort of recentering on the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2974.572s">We</a>  know that we have a shelter crisis in Massachusetts at this time of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2978.636s">If</a>  this is an opportunity where marshaling state resources, Medford can be a port in the storm for vulnerable migrant families, I think that's another important safety piece to put into the conversation is the lack of safety that's putting these families into the situation to begin with.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2993.33s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2995.487s">Just</a>  a quick short note, in the email that Councilor Scarpelli read, the mayor said she would follow up with us with details, and we haven't received a follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3004.772s">So</a>  that's another reason, because we just don't know a lot of these details either.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3010.635s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3011.535s">I</a>  just want to, in terms of like next steps and actions, this wasn't on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3017.762s">We</a>  shouldn't debate that since it wasn't on the agenda, wasn't publicly posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3020.646s">We're</a>  talking about transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3021.827s">We</a>  shouldn't take action on things that we didn't let the public know we were going to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3027.334s">I</a>  just wanted to take it back to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3030.077s">I</a>  did ask a follow up of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3031.679s">The</a>  mayor said the state basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3034.235s">If</a>  the state signs a contract with the property owner, that's the arrangement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3038.717s">The</a>  city has no input, no involvement, unless the state wants to give the city involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3043.899s">So</a>  if the state and the property owner sign an agreement, that's what's going to be what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3050.001s">The</a>  city doesn't have, the state comes in and they can do what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3052.783s">So</a>  that's where this is at, is my understanding, because I wanted to follow up specifically on that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3059.805s">And</a>  I believe the mayor's email <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3061.566s">is</a>  written in the way to show specifically concern that if the state and the property owner just make an agreement without considering the city, since they don't legally have to consult the city and the city doesn't own the property, it's a private land and the state is trying to pay, essentially lease private property for their own purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3082.283s">Her</a>  concern, to my understanding, reading of the email and my follow-up question, was that the city be consulted and engaged in that process in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3090.472s">but</a>  that essentially the state can just sign an agreement with this private property owner if they wish to do so.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3099.701s">I</a>  would find it very interesting if the mayor could point out when she did become aware of these circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3109.69s">You</a>  know, she's remained relatively quiet about it with the exception of a press release <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3114.131s">And</a>  historically, that office has been really good at press releases and social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3119.856s">So</a>  it kind of concerns me, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3121.897s">It</a>  makes me scratch my head and wonder if the mayor had knowledge about this before Halloween and didn't share it with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3129.063s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3129.744s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3131.986s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3133.508s">I</a>  guess just one last comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3135.129s">I</a>  certainly appreciate Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3137.311s">He's</a>  saying that nothing has happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3140.013s">I</a>  also remember being part of the community where with the 61 Locust Street project, we were told the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3144.617s">It</a>  was basically, sorry, too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3146.498s">And</a>  the time to address it was beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3149.361s">So</a>  there's certainly folks in my neighborhood that, you know, if they're made aware of something early, would definitely like to voice their opinion when it can be heard versus being told, sorry, too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3160.569s">So</a>  that's where we're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3162.191s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3164.329s">Do</a>  I have a motion to revert back to regular order of business?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3167.171s">Motion,</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3167.712s">Motion</a>  by Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3170.854s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3172.095s">All</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3172.635s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3176.458s">Going</a>  to 23471, offered by Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3179.441s">Be</a>  it resolved by the Medford City Council that we commend Councilor Caraviello for his outstanding service on the Medford City Council from 2012 to 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3185.566s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3187.927s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3190.089s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello has served with me the entire time that I've been on the City Council, and we've served through a pandemic, zoning recodification, two city elections since I was elected, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3209.867s">I</a>  think 15, 16, 17 ordinances maybe at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3214.229s">And</a>  I have been really lucky to learn from Councilor Caraviello, to work with Councilor Caraviello, especially on development projects and trying to engage property owners, trying to engage people who want to come to the city and build new good things in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3230.355s">I</a>  think sometimes we've been successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3233.979s">Sometimes</a>  we haven't been as successful as we wanted to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3237.163s">And</a>  I personally really want, and I'm hoping if Carol lets you, that you will give a little more time and give me a call if you see a good opportunity or you hear someone who wants to come to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3253.022s">and</a>  wants to talk to a city councilor about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3256.164s">But</a>  I also think you've more than earned some time off, time with family, after many, many years of public service, not just on the council, but before your time on the council in volunteerism and service to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3268.814s">So</a>  thank you, and I will miss you as a colleague, and I hope that you get to spend many vacations getting suntanned and enjoying some time in warm places.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3283.007s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3283.427s">Councilor</a>  Scarpellilli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3285.548s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3287.67s">It's</a>  difficult for me because when you spend so much time in people, it's not just every other Tuesday now, or it was every Tuesday, but my first two phone calls on the way to work every morning was to Councilor Caraviello, then to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3310.094s">What</a>  I want to applaud you, Rick, is for teaching all of us to understand why we do what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3319.702s">And</a>  I think people have forgotten that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3321.043s">And</a>  I think last meeting was a pretty good indication of where we were. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3327.349s">Rick</a>  Caraviello, the Rick Caraviello I know, no one understands how much you've done for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3337.295s">What's</a>  great about a person that does things, hey, listen, it's great when the camera's in your face, people taking pictures of people talking about you, and you're standing up and shaking hands and cutting ribbon, because I know a lot of people that do that and love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3349.345s">It's</a>  all ego-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3351.727s">But</a>  the Rick Caraviello I know, that I'm honored to call my friend, has always done things behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3358.973s">And</a>  I've always admired that about you, Rick. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3361.975s">I've</a>  tried to emulate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3363.737s">It's</a>  very difficult to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3366.983s">while</a>  running a family and running a business and taking care of dad that's in a home and understanding everything that goes on in a person's life, you still have time to feed the hungry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3383.726s">You</a>  still have time to build a deck for a person that can't afford a handicap ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3391.587s">When</a>  a veteran needs something, it's Rick Caraviello they call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3397.489s">And</a>  I used to be, to be honest, I was so jealous of how you did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3402.273s">And,</a>  but it also made me proud that I've learned from the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3408.498s">I've</a>  sat behind this rail with some amazing people, some amazing people that when I sit and talk about all these different people than our lifetimes that have lost, we've lost, and they've moved on to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3422.605s">the</a>  big Mustang land in the sky, I look at it and I say, who's going to take that place? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3429.768s">And</a>  I was fortunate because I see people like Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco and Councilor Knight and you being the Mount Rushmore of that group. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3451.257s">I</a>  don't want to get emotional because I think that this is more than just you've given enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3456.819s">Zach</a>  is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3458.46s">When</a>  it came, when you saw the city falling, no one else had the guts to stand up and you stood up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3466.722s">You</a>  stood up taller than any man I've ever seen in my life other than my dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3474.045s">You</a>  didn't hide from anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3475.626s">You</a>  fought every single day to make things right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3482.028s">And</a>  I'm honored to be your friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3484.89s">So</a>  I hope I can make those phone calls in the morning still. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3490.233s">And</a>  sometimes I think Dina gets jealous because I don't pick up her call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3495.435s">And</a>  I'd say, I'm on the phone with Carvey. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3499.378s">But</a>  she knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3500.818s">So</a>  for your family, people that I love, Carol, you've been amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3507.898s">to</a>  make sure Rick is here with us, and I don't think he's ever missed a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3512.479s">And</a>  if I missed a meeting, I'd always get an email, a text message right away saying, where are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3517.14s">And</a>  I felt guilty to say, my God, Rick, I'm stuck at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3520.161s">Because</a>  no matter what, even after the election, he was still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3523.662s">Even</a>  after the election, people are still calling him. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3525.882s">He</a>  was at the door the other day, and I was like, after the election, and I said, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3533.064s">He</a>  had a truck full of turkeys. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3535.236s">He</a>  says, do you know anybody who needs a turkey, any family that needs a turkey? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3540.317s">And</a>  that's what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3541.438s">That's</a>  what we're going to miss in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3543.638s">People</a>  don't realize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3544.819s">And</a>  it's something that when I see your grandchildren, I make sure they know how proud they should be of their papa. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3552.581s">And</a>  Rick, you've done an amazing job to set a standard for the Caraviello family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3557.952s">So</a>  my friend, all I can say to you is I wish one day George Scarpelli leaves a legacy like Rick Caraviello, because it's not Armin anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3568.517s">All</a>  Armin did was win a few football games. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3571.498s">Rick</a>  Caraviello is what <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3575.785s">we</a>  should all aspire to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3577.446s">So</a>  I will miss you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3579.487s">I</a>  appreciate everything you've taught me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3581.928s">I've</a>  appreciated you, the phone calls that you've, you've called me and set me straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3586.31s">When</a>  I was going to go stray, you pulled me back. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3589.531s">And</a>  I hope I still get those phone calls because we know it's not going to be easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3594.594s">President</a>  Zach Beers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3596.375s">Imagine</a>  Ricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3602.211s">Joking,</a>  of course, but I love you, my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3605.634s">I'm</a>  proud that this journey in our lives made us brothers and I thank you and I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3614.34s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3615.321s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3618.604s">Councilor</a>  Garabiello, it's been an honor to <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3625.982s">serve</a>  alongside you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3629.103s">Nobody</a>  knows I have the best seat in the chambers because Rick has the best gossip. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3636.124s">You've</a>  always offered me advice, unsolicited advice that's been true every time, solicited advice that's been very useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3647.435s">You</a>  know, I know that you care about the success of this community, and you care about the success of this city, and you care about the success of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3655.06s">No</a>  matter who's behind the rail, you want us to be doing the best work that we can for the benefit of the people that live here, and that's evident in everything that you do and how you spend your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3663.344s">So</a>  thank you for your partnership with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3666.626s">Thank</a>  you for working with me in good faith every week over the past two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3670.469s">Thank</a>  you for your service for so many years, and excited to see what you do next. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3676.481s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>
