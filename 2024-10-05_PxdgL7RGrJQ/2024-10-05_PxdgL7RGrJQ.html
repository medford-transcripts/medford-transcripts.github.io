    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=124.947s">attorney</a>  Adam Dash, 48 Grove Street in Somerville with me are Jerry and Janet Alves back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=132.453s">We</a>  have been working on a draft agreement with staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=136.236s">I</a>  would note that the, I believe that the substance is pretty much all set and I'm gonna tell you what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=142.261s">I</a>  don't, from talking to staff just before tonight, I was told that it is not in final form. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=148.306s">So</a>  a little disappointing, but that is where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=150.608s">If</a>  staff are on on the call, they can probably weigh in on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=154.152s">I</a>  did want to note that I do want to at least explain it to you 1 last time, because I know a lot of you put a lot of time into this and been very gracious to have us here and won't be here going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=163.621s">So</a>  just give you 1 last opportunity on this that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=167.785s">The</a>  amendment was to allow the offices to seek to build three units on the property that would be subdivided into two lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=175.938s">Currently,</a>  the city has a deed restriction preventing any new units or any subdivisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=180.447s">Again,</a>  this amendment would not allow any further subdivision. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=183.409s">It</a>  would not allow any further units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=185.03s">It</a>  would just be one subdivision, three units, and the restriction would continue on in all of their forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=190.955s">The</a>  amendment does not mean that the office is gonna actually build anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=194.537s">It</a>  just allows them to go through the normal permitting process like everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=198.0s">There'll</a>  be public hearings and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=199.901s">And</a>  maybe they get the permits, maybe they don't, but they can't even do that unless the amendment and the restriction is amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=206.946s">In</a>  exchange for the restriction, the Alvarez's would pay an amount to the city in lieu of providing the affordable unit on site so the city could build affordable housing elsewhere so the Alvarez's disabled son and the sister-in-law themselves could live in the new units as they may not legally qualify or win the lottery to get the units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=225.558s">So</a>  the amount in payment in lieu, we did work talk to the city and it is in this agreement draft would be the difference between the fair market value of a three bedroom unit <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=235.023s">and</a>  the value of that unit as an 80% affordable, and that delta would be the payment, so that there's no profit from the unit going to the offices, and then that money would go to the city for building affordable housing elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=247.466s">That</a>  is not in contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=250.807s">So</a>  I suppose one thing one could do is, and I'm not pushing for anything, but if one wanted to, I suppose, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=257.791s">the</a>  council could vote to approve this pending this working out a deal working out the finality of the agreement with the staff or could kick it to January. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=267.543s">I</a>  sort of leave it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=268.863s">I</a>  would just like to, obviously, since you've all been involved in this, to explain it to a whole bunch of new people is not really what I would like to do, but we will, obviously, if that's your pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=277.546s">And</a>  I guess this just came up before pretty much I went to dinner and came over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=281.006s">So</a>  I don't really have a whole lot more to say other than that, but that's where we are with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=285.747s">I</a>  think the substance is pretty much done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=287.788s">The</a>  main detail I think outstanding is the timing of the payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=292.543s">is</a>  that the certificate of issuance of certificate of occupancy, they won't have any money because they won't have sold a unit to get the money to pay the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=299.771s">So</a>  certificate of occupancy doesn't really do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=302.274s">On</a>  the other hand, I understand the city's position, which is, if we if you wait till they sell the unit, what if they never sold a unit forever in the city would never get the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=310.042s">I</a>  get everyone gets each other's point here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=312.304s">And</a>  there's got to be a solution here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=313.726s">I</a>  can't <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=314.907s">today,</a>  this afternoon, tell you what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=317.548s">But</a>  that is if anyone has a bright idea, I'm happy to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=319.748s">But</a>  that is the situation that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=321.849s">And</a>  as far as I understand, that is, in my mind, the only thing that's left unless staff has another issue that I'm not picking up on.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=328.39s">Thank</a>  you, Attorney Dash. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=329.05s">We</a>  do have Director Hunt on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=330.991s">I</a>  just want to offer that perspective or any comments.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=337.5s">Thank</a>  you, madam president. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=340.446s">So,</a>  basically, we do think that there is a place here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=343.692s">We</a>  can come to an agreement where there would be a payment to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=348.187s">to</a>  the Affordable Housing Trust in lieu of actually creating an affordable unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=353.772s">We</a>  think that the logistics, everything of that would be easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=356.935s">We</a>  have not yet worked out exactly how much that payment would be, what the terms, at what point in the process that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=364.943s">In</a>  my mind, that is really important to <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=368.766s">approving</a>  this is that we have to have this fully worked out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=372.948s">He</a>  is correct that this doesn't permit anything to actually get built, but we can't condition any of the permitting pieces on this kind of a payment in lieu of an affordable housing unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=386.276s">It</a>  would be pretty significant, whereas we can condition the lifting of the waiver or lifting of the requirement for the restriction, sorry, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=397.262s">That</a>  is actually a very reasonable thing to condition the lifting of the restriction on a payment like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=404.932s">I</a>  will mention that senior planner Danielle Evans is waiting to get let in the Zoom room. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=410.979s">She's</a>  actually the one who's been working on this the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=415.08s">and</a>  has previous experience with things like this from other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=420.203s">I</a>  honestly don't see that there's very much to inform other Councilors on the new Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=425.625s">I</a>  think a lot of them are very familiar with this already. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=429.307s">And</a>  I would be more comfortable having the council vote once we have a fully negotiated agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=437.491s">I</a>  will point out that the agreement we're looking at has to have the mayor's signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=441.793s">And</a>  we have not yet had a chance to bring the mayor up to speed on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=446.537s">She</a>  was waiting to see what details we could work out before she sort of dug into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=451.721s">So</a>  she hasn't seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=452.922s">I</a>  did send her the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=455.184s">I</a>  should say I haven't heard back from her. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=457.987s">So</a>  I assume she hasn't yet had a chance to see it since I sent it to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=463.119s">So</a>  my preference would be for the council to table this and to vote with the new council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=468.442s">I</a>  think you'll have the same turnout, but we would actually have a fully written out documented agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=476.567s">We</a>  also have attorney Sharon Everett on the line who has been our <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=482.691s">attorney</a>  on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=483.471s">I</a>  don't know if she has anything additional to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=485.692s">So</a>  I certainly asked her about the portion that this is a public hearing and the members of the council will be turning over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=493.175s">But</a>  we do not need a public hearing in order to approve the changing of the restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=500.678s">It's</a>  just a simple majority vote of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=503.92s">So</a>  thanks.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=505.64s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=506.821s">Vice</a>  Mayor and Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=509.639s">I'd</a>  just like to ask Attorney Dash, how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=511.16s">Good</a>  to see you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=513.101s">How</a>  long have the process has been for the applicants from start to recount? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=516.683s">How</a>  long ago did they initiate this process?</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=519.405s">Four</a>  years or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=520.946s">Can</a>  you say that again?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=521.866s">Four</a>  years?</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=522.407s">About</a>  four years we've been working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=524.148s">We</a>  tried to do a lot of research with the city to figure out why the restriction existed in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=529.771s">And</a>  we put in some public records requests and I got a bunch of documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=533.153s">There</a>  is no answer to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=535.394s">Nobody</a>  I've talked to, retired people in the city who were there at the time, people I've been referred to from people I've been referred to from people I've been referred to in various departments, all the documents that I've gotten, speaking with the law department when there was a city solicitor, nobody had an answer as to why this restriction existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=552.202s">Because</a>  before I came to you, I wanted to know why it was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=555.344s">So</a>  that would certainly inform how we proceeded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=558.886s">And</a>  then that took us a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=561.707s">And</a>  then we did circle through with the mayor's staff and made sure that if the mayor conceptually was on board with this, because if the mayor was not conceptually on board with this idea, we weren't going to bother you with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=570.99s">So</a>  we got sort of that green light to go forward with the understanding she, of course, hasn't seen the final document. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=577.122s">So,</a>  yeah, this all took a lot of time.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=579.583s">Have</a>  there been any significant delays coming relative to the legal aspect of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=583.385s">Because</a>  we don't have legal counsel or city solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=585.666s">Well,</a>  we were... You've got to wait three days to get somebody to call you back, four days, five days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=589.867s">I</a>  mean, ultimately what I'm hearing is that they started the process four years ago, and at some point it's going to present some sort of economic hardship. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=597.094s">And,</a>  you know, we can only hold people over a barrel for so long as they try to shake them down in a negotiation going on in another department over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=604.139s">But</a>  if this is just an issue, whether or not the council feels they should change the deed of restriction, I don't see why we should be the ones to hold them.</p>

    <p>[Dash]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=614.347s">Well,</a>  we're almost there, to at least this point, in that we're <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=619.704s">And</a>  that, since Attorney Everett's been on here, we've been making progress, as you can see.</p>
