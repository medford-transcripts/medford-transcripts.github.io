[SPEAKER_18]: 4-7-4, 2-3-4-7-5, 2-3-4-7-6.

[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

35
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,152

[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

37
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:36,632
[SPEAKER_09]: 2-3-4-1-2.

38
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:52,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam Dash and Associates Attorneys at Law.

39
00:01:53,814 --> 00:02:03,280
[SPEAKER_09]: This paper has been before us a number of times, so unless counselors need a reminder, I'm happy to hand it over to Attorney Dash, yep, you're good, to provide us with an update on where we stand.

40
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:11,052
[SPEAKER_16]: attorney Adam Dash, 48 Grove Street in Somerville with me are Jerry and Janet Alves back there.

41
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:15,536
[SPEAKER_16]: We have been working on a draft agreement with staff.

42
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:21,621
[SPEAKER_16]: I would note that the, I believe that the substance is pretty much all set and I'm gonna tell you what it is.

43
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:27,545
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't, from talking to staff just before tonight, I was told that it is not in final form.

44
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:30,588
[SPEAKER_16]: So a little disappointing, but that is where we are.

45
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,611
[SPEAKER_16]: If staff are on on the call, they can probably weigh in on it.

46
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:43,581
[SPEAKER_16]: I did want to note that I do want to at least explain it to you 1 last time, because I know a lot of you put a lot of time into this and been very gracious to have us here and won't be here going forward.

47
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,624
[SPEAKER_16]: So just give you 1 last opportunity on this that.

48
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:55,698
[SPEAKER_16]: The amendment was to allow the offices to seek to build three units on the property that would be subdivided into two lots.

49
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:59,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Currently, the city has a deed restriction preventing any new units or any subdivisions.

50
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, this amendment would not allow any further subdivision.

51
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:04,930
[SPEAKER_16]: It would not allow any further units.

52
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,154
[SPEAKER_16]: It would just be one subdivision, three units, and the restriction would continue on in all of their forms.

53
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:14,257
[SPEAKER_16]: The amendment does not mean that the office is gonna actually build anything.

54
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:17,980
[SPEAKER_16]: It just allows them to go through the normal permitting process like everybody else.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,441
[SPEAKER_16]: There'll be public hearings and all of that.

56
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:26,326
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe they get the permits, maybe they don't, but they can't even do that unless the amendment and the restriction is amended.

57
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:44,758
[SPEAKER_16]: In exchange for the restriction, the Alvarez's would pay an amount to the city in lieu of providing the affordable unit on site so the city could build affordable housing elsewhere so the Alvarez's disabled son and the sister-in-law themselves could live in the new units as they may not legally qualify or win the lottery to get the units.

58
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:54,284
[SPEAKER_16]: So the amount in payment in lieu, we did work talk to the city and it is in this agreement draft would be the difference between the fair market value of a three bedroom unit

59
00:03:55,023 --> 00:04:07,426
[SPEAKER_16]: and the value of that unit as an 80% affordable, and that delta would be the payment, so that there's no profit from the unit going to the offices, and then that money would go to the city for building affordable housing elsewhere.

60
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,087
[SPEAKER_16]: That is not in contention.

61
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:16,769
[SPEAKER_16]: So I suppose one thing one could do is, and I'm not pushing for anything, but if one wanted to, I suppose,

62
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:25,863
[SPEAKER_16]: the council could vote to approve this pending this working out a deal working out the finality of the agreement with the staff or could kick it to January.

63
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:28,843
[SPEAKER_16]: I sort of leave it to you.

64
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:36,205
[SPEAKER_16]: I would just like to, obviously, since you've all been involved in this, to explain it to a whole bunch of new people is not really what I would like to do, but we will, obviously, if that's your pleasure.

65
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:40,986
[SPEAKER_16]: And I guess this just came up before pretty much I went to dinner and came over here.

66
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:45,547
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't really have a whole lot more to say other than that, but that's where we are with it.

67
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:47,768
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the substance is pretty much done.

68
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,669
[SPEAKER_16]: The main detail I think outstanding is the timing of the payment.

69
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:59,330
[SPEAKER_16]: is that the certificate of issuance of certificate of occupancy, they won't have any money because they won't have sold a unit to get the money to pay the city.

70
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:01,913
[SPEAKER_16]: So certificate of occupancy doesn't really do it.

71
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:09,882
[SPEAKER_16]: On the other hand, I understand the city's position, which is, if we if you wait till they sell the unit, what if they never sold a unit forever in the city would never get the money.

72
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,284
[SPEAKER_16]: I get everyone gets each other's point here.

73
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:13,666
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's got to be a solution here.

74
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:14,186
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't

75
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:16,727
[SPEAKER_16]: today, this afternoon, tell you what that is.

76
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,608
[SPEAKER_16]: But that is if anyone has a bright idea, I'm happy to hear.

77
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:21,829
[SPEAKER_16]: But that is the situation that we're in.

78
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:27,710
[SPEAKER_16]: And as far as I understand, that is, in my mind, the only thing that's left unless staff has another issue that I'm not picking up on.

79
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Attorney Dash.

80
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,571
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have Director Hunt on the call.

81
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:35,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to offer that perspective or any comments.

82
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, madam president.

83
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:43,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So, basically, we do think that there is a place here.

84
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:46,959
[SPEAKER_01]: We can come to an agreement where there would be a payment to the city.

85
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:53,732
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Affordable Housing Trust in lieu of actually creating an affordable unit.

86
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:56,475
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that the logistics, everything of that would be easier.

87
00:05:56,935 --> 00:06:03,621
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not yet worked out exactly how much that payment would be, what the terms, at what point in the process that would be.

88
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:07,285
[SPEAKER_01]: In my mind, that is really important to

89
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:11,808
[SPEAKER_01]: approving this is that we have to have this fully worked out here.

90
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:25,335
[SPEAKER_01]: He is correct that this doesn't permit anything to actually get built, but we can't condition any of the permitting pieces on this kind of a payment in lieu of an affordable housing unit.

91
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:35,381
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be pretty significant, whereas we can condition the lifting of the waiver or lifting of the requirement for the restriction, sorry,

92
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:44,912
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually a very reasonable thing to condition the lifting of the restriction on a payment like this.

93
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:50,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I will mention that senior planner Danielle Evans is waiting to get let in the Zoom room.

94
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,103
[SPEAKER_01]: She's actually the one who's been working on this the most.

95
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,042
[SPEAKER_01]: and has previous experience with things like this from other communities.

96
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:05,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't see that there's very much to inform other counselors on the new counselors.

97
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of them are very familiar with this already.

98
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:17,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would be more comfortable having the council vote once we have a fully negotiated agreement.

99
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:21,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I will point out that the agreement we're looking at has to have the mayor's signature.

100
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:25,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have not yet had a chance to bring the mayor up to speed on this as well.

101
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:30,981
[SPEAKER_01]: She was waiting to see what details we could work out before she sort of dug into it.

102
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:32,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So she hasn't seen.

103
00:07:32,922 --> 00:07:35,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I did send her the document.

104
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:37,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say I haven't heard back from her.

105
00:07:37,987 --> 00:07:41,630
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume she hasn't yet had a chance to see it since I sent it to her.

106
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:48,302
[SPEAKER_01]: So my preference would be for the council to table this and to vote with the new council.

107
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:55,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll have the same turnout, but we would actually have a fully written out documented agreement.

108
00:07:56,567 --> 00:08:01,230
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have attorney Sharon Everett on the line who has been our

109
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,431
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney on this.

110
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if she has anything additional to add.

111
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:12,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So I certainly asked her about the portion that this is a public hearing and the members of the council will be turning over.

112
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:20,538
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do not need a public hearing in order to approve the changing of the restriction.

113
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:23,139
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a simple majority vote of the city council.

114
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks.

115
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

116
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:27,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Mayor and Councilor Knight.

117
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd just like to ask Attorney Dash, how are you?

118
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to see you again.

119
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:36,463
[SPEAKER_10]: How long have the process has been for the applicants from start to recount?

120
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,945
[SPEAKER_10]: How long ago did they initiate this process?

121
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:40,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Four years or something like that.

122
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:41,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you say that again?

123
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:42,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Four years?

124
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:43,887
[SPEAKER_16]: About four years we've been working on this.

125
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:49,171
[SPEAKER_16]: We tried to do a lot of research with the city to figure out why the restriction existed in the first place.

126
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:52,673
[SPEAKER_16]: And we put in some public records requests and I got a bunch of documents.

127
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:54,354
[SPEAKER_16]: There is no answer to that question.

128
00:08:55,394 --> 00:09:12,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody I've talked to, retired people in the city who were there at the time, people I've been referred to from people I've been referred to from people I've been referred to in various departments, all the documents that I've gotten, speaking with the law department when there was a city solicitor, nobody had an answer as to why this restriction existed.

129
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:14,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Because before I came to you, I wanted to know why it was there.

130
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,925
[SPEAKER_16]: So that would certainly inform how we proceeded.

131
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:21,167
[SPEAKER_16]: And then that took us a very long time.

132
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:30,450
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we did circle through with the mayor's staff and made sure that if the mayor conceptually was on board with this, because if the mayor was not conceptually on board with this idea, we weren't going to bother you with it.

133
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,832
[SPEAKER_16]: So we got sort of that green light to go forward with the understanding she, of course, hasn't seen the final document.

134
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:39,523
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, this all took a lot of time.

135
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Have there been any significant delays coming relative to the legal aspect of this?

136
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:45,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we don't have legal counsel or city solicitors.

137
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:49,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we were... You've got to wait three days to get somebody to call you back, four days, five days a week.

138
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:56,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, ultimately what I'm hearing is that they started the process four years ago, and at some point it's going to present some sort of economic hardship.

139
00:09:57,094 --> 00:10:04,119
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, we can only hold people over a barrel for so long as they try to shake them down in a negotiation going on in another department over here.

140
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:13,606
[SPEAKER_10]: But if this is just an issue, whether or not the council feels they should change the deed of restriction, I don't see why we should be the ones to hold them.

141
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:18,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we're almost there, to at least this point, in that we're

142
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:23,809
[SPEAKER_16]: And that, since Attorney Everett's been on here, we've been making progress, as you can see.

143
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,672
[SPEAKER_10]: In full disclosure, I live on Movement Street.

144
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:26,373
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

145
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:27,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at number 200.

146
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:30,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm probably three football fields, four football fields away.

147
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:31,840
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a direct butterer.

148
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,360
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a butterer.

149
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,141
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a butterer.

150
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:35,504
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, just in the interest of disclosure, I'd like to say that.

151
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:36,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a motion?

152
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:38,417
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a motion, it's more of a question.

153
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:41,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, at this point, Councilor, this is my last meeting, I'm a lame duck Councilor.

154
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to bring any racial items forward at this point.

155
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:53,149
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I just kind of find it curious that, you know, it's taken these hardworking individuals in this community four years to get this process really rolling.

156
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,672
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say COVID delayed us a little bit too.

157
00:10:57,688 --> 00:11:00,470
[SPEAKER_16]: May I give you that line, too?

158
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,812
[SPEAKER_18]: I would motion to, well, I don't want to.

159
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:09,395
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll let you speak, but after you speak, I'm going to motion to table to a date, sir.

160
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:13,432
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

161
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:18,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Dasch, I know that one of the questions that was brought forth was the turnaround for the fire truck.

162
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:20,554
[SPEAKER_17]: That was a big issue, but that was resolved.

163
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:20,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

164
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:23,734
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, I think the biggest issue is really moving this forward.

165
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:30,956
[SPEAKER_17]: Something that I believe what the family had mentioned at the beginning, that it was a hardship due to a family member.

166
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,457
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the reason.

167
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:33,037
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that

168
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:39,829
[SPEAKER_17]: I know my fellow counsel is going to table it, so he allowed me to speak.

169
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:50,261
[SPEAKER_17]: I would move it on the vote, but obviously I don't think it will have the vote, so I just think that we have a new council coming in.

170
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,686
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that if we can bring them up to speed and

171
00:11:55,464 --> 00:12:03,151
[SPEAKER_17]: hope for the first meeting in January we get this passed, because this is, I still don't, I don't see why it's an issue that we can't move this forward.

172
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:07,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it seems like in good faith, we're, we're, we're going above and beyond.

173
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:17,623
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I look at this in a sense that we're kind of holding the Alps hostage here, in a sense that we're, you know, what we're asking them to do, we're going above and beyond right now.

174
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:21,527
[SPEAKER_17]: And it seems like the city has really, really just

175
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:27,058
[SPEAKER_17]: waste a lot of people's time not getting the answers to the right people.

176
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:31,584
[SPEAKER_17]: To hear the fact the mayor hasn't even seen this yet is a little bothersome to me.

177
00:12:31,924 --> 00:12:35,810
[SPEAKER_17]: That to me is just, you know, no disrespect in any way, but

178
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:37,843
[SPEAKER_17]: attorneys are expensive, correct?

179
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:40,984
[SPEAKER_17]: And everybody has to make a living.

180
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:47,126
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're talking about amount of time that's being spent by the Alice family to try to get this push forward for a good reason.

181
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:59,089
[SPEAKER_17]: And in even having the open dialogue and doing something that I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't, you know, allow myself to sort of be bullied to try to make this happen.

182
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:02,991
[SPEAKER_17]: This should be something our community should be looking to assist each other.

183
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,171
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, um,

184
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:11,908
[SPEAKER_17]: know, I just I'm a little confused why we can't move this forward in the sense of a time sensitive situation.

185
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:14,150
[SPEAKER_17]: So, but I'll leave it at that.

186
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

187
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

188
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:17,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Morell.

189
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:19,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being before us again.

190
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:23,275
[SPEAKER_03]: We always appreciate you keeping us updated meeting after meeting.

191
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:27,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I would second the motion to table this to a date certain, and I certainly appreciate it.

192
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:33,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've put time into keeping us briefed on where negotiations and putting together the agreement is at.

193
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:51,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you've done a wonderful job of putting the project into scope pretty efficiently for us in the past, and it's my hope that if we meet on this at our first or second regular meeting in January with those final details ironed out, hopefully we can approve this and dispense with it and get you and the offices on to the next step.

194
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:52,818
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be great.

195
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,262
[SPEAKER_16]: I would note and also for the record that I think staff and everybody in the city has been working in good faith on this.

196
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:58,223
[SPEAKER_16]: As you can see, it's just.

197
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:07,170
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an unusual request, and there's not a whole lot of there's no playbook for this, so it's been a little difficult to figure out how to proceed, but we're almost there.

198
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:08,631
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

199
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:12,454
[SPEAKER_18]: I would make the motion to table to January 9th our date certain.

200
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:13,907
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

201
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:14,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

202
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:16,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Morell.

203
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:22,995
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to thank you, Attorney Dashin, to the Alves family for being so patient and negotiating in good faith with this.

204
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,261
[SPEAKER_15]: If I were the family, I'd feel super frustrated with how long this has taken.

205
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:37,028
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to accidentally undercut the Planning Department's positions on any of this.

206
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:48,579
[SPEAKER_15]: I know this is new territory for you all to chart, so I would like to know if January 9th is a realistic date, because I would want to vote this out by then.

207
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think January 9th is a realistic date?

208
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:55,601
[SPEAKER_16]: It is for me, because I can hop on as quick as I can.

209
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:59,002
[SPEAKER_16]: I suppose that's more a question for Director Hunt and her staff.

210
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:01,503
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have Planner Evans on the call as well.

211
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:10,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Danielle, is there anything you'd like to add?

212
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:17,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so we are working on a cash payment calculation.

213
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:25,583
[SPEAKER_11]: and the timing of when it would need to be made, and we're still trying to iron out those details.

214
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:31,647
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we are very close, but we want it to be a nice, clean boat.

215
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:40,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, there was an RFP to develop this when the city was

216
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:45,394
[SPEAKER_11]: selling the property, and even that cannot be found.

217
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:52,597
[SPEAKER_11]: So it might be somewhere, but I know Attorney Dash has been unable to find it.

218
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:57,099
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm trying to have as few pieces of paper and votes floating around.

219
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:01,181
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be one clean vote, then it'd be easier to track.

220
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:02,761
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is our preference.

221
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:07,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

222
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:11,874
[SPEAKER_16]: I suppose if staff feels that we can wrap it up by January 9th week on our end, we certainly can.

223
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:16,877
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a motion to table to January 9th for vices affair, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

224
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:20,219
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

225
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:21,700
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

226
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes, table to January 9th.

227
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:23,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

228
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:24,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you again.

229
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,283
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you for your service for those of you who are not continuing.

230
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:28,624
[SPEAKER_16]: You've done a good job.

231
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:29,424
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's difficult.

232
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:32,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and you know how difficult it can be.

233
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:32,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good night.

234
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

235
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:37,654
[SPEAKER_09]: 23474, correct? 23474.

236
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:56,523
[SPEAKER_09]: offered by vices and bears, whereas the election commission voted 3-1 to postpone discussion of the council's request for a report on the 2023 election issues to the commission's January 2024 meeting.

237
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:16,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that a report be placed on the reports due slash deadline section of the council agenda titled 2023 Municipal Election Process Errors and Accountability Report with the deadline of the January 23rd, 2024 regular meeting for a presentation by elections manager Ripley and election commissioner chairperson Miller.

238
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:19,919
[SPEAKER_09]: be it further resolved that the council adds the following requests to that report.

239
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:26,143
[SPEAKER_09]: One, any issues with the process for filing for a recount and why it took so long for the candidates and the public to be notified.

240
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:29,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, any process issues in preparation for the recount.

241
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:38,453
[SPEAKER_09]: And three, what systems will be put in place to ensure prompt and timely notification of any issues or errors to the public to ensure trust is maintained when errors are made.

242
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:39,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Mayor.

243
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:40,494
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam President.

244
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:44,077
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an amendment or addendum to the previous resolution.

245
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:48,450
[SPEAKER_18]: from November 14th that we joined with Councilor Scarpelli as well.

246
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,754
[SPEAKER_18]: There was one from Councilor Caraviello, President Morell and I, one from Councilor Scarpelli.

247
00:17:53,594 --> 00:18:04,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Those were referred to the Elections Commission and the Elections Commission voted 3 to 1 to postpone their discussion of the item until their January meeting.

248
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:09,368
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not particularly happy that that decision was made.

249
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:09,809
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think

250
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:12,785
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think this should be something that waits.

251
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:23,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Many of us here spent some time at City Hall on December 9th for the first and what happened to be the only day of the recount.

252
00:18:25,874 --> 00:18:40,303
[SPEAKER_18]: While the results of the recount did not change in any way the results of the election, I think what was found to be inaccurate was significant and concerning in the sense that if the election had been close or if any of the races had been close,

253
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:44,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Those numbers could have changed the results of an election.

254
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:53,926
[SPEAKER_18]: almost 130 ballots in one precinct that somehow didn't get counted in the unofficial count, right?

255
00:18:54,046 --> 00:19:13,551
[SPEAKER_18]: So in addition to everything that was in the resolution that we passed November 14th, which had to do with all of the things that happened that we knew at the time had happened up until election day and on election night, the recount also did expose a couple of other items for consideration.

256
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:17,952
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's incredibly important to the community that

257
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:24,817
[SPEAKER_18]: We have answers to those questions and answers to the process and fixes to the process and staffing and resources in that department.

258
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:31,683
[SPEAKER_18]: So that we have confidence that, number one, mistakes that were made in the past aren't going to be made again.

259
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:38,830
[SPEAKER_18]: And number two, when mistakes happen, which in any human endeavor is inevitable that there will be things that go wrong.

260
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:43,304
[SPEAKER_18]: the public is made aware and the candidates are made aware right away.

261
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:45,185
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's really the most important thing.

262
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:59,337
[SPEAKER_18]: I know in the past when issues did occur, you know, and I haven't been involved as long as some other folks here, but Sandy Gale, Clark Hurtubise, others really did try to get the word out right away.

263
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:00,238
[SPEAKER_18]: We had this issue.

264
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:01,699
[SPEAKER_18]: We want you to know what the issue was.

265
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:02,379
[SPEAKER_18]: We want you to know

266
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,982
[SPEAKER_18]: how we tried to address it, or who we brought in to help address it.

267
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:08,324
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that Finn had done similar things as well.

268
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:12,648
[SPEAKER_18]: And that has to be how our elections offices operate, right?

269
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:16,151
[SPEAKER_18]: If there is an issue, you get the word out right away.

270
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:24,298
[SPEAKER_18]: The operating procedure can't be that if there's an issue, you try to fix it without anyone noticing, because that just does not bring trust.

271
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:24,758
[SPEAKER_18]: So

272
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:36,085
[SPEAKER_18]: putting this on, formally putting on an item for this report to be on our agenda with the deadline of January 23rd, which is our first regular meeting after the next election commission meeting.

273
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:41,948
[SPEAKER_18]: But I am disappointed that the election commission, I believe their rationale was that they had to plan for the recount.

274
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:42,749
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand that.

275
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:50,953
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish they had had, uh, that they had considered an issue to response to this report in a more timely manner because there's an election in March.

276
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,054
[SPEAKER_18]: The presidential primaries in March.

277
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:54,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

278
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:55,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

279
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:56,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

280
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate you bringing this forward.

281
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:22,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Bears, we've spoken at length already in previous council meetings about the original reasons for bringing forward the request for an election postmortem and report, the errors and mishandlings that happened on election day, which again, were addressed, which should not have happened, and we need to know exactly how they won't happen again.

282
00:21:24,144 --> 00:21:34,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the issues and mishandlings that happened leading up to the recount and needing a full accounting of why those happened and how exactly we'll know they won't happen again.

283
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:44,273
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, this is on the institutional scale, an example of people don't plan to fail, they fail to plan.

284
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:48,495
[SPEAKER_03]: We've discussed how going into this election,

285
00:21:49,147 --> 00:21:57,192
[SPEAKER_03]: There were serious concerns about the capacity of the elections department because its staffing had dropped so low below its previous levels.

286
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:03,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we really need to see, we need to see the diagnostic of what exactly happened and why.

287
00:22:04,597 --> 00:22:05,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to investigate.

288
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:26,130
[SPEAKER_03]: First, the Elections Commission, the Elections Department, and then as a community, as a council, we need to investigate what needs to happen so that we can go into our three very consequential elections in 2024 with the Elections Office and the Elections Commission feeling professional and organized and competent so that every voter and every resident in Medford can feel confident.

289
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,151
[SPEAKER_03]: about the three, again, very consequential elections that we will have in 2024.

290
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:44,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think it bears emphasizing that by the time that we hear back from the Elections Commission at our January meeting, it will be less than two months until the first of those three elections.

291
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:54,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think everybody shares a sense of disappointment that it's necessary to have this conversation at all, that it's necessary to put a deadline on it because we haven't gotten a

292
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:57,565
[SPEAKER_03]: really any response so far.

293
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:09,772
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it takes imposing accountability at the outset until this commission and the department can be imposing accountability from within, it's non-negotiable.

294
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

295
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:11,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

296
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:13,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from councilors?

297
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:14,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President?

298
00:23:14,555 --> 00:23:15,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Cabral.

299
00:23:15,256 --> 00:23:16,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

300
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:21,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Board of Integrity is probably our utmost right in our country.

301
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,182
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what our country was founded on, is people's rights to vote.

302
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,020
[SPEAKER_13]: People have died for the right to vote.

303
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:35,643
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't understand why it's going to take a whole nother month to figure out what went wrong when everybody in this room knows what went wrong.

304
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:41,385
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a little disappointed in that, and that'll be up for the new group to do.

305
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:51,948
[SPEAKER_13]: But when people keep getting calls saying, I'm never voting in the city of Medford again, it's a shame, because that's not how it's supposed to be, never how it ever should be.

306
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:53,449
[SPEAKER_13]: We made mistakes.

307
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:56,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's, everybody knows what the mistakes are.

308
00:23:56,612 --> 00:23:59,613
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't need another month to wait and figure out what we did wrong.

309
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:02,254
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be, it should be being addressed now.

310
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:04,915
[SPEAKER_13]: The coverup is always worse than the crime, Madam President.

311
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:06,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

312
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:07,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

313
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:08,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, thank you very much.

314
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:10,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello is absolutely right.

315
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,857
[SPEAKER_10]: The coverup is always worse than the crime.

316
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,738
[SPEAKER_10]: And Councilor Bearsley is right.

317
00:24:14,938 --> 00:24:18,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust in the public process is paramount, especially when it comes to elections.

318
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,821
[SPEAKER_10]: So why is it that we have an elections commission that's going to go hide under their bed?

319
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:26,724
[SPEAKER_10]: when the largest issue in this community has come up in a very long time.

320
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:39,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand how an election commission can vote 3 to 1 to postpone reporting back to this community the flaws and errors that occurred during their mismanagement and incompetency following that election.

321
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:45,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I sat up here the evening of the election, and I heard them read off the figures.

322
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:48,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard them read off the total vote count.

323
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,741
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said to myself, you're missing

324
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:54,488
[SPEAKER_10]: like 4,000 votes.

325
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:55,308
[SPEAKER_10]: You're wrong.

326
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:57,390
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know what you're talking about, counselor.

327
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,530
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know what you're talking about.

328
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:00,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I know one plus one equals two.

329
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:03,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I know one plus one equals two.

330
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:07,837
[SPEAKER_10]: The way that election was handled was the most embarrassing sight I've seen in a long time.

331
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:10,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I worked on political campaigns since I was seven years old.

332
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never seen anything handled like that before in my life.

333
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:19,084
[SPEAKER_10]: The elections manager was not in this room the whole entire night.

334
00:25:19,265 --> 00:25:22,767
[SPEAKER_10]: I was here from 8.05 until almost one o'clock in the morning

335
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:25,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And the elections manager was nowhere to be seen.

336
00:25:26,856 --> 00:25:30,940
[SPEAKER_10]: All the vote totals in bags, unattended, all over this room.

337
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:37,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Individual members of the election commission, unsupervised, alone, going through the bags, looking through them, rifling through them.

338
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:39,967
[SPEAKER_10]: And you wonder why stuff is going missing.

339
00:25:40,328 --> 00:25:42,429
[SPEAKER_10]: You wonder why we can't put it together, Madam President.

340
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,132
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the biggest embarrassment I've ever seen in my life.

341
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:51,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, shockingly, we do have a CEO in this community.

342
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:58,528
[SPEAKER_10]: who's been extremely quiet, extremely quiet about what happened during this election.

343
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Which leads me to believe that this behavior is something that's acceptable with this current administration.

344
00:26:08,494 --> 00:26:19,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know if it were me, and the integrity of my election would be brought into question, I'd be sure that the department heads and the board members

345
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:27,271
[SPEAKER_10]: by way of which I appointed personally, because I'm the mayor, would have their heads rolling down the street.

346
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:37,060
[SPEAKER_10]: The way that they treated election day volunteers, people that wanted to participate in the process and be involved, was shameful.

347
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:49,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And for them to now vote, to postpone the discussion, just tells you what kind of culture we have here at City Hall, Madam President.

348
00:26:50,728 --> 00:26:51,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

349
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the council to bring this people.

350
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:55,073
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

351
00:26:55,213 --> 00:27:04,224
[SPEAKER_17]: If Council Vice President would entertain, could we add something to the motion?

352
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:08,730
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to get the attendance record for all of the members on the Election Commission.

353
00:27:09,923 --> 00:27:10,563
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's important.

354
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:11,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I think that's important.

355
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:17,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, from what I gather, we don't have too many members that are actually committed to that commission.

356
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:20,486
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think we're taking it as serious as we should.

357
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:23,867
[SPEAKER_17]: My biggest piece with this situation is accountability.

358
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,209
[SPEAKER_17]: We've seen very, very good people be marched out that door.

359
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:32,430
[SPEAKER_17]: But not even a quarter of the concerns that we've we've

360
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:42,922
[SPEAKER_17]: or understand any process that has gone on is a disgrace.

361
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,525
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't heard from one commissioner.

362
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:56,654
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't heard from anybody except for the coordinator who sent us a message saying that the election is now certified.

363
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:12,572
[SPEAKER_17]: And like Councilor Caraviello said, my biggest problem is when I was a young man, when I was in high school, everybody had a mandatory class called civics.

364
00:28:13,313 --> 00:28:14,575
[SPEAKER_17]: And you learned about our government.

365
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:18,440
[SPEAKER_17]: You learned about the respect you should give this process.

366
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:24,533
[SPEAKER_17]: I still remember my son just left a minute ago.

367
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:34,680
[SPEAKER_17]: We talked about how Mrs. Lasky ran the fourth grade presidential election in her classroom and how important everything was and how organized everything should be.

368
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:42,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish Mrs. Lasky ran this last election because Councilor Caraviello again is right.

369
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:43,446
[SPEAKER_17]: When people don't want to vote,

370
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:52,480
[SPEAKER_17]: good people, good hardworking people that took pride in coming to that ballot box every municipal election.

371
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,261
[SPEAKER_17]: They've looked me in the eye and said, they'll never vote again.

372
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:57,222
[SPEAKER_17]: They have no faith.

373
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:03,345
[SPEAKER_17]: And I truly thought that maybe coming out ahead of this could have helped that.

374
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:05,846
[SPEAKER_17]: But instead, we just fed into the rhetoric.

375
00:29:07,227 --> 00:29:09,728
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said it the day that we had the first issue.

376
00:29:09,788 --> 00:29:10,228
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, what?

377
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:11,749
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, be careful.

378
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:17,683
[SPEAKER_17]: because perception is reality and it's exactly what happened.

379
00:29:19,284 --> 00:29:33,050
[SPEAKER_17]: So moving forward, I know that we'll have a new council, but I think as this council looks to move people forward and look at our budgetary processes, we have to start looking for people.

380
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,852
[SPEAKER_17]: If the city administration is not going to hold people accountable, then we're going to have to make sure that they

381
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:44,166
[SPEAKER_17]: that they know that this council is going to be strong enough to make sure they hold their people to the feet of the fire.

382
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:48,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Because this has been an absolute laughingstock across the commonwealth.

383
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:56,696
[SPEAKER_17]: And the fact, I'll be honest with you, I'm disgusted with the Secretary of State's office.

384
00:29:57,737 --> 00:29:59,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Reached out to them, haven't heard anything.

385
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,181
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what they're all about.

386
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:11,486
[SPEAKER_17]: If this is what the Secretary of State and our governor sees that that's appropriate, look what's happening.

387
00:30:12,808 --> 00:30:13,850
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a trickle-down effect.

388
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, who knows how many people aren't going to come out for the next elections.

389
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:20,042
[SPEAKER_17]: And why?

390
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:21,904
[SPEAKER_17]: No one's told us anything.

391
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:22,764
[SPEAKER_17]: No one's even talked to me.

392
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:36,173
[SPEAKER_17]: I got a bunch of fluffy, I'm getting a lot of emails, fluffy emails, you know, wishing me luck, a happy birthday, a congratulations, but no one is still from that commission's talked to me about, George, this is what's going on.

393
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,835
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're good people.

394
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:46,019
[SPEAKER_17]: And then for the recount, I know I wasn't there, but I,

395
00:30:47,188 --> 00:30:52,471
[SPEAKER_17]: I talked to a few people that came here, gave their time to help with the process.

396
00:30:53,151 --> 00:31:11,662
[SPEAKER_17]: And I heard our coordinator, our elections coordinator was verbally getting in people's faces and disrespecting people to the point where the attorney from the from the candidate side had to step in and say, Please do not address any of our people.

397
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:13,123
[SPEAKER_17]: Talk to me.

398
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:15,024
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a disgrace.

399
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:21,116
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a lot more that's going to go on in that meeting when they come back.

400
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:32,160
[SPEAKER_17]: But my biggest thing right now is, and a lot of people that have talked to him on every side, every side, this isn't just, you know, the George Scarpelli side, this is every side.

401
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:38,123
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody's watching to see where the accountability pieces.

402
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:40,384
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what everybody's waiting to see.

403
00:31:41,744 --> 00:31:43,985
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you want to give them benefit of the doubt until the January 29.

404
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:44,205
[SPEAKER_17]: So be it.

405
00:31:47,705 --> 00:32:00,329
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you're gonna come up to that podium on January 29th and give us fluff, be prepared, because this one counselor is gonna ask some serious questions, and I'm gonna be calling people out directly.

406
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:07,891
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you, Madam President, and I rest my case.

407
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:08,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

408
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:09,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

409
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, thank you.

410
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:19,806
[SPEAKER_13]: If Councilor Bears wouldn't mind amending this to put one more thing on that, to why it took almost five hours to shut off the central tabulator.

411
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:28,171
[SPEAKER_13]: When all machines are supposed to be shut off at eight o'clock, why did it take till almost one o'clock in the morning for them to shut down the central tabulator?

412
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:31,773
[SPEAKER_13]: And make that phone, if you wouldn't mind adding that onto that.

413
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:33,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

414
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from Councilors?

415
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:36,661
[SPEAKER_18]: What was that?

416
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:38,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you say give them a raise, Councilor?

417
00:32:38,382 --> 00:32:39,203
[SPEAKER_18]: I missed that.

418
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:39,923
[SPEAKER_18]: What was that?

419
00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:41,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to approve as amended.

420
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:42,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam President.

421
00:32:42,445 --> 00:32:43,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

422
00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:49,409
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion by Vice-President Bears, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, and amended by Councilor Caraviello.

423
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:50,590
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favour?

424
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:51,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

425
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

426
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

427
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,013
[SPEAKER_09]: The next resolution is for me, unless Councilors object.

428
00:32:56,073 --> 00:32:56,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's for you, Chair.

429
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:05,875
[SPEAKER_09]: 23475, offered by President Morell, be it so resolved that the council explore and consider language for an ordinance regulating blasting and earth removal within the city.

430
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:07,397
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something...

431
00:33:18,506 --> 00:33:25,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't call for participation, but no, I didn't know, but you always can't.

432
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:32,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you want to wait for participation or counselors, I know we, yeah, we'll get, yeah, we'll, we'll go back to it.

433
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:33,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

434
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:42,524
[SPEAKER_09]: 23475, offered by President Morell, be it so resolved that the council explore and consider language for an ordinance regulating blasting and earth removal within the city.

435
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:46,608
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something I already introduced, but apparently I didn't.

436
00:33:46,968 --> 00:34:00,039
[SPEAKER_09]: This was originally kicked off, of course, by the giant hole that exists, continues to exist, that's still not houses, on Winthrop Street, that we had myriad complaints about, lots of issues, and then I think was kicked off again as

437
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:24,564
[SPEAKER_09]: the we're looking at that deed restriction understanding there's a lot of ledge in that area my intention in this is not to this is obviously for the future my intention is not to say hey there's no blasting but just understanding that a lot of the issues relating from the Winthrop Street project is that we have nothing on the books as far as regulations and permits and steps that people have to follow when they're actually doing that so making sure we have some steps that make sure that our the

438
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:43,542
[SPEAKER_09]: residents and neighbors in the area aren't disturbed in the way that they were with the Winthrop Street project and it's done in a completely different way that respects our residents and make sure that we have permits approvals and process in place to make this a much better experience should it go forward in any place in the city than what happened on Winthrop Street.

439
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:45,724
[SPEAKER_09]: So, go ahead Councilor Tseng.

440
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:48,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you President Murrell for introducing this.

441
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:52,736
[SPEAKER_15]: As you might know, I'm very excited about this.

442
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:57,420
[SPEAKER_15]: I am very much looking forward to helping lead on this in the new council.

443
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:06,487
[SPEAKER_15]: What we saw with Winthrop Street is not acceptable to the residents of the city, and we need more safeguards for future action.

444
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:16,014
[SPEAKER_15]: We know that the housing market is hot, and it's becoming more profitable to blast off ledge and build more housing.

445
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:34,443
[SPEAKER_15]: We just need more community engagement, more community conversations about what that process looks like, informing residents of what to expect, having regulations of best practices, basically taking lessons that we've learned from the Winthrop Street Project to future projects.

446
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:37,044
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm very grateful that you introduced this.

447
00:35:37,424 --> 00:35:37,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

448
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:38,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

449
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:39,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

450
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Something I brought up about six months ago was this, the Wimper Street project.

451
00:35:43,703 --> 00:35:46,005
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, blasting is never a good thing, you know.

452
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:49,108
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, most people blast a day here or there, and that's about it.

453
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,930
[SPEAKER_13]: This company's been blasting nine years.

454
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:53,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Nine years.

455
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:54,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

456
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:56,674
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a commercial business.

457
00:35:57,014 --> 00:35:58,195
[SPEAKER_13]: They are selling the rock.

458
00:35:58,996 --> 00:35:59,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

459
00:35:59,716 --> 00:36:01,578
[SPEAKER_13]: They should be taxed as a commercial business.

460
00:36:02,058 --> 00:36:03,739
[SPEAKER_13]: They're paying on an open space of land.

461
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:15,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank you for putting this forward and I hope that this never happens again, what happened at Winthrop Street, because you live there, other people we know live there, and that's not even close to even stopping.

462
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:17,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they keep, the rock just keeps coming out of there.

463
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,260
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll be lucky if you still be living.

464
00:36:21,321 --> 00:36:22,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Your son will be 10.

465
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:26,682
[SPEAKER_13]: He'll be living in one of those houses by the time the rocket's done.

466
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:28,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

467
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam President, motion to refer to the Zoning Planning and Development Subcommittee.

468
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:33,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the Councilors?

469
00:36:34,623 --> 00:36:36,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Any members of the public wish to speak on this?

470
00:36:36,764 --> 00:36:41,545
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Bears to revert to the Zoning Subcommittee, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

471
00:36:41,745 --> 00:36:42,445
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

472
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:42,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

473
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:43,645
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

474
00:36:43,685 --> 00:36:44,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

475
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:45,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to 23476.

476
00:36:49,295 --> 00:37:17,212
[SPEAKER_09]: To Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, regarding Community Preservation Committee appropriation requests, on behalf of the Community Preservation Committee, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body approve the following recommendations of the Community Preservation Committee, requesting the appropriation of $115,000 from the CPA General Reserve to the Royal House Enslaved Quarters for the Royal House Roof and Gutter Restoration Project, requesting the appropriation of $145,000 from the CPA General Fund to Shiloh Baptist Church,

477
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:19,686
[SPEAKER_09]: for the Shiloh Baptist Church construction project.

478
00:37:20,086 --> 00:37:22,567
[SPEAKER_09]: The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund.

479
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,269
[SPEAKER_09]: The CPC recommendation letters are attached and incorporated.

480
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:26,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your consideration.

481
00:37:26,749 --> 00:37:30,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Respectfully submitted, Brown, Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

482
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:32,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Any discussion, questions from the Council?

483
00:37:33,113 --> 00:37:33,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have Teresa here.

484
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:41,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, motion of Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

485
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Clerk, apologies, please call the roll.

486
00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:48,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

487
00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:54,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

488
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:54,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

489
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

490
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:03,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

491
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

492
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:09,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

493

7.

494
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:10,631
[SPEAKER_08]: The affirmative.

495
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:11,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any negative?

496
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:12,271
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

497
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:15,052
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam President, while we're on suspension, motion to take public participation.

498
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:20,020
[SPEAKER_09]: second by Councilor Tseng all those in favor.

499
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,081
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

500
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:21,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

501
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:23,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Public participation.

502
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:26,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Melanie, if you'd like to.

503
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:29,470
[SPEAKER_09]: In general, but I mean, yeah.

504
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:31,472
[SPEAKER_09]: In general, but.

505
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:37,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street.

506
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:54,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually one of the candidates that requested the recount of the recent election, and I just want to recognize and appreciate Councilor Bears for adding those additions to the agenda this evening.

507
00:38:55,546 --> 00:39:01,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really important that we have integrity in our elections and that they're accurate.

508
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,969
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, I would like it noted that

509
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:11,324
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, after the election, there was a lot of discussion about the process.

510
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:20,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And though each one of these city council members agreed that there was an issue with the process, you all agreed that there was no change in the accuracy of the election.

511
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the election was not accurate.

512
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:24,214
[SPEAKER_02]: The,

513
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:30,252
[SPEAKER_02]: The outcomes may have not changed, but the accuracy was not accurate.

514
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:36,495
[SPEAKER_02]: We missed over 130 ballots that were not counted, which Councilor Bears had mentioned.

515
00:39:38,356 --> 00:39:43,018
[SPEAKER_02]: But in addition, and I think this is something that should be addressed, is that there was tabulations.

516
00:39:43,078 --> 00:39:51,241
[SPEAKER_02]: There were several precincts that had tabulations where there were more ballots counted than actually tallied than there were counted.

517
00:39:51,762 --> 00:39:53,702
[SPEAKER_02]: In two precincts, there was 40 ballots

518
00:39:55,183 --> 00:40:01,348
[SPEAKER_02]: more that were tallied than what was actually counted during the blocking process, and there was another precinct that had 50.

519
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:06,393
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, there were others that had smaller amounts of 11 and 15.

520
00:40:07,514 --> 00:40:10,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But that, to me, is a serious issue with the tabulation machines.

521
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:16,021
[SPEAKER_02]: So my hope is that somehow those will be addressed as well.

522
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:18,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

523
00:40:18,243 --> 00:40:18,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

524
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,820
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one more person.

525
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:29,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address the record, please.

526
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:31,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside at Medford.

527
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:34,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight, it's gonna be, I'm sorry to see you go.

528
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:37,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been a pleasure.

529
00:40:37,828 --> 00:40:39,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I had to pull myself away from- 

529
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,649
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have the nice words about counselors section coming up for the agenda too.

530
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:44,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you did that already.

531
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,171
[SPEAKER_09]: No, if you're up to say nice words about counselors, we're gonna do that next.

532
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:48,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

533
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:49,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Or words, or words.

534
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:51,432
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but other things too, I'm sorry.

535
00:40:52,172 --> 00:40:54,753
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was just gonna give him some, cause he was gonna end this before I could talk.

536
00:40:56,638 --> 00:41:01,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Transparency seems to be like a common theme here among my years in the city.

537
00:41:01,463 --> 00:41:02,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been here since 2014.

538
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:15,782
[SPEAKER_04]: This council was actually very much a proponent of trying to bring transparency back to a process with the 61 Locust Street project, to which I commend the council at the time, and some of you were still a part of that, which is great.

539
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:30,925
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I find out that through the grapevine that there's a potential for having 50 to 75 migrant families directly across the street from my house, sorry, diagonally across the street from my house on Riverside F in a commercial project.

540
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:34,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't heard anything about it.

541
00:41:35,017 --> 00:41:41,603
[SPEAKER_04]: So the good councilor Scarpelli's point about no transparency or lack of transparency from folks in the administration.

542
00:41:43,124 --> 00:41:50,530
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the CEO who was part of the council at that time of the 61 Locust Street project, who was very much a proponent of transparency from the city.

543
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:54,133
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to ask like, what is going on?

544
00:41:54,153 --> 00:41:59,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And can someone please make public the rumors that have been talked about?

545
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:02,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as a resident in an adjacent building,

546
00:42:03,464 --> 00:42:17,470
[SPEAKER_04]: and a neighborhood, and I know that my neighbors know nothing about this, it's kind of a big deal, especially because these sorts of things are also on the news, especially in New York City, where they can't handle what's happening to their properties.

547
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:22,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So this, I guess, is a commercial property that now we're going to all of a sudden start housing people in.

548
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:25,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to know what's going on because I live there.

549
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:29,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some of you don't, and it's not in your neighborhoods, but it is in mine.

550
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:33,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have two small kids at home, and so I'm concerned about things like safety.

551
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:36,360
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my number one thing that I'm concerned about.

552
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a good feel either way.

553
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:42,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that I'm opposed to it, but with no information, it seems like it's kind of underhanded.

554
00:42:42,764 --> 00:42:50,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of a theme that I'm seeing in this city's government to the point of two topics ago between elections and zoning, so on and so forth.

555
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:53,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd really appreciate some answers if someone can give it.

556
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:58,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's make this for the public record instead of just rumors.

557
00:42:58,954 --> 00:42:59,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

558
00:42:59,741 --> 00:43:00,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

559
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:01,102
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

560
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:09,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we received an email, Nate, that the state government is in the governor's executive office.

561
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:18,817
[SPEAKER_18]: The state government is in negotiations with a private property owner at that location for housing of migrant families.

562
00:43:18,977 --> 00:43:19,898
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all we know.

563
00:43:19,918 --> 00:43:27,584
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I believe that the mayor's email also said that they are trying to negotiate to have the city in some way involved in that process.

564
00:43:27,644 --> 00:43:28,165
[SPEAKER_18]: But right now,

565
00:43:28,803 --> 00:43:30,104
[SPEAKER_18]: the state and the private property.

566
00:43:30,124 --> 00:43:30,604
[SPEAKER_18]: I can read it.

567
00:43:31,084 --> 00:43:31,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

568
00:43:32,725 --> 00:43:34,146
[SPEAKER_18]: I can share this with you.

569
00:43:34,186 --> 00:43:34,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, that'd be great.

570
00:43:35,206 --> 00:43:36,347
[SPEAKER_17]: It says, temporary shelter.

571
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:40,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, representatives, senators, members of Medford City Council, Medford School Committee.

572
00:43:40,669 --> 00:43:43,590
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to give you all a heads up on an ever-evolving matter.

573
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,892
[SPEAKER_17]: At the end of last week, I was informed that 400 Riverside Ave was being explored.

574
00:43:49,572 --> 00:43:54,174
[SPEAKER_17]: as a possible temporary winter emergency shelter for migrant families on the wait list.

575
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:59,695
[SPEAKER_17]: The state was only going to pick one site from my recollection on a phone call.

576
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:04,876
[SPEAKER_17]: The families would only each stay a few nights before they would be transitioned.

577
00:44:05,736 --> 00:44:14,419
[SPEAKER_17]: The shelter was going to run through April and start with those families currently staying at 10 Park Plaza and may build up to no more than 75 families.

578
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:27,840
[SPEAKER_17]: The state, excuse me, 75, the state asked for a walkthrough today, and at the time, the Commissioner Rice relayed different terms to us, all regarding capacity and length of stay through June.

579
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:33,206
[SPEAKER_17]: He also said that this was the site they plan to try to move forward with.

580
00:44:34,026 --> 00:44:38,868
[SPEAKER_17]: I have another call with the state tomorrow to try to get more clarity.

581
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:44,051
[SPEAKER_17]: This is 110,000 square foot site that meets the needs of the state.

582
00:44:44,111 --> 00:44:49,893
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm worried about the burden it will cause with city staff, the school department, and et cetera.

583
00:44:50,473 --> 00:44:53,455
[SPEAKER_17]: It reaches the capacity that we are unable to handle.

584
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:57,492
[SPEAKER_17]: I will follow up with you when we have more information.

585
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,153
[SPEAKER_17]: That was on 12-5.

586
00:44:59,794 --> 00:45:02,516
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is, I thought this was public record.

587
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:03,116
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't realize that.

588
00:45:03,277 --> 00:45:05,318
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't know that no one else knew it.

589
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:06,720
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the first time that I heard that no one.

590
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,624
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I'm sorry, I don't have Facebook, but yeah, this isn't Facebook, but I would assume diagonally across.

591
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:13,505
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I would assume we should have a.

592
00:45:14,486 --> 00:45:21,852
[SPEAKER_17]: We should call for a community meeting immediately, maybe somewhere in that area that we can let our neighbors know.

593
00:45:21,892 --> 00:45:26,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Because from what I gather, it doesn't sound like the mayor's supporting this either.

594
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:30,279
[SPEAKER_17]: So if this is something on the state level, I think it's very important.

595
00:45:30,299 --> 00:45:32,261
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the biggest thing.

596
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:36,244
[SPEAKER_17]: When I heard this, I talked to a couple of teachers.

597
00:45:36,865 --> 00:45:38,966
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were confused because they

598
00:45:39,747 --> 00:45:47,011
[SPEAKER_17]: the increase in numbers in the elementary school, especially kindergarten level, I guess they've added an extra kindergarten to every single school already.

599
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:53,074
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was some thought that we've already let families in, and that's the issue.

600
00:45:53,094 --> 00:45:54,135
[SPEAKER_17]: But if that isn't the issue,

601
00:45:54,909 --> 00:46:05,533
[SPEAKER_17]: the fear from our educators that any influx, now remember, anybody that moves into our community as a child, they have every right to go to school in our city.

602
00:46:06,193 --> 00:46:11,275
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is gonna put a huge burden, a burden that I don't think that can meet the capacity

603
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,817
[SPEAKER_17]: that we offer right now, both at the McGlynn and the Roberts for sure.

604
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:21,860
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if the other schools have space from what I was told that there aren't many places.

605
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:28,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, the other issue we heard was with the closure of the Salem Street Fire Station back in our area.

606
00:46:29,183 --> 00:46:30,924
[SPEAKER_17]: I say our area because we grew up in North Medford.

607
00:46:31,324 --> 00:46:32,145
[SPEAKER_17]: The idea of

608
00:46:33,723 --> 00:46:43,929
[SPEAKER_17]: any more an influx of this magnitude with only one true station that's on that side, really, other than coming from the main station and then the heights.

609
00:46:44,909 --> 00:46:47,911
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really going to play an impact with public safety.

610
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:55,455
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a lot of issues here that I appreciate you bringing this forward today because I think that it's scary at many different levels.

611
00:46:55,495 --> 00:46:56,896
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, like I said,

612
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:02,861
[SPEAKER_17]: But when I gather the mayor is really confused with this whole situation as well.

613
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:20,030
[SPEAKER_17]: So not to support her in any way and understanding it, but this is something that one thing we should do is have community meeting or something should go out saying what she just said in this email that I personally thought because this is a public record, I thought it was already out there.

614
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,171
[SPEAKER_17]: So I didn't know that.

615
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,151
[SPEAKER_17]: So I apologize.

616
00:47:22,552 --> 00:47:23,032
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish I knew.

617
00:47:23,852 --> 00:47:24,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

618
00:47:26,906 --> 00:47:27,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Murrell.

619
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:30,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you asking the question in a public forum.

620
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:35,331
[SPEAKER_03]: My impression is that nothing is certain here.

621
00:47:35,371 --> 00:47:38,032
[SPEAKER_03]: We got this heads up that Councilor Scarpelli, thank you for sharing that.

622
00:47:39,073 --> 00:47:46,517
[SPEAKER_03]: My impression from receiving that same communication a couple weeks ago is that this is still in flux and the mayor is still

623
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:56,718
[SPEAKER_03]: in conversation with state partners who is in conversation with this landlord to determine when the state picks a site, will it be this one or will it be another one?

624
00:47:56,738 --> 00:48:00,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in this case, no news really is no news.

625
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:03,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just don't want us to get ahead of ourselves.

626
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:11,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also, and again, I think if this were to go forward, we should get solid answers from the people who really know for sure.

627
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:16,683
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the conception of this temporary shelter is not to be a months long

628
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:19,065
[SPEAKER_03]: for any of these migrant families.

629
00:48:19,145 --> 00:48:28,616
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like away station families would stay for a couple of nights, so I don't think it's in any way certain that this would cause a burden on our public school system because we're not going to.

630
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:37,964
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is why it's an issue, because I took that as that they changed that.

631
00:48:38,024 --> 00:48:41,766
[SPEAKER_17]: The original phone call was for temporary, and then it was extended.

632
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:44,288
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm looking at it totally different.

633
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:51,793
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's why, I think having some clarity, I think that's why really just having some clarity from the main office I think would be important.

634
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:52,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

635
00:48:52,761 --> 00:48:58,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I think it's certainly, certainly be great to circle back with the executive office to ask the question of what's the status?

636
00:48:58,826 --> 00:48:59,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this going forward?

637
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:10,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I interpreted that email as not, we're extending this so that families, any given family will stay through June, but rather this will remain a way station for two or three nights at a time, just for a couple more months.

638
00:49:11,237 --> 00:49:13,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So certainly appreciate all the questions asked.

639
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:20,909
[SPEAKER_03]: My assumption is that this is just certainly still up in the air as many, you know, large infrastructural, you know, sure social infrastructural or if I could.

640
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:29,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think that, you know, certainly asking for an update I'm sure that, you know, trying to sort this out at the end of the year.

641
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,432
[SPEAKER_03]: but sort of recentering on the state.

642
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:37,575
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that we have a shelter crisis in Massachusetts at this time of year.

643
00:49:38,636 --> 00:49:52,189
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is an opportunity where marshaling state resources, Medford can be a port in the storm for vulnerable migrant families, I think that's another important safety piece to put into the conversation is the lack of safety that's putting these families into the situation to begin with.

644
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:53,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

645
00:49:55,487 --> 00:50:04,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a quick short note, in the email that Councilor Scarpelli read, the mayor said she would follow up with us with details, and we haven't received a follow-up.

646
00:50:04,772 --> 00:50:08,434
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's another reason, because we just don't know a lot of these details either.

647
00:50:10,635 --> 00:50:11,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam President.

648
00:50:11,535 --> 00:50:17,098
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to, in terms of like next steps and actions, this wasn't on the agenda.

649
00:50:17,762 --> 00:50:20,626
[SPEAKER_18]: We shouldn't debate that since it wasn't on the agenda, wasn't publicly posted.

650
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:21,787
[SPEAKER_18]: We're talking about transparency.

651
00:50:21,827 --> 00:50:25,371
[SPEAKER_18]: We shouldn't take action on things that we didn't let the public know we were going to talk about.

652
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:29,737
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to take it back to that.

653
00:50:30,077 --> 00:50:31,639
[SPEAKER_18]: I did ask a follow up of the mayor.

654
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:33,802
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor said the state basically.

655
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:38,677
[SPEAKER_18]: If the state signs a contract with the property owner, that's the arrangement.

656
00:50:38,717 --> 00:50:43,839
[SPEAKER_18]: The city has no input, no involvement, unless the state wants to give the city involvement.

657
00:50:43,899 --> 00:50:49,401
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the state and the property owner sign an agreement, that's what's going to be what happens.

658
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:52,623
[SPEAKER_18]: The city doesn't have, the state comes in and they can do what they want.

659
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:59,205
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's where this is at, is my understanding, because I wanted to follow up specifically on that question.

660
00:50:59,805 --> 00:51:01,006
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe the mayor's email

661
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:21,102
[SPEAKER_18]: is written in the way to show specifically concern that if the state and the property owner just make an agreement without considering the city, since they don't legally have to consult the city and the city doesn't own the property, it's a private land and the state is trying to pay, essentially lease private property for their own purposes.

662
00:51:22,283 --> 00:51:29,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Her concern, to my understanding, reading of the email and my follow-up question, was that the city be consulted and engaged in that process in some way.

663
00:51:30,472 --> 00:51:35,056
[SPEAKER_18]: but that essentially the state can just sign an agreement with this private property owner if they wish to do so.

664
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:47,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I would find it very interesting if the mayor could point out when she did become aware of these circumstances.

665
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,394
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, she's remained relatively quiet about it with the exception of a press release

666
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:59,495
[SPEAKER_10]: And historically, that office has been really good at press releases and social media.

667
00:51:59,856 --> 00:52:01,857
[SPEAKER_10]: So it kind of concerns me, Madam President.

668
00:52:01,897 --> 00:52:08,102
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me scratch my head and wonder if the mayor had knowledge about this before Halloween and didn't share it with the community.

669
00:52:09,063 --> 00:52:09,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

670
00:52:09,744 --> 00:52:10,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

671
00:52:11,986 --> 00:52:12,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

672
00:52:13,508 --> 00:52:14,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess just one last comment.

673
00:52:15,129 --> 00:52:16,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly appreciate Councilor Collins.

674
00:52:17,311 --> 00:52:18,872
[SPEAKER_04]: He's saying that nothing has happened yet.

675
00:52:20,013 --> 00:52:24,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I also remember being part of the community where with the 61 Locust Street project, we were told the same thing.

676
00:52:24,617 --> 00:52:25,778
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically, sorry, too late.

677
00:52:26,498 --> 00:52:28,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And the time to address it was beforehand.

678
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:40,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's certainly folks in my neighborhood that, you know, if they're made aware of something early, would definitely like to voice their opinion when it can be heard versus being told, sorry, too late.

679
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:41,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where we're coming from.

680
00:52:42,191 --> 00:52:42,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

681
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:46,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have a motion to revert back to regular order of business?

682
00:52:47,171 --> 00:52:47,692
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion, second.

683
00:52:47,712 --> 00:52:50,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins.

684
00:52:50,854 --> 00:52:51,435
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

685
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,595
[SPEAKER_09]: All opposed?

686
00:52:52,635 --> 00:52:53,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

687
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:58,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to 23471, offered by Vice President Bears.

688
00:52:59,441 --> 00:53:05,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we commend Councilor Caraviello for his outstanding service on the Medford City Council from 2012 to 2024.

689
00:53:05,566 --> 00:53:07,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

690
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:08,868
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam President.

691
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:26,490
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Caraviello has served with me the entire time that I've been on the City Council, and we've served through a pandemic, zoning recodification, two city elections since I was elected,

692
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:32,608
[SPEAKER_18]: I think 15, 16, 17 ordinances maybe at this point.

693
00:53:34,229 --> 00:53:50,335
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have been really lucky to learn from Councilor Caraviello, to work with Councilor Caraviello, especially on development projects and trying to engage property owners, trying to engage people who want to come to the city and build new good things in our community.

694
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:53,116
[SPEAKER_18]: I think sometimes we've been successful.

695
00:53:53,979 --> 00:53:56,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes we haven't been as successful as we wanted to be.

696
00:53:57,163 --> 00:54:12,562
[SPEAKER_18]: And I personally really want, and I'm hoping if Carol lets you, that you will give a little more time and give me a call if you see a good opportunity or you hear someone who wants to come to the city.

697
00:54:13,022 --> 00:54:15,204
[SPEAKER_18]: and wants to talk to a city councilor about that.

698
00:54:16,164 --> 00:54:28,734
[SPEAKER_18]: But I also think you've more than earned some time off, time with family, after many, many years of public service, not just on the council, but before your time on the council in volunteerism and service to the community.

699
00:54:28,814 --> 00:54:41,703
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you, and I will miss you as a colleague, and I hope that you get to spend many vacations getting suntanned and enjoying some time in warm places.

700
00:54:43,007 --> 00:54:43,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

701
00:54:43,427 --> 00:54:45,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpalli.

702
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:45,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

703
00:54:47,670 --> 00:55:06,340
[SPEAKER_17]: It's difficult for me because when you spend so much time in people, it's not just every other Tuesday now, or it was every Tuesday, but my first two phone calls on the way to work every morning was to Councilor Caraviello, then to Councilor Knight.

704
00:55:10,094 --> 00:55:18,561
[SPEAKER_17]: What I want to applaud you, Rick, is for teaching all of us to understand why we do what we do.

705
00:55:19,702 --> 00:55:20,983
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think people have forgotten that.

706
00:55:21,043 --> 00:55:25,147
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think last meeting was a pretty good indication of where we were.

707
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:35,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Rick Caraviello, the Rick Caraviello I know, no one understands how much you've done for the city.

708
00:55:37,295 --> 00:55:49,305
[SPEAKER_17]: What's great about a person that does things, hey, listen, it's great when the camera's in your face, people taking pictures of people talking about you, and you're standing up and shaking hands and cutting ribbon, because I know a lot of people that do that and love it.

709
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,286
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all ego-driven.

710
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:57,792
[SPEAKER_17]: But the Rick Caraviello I know, that I'm honored to call my friend, has always done things behind the scenes.

711
00:55:58,973 --> 00:56:00,554
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've always admired that about you, Rick.

712
00:56:01,975 --> 00:56:03,677
[SPEAKER_17]: I've tried to emulate it.

713
00:56:03,737 --> 00:56:04,758
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very difficult to do.

714
00:56:06,983 --> 00:56:22,806
[SPEAKER_17]: while running a family and running a business and taking care of dad that's in a home and understanding everything that goes on in a person's life, you still have time to feed the hungry.

715
00:56:23,726 --> 00:56:29,527
[SPEAKER_17]: You still have time to build a deck for a person that can't afford a handicap ramp.

716
00:56:31,587 --> 00:56:34,928
[SPEAKER_17]: When a veteran needs something, it's Rick Caraviello they call.

717
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:41,132
[SPEAKER_17]: And I used to be, to be honest, I was so jealous of how you did that.

718
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:46,756
[SPEAKER_17]: And, but it also made me proud that I've learned from the best.

719
00:56:48,498 --> 00:57:00,908
[SPEAKER_17]: I've sat behind this rail with some amazing people, some amazing people that when I sit and talk about all these different people than our lifetimes that have lost, we've lost, and they've moved on to the,

720
00:57:02,605 --> 00:57:08,608
[SPEAKER_17]: the big Mustang land in the sky, I look at it and I say, who's going to take that place?

721
00:57:09,768 --> 00:57:26,755
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was fortunate because I see people like Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco and Councilor Knight and you being the Mount Rushmore of that group.

722
00:57:31,257 --> 00:57:36,699
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to get emotional because I think that this is more than just you've given enough.

723
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:37,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Zach is right.

724
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:45,762
[SPEAKER_17]: When it came, when you saw the city falling, no one else had the guts to stand up and you stood up.

725
00:57:46,722 --> 00:57:52,484
[SPEAKER_17]: You stood up taller than any man I've ever seen in my life other than my dad.

726
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:55,225
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't hide from anything.

727
00:57:55,626 --> 00:57:59,447
[SPEAKER_17]: You fought every single day to make things right.

728
00:58:02,028 --> 00:58:03,289
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm honored to be your friend.

729
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:10,172
[SPEAKER_17]: So I hope I can make those phone calls in the morning still.

730
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:14,855
[SPEAKER_17]: And sometimes I think Dina gets jealous because I don't pick up her call.

731
00:58:15,435 --> 00:58:16,816
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd say, I'm on the phone with Carvey.

732
00:58:19,378 --> 00:58:19,958
[SPEAKER_17]: But she knows.

733
00:58:20,818 --> 00:58:26,501
[SPEAKER_17]: So for your family, people that I love, Carol, you've been amazing.

734
00:58:27,898 --> 00:58:31,659
[SPEAKER_17]: to make sure Rick is here with us, and I don't think he's ever missed a meeting.

735
00:58:32,479 --> 00:58:36,340
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I missed a meeting, I'd always get an email, a text message right away saying, where are you?

736
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,401
[SPEAKER_17]: And I felt guilty to say, my God, Rick, I'm stuck at work.

737
00:58:40,161 --> 00:58:42,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Because no matter what, even after the election, he was still here.

738
00:58:43,662 --> 00:58:45,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Even after the election, people are still calling him.

739
00:58:45,882 --> 00:58:52,263
[SPEAKER_17]: He was at the door the other day, and I was like, after the election, and I said, what are you doing?

740
00:58:53,064 --> 00:58:54,244
[SPEAKER_17]: He had a truck full of turkeys.

741
00:58:55,236 --> 00:58:58,617
[SPEAKER_17]: He says, do you know anybody who needs a turkey, any family that needs a turkey?

742
00:59:00,317 --> 00:59:01,358
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what I'm talking about.

743
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:02,698
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we're going to miss in the city.

744
00:59:03,638 --> 00:59:04,699
[SPEAKER_17]: People don't realize that.

745
00:59:04,819 --> 00:59:11,060
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's something that when I see your grandchildren, I make sure they know how proud they should be of their papa.

746
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:17,102
[SPEAKER_17]: And Rick, you've done an amazing job to set a standard for the Cabello family.

747
00:59:17,952 --> 00:59:26,716
[SPEAKER_17]: So my friend, all I can say to you is I wish one day George Scarpelli leaves a legacy like Rick Caraviello, because it's not Armin anymore.

748
00:59:28,517 --> 00:59:30,118
[SPEAKER_17]: All Armin did was win a few football games.

749
00:59:31,498 --> 00:59:34,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Rick Caraviello is what

750
00:59:35,785 --> 00:59:36,765
[SPEAKER_17]: we should all aspire to.

751
00:59:37,446 --> 00:59:39,167
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will miss you.

752
00:59:39,487 --> 00:59:41,208
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate everything you've taught me.

753
00:59:41,928 --> 00:59:45,790
[SPEAKER_17]: I've appreciated you, the phone calls that you've, you've called me and set me straight.

754
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:48,271
[SPEAKER_17]: When I was going to go stray, you pulled me back.

755
00:59:49,531 --> 00:59:53,453
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hope I still get those phone calls because we know it's not going to be easy.

756
00:59:54,594 --> 00:59:55,654
[SPEAKER_17]: President Zach Beers.

757
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:56,955
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine Ricky.

758
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:05,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Joking, of course, but I love you, my friend.

759
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:13,920
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm proud that this journey in our lives made us brothers and I thank you and I apologize.

760
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:14,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

761
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:15,641
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

762
01:00:18,604 --> 01:00:25,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Garabiello, it's been an honor to

763
01:00:25,982 --> 01:00:26,982
[SPEAKER_03]: serve alongside you.

764
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:32,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knows I have the best seat in the chambers because Rick has the best gossip.

765
01:00:36,124 --> 01:00:45,047
[SPEAKER_03]: You've always offered me advice, unsolicited advice that's been true every time, solicited advice that's been very useful.

766
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:53,959
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know that you care about the success of this community, and you care about the success of this city, and you care about the success of this council.

767
01:00:55,060 --> 01:01:03,244
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter who's behind the rail, you want us to be doing the best work that we can for the benefit of the people that live here, and that's evident in everything that you do and how you spend your time.

768
01:01:03,344 --> 01:01:05,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for your partnership with me.

769
01:01:06,626 --> 01:01:09,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for working with me in good faith every week over the past two years.

770
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:15,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your service for so many years, and excited to see what you do next.

771
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:17,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

772
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:20,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

773
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:26,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello, Rick, it's been such an honor serving with you.

774
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:35,855
[SPEAKER_15]: I think on this side of the chambers, there's such a strong camaraderie with the three of us, and it's always a pleasure to walk in and see you and Kit here.

775
01:01:36,755 --> 01:01:43,297
[SPEAKER_15]: And as Kit says, gossiping, but for me, it's really just learning more about this city, learning more about how our city works.

776
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:48,679
[SPEAKER_15]: You've never failed to be a teacher, and we've talked a lot about this, but

777
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:50,741
[SPEAKER_15]: you've truly taught me a lot.

778
01:01:51,021 --> 01:02:10,379
[SPEAKER_15]: I see you as a mentor here at Medford, and there's, you know, from who to call in City Hall to do what, to who to talk to on City Council, you know, there's, that's the job aspect of it, but there's also the personal aspect of it, you know, people I should meet, introducing me to people,

779
01:02:10,979 --> 01:02:13,761
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of that support, you know, it really means a lot.

780
01:02:13,961 --> 01:02:18,925
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been really glad that we've spent these last few years supporting each other so much.

781
01:02:19,606 --> 01:02:23,428
[SPEAKER_15]: We've bumped into each other so much, and we've really become really strong friends.

782
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:32,315
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember really clearly the day I received an email from you, right after I announced my candidacy my first time.

783
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:37,599
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was just such a sweet email, a really like hopeful email.

784
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:41,551
[SPEAKER_15]: and encouraging one too, that uplifted that whole day.

785
01:02:41,952 --> 01:02:48,156
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember you talked about how we met when I got the Kiwanis scholarship back in high school.

786
01:02:48,896 --> 01:02:55,621
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think there's just that long history between us two that has brought us closer and closer throughout time.

787
01:02:55,701 --> 01:02:57,562
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm truly gonna miss you being here.

788
01:02:57,582 --> 01:03:05,047
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna miss you being with us and walking into the chamber and hearing all your fun stories.

789
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:34,678
[SPEAKER_15]: know, it's it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it

790
01:03:35,197 --> 01:03:36,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, thank you very much.

791
01:03:37,959 --> 01:03:39,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Ricky, first things first.

792
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:43,184
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your turn to pay at the Mets tomorrow morning.

793
01:03:48,548 --> 01:03:56,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I've served on this council for 10 years, and I've never, ever served a year without you.

794
01:03:57,195 --> 01:03:58,316
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been a great ride.

795
01:03:58,336 --> 01:04:03,100
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think back to when I first had the opportunity to meet you.

796
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:25,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I was in kindergarten, I was with your son Richard, running across High Street, going over to Hastings Lane, visiting the house, and you know, a lot's transpired since those times, and now here I am serving with you as a colleague, and I've had the opportunity to not only, you know, spend a lot of time around your family and your children, but also your grandchildren.

797
01:04:25,777 --> 01:04:29,318
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really think that shows what you're all about.

798
01:04:30,218 --> 01:04:36,099
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a true family man, and you're a true throwback to that old school politician.

799
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,980
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the type of guy that when someone calls you on the phone, you call them back.

800
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,980
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they don't answer the phone, you show up at the door.

801
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you truly care about people in this community, and you want to make a difference.

802
01:04:48,062 --> 01:04:49,982
[SPEAKER_10]: And rest assured, Ricky, you have.

803
01:04:50,694 --> 01:04:51,214
[SPEAKER_10]: You really have.

804
01:04:52,034 --> 01:04:55,516
[SPEAKER_10]: You've done an excellent job, and it's been an honor and a privilege to serve with you.

805
01:04:57,376 --> 01:05:02,958
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's even more bittersweet to walk out the door with you.

806
01:05:02,978 --> 01:05:05,239
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, thank you very much for your service.

807
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:14,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think that there are a couple of people in this audience that haven't been recognized yet this evening that I know you're going to take a chance to recognize.

808
01:05:16,889 --> 01:05:19,451
[SPEAKER_10]: for the past, what is it, 12 years now?

809
01:05:21,252 --> 01:05:22,513
[SPEAKER_10]: The family's been very good at...

810
01:05:23,971 --> 01:05:29,215
[SPEAKER_10]: throwing you out of the house, letting you get out here and serve the people of this community.

811
01:05:29,896 --> 01:05:39,284
[SPEAKER_10]: And what is to be said about a family that's so willing to share such a great man with so many people here in this community.

812
01:05:39,324 --> 01:05:48,372
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Carol and Lauren and Richard and Nikki for letting us have a piece of Ricky for the past decade plus.

813
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:50,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

814
01:05:50,856 --> 01:05:51,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could.

815
01:05:51,897 --> 01:05:57,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you and what you brought to this council.

816
01:05:58,842 --> 01:06:02,184
[SPEAKER_09]: As everyone has said, you absolutely put your money where your mouth is.

817
01:06:02,805 --> 01:06:07,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I know anytime a constituent has an issue, you're either on the phone or you're down at City Hall.

818
01:06:07,728 --> 01:06:14,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I think anytime I've been at City Hall, no matter how many days I'm here, someone's always saying, Rick was just here, you know, fixing whatever issue.

819
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:18,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And you don't hear about it the large majority of the time.

820
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:21,261
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not at the council meeting saying, I did this, this, and this.

821
01:06:21,721 --> 01:06:24,123
[SPEAKER_09]: You quietly do a lot of things for a lot of people.

822
01:06:24,723 --> 01:06:30,307
[SPEAKER_09]: And that makes, that's a really, it's just a really positive thing for the city and for individuals.

823
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:40,834
[SPEAKER_09]: And as Councilor Scarapelli said, you put it all out there running for mayor, which is just, it takes a tremendous amount of courage and time and dedication to do that.

824
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:48,796
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter who you talk to, regardless of who they were supporting for mayor, there was never a bad thing that could be said about Rick Caraviello, the person.

825
01:06:49,217 --> 01:06:53,198
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, whoever politics may lie, everyone could say that you're a tremendous person.

826
01:06:55,339 --> 01:07:03,261
[SPEAKER_09]: You leave just a vast amount of knowledge when you leave this body and we're going to be, or they're going to be a little bit poorer for it.

827
01:07:03,421 --> 01:07:09,864
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think to Vice President Bair's point, I know that you're just a short phone call away when they have those questions.

828
01:07:09,964 --> 01:07:10,984
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, you know,

829
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,621
[SPEAKER_09]: being the kind of person you are.

830
01:07:12,641 --> 01:07:19,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's just a little bit of comfort knowing we're losing you, but we know where to find you, and you'll give us a little bit of your time once more.

831
01:07:19,626 --> 01:07:29,693
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thank you for that, and I know there's folks here who want to speak in the audience, but I know if you want to speak now, we want to wait for everyone to kind of say their piece.

832
01:07:30,054 --> 01:07:33,276
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to add one more thing, and I'm sorry to speak out of

833
01:07:34,196 --> 01:07:48,387
[SPEAKER_18]: second time already, but I think it's a testament to how much you've done your service to the city, your service to your colleagues, your devotion to your family, that none of us mentioned that you also got us a brand new library.

834
01:07:50,968 --> 01:07:53,731
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just, you know, again,

835
01:07:54,798 --> 01:08:04,865
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a beautiful place that thousands of people are using every day that wouldn't be here if you hadn't put in incredibly hard work to get it here, to get it funded after the fact.

836
01:08:05,905 --> 01:08:11,389
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to be there for generations and have your name in a few places on it as well deserved.

837
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:20,475
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to say that and also to say that this council, I think especially this term, we don't agree all the time.

838
01:08:21,462 --> 01:08:23,563
[SPEAKER_18]: but we care for each other.

839
01:08:23,624 --> 01:08:25,525
[SPEAKER_18]: We agree, we agree to disagree.

840
01:08:26,506 --> 01:08:30,308
[SPEAKER_18]: And we know that we all care so much about Medford.

841
01:08:31,309 --> 01:08:34,711
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think you lead with that, right?

842
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:39,715
[SPEAKER_18]: We've disagreed on many things, but I've never felt like you didn't respect me and I didn't respect you.

843
01:08:39,735 --> 01:08:41,056
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's incredibly important.

844
01:08:41,136 --> 01:08:41,596
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

845
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:48,281
[SPEAKER_09]: If folks want to speak, I don't know if Rep Donato, if you want to start, or former Councilor Marks.

846
01:08:54,053 --> 01:08:57,395
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President, Michael Marks, 37 Wellington Road.

847
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:07,359
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an honor to be here tonight, Rick, to honor you for your 12 years of commitment and dedication to this community.

848
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:18,205
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I can honestly say, as has been eloquently stated here tonight, that you are a man of results.

849
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,187
[SPEAKER_12]: and didn't let anything get in the way.

850
01:09:21,587 --> 01:09:24,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't let politics get in the way, personalities.

851
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:26,272
[SPEAKER_12]: He wanted to see things happen.

852
01:09:26,752 --> 01:09:31,436
[SPEAKER_12]: And as Council Vice President Bears just mentioned, the library, right?

853
01:09:31,757 --> 01:09:39,284
[SPEAKER_12]: A little thing like the library came to fruition because Rick thought out of the box and said, you know what?

854
01:09:40,322 --> 01:09:41,863
[SPEAKER_12]: We need this for our community.

855
01:09:42,323 --> 01:09:43,824
[SPEAKER_12]: We need this for our residents.

856
01:09:44,204 --> 01:09:48,506
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was you that pursued that dream and why it became to a reality.

857
01:09:49,506 --> 01:09:59,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Another issue that we didn't even mention, and I don't even think we've touched the tip of the iceberg here, is an issue that was near and dear to me when I first got on the council in 2002.

858
01:09:59,591 --> 01:10:03,693
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was to create an art center in our community.

859
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:08,447
[SPEAKER_12]: And I had the keys to the Swan School in my hands.

860
01:10:08,907 --> 01:10:13,668
[SPEAKER_12]: And every Saturday and Sunday, I used to open the building and let the artists roam the building.

861
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,428
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were gonna put an art center in the Swan School.

862
01:10:16,448 --> 01:10:17,729
[SPEAKER_12]: That never came to fruition.

863
01:10:18,269 --> 01:10:22,410
[SPEAKER_12]: And I worked on creating an art center for 19 years after that.

864
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:28,491
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was responsible as one member, creating arts collaborative method.

865
01:10:29,111 --> 01:10:33,552
[SPEAKER_12]: Our sole responsibility was to create an art center in this community.

866
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:43,397
[SPEAKER_12]: And for three to four years, we looked at the Heckner Center and realized that building would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring it up to a reality.

867
01:10:44,137 --> 01:10:46,858
[SPEAKER_12]: And then one day we got a phone call.

868
01:10:47,899 --> 01:10:58,304
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was from Councilor Caraviello that said, I have a community public-private partnership that's going to allow an art center to come on Mystic Ave.

869
01:10:59,725 --> 01:11:01,926
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not going to have to pay anything for the first 10 years.

870
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:17,029
[SPEAKER_12]: They're gonna suit the building to your need, ample parking, we're gonna have community art classes, we're gonna have artist space, all for nothing.

871
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,731
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the way, January 20th of next year,

872
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:23,971
[SPEAKER_12]: they can have a ribbon cutting.

873
01:11:24,491 --> 01:11:34,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Meffitt's first art center in this community came to fruition because of this man right here that put together a public-private partnership to make that happen.

874
01:11:35,201 --> 01:11:39,144
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm a little envious, it took me 20 years, it took him 20 minutes, but that's all right.

875
01:11:40,265 --> 01:11:43,868
[SPEAKER_12]: It came to reality, and that's the most important thing.

876
01:11:44,549 --> 01:11:46,190
[SPEAKER_12]: You know- Can I say something?

877
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:46,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

878
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:49,433
[SPEAKER_13]: My second phone call was to Councilor Marks to let him know about it.

879
01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:51,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and I appreciate that.

880
01:11:56,049 --> 01:12:03,511
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you hit the nail on the head, George.

881
01:12:04,031 --> 01:12:13,875
[SPEAKER_12]: It's almost like you stole my speech because honestly, I mean, you look at someone's character and we're celebrating Rick for 12 years.

882
01:12:14,635 --> 01:12:17,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Rick's been dedicated in this city for five decades.

883
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Rick did the reverse.

884
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:22,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually people get elected, then they start getting involved in the community.

885
01:12:23,523 --> 01:12:32,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Rick was involved for five decades and then got elected and continued to do what he did from the previous five decades.

886
01:12:32,688 --> 01:12:42,114
[SPEAKER_12]: As you mentioned, feeding the most needy in our community, helping veterans, whether they had a leaky roof or needed accessibility ramp to their homes.

887
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:53,146
[SPEAKER_12]: know, those are the type of things that, you know, I think go unnoticed, because there's no print paper anymore, there's, you know, there's no really way of getting the message out.

888
01:12:53,546 --> 01:12:57,809
[SPEAKER_12]: But those are things that Rick did, because he wanted to do, not for any fanfare.

889
01:12:58,289 --> 01:13:10,237
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I personally, Rick, you know, I have to say, when when I was on the council, and you were running for council, I said, this son of a gun, he's, you know, he was out there campaigning, I said, this son of a gun.

890
01:13:10,717 --> 01:13:13,099
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when he got on the council, I said, you know what,

891
01:13:14,059 --> 01:13:15,620
[SPEAKER_12]: He adds a lot to this council.

892
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,360
[SPEAKER_12]: He has a lot of integrity.

893
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,381
[SPEAKER_12]: He cares about this community.

894
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:26,923
[SPEAKER_12]: And as members said behind this reel, no matter what side of the issue, Rick was always respectable.

895
01:13:27,663 --> 01:13:31,324
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's one thing that I take, Rick, and I'm proud to call you my friend.

896
01:13:31,985 --> 01:13:39,907
[SPEAKER_12]: And honestly, I hope that you will maintain your leadership role in this community, because we do need leaders.

897
01:13:40,407 --> 01:13:42,668
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, when the Chamber of Commerce didn't have a president,

898
01:13:43,462 --> 01:13:50,584
[SPEAKER_12]: It was Rick Caraviello that stood up and took over the reins in order for small business to be represented.

899
01:13:51,224 --> 01:13:52,905
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a lot of work and a lot of effort.

900
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:54,925
[SPEAKER_12]: And those type of things go unnoticed.

901
01:13:55,246 --> 01:13:58,687
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to thank you, my friend, and I'm sure you'll be active in the community.

902
01:13:58,747 --> 01:13:59,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

903
01:13:59,147 --> 01:13:59,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

904
01:13:59,867 --> 01:14:00,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

905
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:09,630
[SPEAKER_13]: That'll be from the governor.

906
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:16,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Or wood, it comes from the hat.

907
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,317
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what these things are anyway.

908
01:14:28,382 --> 01:14:34,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that had to be said about Councilor Caraviello, I think has been said, and I would only be redundant.

909
01:14:35,364 --> 01:14:50,268
[SPEAKER_00]: On behalf of the delegation, on a personal note, I'm going to say that the delegation is here to work with the incoming president, Mr. Beyer, and the incoming vice president, Councilor Collins.

910
01:14:50,808 --> 01:14:58,652
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to continuing our relationship with the city council and with the administration here in the city of Medford.

911
01:14:59,113 --> 01:15:03,895
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, let me say something about my friend.

912
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:06,457
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known each other for

913
01:15:07,893 --> 01:15:30,876
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years basically growing up in the same area in South Manfred but in addition to that being members of the Kiwanis Club so that you know when we talk about all of the things that Rick has done as president of the Chamber of Commerce and and his involvement in the arts program and involvement in the in the

914
01:15:31,997 --> 01:15:33,979
[SPEAKER_00]: building of the library.

915
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:42,185
[SPEAKER_00]: He also stood up at the same time to be a member and to be president of the Medford Kiwanis Club.

916
01:15:43,026 --> 01:15:53,954
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the kind of dedication that Councilor Caraviello, Rick has done in his involvement in this community for decades.

917
01:15:55,035 --> 01:16:01,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am so proud that we had the opportunity to learn from each other.

918
01:16:01,778 --> 01:16:07,119
[SPEAKER_00]: and to nurture each other with regard to what was going on in the community.

919
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:18,402
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to kid Rick, I thought I went to everything, but I know that Councilor Cario would go to a envelope opening if there was one available.

920
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:24,824
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that he was there for the people.

921
01:16:25,424 --> 01:16:30,025
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there to make sure that when anyone needed assistance,

922
01:16:31,704 --> 01:16:35,266
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there in the forefront to have it done.

923
01:16:35,967 --> 01:17:00,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times he approached me and said, if you know anybody, as Councilor Knight said, if you know anyone who needs a food basket, turkey, and he had no problem going to the supermarket saying that, you know, we need turkeys, we need food for Thanksgiving, Christmas, for the elderly, for those who are in need.

924
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:08,181
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in my heart, for the many years that I've known him, that he's not going to stop.

925
01:17:08,802 --> 01:17:13,005
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to continue to do what is in the best interest of this community.

926
01:17:13,645 --> 01:17:14,506
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear from

927
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:31,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Caraviello, maybe in a different way, maybe in a way that you're going to say, gee, he did what he had to do as a city councilor to make it so that this community fostered what was important to him.

928
01:17:32,042 --> 01:17:43,451
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, he's going to continue to do all of the things that he did, not only as a councilor, but as a member of the Kiwanis and as a member of this community.

929
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:45,272
[SPEAKER_00]: So on behalf of

930
01:17:46,574 --> 01:17:48,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Our colleagues in the.

931
01:17:49,656 --> 01:17:58,860
[SPEAKER_00]: delegation, I would like to take, I'm not even gonna read it because it's the same thing that you have all said to everyone in this community.

932
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:04,982
[SPEAKER_00]: I say it from my heart to you, Rick, for all of the wonderful things you have done.

933
01:18:05,683 --> 01:18:16,527
[SPEAKER_00]: You made me proud to be a friend, but more important, you made me proud that we had the opportunity in the beginning to learn from each other and help you become a great city councilor.

934
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:17,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So, congratulations.

935
01:18:30,188 --> 01:18:32,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak?

936
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:39,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll hand it over to you, Pastor Carmelo.

937
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:40,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

938
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:46,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for everybody with the kind words, former colleagues, present colleagues, and everyone else.

939
01:18:46,971 --> 01:18:53,233
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's been an honor to serve the residential community for the past 12 years.

940
01:18:53,853 --> 01:18:55,693
[SPEAKER_13]: I never once thought of this as a job.

941
01:18:55,713 --> 01:18:57,954
[SPEAKER_13]: It was something that I wanted to do.

942
01:19:00,481 --> 01:19:07,468
[SPEAKER_13]: As I said, when Terry Carter interviewed me for an interview, he says, how did you get involved?

943
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:19,359
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, you know, I said, I was like kind of a young kid, 45 years old, and I was kind of at the crossroads, you know, with young kids, and a friend invited me to a Kiwanis meeting.

944
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:20,701
[SPEAKER_13]: And

945
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:26,793
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to sit with Paul, and back then there was like 80, 90 people, but they were all pillars of the community.

946
01:19:26,813 --> 01:19:31,276
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd sit there and I'd listen to their stories, and I said, geez, I'd like to be that person one day.

947
01:19:33,137 --> 01:19:35,358
[SPEAKER_13]: And Paul mentored me along, and here I am today.

948
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:47,526
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thank the Kiwanis for really getting me involved with the community and showing me what community involvement was all about, because I didn't come from, you know, it's not something that I did, or my dad didn't do it either, so.

949
01:19:48,882 --> 01:19:52,105
[SPEAKER_13]: They taught me community involvement.

950
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,487
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thank my friends at the Quons for that.

951
01:19:54,527 --> 01:19:59,351
[SPEAKER_13]: But I've had a lot of good accomplishments.

952
01:20:00,132 --> 01:20:03,515
[SPEAKER_13]: As you said, I worked hard in the library, like four or five years.

953
01:20:03,555 --> 01:20:04,896
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't do it by myself.

954
01:20:04,956 --> 01:20:15,186
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank Mayor Burke for taking something from a counselor, which no mayor has ever done in the city, and actually brought it to a reality.

955
01:20:16,058 --> 01:20:18,139
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thank Mayor Burke for doing that.

956
01:20:18,699 --> 01:20:25,862
[SPEAKER_13]: And even with the art center, I know Councilor Marks, he was a trailblazer on that.

957
01:20:25,942 --> 01:20:30,604
[SPEAKER_13]: And when that call came in, I knew right away who needed the property.

958
01:20:31,505 --> 01:20:32,165
[SPEAKER_13]: And who do I call?

959
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:33,806
[SPEAKER_13]: I call another colleague, Councilor Marks.

960
01:20:35,446 --> 01:20:38,368
[SPEAKER_13]: And we got the ball rolling on that.

961
01:20:38,688 --> 01:20:41,529
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are two real things I've did that I'm real proud of.

962
01:20:41,549 --> 01:20:45,551
[SPEAKER_13]: But I've also done some, I'm real proud of some of the veterans things I did.

963
01:20:46,769 --> 01:20:49,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Who in the world would ever know where to find an elevator for free?

964
01:20:52,211 --> 01:20:57,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, we got a call and the lady said, I need an elevator for my house, I'm saying.

965
01:20:59,761 --> 01:21:03,503
[SPEAKER_13]: I made a couple of calls in like, in three hours I had an elevator.

966
01:21:03,523 --> 01:21:07,024
[SPEAKER_13]: And I called him back and he says, remember Christmas?

967
01:21:07,084 --> 01:21:09,185
[SPEAKER_13]: He says, we're gonna have an elevator for you.

968
01:21:09,746 --> 01:21:11,406
[SPEAKER_13]: And we got people to put it in for free.

969
01:21:12,247 --> 01:21:15,428
[SPEAKER_13]: And this was from a guy who hadn't been out of this house in four years.

970
01:21:16,108 --> 01:21:21,271
[SPEAKER_13]: We also, we did a home of a veteran, what apparently his daughter.

971
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:25,973
[SPEAKER_13]: And we got together with the community and volunteers and did almost $300,000 worth of work in this house free.

972
01:21:29,482 --> 01:21:34,448
[SPEAKER_13]: So when I say I started, we did the food program, but it's just things I've done over the years.

973
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:39,193
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how they came to the past, but they did.

974
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:42,918
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm happy that I've been able to serve the community.

975
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:46,422
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to belabor the point, but I served under three mayors.

976
01:21:49,332 --> 01:21:57,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Council Marks, and maybe we weren't the best of friends when we got on the council, because he was, you know, I was the new, I was the, even though I was older than him, I was the new guy.

977
01:21:57,898 --> 01:21:59,719
[SPEAKER_13]: I was the new guy on the council.

978
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:09,846
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, over the years, we've been good friends, you know, Councilor Dello Russo, Councilor Falco, Councilor Penta, Councilor Mayorkas, Councilor Musil.

979
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:13,608
[SPEAKER_13]: I've shared with a lot of good people, including the people that are sitting here today.

980
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:16,230
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, these are memories I'll have forever and ever.

981
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:17,531
[SPEAKER_13]: And listen,

982
01:22:20,677 --> 01:22:26,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Where I lay in the next few months, who knows, but I'll always be around for anybody who ever needs St.

983
01:22:26,268 --> 01:22:26,528
[SPEAKER_13]: David's.

984
01:22:26,548 --> 01:22:29,434
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, and thank you everybody for all the kind words you said tonight.

985
01:22:29,975 --> 01:22:32,199
[SPEAKER_13]: And like I said, I'll miss everybody.

986
01:22:52,459 --> 01:22:53,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to do it?

987
01:22:53,342 --> 01:22:53,684
[SPEAKER_09]: You do it.

988
01:23:21,434 --> 01:23:23,996
[SPEAKER_07]: bottle of bourbon.

989
01:23:25,857 --> 01:23:36,545
[SPEAKER_06]: He said don't rock it.

990
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:37,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a photo?

991
01:23:54,955 --> 01:23:59,156
[SPEAKER_06]: You got your phone?

992
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:02,477
Of course.

993
01:24:28,049 --> 01:24:28,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

994
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:29,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

995
01:25:01,462 --> 01:25:25,394
[SPEAKER_07]: get a copy of this.

996
01:25:28,935 --> 01:25:31,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Councilor Caraviello, you wanna add?

997
01:25:33,557 --> 01:25:34,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

998
01:25:36,038 --> 01:25:41,660
[SPEAKER_13]: I think as we all know, doing this job really takes a toll on your family and your family life.

999
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:48,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanna thank my family here tonight for all the birthdays and games and stuff that I missed over the years.

1000
01:25:50,303 --> 01:25:51,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm around for that stuff now.

1001
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:56,165
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for my family for putting up with me over the years for all this stuff.

1002
01:25:56,205 --> 01:25:56,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1003
01:25:57,066 --> 01:25:57,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1004
01:25:59,172 --> 01:26:01,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to 234, oh sorry, on the motion.

1005
01:26:03,394 --> 01:26:04,534
[SPEAKER_09]: This guy, president.

1006
01:26:04,994 --> 01:26:09,496
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1007
01:26:09,536 --> 01:26:10,277
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1008
01:26:10,297 --> 01:26:11,557
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1009
01:26:11,597 --> 01:26:12,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1010
01:26:13,038 --> 01:26:16,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Going through 23472, offered by Vice President Bears.

1011
01:26:16,999 --> 01:26:22,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we commend Councilor Knight for his outstanding service on the Medford City Council from 2014 to 2024.

1012
01:26:22,442 --> 01:26:24,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

1013
01:26:25,323 --> 01:26:26,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam President.

1014
01:26:26,403 --> 01:26:27,524
[SPEAKER_18]: I have been lucky enough

1015
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:36,876
[SPEAKER_18]: to have Councilor Knight here to tell me everything I'm doing wrong, every meeting, quietly, which is what I appreciated.

1016
01:26:39,203 --> 01:26:48,392
[SPEAKER_18]: And occasionally, even to give me a heads up in advance, when he knew I was going to do something wrong, so I could correct course before I made the mistake and embarrass myself.

1017
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:56,339
[SPEAKER_18]: That's my personal thing to say about having Councilor Knight sitting next to me for my first four years on this council.

1018
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:59,702
[SPEAKER_18]: But in addition to being a

1019
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:03,161
[SPEAKER_18]: great colleague.

1020
01:27:04,682 --> 01:27:16,664
[SPEAKER_18]: He's incredibly devoted to this city and to the institution of the Medford City Council in a way that I hope that I can at least take a piece of and continue into the future.

1021
01:27:18,205 --> 01:27:23,286
[SPEAKER_18]: He knows not just the history of the council since he's been on it, but the history of the council before that.

1022
01:27:24,171 --> 01:27:29,373
[SPEAKER_18]: He deeply cares about the city of Medford and seeing it go in the right direction.

1023
01:27:30,213 --> 01:27:33,995
[SPEAKER_18]: And he is nothing if not persistent and passionate in that cause.

1024
01:27:36,175 --> 01:27:40,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Similarly to Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight,

1025
01:27:41,858 --> 01:27:55,363
[SPEAKER_18]: is a father and he has spent many nights away from his family in this chamber serving the people of Medford when he may, at least maybe some of the time, would have wanted to be there with his family.

1026
01:27:55,584 --> 01:28:01,026
[SPEAKER_18]: And that sacrifice does not go unnoticed and unremarked this evening.

1027
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:07,082
[SPEAKER_18]: He's got a legal mind for the state laws and the city ordinances.

1028
01:28:07,602 --> 01:28:17,907
[SPEAKER_18]: He always brings up that subtle point of procedure or the rules or the court precedent for us to consider.

1029
01:28:17,947 --> 01:28:29,992
[SPEAKER_18]: And he always wants to make sure that we're dotting our I's and crossing our T's so that when we pass things as this council, that they are enduring and that they live in the history of our city for a long time.

1030
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:31,633
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have appreciated

1031
01:28:32,552 --> 01:28:36,513
[SPEAKER_18]: learning as much as I can from him in the time that I've been able to sit next to him.

1032
01:28:36,593 --> 01:28:41,714
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to thank you, Councilor Knight, for your service to the city and for what you've been able to share with me.

1033
01:28:43,334 --> 01:28:45,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

1034
01:28:47,235 --> 01:28:52,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Unlike many other people, I knew Councilor Knight when he was Adam and a young man with my son.

1035
01:28:52,315 --> 01:28:59,337
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have a little history going back, but Adam's probably one of the smartest people I know on this council.

1036
01:29:00,277 --> 01:29:01,057
[SPEAKER_13]: He knows the rules.

1037
01:29:02,112 --> 01:29:09,275
[SPEAKER_13]: He knows the laws and anytime I ever had a question of anything, he'd be the guy I called all the time.

1038
01:29:09,375 --> 01:29:14,377
[SPEAKER_13]: His knowledge of everything in government, just phenomenal.

1039
01:29:15,298 --> 01:29:16,998
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish I knew half of what he knew.

1040
01:29:17,859 --> 01:29:23,621
[SPEAKER_13]: But he's been a dedicated servant in government for his whole life.

1041
01:29:24,102 --> 01:29:25,102
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where his family came from.

1042
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:28,266
[SPEAKER_13]: He served at Senator Shannon with my son.

1043
01:29:28,766 --> 01:29:31,208
[SPEAKER_13]: They worked together in government offices.

1044
01:29:33,209 --> 01:29:37,252
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know the toll that he's got a young family.

1045
01:29:37,272 --> 01:29:39,254
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the toll that it's taken on him over the years.

1046
01:29:39,994 --> 01:29:43,497
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanted to thank him for his time and dedication to the city.

1047
01:29:44,317 --> 01:29:47,199
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think he'll be around when people need him for things.

1048
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:50,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Like myself, we're born to race here.

1049
01:29:50,142 --> 01:29:52,964
[SPEAKER_13]: The Mustang runs, Mustang blue runs through our veins.

1050
01:29:54,201 --> 01:29:58,284
[SPEAKER_13]: And he'll always be here like myself, always be here with a phone call away.

1051
01:29:58,305 --> 01:30:01,207
[SPEAKER_13]: So Adam, thank you for your service.

1052
01:30:01,527 --> 01:30:02,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your friendship.

1053
01:30:06,431 --> 01:30:16,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I think that it's tough when it's one person that leaves, but when it's two, it's really tough.

1054
01:30:19,124 --> 01:30:19,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Three.

1055
01:30:19,804 --> 01:30:21,565
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I apologize.

1056
01:30:21,906 --> 01:30:27,609
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone that I've worked with, I mean, for a long time now, so I apologize, Councilor.

1057
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:31,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Believe me, I have your speech ready, so I hope you have tissues.

1058
01:30:34,433 --> 01:30:37,595
[SPEAKER_17]: I love listening to kid laugh.

1059
01:30:37,615 --> 01:30:38,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you ever notice that?

1060
01:30:38,496 --> 01:30:40,077
[SPEAKER_17]: It's my mission in life.

1061
01:30:40,337 --> 01:30:41,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's my mission in life.

1062
01:30:41,898 --> 01:30:46,681
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just want everybody to realize, I think that,

1063
01:30:49,254 --> 01:31:13,354
[SPEAKER_17]: You might not agree with him a thousand percent of the time you might get irritated with him Sometimes he does it with a subtle rule or a law, but sometimes he does it with a kick in the face but he does it all for a reason and something that I admire and His passion and love for the city.

1064
01:31:13,594 --> 01:31:15,856
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that that's a common denominator tonight.

1065
01:31:16,617 --> 01:31:17,197
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that

1066
01:31:18,803 --> 01:31:20,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello touched on it.

1067
01:31:22,166 --> 01:31:25,388
[SPEAKER_17]: He is probably the smartest person I've ever been around.

1068
01:31:26,489 --> 01:31:28,411
[SPEAKER_17]: I would call him so giddy about something.

1069
01:31:28,511 --> 01:31:29,231
[SPEAKER_17]: I found something.

1070
01:31:29,292 --> 01:31:32,214
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd say, Adam, how about this rule?

1071
01:31:32,414 --> 01:31:33,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Or how about this?

1072
01:31:33,055 --> 01:31:34,736
[SPEAKER_17]: And he'd say, no, that's good, George.

1073
01:31:35,376 --> 01:31:36,117
[SPEAKER_17]: But how about this?

1074
01:31:36,517 --> 01:31:37,618
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like, I was wrong.

1075
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,881
[SPEAKER_17]: But he wouldn't tell you.

1076
01:31:42,649 --> 01:31:46,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Or it would be like, I have to do this, Adam, could you, I sent over a speech.

1077
01:31:47,792 --> 01:31:54,115
[SPEAKER_17]: And 15 minutes later, I'd get something back and say, wow, that's great, but that's nothing of what I sent you.

1078
01:31:54,835 --> 01:32:02,599
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's, when I first started running for school committee, one of the first phone calls I made was to a young man named Adam Knight.

1079
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,801
[SPEAKER_17]: And he was amazing.

1080
01:32:07,161 --> 01:32:07,782
[SPEAKER_17]: And he helped,

1081
01:32:08,826 --> 01:32:15,209
[SPEAKER_17]: mold that team that started my journey as an elected official more than 16 years ago.

1082
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:20,652
[SPEAKER_17]: And I admire your passion.

1083
01:32:20,992 --> 01:32:27,756
[SPEAKER_17]: I admire your, what people don't realize is your strong integrity and for what's right.

1084
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:30,391
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's something that we laugh about.

1085
01:32:30,431 --> 01:32:32,233
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to lie to you, Adam.

1086
01:32:32,253 --> 01:32:35,076
[SPEAKER_17]: The last couple of months, we've had a few jokes behind your back.

1087
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:48,912
[SPEAKER_17]: And I tell you, people don't realize, when he first got angry because somebody moved all of his paperwork, people don't realize that's years, years of organizing.

1088
01:32:50,017 --> 01:32:53,559
[SPEAKER_17]: And if Adam needed anything, if I said something, and I'm like, geez, I don't know where to look for it.

1089
01:32:53,919 --> 01:32:59,863
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd look at Adam, and he would know exactly out of a mound of pile of paperwork that he knew exactly where to go to help.

1090
01:33:00,864 --> 01:33:02,185
[SPEAKER_17]: And he probably still has it right now.

1091
01:33:04,026 --> 01:33:04,286
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1092
01:33:05,847 --> 01:33:14,693
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that knowing the Knight family, and I was fortunate to know his dad and know his beautiful wife and his kids,

1093
01:33:15,752 --> 01:33:17,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I think this is good for Adam.

1094
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:20,857
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that the last year that he had has been very difficult.

1095
01:33:21,337 --> 01:33:30,766
[SPEAKER_17]: He's been true to what you're supposed to be and what we should all admire too as a family man that supported his brother through probably his most difficult time.

1096
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:37,232
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, you know, I wish people would know what you've gone through.

1097
01:33:38,072 --> 01:33:41,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but as a friend, like I said,

1098
01:33:42,236 --> 01:33:50,702
[SPEAKER_17]: my first phone call, then my second phone call to get whether your approval or your understanding or you correcting me.

1099
01:33:51,342 --> 01:33:52,583
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that, my friend.

1100
01:33:52,903 --> 01:33:56,406
[SPEAKER_17]: And like I said, there's a common denominator tonight.

1101
01:33:57,586 --> 01:34:04,211
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sad because I'm not going to see you on a regular basis, that we're going to be mandated to see each other at least every other Tuesday.

1102
01:34:04,831 --> 01:34:10,896
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm proud that we're friends and I'm proud that my kids

1103
01:34:11,977 --> 01:34:15,420
[SPEAKER_17]: get to be around Adam Knight because he's a great role model.

1104
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:33,556
[SPEAKER_17]: I know my daughter Gianna loves him and his family and I know John is at Merrimack and he's following Adam's footsteps out of Merrimack and I know how much Dina loves both you and Rick and what you guys have done for our community.

1105
01:34:34,998 --> 01:34:36,499
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna miss you my friend and

1106
01:34:37,674 --> 01:34:45,143
[SPEAKER_17]: But I thank this opportunity because I have a good friend that I feel I can count on for the rest of my life.

1107
01:34:45,203 --> 01:34:46,424
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

1108
01:34:50,629 --> 01:34:50,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1109
01:34:51,049 --> 01:34:55,975
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a few more counselors, including myself, but we're going to go to Rep Donato first because he has to go.

1110
01:34:56,035 --> 01:34:57,377
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to jump the line.

1111
01:35:01,496 --> 01:35:02,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Just gonna wait for the mic.

1112
01:35:03,396 --> 01:35:04,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hit the button on the mic.

1113
01:35:04,597 --> 01:35:05,197
[SPEAKER_00]: First time here?

1114
01:35:05,217 --> 01:35:06,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that's good.

1115
01:35:06,417 --> 01:35:07,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, go ahead again.

1116
01:35:07,157 --> 01:35:07,637
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

1117
01:35:07,797 --> 01:35:08,238
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1118
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:08,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1119
01:35:09,998 --> 01:35:10,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.

1120
01:35:10,878 --> 01:35:15,479
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank the members of the city council for giving me the opportunity to be before them.

1121
01:35:15,979 --> 01:35:30,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my grandson with me who is flying to Florida to visit his family so that I will have the opportunity to... I hope his arms don't get tired.

1122
01:35:33,999 --> 01:35:37,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you notice, Madam President, I didn't even- Get it?

1123
01:35:38,262 --> 01:35:39,143
[SPEAKER_17]: No, all right, kid.

1124
01:35:39,563 --> 01:35:55,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say this, Councilor Schiappelle, if you wanna see both Councilor Gaviello and Councilor Knight, because you'll miss them, come to Demet's in the morning and buy the coffee.

1125
01:35:55,595 --> 01:35:56,495
[SPEAKER_00]: And buy the coffee.

1126
01:35:57,756 --> 01:35:58,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Buy the coffee, okay.

1127
01:36:02,199 --> 01:36:02,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of respect,

1128
01:36:04,397 --> 01:36:15,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Knight and I will not tell you how long ago it was that he walked the streets for me when I was campaigning for the Medford School Committee and the Medford City Council.

1129
01:36:15,823 --> 01:36:22,207
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long we have known each other and how much respect that I have for him.

1130
01:36:24,193 --> 01:36:39,908
[SPEAKER_00]: and his understanding of what the rules and the regulations are for the council members to understand, and his understanding of the laws that govern our communities and govern our state.

1131
01:36:40,568 --> 01:36:47,214
[SPEAKER_00]: He is, as the vice president said, he is on a number of occasions indicated

1132
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:51,352
[SPEAKER_00]: that the council was working in the wrong direction.

1133
01:36:52,072 --> 01:37:01,614
[SPEAKER_00]: And the direction was based upon his knowledge of what the rules are for the council and what the laws are of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1134
01:37:04,114 --> 01:37:08,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people would say, he talks so fast I didn't understand what he was saying.

1135
01:37:12,276 --> 01:37:15,757
[SPEAKER_00]: But he did that on purpose, because he didn't want you to understand what he was saying.

1136
01:37:18,351 --> 01:37:22,873
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been doing that for the 35 years that we've known each other.

1137
01:37:23,373 --> 01:37:31,337
[SPEAKER_00]: So his dedication to this community will not go unnoticed.

1138
01:37:32,757 --> 01:37:39,100
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a time that Councilor Knight will come to this community once again

1139
01:37:40,905 --> 01:37:45,747
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, this is the way things should be done in our community.

1140
01:37:46,568 --> 01:37:48,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worked hard to do it.

1141
01:37:48,629 --> 01:38:03,876
[SPEAKER_00]: He has demonstrated that in his work with the late Senator Shannon and the dedication that he had with his friend, who was the governor's counselor, Michael Callahan, for many, many years.

1142
01:38:05,217 --> 01:38:16,762
[SPEAKER_00]: So his involvement in the inner workings of the government in this community, he knows what he's talking about and how to get it done.

1143
01:38:17,762 --> 01:38:18,903
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will miss

1144
01:38:20,902 --> 01:38:38,936
[SPEAKER_00]: you, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President, you'll be banging the gavel and you'll be looking down at that seat and waiting for Councilor Knight to say, Mr. President, that's not the correct motion for that particular issue.

1145
01:38:39,676 --> 01:38:43,619
[SPEAKER_00]: So Adam, thank you for everything that you've done for our community.

1146
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:45,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your friendship.

1147
01:38:45,721 --> 01:38:48,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time campaigning for me.

1148
01:39:02,967 --> 01:39:25,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam President, we have not known each other for that long a period of time, but I have observed the dedication that you have to this community and what you represent as a sincere, honest, dedicated individual and has demonstrated to this council and to the public

1149
01:39:26,667 --> 01:39:31,878
[SPEAKER_00]: your ability to be a conscientious president of this city council.

1150
01:39:32,339 --> 01:39:37,910
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should be proud of the fact that you have been there and handling

1151
01:39:39,397 --> 01:39:40,238
[SPEAKER_00]: these counselors.

1152
01:39:40,938 --> 01:39:45,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are difficult times, not only with the counselors, but with the public at large.

1153
01:39:46,161 --> 01:39:47,502
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done it honorably.

1154
01:39:47,862 --> 01:39:49,723
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done it with integrity.

1155
01:39:50,344 --> 01:39:51,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm proud to know you.

1156
01:39:52,025 --> 01:39:59,149
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that even though you're going to stay home, take care of your family, you're still going to be involved in this community.

1157
01:39:59,509 --> 01:40:02,932
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you for your work on behalf of our delegation.

1158
01:40:32,978 --> 01:40:33,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1159
01:40:33,178 --> 01:40:33,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1160
01:40:33,959 --> 01:40:34,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1161
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:36,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight for briefly sharing.

1162
01:40:36,121 --> 01:40:37,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll go to counselor saying.

1163
01:40:38,863 --> 01:40:39,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1164
01:40:39,524 --> 01:40:44,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Um thank you, Councilor Knight, Adam for all your service on the City Council.

1165
01:40:45,229 --> 01:40:49,293
[SPEAKER_15]: I think at home and both both at home and behind the rails.

1166
01:40:49,313 --> 01:40:52,056
[SPEAKER_15]: I think people often see the verbal jousting, but people don't

1167
01:40:58,622 --> 01:41:05,332
[SPEAKER_15]: You're so upsmart, so witty, and so funny, and you brighten up all my Tuesdays.

1168
01:41:05,873 --> 01:41:09,739
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's been a difficult last few months, but I've been missing you quite a bit.

1169
01:41:11,701 --> 01:41:27,614
[SPEAKER_15]: being in the council chambers with you is like for me going back to school and I'm constantly pushed to be better, to do my homework even more, to study and to be prepared because you're just so prepared and so on top of things whenever you walk into the council chambers.

1170
01:41:28,414 --> 01:41:33,136
[SPEAKER_15]: I think people should appreciate all the work that you've done for the city.

1171
01:41:33,977 --> 01:41:37,178
[SPEAKER_15]: You fight the hard fight for workers, for working people in the city.

1172
01:41:37,619 --> 01:41:48,464
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you oftentimes ask the right questions and get us to think more deeply about what actions we're taking, what we're not doing, why we're not doing things.

1173
01:41:48,684 --> 01:41:55,347
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that voice is just so important to us in this chamber, to have that compass for us in this community.

1174
01:41:57,288 --> 01:42:08,457
[SPEAKER_15]: really like there's there's so much I have to thank you for for for this term for the lessons I've learned on the City Council and for a lot of what I want to do in the future.

1175
01:42:09,418 --> 01:42:20,006
[SPEAKER_15]: You've pushed me to be a lot better and so I really appreciate that and I'm sure Medford appreciates it too because you've pushed Medford to become a better place.

1176
01:42:21,267 --> 01:42:21,927
[SPEAKER_15]: We're gonna need

1177
01:42:23,228 --> 01:42:31,875
[SPEAKER_15]: that same tenacity, that same fire and passion in the future, but I know you'll stay around it.

1178
01:42:31,975 --> 01:42:32,876
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you'll stay involved.

1179
01:42:34,157 --> 01:42:34,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1180
01:42:34,738 --> 01:42:35,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Collins.

1181
01:42:38,421 --> 01:42:39,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight, we're sorry to see you go.

1182
01:42:40,282 --> 01:42:42,784
[SPEAKER_03]: You leave big shoes to fill on this council.

1183
01:42:44,206 --> 01:42:45,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people have remarked upon it, but

1184
01:42:46,499 --> 01:42:51,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Your depth of institutional knowledge has been such an asset to this council in the two years that I've been involved.

1185
01:42:51,980 --> 01:43:00,361
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to need somebody to step up and learn every line of parliamentary procedure to save us from those future kind of borderline situations.

1186
01:43:00,381 --> 01:43:02,662
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like, oh, is that a simple or a super majority?

1187
01:43:03,322 --> 01:43:05,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we always counted on you to know that.

1188
01:43:06,182 --> 01:43:14,384
[SPEAKER_03]: But in all seriousness, I think that your respect and your affection for the city is spelled in the rigor that you've always brought to this

1189
01:43:15,071 --> 01:43:40,262
[SPEAKER_03]: role, you have a razor-sharp sense of right and wrong, you don't suffer fools gladly, and I think that there's been many topics that we've discussed on the council, many papers that we've deliberated where that has been an asset to the outcomes because we've always been focused on making sure that the city is headed in the right direction and that the council is doing the right thing, that the council is doing its job as you see it.

1190
01:43:40,462 --> 01:43:44,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's always been very clear and I as one council have always appreciated it.

1191
01:43:45,247 --> 01:43:47,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Best of luck to you and your family and everything that lies before you.

1192
01:43:47,868 --> 01:43:48,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your service.

1193
01:43:49,368 --> 01:43:49,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1194
01:43:55,050 --> 01:44:00,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, as has been said by most of us, or all of us, you make everyone on this Council better.

1195
01:44:00,931 --> 01:44:14,115
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter the resolution I introduce, no matter how innocuous or how controversial, part of my preparation is trying to get into your head and think as best as I can every legal, procedural, historical argument that you're going to make.

1196
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:18,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure I've ever gotten all of them, but I think I've started to get close.

1197
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:24,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that your skill and tenacity demands the same of every single counselor behind this rail.

1198
01:44:26,132 --> 01:44:31,014
[SPEAKER_09]: As everyone has said, there is no denying how smart you are and how you know your stuff.

1199
01:44:31,314 --> 01:44:35,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the off chance that you don't know your stuff, you know how to present it in a way.

1200
01:44:35,556 --> 01:44:37,939
[SPEAKER_09]: that makes the rest of us question if we know our stuff.

1201
01:44:38,339 --> 01:44:43,004
[SPEAKER_09]: So you keep us on our toes, for sure, and that will be missed.

1202
01:44:43,565 --> 01:44:50,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Your dedication to Medford, to the workers of Medford, to labor, your knowledge and your humor will be greatly missed in this body.

1203
01:44:50,812 --> 01:44:55,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sad to see you go, but it's been great to have you back, if only for a few meetings.

1204
01:44:56,380 --> 01:45:03,748
[SPEAKER_09]: and remind us kind of what was missing, that little, that salt, that something that was missing that keeps us all awake and engaged.

1205
01:45:04,449 --> 01:45:09,374
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thank you for your service and excited and nervous to see what you do next.

1206
01:45:14,059 --> 01:45:17,262
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to former Councilor Marks and then anyone else.

1207
01:45:19,517 --> 01:45:26,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President, and I, too, wanna thank Councilor Knight for his friendship and his many years of service.

1208
01:45:26,899 --> 01:45:34,902
[SPEAKER_12]: As you stated, Madam President, there's been no bigger advocate for working families in this community than Councilor Knight.

1209
01:45:36,102 --> 01:45:46,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I gotta be honest, I learned so much regarding living wages and rights of workers from listening to Councilor Knight over the years.

1210
01:45:46,885 --> 01:45:48,166
[SPEAKER_12]: It made me a better councilor.

1211
01:45:49,006 --> 01:46:00,874
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know over the years, when he first got on, he was a young man at the time, and he's still a young man, but, you know, some of us said, oh, I hear some fresh meat coming onto the council.

1212
01:46:01,694 --> 01:46:05,217
[SPEAKER_12]: And before you knew it, we had our own parliamentarian.

1213
01:46:05,497 --> 01:46:12,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it was Councilor Knight, honestly, that knew the rules and regulations inside and out.

1214
01:46:12,782 --> 01:46:14,783
[SPEAKER_12]: And the only way I could combat

1215
01:46:15,803 --> 01:46:37,232
[SPEAKER_12]: his knowledge was I thought if I spoke louder that I would I would win the debate and that was my attack when I when we used to go at it he'd bring up rules and regulations facts and figures and I would mostly yell and raise my voice and I thought that I won the argument but I

1216
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:44,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew all the time that I never won the argument because he was armed better than I was.

1217
01:46:44,277 --> 01:46:47,820
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to thank you for your years of service.

1218
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:59,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor, it was a pleasure getting to know you, the person who you are, the family man, the care that you have for this community, and I hope to see you around the community.

1219
01:47:00,049 --> 01:47:00,389
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1220
01:47:04,612 --> 01:47:05,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else would like to speak?

1221
01:47:07,318 --> 01:47:07,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1222
01:47:08,459 --> 01:47:10,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Madam President, thank you very much.

1223
01:47:11,401 --> 01:47:18,847
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't realize that subtlety was such a strong suit of mine, but apparently a couple of my colleagues feel so it is.

1224
01:47:20,689 --> 01:47:22,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, who would have thunk it?

1225
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:26,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in 2013 when I was elected to the city council and I was the liberal.

1226
01:47:33,769 --> 01:47:34,349
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you.

1227
01:47:35,009 --> 01:47:36,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for all the kind words that you said.

1228
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:44,793
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's kind of weird getting out of the public life, getting out of electoral politics.

1229
01:47:44,893 --> 01:47:48,034
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, everywhere you go, you have people coming up to you.

1230
01:47:48,074 --> 01:47:49,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your service.

1231
01:47:49,095 --> 01:47:50,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your service.

1232
01:47:50,215 --> 01:47:51,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your service.

1233
01:47:51,295 --> 01:47:52,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm looking at them like they're crazy.

1234
01:47:53,056 --> 01:47:53,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a veteran.

1235
01:47:54,276 --> 01:47:55,397
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you're talking about.

1236
01:47:55,417 --> 01:47:56,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your service.

1237
01:47:56,837 --> 01:47:57,778
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels wrong to me.

1238
01:47:59,478 --> 01:48:01,359
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels like I should be the one saying thank you.

1239
01:48:03,078 --> 01:48:03,419
[SPEAKER_10]: truly.

1240
01:48:04,439 --> 01:48:08,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Serving the residents of this community as a member of this council has been an honor, truly has.

1241
01:48:09,782 --> 01:48:11,363
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been a great run.

1242
01:48:12,064 --> 01:48:19,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very proud of the work that together we've been able to accomplish and very thankful for the friendships I've been able to make along the way.

1243
01:48:21,029 --> 01:48:23,030
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I wish the incoming council the best of luck.

1244
01:48:25,407 --> 01:48:28,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank my past and current colleagues for their service and work.

1245
01:48:29,491 --> 01:48:30,451
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had a lot of laughs.

1246
01:48:30,632 --> 01:48:31,973
[SPEAKER_10]: We've done a lot of good for this community.

1247
01:48:32,193 --> 01:48:34,375
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've always kept Medford in the forefront.

1248
01:48:35,876 --> 01:48:37,197
[SPEAKER_10]: To my family, they've been great.

1249
01:48:38,658 --> 01:48:40,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Sacrificed a lot to allow me this opportunity.

1250
01:48:41,301 --> 01:48:42,962
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's something I'll be forever grateful for.

1251
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:51,950
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice to see my old colleagues here, my old friends, Councilor Marks and I, at a number

1252
01:48:52,583 --> 01:48:55,446
[SPEAKER_10]: a number of great debates right in these chambers.

1253
01:48:56,406 --> 01:49:07,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God for TV3, because we can go back and watch them and laugh at what donkeys we were making of ourselves as we picket back and forth.

1254
01:49:09,991 --> 01:49:16,734
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm upset that Representative Donato had to leave because I remember back a number of years ago, my grandfather was still with us.

1255
01:49:16,895 --> 01:49:18,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And I went over to the house all excited.

1256
01:49:19,056 --> 01:49:21,217
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a young kid and I'm working on a political campaign.

1257
01:49:21,257 --> 01:49:25,579
[SPEAKER_10]: And I grabbed my grandfather and I'm saying, Hey, grandpa, we got to help this guy, Paul Donato.

1258
01:49:25,619 --> 01:49:26,579
[SPEAKER_10]: He's running for state rep.

1259
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:27,540
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, he's my friend.

1260
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:30,061
[SPEAKER_10]: And Donato, guy's a bum.

1261
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:32,270
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean?

1262
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:33,930
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not supporting Donato.

1263
01:49:34,071 --> 01:49:34,491
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a grip.

1264
01:49:34,511 --> 01:49:35,311
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you talking about?

1265
01:49:35,331 --> 01:49:35,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Now?

1266
01:49:35,451 --> 01:49:37,751
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, you know, 2000 or so.

1267
01:49:38,191 --> 01:49:38,571
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a grip.

1268
01:49:38,611 --> 01:49:39,292
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you talking about?

1269
01:49:39,312 --> 01:49:41,472
[SPEAKER_10]: He ran against my friend Dennis McKenna in 1982.

1270
01:49:41,512 --> 01:49:43,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not supporting that guy.

1271
01:49:44,933 --> 01:49:52,094
[SPEAKER_10]: So if that tells you anything about the Knights in the way that we approach politics, you know, sometimes we have a long memory.

1272
01:49:55,335 --> 01:49:59,996
[SPEAKER_10]: But with that being said, this has been a job that

1273
01:50:00,512 --> 01:50:01,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I had never considered work.

1274
01:50:02,553 --> 01:50:13,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I considered it something that I love to do, a form of service and an opportunity for me to give back to a city that's given me so much.

1275
01:50:14,396 --> 01:50:20,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Sitting here tonight, being able to reflect on all the good that we've been able to accomplish together is truly rewarding.

1276
01:50:20,317 --> 01:50:22,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank you all for being here this evening.

1277
01:50:23,968 --> 01:50:28,110
[SPEAKER_10]: the people that put me in the seat, because without them, it never would have been possible.

1278
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:36,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Most importantly, though, I do have to, again, reiterate thanks to my family and my campaign team for all the work that they put forward over the years.

1279
01:50:37,414 --> 01:50:41,816
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very difficult job, and there's two jobs when you get involved in this type of business.

1280
01:50:42,536 --> 01:50:46,197
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you don't do the first job good, it doesn't matter how good you are at the second job.

1281
01:50:46,898 --> 01:50:49,639
[SPEAKER_10]: And the first job is getting elected, and nobody can do that alone.

1282
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:52,280
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're only as good as the team that you have around you.

1283
01:50:54,019 --> 01:50:57,000
[SPEAKER_10]: You get elected, and you get in the seat, and then you've got to earn your bonus.

1284
01:50:57,861 --> 01:51:02,203
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you can't do the first job right, you're never going to be able to get a chance to do the second job.

1285
01:51:02,603 --> 01:51:09,847
[SPEAKER_10]: And my campaign committee worked tirelessly, tirelessly, over the last decade to ensure that I had this opportunity.

1286
01:51:09,907 --> 01:51:11,928
[SPEAKER_10]: And for that, I will be photographed.

1287
01:51:51,446 --> 01:51:54,908
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to note for the record, you will get your chair.

1288
01:51:56,569 --> 01:51:57,629
[SPEAKER_18]: You will get your chair.

1289
01:52:02,271 --> 01:52:04,512
[SPEAKER_18]: The only counselor to ever get a chair and a clock.

1290
01:52:07,394 --> 01:52:08,895
[SPEAKER_09]: The clock is to count down to the chair.

1291
01:52:13,925 --> 01:52:19,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins, all those in favor?

1292
01:52:19,547 --> 01:52:19,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1293
01:52:20,287 --> 01:52:21,848
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1294
01:52:23,148 --> 01:52:24,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1295
01:52:24,329 --> 01:52:31,931
[SPEAKER_09]: 23473, offered by Vice President Bears, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we commend President Morell for her outstanding service on the Medford City Council from 2020 to 2024.

1296
01:52:34,352 --> 01:52:34,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Fares.

1297
01:52:35,252 --> 01:52:36,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam President.

1298
01:52:37,714 --> 01:52:46,237
[SPEAKER_18]: It has been noted multiple times on what remains of the public discourse of the city that I only got the most votes in the last election because you didn't run.

1299
01:52:46,257 --> 01:52:49,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I said that.

1300
01:52:49,939 --> 01:52:50,439
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1301
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,600
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know who the anonymous commenters are.

1302
01:52:53,181 --> 01:52:54,821
[SPEAKER_18]: If they are you, I understand.

1303
01:52:55,522 --> 01:53:01,925
[SPEAKER_18]: But I really cannot begin to talk about what it's meant to

1304
01:53:03,248 --> 01:53:03,949
[SPEAKER_18]: serve with you.

1305
01:53:04,529 --> 01:53:08,032
[SPEAKER_18]: We ran together in our first campaign.

1306
01:53:08,312 --> 01:53:10,453
[SPEAKER_18]: We got elected.

1307
01:53:11,514 --> 01:53:15,157
[SPEAKER_18]: We came onto this council in January 2020.

1308
01:53:16,718 --> 01:53:31,108
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I think all of the things, the kind things that have been said about Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks two years ago, and also some of the funny ones, we experienced them directly.

1309
01:53:31,168 --> 01:53:32,029
[SPEAKER_18]: We experienced

1310
01:53:33,186 --> 01:53:43,890
[SPEAKER_18]: the very specific legalisms of Councilor Knight, the history and the knowledge of Councilor Caraviello, the history and the knowledge and loud speaking of Councilor Marks.

1311
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:46,250
[SPEAKER_18]: And we experienced it together.

1312
01:53:46,891 --> 01:53:58,755
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know that if I had been elected just on my own without having you been elected alongside me, that I would have handled it a quarter as well as I was able to sharing that experience.

1313
01:54:00,315 --> 01:54:07,162
[SPEAKER_18]: those first few months, and what am I kidding, those first two years, without being able to serve alongside you.

1314
01:54:08,792 --> 01:54:11,394
[SPEAKER_18]: You are incredibly devoted to this city.

1315
01:54:11,574 --> 01:54:13,656
[SPEAKER_18]: You came to the city and you made it your home.

1316
01:54:13,696 --> 01:54:16,558
[SPEAKER_18]: And you said, if I'm going to make this my home, I want to make it better.

1317
01:54:16,618 --> 01:54:18,040
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to devote my time to that.

1318
01:54:19,201 --> 01:54:29,929
[SPEAKER_18]: You have devoted immense time to this council, to your colleagues, to the pursuit of bold ideas,

1319
01:54:32,131 --> 01:54:37,694
[SPEAKER_18]: ideas that we hadn't tried before, ideas that had been put on the table and hadn't made their way through the process.

1320
01:54:38,935 --> 01:54:40,316
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've accomplished a lot.

1321
01:54:40,836 --> 01:54:49,081
[SPEAKER_18]: And you've accomplished a lot over the past four years, I think, especially to note that you've served four years, but two of those as president.

1322
01:54:51,663 --> 01:54:56,605
[SPEAKER_18]: is important to note as well, that you have led this council this term with aplomb.

1323
01:54:56,665 --> 01:54:58,587
[SPEAKER_18]: We have accomplished an incredible amount.

1324
01:54:58,647 --> 01:55:00,528
[SPEAKER_18]: We have been an incredibly civil council.

1325
01:55:01,568 --> 01:55:09,513
[SPEAKER_18]: I think if we go back and look at the TV3 records, only 5% to 10% of the time will we have been making donkeys out of ourselves.

1326
01:55:10,093 --> 01:55:18,318
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's a testament to state leadership and leadership that brings our focus back to the issues at hand.

1327
01:55:19,859 --> 01:55:26,641
[SPEAKER_18]: I have been very lucky to serve with you, and I am not sure what it's going to mean.

1328
01:55:27,381 --> 01:55:35,224
[SPEAKER_18]: As Councilor Scarapelli noted, or President Zagreb, I don't know what it means to be a Councilor without President Nicole Morell, Councilor Nicole Morell.

1329
01:55:36,524 --> 01:55:45,352
[SPEAKER_18]: While I invite all of my former colleagues to call me and tell me what I'm doing wrong, if you all do it at the same time, I'm gonna take her call first.

1330
01:55:45,472 --> 01:55:48,794
[SPEAKER_18]: So, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1331
01:55:49,115 --> 01:55:53,978
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope that we'll be able to pull you back in.

1332
01:55:54,599 --> 01:55:54,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1333
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:59,083
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a funny position to like calling people to say nice things.

1334
01:55:59,403 --> 01:56:00,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

1335
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:01,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Praise me.

1336
01:56:01,084 --> 01:56:01,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Praise me.

1337
01:56:09,331 --> 01:56:18,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this will be one of the last very long list of unenviable tasks in your tenure as president of the City Council is calling on people to then speak about you.

1338
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:26,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Nicole, it's hard to know where to start in congratulating you on your two terms.

1339
01:56:27,145 --> 01:56:34,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely this must be one of the densest tenures of any Medford City Councilor to serve two years during a pandemic and then two as president.

1340
01:56:37,754 --> 01:56:42,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty remarkable what you've been able to accomplish in your two terms.

1341
01:56:42,778 --> 01:56:50,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, a phrase that I heard from you that I learned from you is occupying spaces that weren't designed for people like you.

1342
01:56:50,624 --> 01:57:01,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I think often about how you were running for city council two years before I did in completely certain terms.

1343
01:57:02,503 --> 01:57:11,815
[SPEAKER_03]: gave the way for myself and people like me to think about engaging in civic life in ways that are not traditional, that never felt possible or likely.

1344
01:57:11,835 --> 01:57:20,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a gift that you gave to not just myself for this opportunity, but for the community of Medford for allowing, you know,

1345
01:57:20,828 --> 01:57:24,912
[SPEAKER_03]: representation to blossom and become better and become more representative.

1346
01:57:26,353 --> 01:57:39,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And as that continues to expand and to blossom over time, you will have been a crucial ingredient in that for future generations of Medford City Councils.

1347
01:57:39,364 --> 01:57:45,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it deserves repeating that you've presided over a really effective, a really civil,

1348
01:57:47,597 --> 01:57:54,699
[SPEAKER_03]: a friendlier Council than has always been true and I think that's a real benefit to the effectiveness of this Council I think that's a benefit to the community.

1349
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:58,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it makes City Hall more welcoming and inclusive space.

1350
01:57:59,681 --> 01:58:02,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just so important and that will continue after you as well.

1351
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:11,887
[SPEAKER_03]: so many projects that I hope that you can really feel the gravity of as you leave office.

1352
01:58:12,608 --> 01:58:21,836
[SPEAKER_03]: You were pushing for our zoning overhaul for two years before I was ever elected, and that's going to be a defining feature of the term ahead.

1353
01:58:22,637 --> 01:58:28,122
[SPEAKER_03]: In so many ways, you've teed us up for, you've teed up the future council, perhaps the council after that.

1354
01:58:29,083 --> 01:58:46,857
[SPEAKER_03]: for success with the projects that you've advocated for, that you've worked for, with the relationships that you've cultivated with members of, with City Hall staff, and with the new and better expectations that we have come to set for this City Council and that residents and staff have come to set for this City Council.

1355
01:58:46,997 --> 01:58:54,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So my hope for you is that you feel as positive and as proud about your tenure

1356
01:58:54,662 --> 01:59:08,561
[SPEAKER_03]: on city council as everybody else does, because it's a gift to leave us in such a position to be so much more effective and inclusive in our future work.

1357
01:59:08,781 --> 01:59:09,943
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for that.

1358
01:59:10,363 --> 01:59:12,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the sacrifices that you've made to be here.

1359
01:59:13,587 --> 01:59:25,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that your life after city council will continue to be extremely full and busy doing incredible work on MIT campus, as well as taking care of the cutest two-year-old in Medford.

1360
01:59:26,113 --> 01:59:29,954
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, too, hope that we can lure you back in in the future.

1361
01:59:29,994 --> 01:59:30,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Nicole.

1362
01:59:31,175 --> 01:59:31,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1363
01:59:32,195 --> 01:59:32,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

1364
01:59:33,076 --> 01:59:33,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

1365
01:59:34,386 --> 01:59:39,914
[SPEAKER_13]: So as Councilor—I mean, as a representative, I don't know you as well as they know me.

1366
01:59:39,954 --> 01:59:41,637
[SPEAKER_13]: I've only known you for the last four or five years.

1367
01:59:44,445 --> 01:59:45,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Muroi came out of nowhere.

1368
01:59:46,367 --> 01:59:59,657
[SPEAKER_13]: She burst onto the scene, new face, no not being, you know, this is, for those who don't have grew up in the community, it's very tough to break into being an outsider, coming in and breaking into the scene.

1369
01:59:59,717 --> 02:00:02,499
[SPEAKER_13]: And she did that very well with grace and honor.

1370
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:06,082
[SPEAKER_13]: And in a short time, she became president.

1371
02:00:06,122 --> 02:00:11,527
[SPEAKER_13]: And being a past president, I know the sacrifices that it makes, that it takes to be a president.

1372
02:00:11,567 --> 02:00:12,928
[SPEAKER_13]: People think you should show up and do it tonight,

1373
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:15,682
[SPEAKER_13]: she gets a lot more calls than anyone even knows.

1374
02:00:16,202 --> 02:00:20,045
[SPEAKER_13]: And she did it while she was becoming a new mother also.

1375
02:00:20,105 --> 02:00:27,631
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for your family giving you, letting you come in even while you were having a child.

1376
02:00:27,671 --> 02:00:28,332
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for that.

1377
02:00:28,592 --> 02:00:33,155
[SPEAKER_13]: But you pursued women's rights and you made sure that everybody had a voice here.

1378
02:00:33,216 --> 02:00:34,757
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thank you for that.

1379
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:40,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully you, like the other people, you won't disappear.

1380
02:00:40,963 --> 02:00:46,246
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll be around and you'll be, for that phone call to be made or maybe come back again to do something.

1381
02:00:46,627 --> 02:00:51,189
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for your service and thank you for your family for giving us to you.

1382
02:00:51,249 --> 02:00:51,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1383
02:00:51,850 --> 02:00:53,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1384
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,481
[SPEAKER_09]: save it out for last.

1385
02:00:58,561 --> 02:01:05,907
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I, uh, Councilor Morelle, I just, Council President, um, I'm honored to call you president.

1386
02:01:06,087 --> 02:01:12,772
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I've reached out to you some tough meetings and I wanted to, you know, publicly say that

1387
02:01:14,306 --> 02:01:19,311
[SPEAKER_17]: you've handled yourself with grace and honor, and I think you've been a true leader to this council.

1388
02:01:19,751 --> 02:01:28,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Councilor Caraviello said, it's not easy when your community is viewed as divided, you know, the new metric, the old metric.

1389
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:37,968
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would get phone calls, imagine this Morell, I said, imagine this Morell, imagine Nicole Morell would

1390
02:01:39,744 --> 02:01:50,389
[SPEAKER_17]: take an opportunity to stand up and run for an office that's not traditionally for an independent, strong woman, and come in and do what you've done.

1391
02:01:50,989 --> 02:01:58,492
[SPEAKER_17]: I thank you because you give my daughter the understanding that you can reach for anything you want.

1392
02:01:59,513 --> 02:02:04,255
[SPEAKER_17]: And we haven't seen eye to eye to everything, but it was always out of respect.

1393
02:02:04,835 --> 02:02:09,157
[SPEAKER_17]: And what people don't understand is that it's for a reason.

1394
02:02:10,848 --> 02:02:12,790
[SPEAKER_17]: And Nicole Morell doesn't go home at night.

1395
02:02:12,810 --> 02:02:15,572
[SPEAKER_17]: They tell people, yeah, but Nicole definitely goes home at night.

1396
02:02:15,612 --> 02:02:16,733
[SPEAKER_17]: How can I destroy that?

1397
02:02:18,514 --> 02:02:20,115
[SPEAKER_17]: It became comical at times.

1398
02:02:20,556 --> 02:02:30,303
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think you've stood up and you have taken the leadership with honor, with grace, with distinction.

1399
02:02:30,703 --> 02:02:33,365
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm proud that I've served with you.

1400
02:02:34,591 --> 02:02:43,838
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that the most honorable thing in life, I think I've, in my life that I've ever seen, is watch my wife raise our two amazing kids.

1401
02:02:44,658 --> 02:02:53,085
[SPEAKER_17]: And tonight, it like kicked me like a mule watching you with your baby and understand the huge sacrifices.

1402
02:02:53,125 --> 02:02:59,609
[SPEAKER_17]: And I remember the nights that you'd have to run out of here for 20 minutes and run back and people didn't know why, but

1403
02:03:00,489 --> 02:03:01,309
[SPEAKER_17]: your mom first.

1404
02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:19,019
[SPEAKER_17]: And you taking this hiatus, I know that when everything moves forward like we expect and have a positive growth with your beautiful son, that you'll be back.

1405
02:03:19,479 --> 02:03:25,022
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that we appreciate the four years that you've given us, and I appreciate you

1406
02:03:27,529 --> 02:03:36,426
[SPEAKER_17]: being our leader and I think that I hope that we do see you around still and I'm sure that if you see me go the wrong way that

1407
02:03:38,281 --> 02:03:40,543
[SPEAKER_17]: One thing people don't realize, I don't think, is how tough you are.

1408
02:03:41,183 --> 02:03:43,365
[SPEAKER_17]: And George Scott Pell likes to speak.

1409
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:45,966
[SPEAKER_17]: People think I yell.

1410
02:03:46,807 --> 02:03:47,587
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm yelling at people.

1411
02:03:47,627 --> 02:03:48,508
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't yell at people.

1412
02:03:48,548 --> 02:03:50,089
[SPEAKER_17]: This is how I speak.

1413
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:50,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Ask my wife.

1414
02:03:50,789 --> 02:03:52,570
[SPEAKER_17]: I just talk loud.

1415
02:03:53,671 --> 02:03:55,793
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's great because you give it right back.

1416
02:03:56,193 --> 02:03:59,875
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was some things me and you would talk about right here, and you'd say, oh yeah?

1417
02:04:00,536 --> 02:04:01,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you forget two years ago?

1418
02:04:01,676 --> 02:04:02,877
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like, oh wow.

1419
02:04:03,277 --> 02:04:04,198
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like, ooh, ooh.

1420
02:04:05,501 --> 02:04:12,023
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's out of respect, and I appreciate that, because I think that's what this council is so great about.

1421
02:04:12,904 --> 02:04:20,886
[SPEAKER_17]: We've done some great things, and we've respected each other enough to agree to disagree, but not cross the line.

1422
02:04:21,847 --> 02:04:30,549
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I thank you, and I wish you much luck and happiness at home, and enjoying your beautiful son.

1423
02:04:32,543 --> 02:04:34,425
[SPEAKER_17]: and I'm sure we'll see you around, so I appreciate it.

1424
02:04:34,445 --> 02:04:34,905
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

1425
02:04:35,186 --> 02:04:35,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1426
02:04:37,688 --> 02:04:40,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Sen.

1427
02:04:40,731 --> 02:04:42,593
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to miss you so much, President Morell.

1428
02:04:42,613 --> 02:04:45,476
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to miss calling you my president.

1429
02:04:47,798 --> 02:04:48,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of love to you, Zach, too.

1430
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:52,180
[SPEAKER_05]: miss.

1431
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:54,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah I will miss her though.

1432
02:04:54,281 --> 02:04:55,481
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you know that.

1433
02:04:56,161 --> 02:04:58,042
[SPEAKER_15]: I think a lot's been said about your honor and grace.

1434
02:04:58,602 --> 02:05:05,264
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember when before I even thought about running for office when there was so much going on with the pandemic and with Black Lives Matter.

1435
02:05:05,705 --> 02:05:18,889
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember watching all those very contentious city council meetings and I didn't know you at the time but I was like huh this like Nicole Morell person gets where I'm coming from like what my experience growing up in Medford was and

1436
02:05:19,449 --> 02:05:32,694
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I think like it surprised me so much because it's just so rare for people like me to see your views being represented and your perspective being considered, especially by people who didn't come from the same background as me.

1437
02:05:33,355 --> 02:05:37,276
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was just, I think, so cool.

1438
02:05:37,597 --> 02:05:38,097
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think

1439
02:05:38,973 --> 02:05:51,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Beyond just honor and grace, for me, it was seeing you stay true to your convictions as well, even when the conversations were heated and difficult and when it would be easier to back out.

1440
02:05:51,983 --> 02:05:58,068
[SPEAKER_15]: As George has mentioned, you've always stayed in the fight and you've led with your convictions as well.

1441
02:05:58,248 --> 02:06:04,953
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think you've shown us that you can lead with your convictions and also build civility and unity and harmony here.

1442
02:06:05,333 --> 02:06:05,953
[SPEAKER_15]: behind the rail.

1443
02:06:06,094 --> 02:06:10,136
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, you know, it's not an easy job when I wouldn't want it.

1444
02:06:10,796 --> 02:06:15,720
[SPEAKER_15]: But and you've had to stand up here through some really difficult meetings.

1445
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:33,871
[SPEAKER_15]: But the grace, the kind of the poise that you've led with is something that I think people at home, especially girls and young mothers at home, really look at politics and see that you can do a good job even when it gets tough.

1446
02:06:35,315 --> 02:06:37,177
[SPEAKER_15]: and can really be inspired by.

1447
02:06:37,717 --> 02:06:55,176
[SPEAKER_15]: You also, I think, have laid out a path for our city and for progressives especially, that shows us that you can have a progressive vision that's tailored to our local needs and addressing what we need street by street.

1448
02:06:56,839 --> 02:07:02,330
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that kind of attitude has really been leading the city council in the last few years.

1449
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:08,202
[SPEAKER_15]: And Kit talked a lot about the achievements of this council from zoning to all the ordinances to

1450
02:07:08,578 --> 02:07:10,119
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of projects that were kickstarting.

1451
02:07:10,879 --> 02:07:19,643
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a testament to you that, to your leadership that, you know, we have been able to really pursue progressive change in a way that touches people personally.

1452
02:07:20,364 --> 02:07:33,890
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's furthermore, another testament upon you that candidates are running and I'm looking forward to carrying a lot of the ideas that you set in place in the first, in your four years here on City Council.

1453
02:07:34,609 --> 02:07:38,290
[SPEAKER_15]: I think beyond that, I'm going to miss just having a friend to look up to.

1454
02:07:39,251 --> 02:08:04,160
[SPEAKER_15]: um literally look up to um i think it it's always nice to talk to you when things get heated because i think i can i can trust you to have a rational viewpoint of things and i i can trust you to make a millennial joke that i don't 100% get and i can i can trust you that we'll have we'll banter around about millennial and gen z slang and

1455
02:08:04,687 --> 02:08:11,332
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's just like those funny moments that take you out of the heat and out of the seriousness and make all of us sing.

1456
02:08:11,953 --> 02:08:14,935
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know this will not be the end.

1457
02:08:14,995 --> 02:08:16,176
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you're gonna stay involved.

1458
02:08:16,276 --> 02:08:18,518
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking forward to the days when you're back here.

1459
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:26,725
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you're not back here in the council chambers, I'm looking forward to being at Jackson on vacation this May.

1460
02:08:26,825 --> 02:08:27,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1461
02:08:28,846 --> 02:08:29,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1462
02:08:31,144 --> 02:08:32,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I got something here?

1463
02:08:32,285 --> 02:08:32,885
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1464
02:08:33,245 --> 02:08:34,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any water in this thing?

1465
02:08:34,226 --> 02:08:37,868
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be long.

1466
02:08:41,490 --> 02:08:43,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, congratulations.

1467
02:08:44,412 --> 02:08:45,592
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a great run as well.

1468
02:08:46,913 --> 02:08:52,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe not as long as Councilor Caraviello and I, but that's because you chose to not make it that long.

1469
02:08:52,616 --> 02:08:55,638
[SPEAKER_10]: You could have served in the city council for as long as you felt like it.

1470
02:08:56,418 --> 02:08:59,080
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you guys know this,

1471
02:09:00,370 --> 02:09:02,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell might be a tad competitive.

1472
02:09:03,004 --> 02:09:03,768
[SPEAKER_10]: She doesn't show it.

1473
02:09:04,144 --> 02:09:07,527
[SPEAKER_10]: but she might be a tad competitive.

1474
02:09:08,107 --> 02:09:09,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Very tenacious on the campaign trail.

1475
02:09:10,670 --> 02:09:14,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I've talked to several of my neighbors and they said they voted for her just because she wouldn't get off her porch.

1476
02:09:14,773 --> 02:09:19,097
[SPEAKER_10]: She's going to have to vote for her because she keeps coming back and she won't get off her porch.

1477
02:09:20,938 --> 02:09:25,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And that strategy worked out very well for the council, as evident by her vote totals.

1478
02:09:26,763 --> 02:09:30,066
[SPEAKER_10]: And when she first got elected to the council after

1479
02:09:31,027 --> 02:09:33,308
[SPEAKER_10]: her first foray into public office.

1480
02:09:34,089 --> 02:09:39,051
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a nice discussion when she came up here and we invited her up as a councilor-elect to observe.

1481
02:09:39,451 --> 02:09:47,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said to Nicole, she had a very, very, very important decision that she had to make that's gonna shape her future here on the Medford City Council.

1482
02:09:48,556 --> 02:09:53,459
[SPEAKER_10]: This decision that she makes is probably gonna be the most important decision that she makes as a city council.

1483
02:09:54,419 --> 02:09:59,242
[SPEAKER_10]: And she had to choose where she wanted to sit, next to me or next to Councilor Marks.

1484
02:10:01,247 --> 02:10:13,314
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, subtlety is not one of her strong spots either.

1485
02:10:14,135 --> 02:10:18,657
[SPEAKER_10]: And I lost out on that one, Councilor Marks.

1486
02:10:19,438 --> 02:10:25,661
[SPEAKER_10]: And since that time, she tells me that your private whisper conversations with Councilor Bears aren't whispers at all.

1487
02:10:25,801 --> 02:10:27,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I can hear you all the way over here.

1488
02:10:31,129 --> 02:10:39,312
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, congratulations, Councilor Marks, you're responsible for helping shape and mold our president right now.

1489
02:10:40,052 --> 02:10:46,994
[SPEAKER_10]: But as I sit here and I see you there, and don't take this the wrong way, Councilor, but I feel as though your talents are wasted at the chair.

1490
02:10:48,415 --> 02:10:51,980
[SPEAKER_10]: You're an excellent city councilor, very capable on the council floor and a very formidable debater.

1491
02:10:53,321 --> 02:11:04,456
[SPEAKER_10]: I enjoyed the time where you'd step away from the chair and step down on the floor because you always brought forward well thought out arguments that were rooted in fact, not fiction.

1492
02:11:05,036 --> 02:11:07,498
[SPEAKER_10]: that was supported by Data Not Drama.

1493
02:11:08,739 --> 02:11:10,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And that helps move this body along.

1494
02:11:10,660 --> 02:11:17,765
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, thank you very much for your approach to the office and for the way that you handle yourself and tried to handle this body.

1495
02:11:18,846 --> 02:11:23,109
[SPEAKER_10]: It's impossible to hurt a bag of cats and you did the best you can with what you got here.

1496
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:30,354
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we've had some great, we've had some great meetings and we've had, we've had some, some very,

1497
02:11:30,914 --> 02:11:38,821
[SPEAKER_10]: very, what we could say, colorful meetings over the past four years, and you've handled yourself with great dignity and great respect.

1498
02:11:38,861 --> 02:11:51,872
[SPEAKER_10]: You've carried yourself in a fashion that's admirable, and you're certainly worthy to wield that gavel and worthy to carry the title counselor, and it's been an honor and a privilege to serve with you.

1499
02:11:51,933 --> 02:11:52,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1500
02:11:54,935 --> 02:11:55,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Former Councilor Marks.

1501
02:11:59,332 --> 02:12:00,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

1502
02:12:01,535 --> 02:12:02,757
[SPEAKER_12]: It was an honor and pleasure.

1503
02:12:02,797 --> 02:12:04,559
[SPEAKER_12]: We only served for one term together.

1504
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:13,571
[SPEAKER_12]: I can tell you the first six months that Nicole sat next to me, I don't think she said hi to me for six months.

1505
02:12:14,712 --> 02:12:19,156
[SPEAKER_12]: And I didn't know if it was me or she was new on the job and trying to feel her way around.

1506
02:12:19,936 --> 02:12:32,046
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think our very first debate was a difficult one because we were sitting next to each other and I may have taken some liberties at the time and you turned around and literally snapped at me.

1507
02:12:32,926 --> 02:12:38,150
[SPEAKER_12]: And like, after that, I think I was like walking on a tightrope the whole time.

1508
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:40,432
[SPEAKER_12]: I was, what's she going to do next?

1509
02:12:40,452 --> 02:12:43,715
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I was kind of in fear to be honest.

1510
02:12:45,575 --> 02:12:56,079
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that when you've gone on the council, your intentions were always to move the city forward.

1511
02:12:56,999 --> 02:13:02,901
[SPEAKER_12]: I also believe that you were even-handed, you were willing to listen, which I think goes a long way.

1512
02:13:03,241 --> 02:13:07,362
[SPEAKER_12]: We may not agree, but if you know someone's at least listening, that means a lot.

1513
02:13:08,122 --> 02:13:14,626
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, the one thing that I didn't agree with, it was the leaf blower ordinance.

1514
02:13:16,227 --> 02:13:20,730
[SPEAKER_12]: However, I think you've surpassed that with the school committee race.

1515
02:13:23,628 --> 02:13:24,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm keeping everyone engaged.

1516
02:13:26,810 --> 02:13:27,710
[SPEAKER_12]: At the very least.

1517
02:13:28,310 --> 02:13:31,091
[SPEAKER_12]: But I want to thank you for your years of service.

1518
02:13:31,151 --> 02:13:36,454
[SPEAKER_12]: It takes a lot to do what elected officials do in this community.

1519
02:13:37,154 --> 02:13:39,655
[SPEAKER_12]: I think people think, you know, it's an easy task.

1520
02:13:39,675 --> 02:13:48,779
[SPEAKER_12]: You come on a Tuesday night and attend some subcommittee meetings and they don't know the hours of reading, the hours of phone calls, the really

1521
02:13:50,179 --> 02:13:53,941
[SPEAKER_12]: that takes place to be an effective counselor.

1522
02:13:54,321 --> 02:14:01,644
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you've shown that over the last four years, and hopefully we're losing a lot of knowledge behind this reel.

1523
02:14:02,105 --> 02:14:05,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully some of that will be spread on with the existing members.

1524
02:14:05,986 --> 02:14:15,431
[SPEAKER_12]: But I want to thank you for your service, and hopefully you'll spend some more time with the family, which I think you'll find equally, if not more important.

1525
02:14:15,491 --> 02:14:16,231
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

1526
02:14:16,431 --> 02:14:16,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1527
02:14:17,211 --> 02:14:17,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam President.

1528
02:14:18,912 --> 02:14:25,061
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to add Councilor Mark's remarks to the record about how hard elected officials work and how much they deserve.

1529
02:14:27,744 --> 02:14:33,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, on that topic, can you tell us what you made when you were in the school?

1530
02:14:35,131 --> 02:14:35,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1531
02:14:36,052 --> 02:14:39,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate you coming up and saying some kind words and some true words.

1532
02:14:40,035 --> 02:14:47,700
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully now that we're both out of office, I won't get so nervous every time I see you either sitting there or approaching the podium.

1533
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:50,142
[SPEAKER_09]: So one last time, I appreciate it.

1534
02:14:51,323 --> 02:14:52,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank everyone for their kind words.

1535
02:14:54,679 --> 02:14:58,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I truly love this job and there are times that I think I'm not half bad at it.

1536
02:14:58,240 --> 02:15:02,762
[SPEAKER_09]: There are times I think I'm terrible at it and there are times I think I'm great, but they all even out in the end.

1537
02:15:02,922 --> 02:15:09,264
[SPEAKER_09]: So deciding not to run this year was one of the hardest decisions I've probably ever had to make.

1538
02:15:09,604 --> 02:15:11,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I think as comes through on the council is I usually

1539
02:15:12,526 --> 02:15:14,027
[SPEAKER_09]: know exactly how I feel about something.

1540
02:15:14,047 --> 02:15:15,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always listening, but I usually know how I feel.

1541
02:15:15,767 --> 02:15:16,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I know how I'm going to go.

1542
02:15:16,668 --> 02:15:24,291
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is something that I really wrestled with for months and probably, honestly, the better part of two years.

1543
02:15:24,631 --> 02:15:28,313
[SPEAKER_09]: But like everyone in these seats, I also have a full time job.

1544
02:15:29,082 --> 02:15:41,145
[SPEAKER_09]: and I have a favorite constituent who is just about two years old and who has shared his whole life with this council.

1545
02:15:42,125 --> 02:15:52,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm stepping away to spend more time with him in those early precious years, which I know you all know, but I think, again, without the lack of paper and all these things, sometimes that's information that hasn't been shared.

1546
02:15:53,669 --> 02:15:54,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I care about this job.

1547
02:15:54,889 --> 02:15:55,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this job.

1548
02:15:56,610 --> 02:15:57,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I care about my son.

1549
02:15:57,290 --> 02:15:57,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I love my son.

1550
02:15:57,850 --> 02:15:58,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to spend some time with him.

1551
02:15:58,931 --> 02:16:06,013
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's a saying in parenting that the days are long, but the years are short, which I know all the parents here will agree with.

1552
02:16:06,694 --> 02:16:12,556
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I'd like to extend that to city council where the meetings are long, but the years are short.

1553
02:16:14,436 --> 02:16:15,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe it's been four years.

1554
02:16:15,557 --> 02:16:17,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe it's only been four years.

1555
02:16:17,637 --> 02:16:21,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe it's been a long four years and it's been a short four years.

1556
02:16:22,599 --> 02:16:34,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I think starting this whole journey just before the pandemic I know we all have that feeling of time kind of collapsing in on itself and it feels like so long ago I started in this body, but it's only been just a few years.

1557
02:16:36,385 --> 02:16:38,946
[SPEAKER_09]: We did a lot of great work as a council.

1558
02:16:39,146 --> 02:16:42,087
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of great work left to be done, a lot of work left to be done.

1559
02:16:42,127 --> 02:16:47,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to go through everything we worked on because this isn't a campaign speech, but there's a lot that I'm proud of.

1560
02:16:48,730 --> 02:16:50,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to note that

1561
02:16:51,411 --> 02:16:53,693
[SPEAKER_09]: We often say that it's a privilege to do this job.

1562
02:16:54,513 --> 02:16:56,255
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a privilege to represent your peers.

1563
02:16:56,295 --> 02:16:57,656
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a privilege to serve the public.

1564
02:16:57,976 --> 02:17:13,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And beyond that, it's also an extreme privilege to have the opportunity to meet and strike up conversations with and friendships with people that simply wouldn't happen if you didn't have the access and the welcome that this role gives you.

1565
02:17:14,221 --> 02:17:25,957
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think every person that I've spoken with for that, whether we agreed or not, the ability to sit down with someone or pick up a phone call and have a conversation with something has been a privilege and really a gift.

1566
02:17:26,518 --> 02:17:29,502
[SPEAKER_09]: And another gift, which, you know, there are nights

1567
02:17:30,819 --> 02:17:34,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's all of you behind the rails.

1568
02:17:35,926 --> 02:17:45,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's something going on in this body since, you know, I think the past two years in particular that there's a camaraderie and a respect that I think we all know is

1569
02:17:46,161 --> 02:17:55,849
[SPEAKER_09]: quickly or has already left much of politics, but I think it's still alive and well behind the rail where, as has been said, we all don't agree a lot of times.

1570
02:17:56,009 --> 02:18:00,433
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets heated sometimes, but I think at the end of the day we know there's a deep respect.

1571
02:18:01,194 --> 02:18:05,917
[SPEAKER_09]: There's usually, you know, after some of our, even during some of our most challenging meetings,

1572
02:18:06,698 --> 02:18:15,864
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a time where we can have a few jokes and let out some of that tension and remember that we all respect each other and no one here holds a grudge.

1573
02:18:16,865 --> 02:18:19,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say very briefly about people going around the room.

1574
02:18:19,326 --> 02:18:30,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I've already said my nice things about Rick and Adam, but Justin, it's been a pleasure to serve with you and just to have your cerebral and considerate approach to everything and also have a resident Harvard man.

1575
02:18:32,535 --> 02:18:35,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Kit, you are the epitome of speak softly and carry a big stick.

1576
02:18:35,677 --> 02:18:40,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think everyone learned that one or two budgets ago.

1577
02:18:40,079 --> 02:18:51,744
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just been so good for my soul to have another woman on the council that I can kind of just look at sometimes or catch a smile from in those heavy meetings.

1578
02:18:53,203 --> 02:18:57,908
[SPEAKER_09]: George, I think it may have taken us a longer path than some to get to that place of friendship, but we got there.

1579
02:18:58,488 --> 02:18:59,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And I truly respect you.

1580
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:08,158
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just, we've been able to have some conversations this term in particular, just to say, Hey, you know, I don't agree with you on this, but I want you to know it's no hard feelings.

1581
02:19:08,198 --> 02:19:10,781
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know you're doing what you think you believe is right.

1582
02:19:11,282 --> 02:19:14,225
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's a, it's a two way street and I really respect you.

1583
02:19:15,025 --> 02:19:27,174
[SPEAKER_09]: And vice president Bears, when I was first running and working really hard, someone pulled papers on the very last day and I thought, who is this Zach Bears?

1584
02:19:28,035 --> 02:19:29,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is he trying to ruin me?

1585
02:19:33,038 --> 02:19:58,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And the answer over to that, who is this Zach Bears, is he's a friend, he's a confidant, he's someone who, when I had a one week old, a one month old, a one year old, allowed me to be in this position as president, who helped me with some of the logistics and all those things that go on behind the scene and allowed me to serve and fulfill this role and chair the body as I was home with a little tiny newborn for those first eight weeks.

1586
02:20:02,108 --> 02:20:03,350
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a demanding job.

1587
02:20:03,430 --> 02:20:04,491
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fulfilling job.

1588
02:20:04,511 --> 02:20:11,960
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so important and I'm so thankful to the residents who put me into this position, giving me the opportunity to do this.

1589
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:16,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you remember me if I decide to come back and

1590
02:20:17,588 --> 02:20:20,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to make Rick's mistake, but I thank my family who allowed me to be here.

1591
02:20:20,470 --> 02:20:25,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the, I knew I would have the logistical support to be here.

1592
02:20:25,293 --> 02:20:26,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank my husband for that.

1593
02:20:27,335 --> 02:20:35,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but emotionally it's really hard and everyone makes that sacrifice, you know, Tuesday, Wednesday, all the nights, all the mornings, all the phone calls.

1594
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:41,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and right now I want to spend that time with my son, but I do want to say farewell and thank you.

1595
02:20:41,444 --> 02:20:46,647
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not sure what my next move is, but for better or worse, I can assure you, you are not rid of me yet.

1596
02:20:48,275 --> 02:20:48,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank you all.

1597
02:21:22,728 --> 02:21:24,189
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on?

1598
02:21:24,249 --> 02:21:25,570
[SPEAKER_07]: One on the way in, one on the way out.

1599
02:21:25,650 --> 02:21:28,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1600
02:21:28,171 --> 02:21:38,137
[SPEAKER_07]: He's doing the thing where he says stuff, but you can't understand what he's saying.

1601
02:21:53,871 --> 02:22:09,641
Thank you very much.

1602
02:22:27,834 --> 02:22:28,316
I'm kidding.

1603
02:22:40,401 --> 02:22:44,244
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, it was Zach's fault.

1604
02:22:44,344 --> 02:22:45,185
[SPEAKER_09]: He said it was gonna be short.

1605
02:22:45,646 --> 02:22:46,166
