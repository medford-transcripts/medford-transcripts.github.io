1
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:47,139
I think we're still waiting for Member McStone and Member McLaughlin.

2
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,727
So we can just give them another minute or two.

3
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:35,203
Member McLaughlin said she'll be right on.

4
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:35,644
Okay.

5
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,705
I'm going to go ahead and start reading our meeting notice so that we can get that out of the way.

6
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:39,539

12
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,059
Um, member.

13
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,860
So you call the roll.

14
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,380
I sure will.

15
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:42,921
Never Graham here.

16
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:45,842
Number of days here.

17
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:48,603
Democrats here.

18
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:52,284
Remember Crawford here.

19
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:10,074
Do we want to give Member McStone another minute or should we get started?

20
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:16,216
Member McStone let folks know that she was going to be running behind tonight because she was at the high school.

21
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:18,577
So she will be checking in later.

22
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:19,237
Thank you.

23
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:20,117
Okay.

24
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:21,538
So why don't we go ahead and get started?

25
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:26,680
I am going to turn it over to the Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, David Murphy.

26
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,681
Thank you, Member Graham.

27
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,381
Good evening, everyone.

28
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:32,922
This is our fourth

29
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:52,140
formal presentation of the developing FY23 Medford Public Schools operating budget for the committee and for members of the community that have been following along over the last four gatherings of the school committee in public session, four of the last five public sessions, I should say.

30
00:04:53,041 --> 00:05:02,905
We have been articulating the, in response to the feedback that we received from all members of the school administration, as well as members of the school committee,

31
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:06,817
the funding priorities for fiscal year 23.

32
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:26,863
And so in the last couple of times that we've met to discuss the budget, I've sort of tried to move quickly through some of the process elements as this, I imagine may well constitute the culmination of one phase of our budgeting process.

33
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:31,765
I'm going to go through those process points a little more methodically tonight,

34
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:45,229
We'll also try to move as efficiently as possible so that we can get to the decision making that it's my understanding and hope that the committee is positioned to make tonight.

35
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:52,111
And with respect to exactly what those decisions are and what the objectives of tonight's meeting, I'll try to cover those up front.

36
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,411
I'm going to share my screen.

37
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:55,892
I did want to also say that

38
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:03,442
As is always the case this time of year in a school district, there are lots of events and lots of things that are taking place.

39
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:11,266
And so members of our team are sort of scattered tonight throughout various district community and school events.

40
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:22,731
And so there may be times if I'm bouncing questions off of other team members that people would just need a second to get in a place where they can contribute.

41
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:25,613
So we as a team appreciate the committee's

42
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,503
indulgence in that respect.

43
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:33,548
Okay, so tonight, we're going to go over the budget process and next steps.

44
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:43,415
We're going to review our category system as everyone knows, throughout this we've had six budget categories that are not necessarily in a hierarchical order.

45
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:54,664
But they, there's some overlap with and what the categories are really designed to do are help us to think through the strategic implications of the use of operating funds versus our

46
00:06:56,018 --> 00:07:04,801
one-time grant-related funding that is available specifically to the school district, which we refer to as our ESSER funding priorities.

47
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:24,528
And then if the committee is prepared to, we would recommend that a vote be taken so that we can begin to actually construct the proposed budget, which will then be sent to the municipal government by way of the school committee's requests for FY23 operating funds.

48
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:30,836
Much of this presentation, a lot of these slides are repetitive.

49
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:37,298
And so for time purposes, I will try to, again, move as quickly as I can through them.

50
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:42,940
But I do want to call attention to the second and third bullet points on this slide.

51
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:52,263
Again, for people that have been watching each meeting, you've heard me say this before, but I don't think it can be stressed enough that one, when you are

52
00:07:53,078 --> 00:08:03,021
then the vast majority of the operating budget is for personnel expenses and the vast majority of the personnel are in collective bargaining units that have open CBAs.

53
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:08,003
That results in a lot of budgetary uncertainty.

54
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:21,928
And so everything we're doing, we have to keep in mind that variable with regard to where the contracts will ultimately settle and that will have an impact on our budgetary flexibility.

55
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:33,056
The third bullet, and again, I think there were some great questions from members of the committee in earlier meetings as to sort of the underlying objectives of each of this process.

56
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:47,463
And I think the sort of two pillars are one, to be as transparent as possible so that the Medford community understands how our budgetary priorities are tied to our strategic planning and our strategic thinking around how to move the district forward.

57
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:51,565
And at the same time, we wanna make sure that as we develop these priorities,

58
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:56,801
we're driving toward as coherent a budget as possible.

59
00:08:57,381 --> 00:09:06,567
There isn't anything that I think anyway that we've discussed over the course of these last four meetings that in a vacuum is not or at least does not sound like a good idea.

60
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:18,175
And certainly I can tell you as each of the priorities that we've discussed from the various stakeholders who have contributed to this dialogue to a

61
00:09:20,152 --> 00:09:22,253
to a priority are meant to help students.

62
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:46,103
And if there was a priority that was discussed at some point in our internal deliberations as an administration, if there wasn't a nexus between the priority and the potential impact it could have on student outcomes and student wellbeing, you as a committee and as a Medford community, I'd like to think we'll not hear about it, at least from us.

63
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:49,645
But that means that our job though at this point

64
00:09:50,337 --> 00:10:04,360
is collecting those priorities together and making sure that we are, that they are complimentary to one another so that we can put together a coherent budget that advances our strategic goals and serve students well.

65
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:15,822
So again, with regard to process, this is sort of the step-by-step process that in the slide that you've seen several times, particularly over the last, at least for the last two years,

66
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:31,542
And I do think sometimes there's some confusion and I think it's been, there's been some healthy discussion about this piece of it on this committee and in this forum, which is that what exactly is the role of the school committee?

67
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:38,627
Because oftentimes we talk about the three pillars of establishing policy, appointing a superintendent and approving a budget.

68
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:45,473
And those pillars to some degree predate some of the more

69
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,112
modern school governance laws in Massachusetts.

70
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:57,134
And it's not the case that the school committee can determine what the revenue is or what the overall funding picture looks like.

71
00:10:57,214 --> 00:11:04,295
That's authority that rests within the municipal government and the school committee's responsibility is multifaceted.

72
00:11:04,635 --> 00:11:08,516
And it includes both advocating for the priorities and the needs of the district.

73
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:15,077
And then ultimately adopting a budget that addresses those priorities and moves it forward based on the appropriation

74
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:17,149
that is made from the municipal government.

75
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:44,267
And you've heard me say several times that as a school administration, we have a dual responsibility, both to help flesh out those priorities and to make sure that the committee is fully informed as to how those priorities affect the operations of the school district, and also to be planning for any potential contingency so that we're able to operate the school district and move our strategic objectives forward based on whatever appropriation is there.

76
00:11:44,889 --> 00:12:03,844
But I think as many school districts learn, if we don't have a clear articulation of those priorities and the impact that those priorities can have, it would be unreasonable for a school department or a school committee to expect that appropriation to be consistent with the work that needs to be done.

77
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:14,072
And so I think that's a big part of these forums and the public discussions we've had, and you've been able to hear from the administration and various members of the administration as to

78
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:28,127
both the positive impact some of these funding priorities can have, and also how some pieces make more sense at certain times or within a certain sequence, and how things can complement one another.

79
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:41,170
And then, as you know, there are some things, and particularly this is true for some of the priorities listed in category E, that, as I said before, in a vacuum would be very good and might be very good regardless.

80
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:48,046
but might not fit into our current picture based on the anticipated capacity that we have.

81
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:52,129
So that's where we are with regard to process.

82
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:58,014
I imagine that could come up at some point during our discussion tonight and be happy to discuss that in greater detail at that time.

83
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:10,845
This is their school funding 101 slide that as again, people that have followed along know, we're a largely local contribution funded school district.

84
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:18,489
Um, that means that 80%, approximately 80% of our operating budget comes from the taxpayers of the city of Medford.

85
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:25,874
Um, and about 20% or so comes from the taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts across all the cities and towns in the state.

86
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:29,417
And, uh, that we refer to as our chapter 70 funding.

87
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:35,261
And then there is our external funding, um, that comes in the way of, uh, grant funding.

88
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:39,284
Now, uh, we have more grant funding now than I imagine we've ever had.

89
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:40,505
Uh, that that's true for most.

90
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,331
school districts in light of the pandemic.

91
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,632
But much of that grant funding is one-time funding.

92
00:13:47,652 --> 00:14:02,997
And that's when we get into some of the strategic thought processes that we need to engage in with regards to not committing or trying to avoid as best as possible, avoiding the commitment of one-time funds to recurring expenses.

93
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,519
So on May 2nd,

94
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:17,072
We discussed as part of our budgeting process where we are with respect to our collective bargaining negotiations.

95
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:37,160
Our current budget is approximately $55 million out of 67.4 is devoted to personnel expenses and the vast, vast majority of our employees are part of our 10 bargaining units, nine of which have open CBAs and most of which we are currently in negotiations with.

96
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,741
The only exceptions to that are

97
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,861
units represented by other bargaining agents that we are at the table with.

98
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:57,683
And it would be my expectation that when those negotiations reach an endpoint, we'll be finishing the negotiation, or we will begin and hopefully in short order negotiate successor agreements to the remaining units.

99
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:07,325
We've said that one of our priorities, both from a budgeting perspective and from a collective bargaining perspective, is to maintain wage increases that are

100
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,951
are both competitive and sustainable.

101
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:18,196
That means we want them to be competitive enough where it's a place that we can recruit and retain the top teaching and educator talent in the state.

102
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:37,408
And at the same time, it has to be sustainable because we can't commit resources that are too speculative and then have a situation in which we have a structural financial deficit that will inevitably have a disproportionate impact on our high need and most vulnerable

103
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,910
student populations.

104
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:47,693
And that really has to be a guiding pillar, both in our discussions in this forum, as well as at the bargaining table.

105
00:15:48,834 --> 00:16:05,140
The nature of school districts is that they are structured in a way that if we do not maintain sound fiscal stewardship, it will result in the staff positions that exist to help students who need the most support.

106
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:09,885
those positions won't exist if we don't have that structural deficit.

107
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:12,887
There are certain positions that we know we're always going to have as a school district.

108
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:24,575
We're going to have classroom teachers, we're going to have principals, we're going to have some administrator roles that are necessities, and some of them are legal necessities, others are practical necessities.

109
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:31,520
And so while there are always choices that a city and a school district can make, those choices are not unlimited.

110
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,162
And that is why, well,

111
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:52,449
most of us would prefer to focus our attention on establishing competitive wage increases so that we can make sure that students at Medford have the most talented and the most diverse staff that we can possibly put in front of them.

112
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:04,977
At the same time, if we don't pay appropriate respect to the sustainability priority, we will end up in a situation in which our staffing structure

113
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,472
is not commensurate with the needs of our students.

114
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:14,037
And that is why that is a drum that you'll hear us continue to beat in this and other forums.

115
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:32,072
And it's why that while most of us who work in education would like from a societal perspective education to be prioritized in a way where there aren't as many boundaries as we may find time to time, we have a responsibility to

116
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,583
operate within the realm of reality and that will be the case going forward.

117
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:56,470
So I said that our budgeting priorities have been cultivated over the course of the last several months and these are slides that again you've seen before but generally they fit into certain buckets around the critical priorities that we know are most urgent as a result of

118
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:03,029
with how and where our students are currently situated coming out of the pandemic, hopefully coming completely out of the pandemic.

119
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:11,514
There are personnel needs that we've talked about and the varying degrees of priority, but our budget is mostly personnel.

120
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:19,178
And so when we talk about any budget, whether it's regardless of the nature of the funding, right, personnel is always gonna be a large component of it.

121
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:23,261
Here's some other priorities, technology again,

122
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,960
always going to be a cornerstone.

123
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:43,845
Our professional learning is something that is emphasized within our strategic plan and keeping equity and student support at the center of all our decision making has been a guiding pillar throughout the superintendent's strategic planning process, as well as this process that we've engaged in over the last several weeks.

124
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:53,767
Okay, so from fixed cost perspective, this is something that, again, for those that have watched every

125
00:18:54,189 --> 00:19:06,498
The ins and outs of every meeting, it's a little dry, it might get a little boring, but it's important to note that we're coming out of FY22 with a $67.4 million operating budget.

126
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:18,367
It is the case, as it is always every year, that there are pre-existing obligations that we have or unavoidable realities that exist that result in

127
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:21,495
what we generally refer to as our fixed cost increases.

128
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:42,265
So these are the increases that even if there was no strategic thinking and no strategic decision making, these elements of our budget are going up in cost, meaning to maintain just a level services operation within the Medford Public Schools, there would be approximately $2.6 million increase to the budget.

129
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:47,488
That includes as the sort of the headline number, the biggest number there, the $1.3 million

130
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:56,488
that is represented in salary increases that are owed in FY22 as a result of existing contractual obligations.

131
00:19:56,568 --> 00:20:05,649
So that is separate and aside from anything that is done at the bargaining table and potential cost of living adjustments that we've said are a priority for us going into FY23.

132
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,710
But that $1.3 million is just the natural growth.

133
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:16,892
When I say natural growth, it is the steps, lanes, and other contractual obligations that will hit the budget in FY23.

134
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:27,151
The highlighted numbers there, the subscription and contractual renewal piece, the special education fixed cost increase, and the math curriculum piece.

135
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:34,034
Those are numbers that, as I've mentioned before, there is, to some degree, this is true for any of these numbers.

136
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:41,518
All of these numbers, and this is true for every single number in your presentation, there could be some fluidity between now and as the budget is implemented.

137
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:45,600
These three numbers are the ones that we're looking most closely at right now.

138
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:49,885
to see if there is any way of essentially reducing those costs.

139
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:55,288
There's no strategic thinking at the moment behind these costs.

140
00:20:55,308 --> 00:21:00,049
These are costs that have already been adopted previously within the school district.

141
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:14,615
And so by restraining these costs and reducing them where possible, it gives us the potential for having greater flexibility and hopefully provides the municipal government greater flexibility as well.

142
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:21,394
Right now we would still estimate that to be 2.6 but there is the prospect for those to be reduced as time goes on.

143
00:21:24,855 --> 00:21:37,839
Again, that slide you've seen before this is just the various structures of the budget that sort of specific piece that is different in FY 20, it has been different the last couple of fiscal years will be different for the next few fiscal years then.

144
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:49,312
the way the operating budgets have run in school districts previously is we continue to have a significant injection of federal funding in response to the pandemic.

145
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:54,216
So a lot of times there's confusion between the ARPA funding and the ESSER funding.

146
00:21:54,676 --> 00:22:07,326
ARPA funding, first of all, there's a significant amount of regulatory distinction between the two, but the ARPA funding of which our budget was funded through, a significant portion was funded through last year,

147
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:18,469
That is the municipal government's COVID funds, essentially, coming from the federal government, with, again, significant restrictions and criteria around how that money can be appropriated.

148
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:29,176
The ESSER funding is funding that is allocated through the Department of Education, of Elementary and Secondary Education at the state level here in Massachusetts.

149
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:34,439
And so we anticipate that our ESSER funding expenditures for FY22

150
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,372
will be in the vicinity of a million to $1.4 million.

151
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:46,034
You've heard multiple presentations as to some of the initiatives that we've been able to undertake as a result of that funding.

152
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:52,157
That leaves us with approximately $6.2 million over the next three fiscal years.

153
00:22:52,778 --> 00:23:00,441
And so, again, we've talked a lot about this, but in thinking about the ESSER funding, there's sort of a few elements that we should think about.

154
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,123
One, first and foremost, understanding that it's one-time funding.

155
00:23:04,597 --> 00:23:16,763
And so to the extent that we can avoid the creation of fiscal cliffs by using that funding toward either one time or temporary or fleeting expenses, that would be considered more prudent.

156
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:33,651
At the same time, the most important criteria is that there is a nexus between this funding and the financial resources that are available and our efforts to combat and come out of the pandemic and to minimize the educational disruption that our students have experienced.

157
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:43,790
And so as a result of that nexus, sometimes the things that we need to help our students recover from the pandemic are the most urgent priorities that we have.

158
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:55,499
And that does at times mean that we need to essentially suspend the guiding principle that I just referenced a moment ago around trying to avoid committing one-time funds to recurring expenses.

159
00:23:55,979 --> 00:24:01,043
And you saw some of that last year in our FY22 budget, and that'll be true in the FY23 budget as well.

160
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:30,673
And I think the way to think about that is if we're going to put it toward things like personnel expenses, which as you know, in category B, that's our recommendation in part, we should be putting them toward personnel expenses that either we will, that the need will dissipate to some degree as we get further away from the pandemic, or towards something in which

161
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:38,691
we use the next couple of years to determine the extent to which it is a priority to absorb those priorities in our operating budget.

162
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:54,494
And particularly with the ARPA funding, the rationale is hopefully you see the revenue landscape, at least as it was projected in FY22, improves to the point where there's the capacity to do that.

163
00:24:55,894 --> 00:25:00,375
At a state level, there's encouraging news about that at the moment,

164
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:07,842
but with respect to revenues, and that's where you see the $1.6 million increase in Chapter 70 funding.

165
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:18,870
I've mentioned before the sort of double-edged sword that we get into with that because our budget, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, is only 20% Chapter 70 funding, approximately 20%.

166
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:25,575
And so there's only a proportional impact that is felt there, at least with regard to the state level.

167
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:27,676
And then obviously the economic forecasts

168
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:45,863
you know, we're not here to do economic forecasting, but for those of you that follow economic forecasting, it's not a particularly, there are not a lot of positive forecasts currently to be found with regards to the potential for a recession and the possibility of the erosion of revenue.

169
00:25:45,923 --> 00:25:55,109
So all of that is to say that these are the various components of our budget, some of which are specific to this COVID or hopefully soon to be post-COVID context.

170
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,762
OK, so this slide is sort of just meant to indicate how the budget grows.

171
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:05,924
As I said, we start at $67.4 million.

172
00:26:06,624 --> 00:26:10,347
If you factor in the fixed cost increases, you get to approximately $70 million.

173
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:20,093
And then to address the priority around sustainable but competitive wage increases, that is estimated to be approximately $1.1 million.

174
00:26:20,473 --> 00:26:24,175
And so that's how we get to the $71.1 million figure.

175
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:33,632
prior to addressing any of the strategic priorities that we'll discuss tonight in those categories.

176
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:49,703
I've already mentioned that the hope is that we're still able to restrain to some degree the fixed cost increases that could give us some flexibility and or allow us to address priorities in the event of a Delta between what the school committee requests and what the municipal government can appropriate.

177
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:55,247
And as I've said, as a school administration, we know that we have a dual responsibility both to articulate the priorities

178
00:26:55,727 --> 00:27:00,889
and to prepare for any eventuality to make sure that we implement the operating budget in a way that serves students well.

179
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,571
This is how we're currently organized.

180
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:13,994
All of these boxes represent personnel, and as I said, we, like every school district, are primarily a personnel-driven organization.

181
00:27:16,147 --> 00:27:17,448
So we get to our categories now.

182
00:27:17,948 --> 00:27:23,090
This is A through F. It's not a strict hierarchy from a priority perspective, but there's overlap.

183
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,572
And again, strategic considerations to the operating budget versus the use of ESSER funding.

184
00:27:30,113 --> 00:27:31,593
This spells out a few priorities.

185
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:36,755
And as we get to the end of the slides here, it'll spell it out in greater clarity.

186
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:43,098
But essentially, these are the sort of the total numbers that we would be looking at depending on

187
00:27:44,073 --> 00:27:46,275
which of the categories are pursued.

188
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:50,917
They don't go in ascending order here as you look left to right.

189
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:59,482
So in retrospect, that could have been a little clearer, but there's a slide that says this exact same information at the end, but in a more clear fashion.

190
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:03,384
So if you can hang tight for a minute, we'll get to that part.

191
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:12,670
Again, our priorities here, category A are things that, from the school administration's perspective, are things that we have to do and we're prepared to do.

192
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:15,558
but the most appropriate funding source is the operating budget.

193
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:30,487
Category B are things that we also feel that we need to do, but because of the nature of the priority that would be pursuing, we would consider it to be ESSER appropriate in the event of the appropriation is not sufficient to absorb those priorities.

194
00:28:31,228 --> 00:28:41,834
Category C are things that we would strongly recommend stay within ESSER, and it would sort of, essentially, it would be a waste of the ESSER funds to not use toward those priorities in category C.

195
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:52,781
Category D, very similar to category A, but the piece that doesn't apply there is what I said about it being hierarchical in a sense.

196
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:57,303
The A and D are hierarchical in that A is considered the highest priorities.

197
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:02,985
I would imagine, well, I know we've discussed this a lot over the last several weeks.

198
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:12,208
In the event that we wanna discuss category D tonight in terms of what will ultimately make it into the request, and again, based on this sequence,

199
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:24,589
once an appropriation is made or a recommended appropriation is identified, we're gonna have more time to sift through those and sort of make sure that we are putting together the most coherent budgetary picture possible.

200
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:32,173
But just for purposes of tonight, I have divided category D up into D1, D2, and D3.

201
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:36,776
And when we get to the category D, I'll explain a little bit how some of that works.

202
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:39,177
It's not necessarily just one is more important than the other.

203
00:29:39,675 --> 00:30:05,709
but some of the pieces, as you know, if you've looked through and read through the category D priorities, are priorities that some of them are one-time expenses that we may be able to think about using one-time funds for, and others are just recurring expenses that if the needs of the district were different, or if the budgetary priorities were gonna fit in connection with one another differently, it would likely be that we would, that they could be moved into category A.

204
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:35,442
but sometimes it's because of, for compliance purposes, sometimes because of the more urgent needs of students, whatever the case may be, that oftentimes is what will determine the categorization between a D and A. Category E are things that we've, this sort of speaks to the transparency piece that we want to be really open with the community about the things that we think the district needs, but they're not necessarily the things that we would recommend are included in this budget, either at this stage or at a later stage.

205
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:45,945
That can change, and some things like this will change throughout the course of the fiscal year, but right now they wouldn't be at the top of the administration's recommendations.

206
00:30:46,485 --> 00:31:02,918
In category F, there's only one item, one that we've discussed a couple of times, and that we're in the process of preparing for further discussion with regard to trying to eliminate the burden of fee-based services, in this case, specifically school lunch and meals.

207
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,252
These are the numbers, if we just take those priorities that are in those categories.

208
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:21,659
Again, you'll see some fluctuation from the last time sometimes that there have been times and there's a personnel position that was identified late in the process that push the category D number up a bit.

209
00:31:22,452 --> 00:31:25,934
It's not something that would go into category A and I'll just use this as an example right now.

210
00:31:26,614 --> 00:31:31,877
So there's, there's a position and we think there's a need and we think that kids would be well served.

211
00:31:32,817 --> 00:31:35,759
But we also know that one way or another, there's going to be a limited capacity.

212
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:48,605
And so, while it's, we will reference it tonight, we are actively exploring different staffing configurations that could eliminate the need for the newly funded position and again,

213
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:52,513
That is just part of the fluidity of a $67 to $70 million budget.

214
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:57,015
And it's just part of the work that we do day in and day out to manage the district.

215
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:02,697
So again, we'll get back to this slide toward the end.

216
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:13,920
But these are the overall numbers, depending on which of the categories the committee were to adopt in its request, assuming you want to vote this evening.

217
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:18,282
And so just so everyone understands what would happen next in terms of the process,

218
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:34,896
If once you've identified for the administration that you'd like to pursue one of these options or potentially a combination thereof, we will then go back and we will actually compile the sort of the concrete part of this, which is frequently referred to as the budget book.

219
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:46,663
We've discussed previously that the budget book when you've got nine open CBAs has, I think, a slightly different degree of value with respect to accuracy if we were to publish it right now.

220
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:53,631
it would essentially list out your FY 21 salaries for most positions because those those contracts are open, but at the same time.

221
00:32:54,352 --> 00:33:06,304
To make sure that you understand how the various pieces pieces fit together in leading up to some of the sizable numbers that you see here that's what that's the direction that we would go subsequent to this presumably subsequent to this meeting.

222
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:08,759
I did see a hand there, Ms.

223
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:08,919
Graham.

224
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:12,860
I don't know if you want me to pause for a second or if you want me to keep moving and then take questions at the end.

225
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:17,963
I'm guessing we've got 10 minutes left, but I'd be more than happy to take a breath if you'd like.

226
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:22,404
Member Russo, do you want to ask a question now or do you want to hold your question?

227
00:33:23,145 --> 00:33:24,685
My question was how many more slides?

228
00:33:24,705 --> 00:33:29,788
10 more minutes sounds like I can wait.

229
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:34,490
Very few new slides, but just because it's been a few days since we've looked at all this,

230
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:41,233
I just want to run through to make sure everybody remembers what's A, what's B, what's C, and so on and so forth.

231
00:33:41,993 --> 00:33:42,174
Great.

232
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:44,795
I do also want to make a motion, but I will wait until you get to the end.

233
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:45,476
Sure.

234
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:51,799
So keep going.

235
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,622
OK, so this is category A. Again, this lists out the priorities as they're in there.

236
00:33:57,142 --> 00:34:04,227
I don't know how the Curtis Tufts nurse position didn't make it into this slide the first time.

237
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:06,889
but in my draft, it didn't.

238
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:17,377
So the total amount was correct in the last one, but the getting up to a 1.0 nurse at the Curtis Tufts would be considered category A at this time.

239
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:26,804
Category B, again, this is stuff that it would be great to have in the operating budget, but we're prepared to use the ESSER funding and think the ESSER funding is appropriate.

240
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:34,169
Category C, again, these are not so much personnel items and corresponding,

241
00:34:35,062 --> 00:34:36,783
monetary impact is lower, obviously.

242
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:43,425
These are things that we would strongly recommend be charged to the ESSER budget going into FY23.

243
00:34:46,026 --> 00:34:54,309
And I should say, if you remember last year, we did the full operating budget, and then at the end in June, we presented you with the ESSER priorities.

244
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:01,452
Although we knew all along there would be, we knew that there were some items that we were discussing that were going to land in the ESSER budget.

245
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:03,873
Slight difference this year,

246
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,482
we've gained more familiarity with the ESSER criteria, with the eligibility.

247
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:12,745
There's not money coming in the door, new money coming in the door every few weeks as there was last year.

248
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:14,747
And so we have these now.

249
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:25,453
They don't need and shouldn't necessarily be part of your requests to the municipal government because the ESSER funding is the school committee's COVID-related funding to spend.

250
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:30,516
Some of this is a continuation of programming we had last year.

251
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:39,821
last year we projected to spend $2 million and we ended up spending close, we'll end up spending around approximately $1.4 we think, maybe even a little bit less.

252
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:54,664
Part of that is because, while it's not the case that there's a significant amount of new money coming in the door every few weeks, as was the case at the heart of the pandemic, there have been a lot of grant funding opportunities that have been made available through DESE and other funding sources.

253
00:35:55,164 --> 00:35:57,225
And so sometimes with the ESSER

254
00:35:57,919 --> 00:36:03,763
rolling over year to year until FY 25, we've availed ourselves of that other grant funding when that's been more time sensitive.

255
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:13,910
So that's part of why we came under budget on ESSER this year and why, frankly, we would probably hope and expect it to be so next year as well.

256
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:25,257
This is category D. I think I've explained this already, but with regard to categories D1, D2, and D3, some of it, I'm going to try to move through these to get to the end here.

257
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:31,250
Category D, in part from the committee's feedback, the number grew somewhat significantly.

258
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:48,086
That's an $850,000 package right now with everything in category D. We understand that I'm not going to go through the whole sort of song and dance about having to plan for every contingency, but from a strategic perspective,

259
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:53,359
The school administration does not want the school committee asking for things that we're not ready to implement.

260
00:36:53,739 --> 00:37:04,043
And we have a responsibility to understand that we're one component of the municipal government and that there are going to be competing priorities that need to be addressed by the municipal government.

261
00:37:04,343 --> 00:37:07,064
And so what we're trying to do here is explain that.

262
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:13,666
One, within the broad category of D, there are some things that for various reasons would be of a higher priority.

263
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:18,008
But the other piece of this is that there are some priorities within here

264
00:37:18,523 --> 00:37:29,329
That it may be possible that we're able to find other funding sources for and so therefore we're able to advance those priorities without availing ourselves of the operating budget funds that we would otherwise need to do that.

265
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:38,435
That an example of that could be CTE tuitions funded position within there that in that program it's also.

266
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:43,049
and even more so some of the supplies and the one-time related expenses.

267
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:50,232
Also, every year, typically with a budget of our size, we're looking to finish the fiscal year with some degree of a cushion.

268
00:37:50,272 --> 00:38:02,638
We can't finish in the red, as you know, so there has to be some degree of a cushion, and typically that's a surplus that we want to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

269
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,420
When we get to the

270
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:15,544
Right now, we're in a partial spending freeze to make sure that we're positioned to both finish the year well and in the hope of finishing the contracts.

271
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:36,000
But if there's surplus that we're going to finish with, something like the programming supplies for the CTE or the robotic supplies or the projectors, while we would pursue them if necessary in fiscal year 23, if there's a way to cross that off the list of things that we need to do in FY22, then we always sort of have our antennas up

272
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:37,345
to be ready to do that.

273
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:43,127
Category E, I think everyone understands where that sits.

274
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:50,189
These are things that the community should know about, the committee should know about, but it is not the recommendation that they would be the things that we would pursue at this time.

275
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:57,871
And you know about the lunch program, which we've discussed and we're looking forward to further conversations on that front.

276
00:38:59,491 --> 00:39:06,093
These are the subscriptions and platforms that we either are either up for renewal or need to be renewed.

277
00:39:06,992 --> 00:39:11,356
There's also a big part of this fills the hundred and $35,000 estimated fixed costs.

278
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:20,706
That's a number that we're looking through partly through negotiations with some of these vendors and probably through the identification of platforms that potentially could be retired from service.

279
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:23,629
That's one of the ways we try to bring that number down to the extent that we can.

280
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:30,936
These are just referencing some of the variables and fluidity that go into every budget.

281
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:37,449
And this, I think, is the last slide.

282
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:45,094
It repeats what I've already told you, so I will not.

283
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:49,877
Mr. Murphy, can you just go back to category D to the first slide?

284
00:39:49,897 --> 00:39:54,740
I think you moved too quickly through that for me to take that in.

285
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,201
OK.

286
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:57,862
I just wanted to make sure everyone had a chance to look at that.

287
00:39:58,443 --> 00:39:58,583
Yeah.

288
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:22,409
Okay, thank you, Mr. Murphy for that presentation.

289
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,592
Are there questions on the floor?

290
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,054
If you guys just want to raise your hands, we can move through it that way.

291
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:29,556
Member Rousseau?

292
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:31,197
Thank you.

293
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:39,726
Since we have seen this a few times, I have a motion that I'd like to make, and I'll put it in the chat.

294
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:48,811
But I'd like to move that we submit a request for A, B, and D to the municipal government in the sum of $72.4 million.

295
00:40:49,412 --> 00:41:04,303
Further, in the event that the state of Massachusetts does not fund school meals as they are presently considering, the district will proceed with free meals nonetheless and make a request to the municipal government for supplemental funding to cover the costs of continuing our free meal policy.

296
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,371
And are you going to put that in the chat?

297
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:13,212
I just did, yes.

298
00:41:13,312 --> 00:41:15,853
I just have one clarifying question or comment, Ms.

299
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:16,113
Graham.

300
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:17,673
Sure.

301
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:19,454
I have information too.

302
00:41:19,494 --> 00:41:25,395
Can you put that slide back up on the proposals, the packaged, you know, each one, please?

303
00:41:25,915 --> 00:41:26,275
Thank you.

304
00:41:26,896 --> 00:41:29,956
That relates to the point that I didn't make quickly when you're ready.

305
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:35,198
You can go ahead, Mr. Murphy.

306
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:40,821
So I just wanted to say that as part of Mr. Oso's motion, it's a $72.4 million request.

307
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:50,104
It is possible that as we continue to work on those fixed costs and so on and so forth, that actual number could be lower.

308
00:41:50,524 --> 00:41:54,685
Theoretically, it's possible it could be higher, but we've sort of constructed this in a way to try to avoid that.

309
00:41:55,765 --> 00:42:00,467
And so the way I would interpret your motion

310
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:07,471
is that we would build the budget proposal based on all of those priorities being included.

311
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:13,174
And if the total cost of that ended up being a different number, that would not be inconsistent with the intent of the motion.

312
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:18,377
It would just be the school committee has identified the priorities that you would expect the administration to pursue.

313
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:20,078
That's what the request would be.

314
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:26,762
And if it turns out to be 71.8 instead of 72.4, it still has the same legal effect.

315
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:29,524
Is that fair interpretation, Mr. Rizzo?

316
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:36,118
I guess it depends how the number comes down.

317
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:36,959
Sure.

318
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:43,605
If it comes down to 69.9, which I don't think it's going to, we will convene again next week and give you the opportunity to take a look at category E.

319
00:42:46,034 --> 00:42:46,734
That's not what I meant.

320
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:53,336
I meant if it comes down because you're doing your analysis and you find ways to save money, I'm fine with the number getting smaller.

321
00:42:53,396 --> 00:43:03,660
If it comes down because you have conversations offline with other people and decide to move things into ESSER funds instead of part of the request, I'm not OK with that.

322
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,480
Understood.

323
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:11,543
And I think what we would do, similar to what we did last year, is come back to the committee in June with an articulation of exactly what

324
00:43:11,982 --> 00:43:16,503
at that stage is our anticipated ESSER funding priorities.

325
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:22,184
And then you'll be able to see both of those sort of funding constructs.

326
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:22,965
Does that make sense?

327
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:24,565
Makes sense to me.

328
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:25,465
Yeah.

329
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:25,845
Thank you.

330
00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:35,908
I do want to talk a little bit about how we go about identifying savings so that there is not the impression that we come to you with a big number and then we take a magic wand and reduce the number.

331
00:43:36,108 --> 00:43:41,189
But when that, well, I can fit that in when appropriate, but I just want to make sure that that point is referenced later.

332
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:44,189
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

333
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:44,950
Member McLaughlin.

334
00:43:46,471 --> 00:43:47,051
Thank you.

335
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:54,116
I wanted to just clarify through the chair, Member Russo's motion, if I could.

336
00:43:54,176 --> 00:44:11,127
So if I understand correctly, with the 72.4 categories A, B, and D, Member Russo, that is because you're not including C because of the ESSER aspect of funding of that.

337
00:44:11,187 --> 00:44:11,868
Is that accurate?

338
00:44:13,223 --> 00:44:14,444
That is correct.

339
00:44:14,844 --> 00:44:15,104
Okay.

340
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:17,566
And so that's what I thought.

341
00:44:17,646 --> 00:44:17,886
Okay.

342
00:44:17,966 --> 00:44:26,832
ABD and then E the strong consideration, which is in the, in the 73, four is not being considered in the ABD.

343
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:35,218
So I guess I would ask that if we can go back to the strong consideration page for a moment, if my colleagues will indulge me, I would like to do that.

344
00:44:35,238 --> 00:44:35,658
Thank you.

345
00:44:59,848 --> 00:45:01,209
If I could, Ms.

346
00:45:01,249 --> 00:45:02,069
McLaughlin or Ms.

347
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:09,974
Graham, there are a couple of pieces here that I think it might be helpful as to if I explain why they're in category E, if that is helpful.

348
00:45:10,014 --> 00:45:10,614
Yes, please.

349
00:45:11,222 --> 00:45:11,482
Sure.

350
00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:17,005
So just the two bottom rows in particular, the DEI administrator and a registrar.

351
00:45:17,745 --> 00:45:20,906
Those are two administrative positions that the district could really benefit from.

352
00:45:22,147 --> 00:45:28,750
And at some point when we are confident about our capacity, I would imagine that it's their goals that we would pursue.

353
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:40,135
However, at this point, with the uncertainty of our capacity, both on the city side and on the district side, part of the reason that they were lowered from the prioritization perspective is because

354
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:47,142
Unlike some of the teaching positions, there's less of a priority to hire for those roles at this point in time.

355
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:56,869
If midway through the fiscal year, we identify the capacity or the needs and dynamics of the district shift such that we say, this is something we really need to pursue right now.

356
00:45:56,889 --> 00:46:02,093
Frankly, it's a largely different perspective applicant pool.

357
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:06,496
And that cycle that we have to be on

358
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,183
is different and therefore, you know, we can pursue it at a different time.

359
00:46:13,843 --> 00:46:35,896
Sort of somewhat in the same vein, from the CTE personnel priorities, Media Tech landed in Category E and Metal Fab landed in Category D. Neither program at the moment has the, this is a little more complicated because as I said, with regard to D, there's a potential other funding source that we may want to pursue there.

360
00:46:36,513 --> 00:46:41,276
And so we may very well be able to do that separate and aside from the operating budget.

361
00:46:41,756 --> 00:46:52,303
But with neither having the enrollment that says this is a clear necessity, we have to do this right now, that's what kept it out of A as opposed to health assisting where that was pursued.

362
00:46:52,864 --> 00:47:06,072
But the other piece that sort of distinguishes Metal Fab from the Media Tech is that there's a safety component on the Metal Fab piece that, again, if it's a vital safety need, we're going to pursue it regardless of where the budget comes in, obviously.

363
00:47:07,164 --> 00:47:13,070
But that variable helped sort of distinguish between those two programs in that moment.

364
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:22,279
With regard to the nurse registration piece, this is the purpose of that role, and I don't think we really, we may have discussed this in the first budget meeting, I can't remember.

365
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:27,364
But the idea from that would be a position that we could more,

366
00:47:29,562 --> 00:47:44,574
expeditiously move, register students and get them into schools faster by clearing them and making sure that we've got qualified medical personnel, both reviewing records and working with families to get them where we need them to be to get them registered.

367
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:45,955
That is a vital need.

368
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:49,177
It is not necessarily a vital position.

369
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:59,205
And so similar to what I said earlier about the position that landed in category D that wasn't there previously, we're exploring the other ways in which we can do that work more efficiently

370
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:04,543
without having to fund another full FTE and eat into that limited capacity that we have.

371
00:48:05,124 --> 00:48:07,905
With regard to, I guess I'm just going to go through all of them because I've only got two more if you don't mind.

372
00:48:08,205 --> 00:48:24,233
The science position is something that based on enrollment trends we think may be necessary, but according to the science department and the administration at the high school, it's not necessary this year, but it's something that we're putting a pin in to make sure that we continue to have the broad array of elective programming that

373
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:26,183
we want to have for our high school students.

374
00:48:26,563 --> 00:48:31,204
And with regards to the librarian program, that's one that we frankly have gone back and forth on.

375
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:33,605
And I know there's been discussion here at the committee about it.

376
00:48:34,346 --> 00:48:47,450
It's something that we want to develop the curriculum for and make sure that when we go to invest in that personnel, we have the programming and the curriculum structure that we need to make that personnel investment to maximize that personnel investment.

377
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:54,413
So that's sort of a very, very high level brief summary as to how things that are good ideas and could be good for kids

378
00:48:54,907 --> 00:49:02,171
landed in category E as opposed to category D. Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

379
00:49:02,191 --> 00:49:03,391
Thank you.

380
00:49:03,411 --> 00:49:03,992
Member Kratz?

381
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:11,196
Yes, I had a similar question about category E, which you answered the questions regarding the personnel.

382
00:49:11,836 --> 00:49:19,040
I did have another question on, because I had written down, and you were going pretty quickly on this, so I had written down that

383
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:25,143
Highest priority was category A. B was recommends ESSER.

384
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:26,504
Maybe I wrote that down wrong.

385
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:29,206
And then C was definitely ESSER.

386
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:38,752
So I think I need some clarification on in regards to category B, where that is part of Mr. Russo's motion.

387
00:49:39,212 --> 00:49:42,655
So is category B, is that

388
00:49:43,435 --> 00:49:56,924
a recommended ESSER or that's not, I get a little confused between the highest priority ESSER, the high priority ESSER, like why is C nodding?

389
00:49:57,164 --> 00:50:04,288
Like why are we counting on ESSER for all of the C priority needs and not for the category B?

390
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,470
I guess I'm just getting confused about that.

391
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,050
Thank you.

392
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,071
That's a very, very good question.

393
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,573
So I really do appreciate it.

394
00:50:11,653 --> 00:50:12,994
And I apologize if I

395
00:50:13,915 --> 00:50:15,736
was going too quickly this time.

396
00:50:15,756 --> 00:50:19,857
I want to, because it's a really important point, and I think your question helps illustrate it.

397
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:31,320
So category B, which I'll just scroll through really quickly, it's three personnel-related priorities, okay?

398
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:40,483
It's adjustment counselors, a strand of newcomer teachers in our English language learner program, and a district-wide nurse.

399
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:49,151
which helps support our health services in the event of continued COVID-related needs, okay?

400
00:50:50,172 --> 00:51:02,741
Given that they're personnel priorities, it would be our preference that the operating budget have a capacity that would allow us to absorb those priorities.

401
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,263
In a perfect world, that would be the case.

402
00:51:06,183 --> 00:51:08,645
However, two things are true.

403
00:51:09,386 --> 00:51:10,807
One, we don't live in a perfect world,

404
00:51:11,257 --> 00:51:16,841
And we know that there will be some limitation wherever that ends up being, there will be a limitation on our budget capacity.

405
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:17,521
Okay.

406
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:26,307
And the second thing that is true is that we have to do these things anyway, because of the impact that the pandemic has had on our students.

407
00:51:27,027 --> 00:51:34,192
And so while it may be, it may be our preference to use the one time funding capacity through ESSER

408
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,991
for only for one time funding expenses.

409
00:51:37,572 --> 00:51:50,900
In this case, the urgency of the need and the connection to the pandemic leaves us in a place where we would use the ESSER funding for this if the capacity is not there.

410
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,122
And so the distinction between B and C

411
00:51:55,185 --> 00:52:00,426
is that in C, we're telling the committee we really don't want to use the operating budget for this.

412
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,326
It's one-time related expenses.

413
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:04,847
There's a strong nexus with the pandemic.

414
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:13,188
And they're of a financial magnitude that they fit neatly within our overall ESSER prioritization and budgeting.

415
00:52:13,948 --> 00:52:21,770
With regard to category B, if it were the case that the operating budget could absorb these, then that's what we would use.

416
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,510
What we're saying is, frankly, we don't think the capacity will be there.

417
00:52:28,151 --> 00:52:30,072
And we know that we have to do this anyway.

418
00:52:30,512 --> 00:52:42,000
So this is our way of saying that, essentially, with or without an appropriation that can handle this $560,000, this will need to land within our ESSER priorities.

419
00:52:42,461 --> 00:52:49,906
And it's not an inappropriate use of the ESSER funds, because there is a strong nexus between these things and the pandemic.

420
00:52:54,650 --> 00:53:04,976
I don't have a crystal ball, which is what one of the administrators responsible for helping us to establish these priorities has said on multiple occasions, and the person is correct, none of us do.

421
00:53:05,856 --> 00:53:18,843
There is a prospect, I'd like to say a likelihood, but a prospect at least, that the urgency of these funding priorities will dissipate the further we get away from the pandemic.

422
00:53:20,182 --> 00:53:30,834
We know we need right now as students are coming back into the school setting, based on the enrollment trends based on what we saw this year in terms of the numbers are going up significantly.

423
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:35,159
We know that next year we need this strand of four positions.

424
00:53:37,296 --> 00:53:38,237
in the newcomer program.

425
00:53:38,277 --> 00:53:41,158
We know we're gonna need that for school year 22, 23.

426
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:46,982
It is possible though, that we will not need those positions in school year 23, 24 or 24, 25.

427
00:53:47,983 --> 00:53:52,205
And so the ESSER gives us the capacity to do that, to fund those positions while we need them.

428
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:53,926
And then one of two things are gonna happen.

429
00:53:54,687 --> 00:54:02,051
The need won't be there because we won't have, from an instructional perspective, it won't be necessary or it will be necessary.

430
00:54:02,151 --> 00:54:05,253
And then it will be incumbent upon the district

431
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:10,513
to find within its operating budget the funding to continue the programming that students need.

432
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:16,979
So it's about the sort of time-sensitive nature of it, the urgency of it, and the connection to the pandemic.

433
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:24,285
And ultimately, what really distinguishes it is that, sure, if we could do it in operating, we would.

434
00:54:24,725 --> 00:54:31,271
But we're telegraphing to the committee and the community that this is something that we will have to resort to ESSER funding for if that capacity is not there.

435
00:54:33,152 --> 00:54:33,653
Is that helpful?

436
00:54:34,415 --> 00:54:35,396
Yes, that was helpful.

437
00:54:36,136 --> 00:54:50,125
And then I just wanted to also note last week I did reach out to state rep Donato and he did tell me that the House of Representatives did vote to approve $110 million in their budget for free lunch for all students.

438
00:54:50,205 --> 00:54:56,529
So it's gone over to the Senate and then in likelihood like the Senate and the governor will approve hopefully.

439
00:54:56,549 --> 00:55:03,373
So, you know, really hoping that happens but I do agree with the language and Mr. Russo's

440
00:55:03,773 --> 00:55:14,056
motion that we would then submit supplemental fund, you know, for a request for supplemental funds, if that wasn't to pass, but I'm, I'm really hopeful that that it will pass.

441
00:55:15,356 --> 00:55:30,560
And I just would add, Miss Kretz that the Superintendent's Association has made this a significant part of their legislative agenda, and our administration has added our voice to that and so that they know that in their lobbying efforts that this is something that

442
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,632
we believe would be in the best interest of the Medford community as well.

443
00:55:35,273 --> 00:55:48,264
And so anyone out there has friends in the Senate, we would urge you to write those letters and make those phone calls, because I do think the state and federal government is the appropriate place to resolve this, and they're the entities with the capacity to do it, and I would say the responsibility to do it.

444
00:55:50,065 --> 00:55:50,466
Thank you.

445
00:55:50,606 --> 00:55:51,306
Member McGill?

446
00:55:52,507 --> 00:55:59,593
I'd like to second Member Russo's motion for A, B, and D, please.

447
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:13,459
Okay, so the motion on the floor by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McStone, is I move that we submit a request for A, B, and D to the municipal government in the sum of $72.4 million.

448
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:30,045
Further, in the event that the state of Massachusetts does not fund school meals as they are presently considering, the district will proceed with free meals nonetheless and make a request to the municipal government for supplemental funding to cover the cost of continuing our free meal policy.

449
00:56:32,753 --> 00:56:38,219
Are there other questions from the committee on the motion or on the deck?

450
00:56:43,705 --> 00:56:44,887
Are we ready to move the question?

451
00:56:46,589 --> 00:56:46,989
Okay.

452
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,672
Member Rossell, will you call the roll?

453
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:53,817
One second.

454
00:57:03,393 --> 00:57:03,893
Member Graham.

455
00:57:05,194 --> 00:57:05,454
Yes.

456
00:57:06,855 --> 00:57:07,376
Member Hayes.

457
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:08,356
Yes.

458
00:57:09,317 --> 00:57:09,858
Member Kratz.

459
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:10,558
Yes.

460
00:57:11,859 --> 00:57:12,719
Member McLaughlin.

461
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,220
Yes.

462
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:15,922
Member Stone.

463
00:57:16,282 --> 00:57:16,522
Yes.

464
00:57:17,943 --> 00:57:18,684
Member Rousseau.

465
00:57:18,844 --> 00:57:19,124
Yes.

466
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,605
Mayor Lungo-Kern, absent.

467
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:24,367
Thank you.

468
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:26,909
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

469
00:57:27,029 --> 00:57:28,030
The motion passes.

470
00:57:31,712 --> 00:57:32,333
Member McLaughlin.

471
00:57:34,769 --> 00:57:46,758
I just wanted to congratulate everyone on that process and thank Mr. Murphy for all of his hard work and putting this together and the presentation and giving us all an opportunity to try a new process.

472
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:52,643
And I know this is arduous for all, but thank you guys, everyone for all your hard work.

473
00:57:55,066 --> 00:57:55,806
Thank you, Ms.

474
00:57:55,926 --> 00:57:56,286
McLaughlin.

475
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:56,447
Ms.

476
00:57:56,467 --> 00:58:00,768
Graham, if I could just make that one point about the identification of savings that I alluded to earlier.

477
00:58:01,028 --> 00:58:01,829
Yes, please do.

478
00:58:02,129 --> 00:58:12,353
I appreciate the committee's patience, forbearance, and willingness to work through this the way that we have over the last few weeks.

479
00:58:12,453 --> 00:58:16,655
I think that while this may have felt different,

480
00:58:18,263 --> 00:58:27,527
I actually think we essentially covered the same ground that we typically did, but I'd like to think we did it in a more efficient manner, and hopefully in a more transparent one as well.

481
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,567
That was our goal last year.

482
00:58:28,587 --> 00:58:31,608
I think we advanced that even further this year.

483
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:41,352
What I don't want to happen is, with the committee indicating this is the categorization, this is the priorities, this is the committee doing what the committee is supposed to do, identifying the high-level priorities,

484
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:44,655
that it is incumbent upon the administration to now pursue.

485
00:58:45,536 --> 00:58:57,185
That being said, we're not doing our job if we pursue them without also looking to identify any potential efficiencies and flexibility that we have within our existing budget, right?

486
00:58:57,646 --> 00:58:58,006
And so

487
00:58:59,074 --> 00:59:13,327
the sort of three areas that we'll look to, and we've discussed this throughout these budget meetings, to see whether or not we can do what the committee has just charged us with doing, but for less than $72.4 million, will be one in the identification of positions.

488
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:13,907
And Ms.

489
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:21,014
Galussi spoke in the second budget meeting about how, as we look at enrollment trends, it may well be the case that

490
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:25,791
that there are strands that we can potentially collapse.

491
00:59:25,871 --> 00:59:27,772
That's something we continue to look at.

492
00:59:28,613 --> 00:59:31,094
That doesn't mean we collapse them and we just put the money in our pocket.

493
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:34,555
It means that we use that funding to hopefully pursue other priorities.

494
00:59:34,615 --> 00:59:36,596
But that is one piece.

495
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:45,540
The second piece is, and I talked about this a little bit with category D, there are some one-time related expenses there that it's my hope they don't survive into FY23.

496
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:53,080
They may or may not, but that would be another way in which that overall price tag could potentially be affected.

497
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,841
And then the third way is I mentioned that we're in a spending freeze right now.

498
00:59:56,881 --> 00:59:57,521
That's typical.

499
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:58,961
That's something we pretty much do every year.

500
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:02,942
We have to make sure that we finish the fiscal year in the appropriate financial position.

501
01:00:03,962 --> 01:00:11,463
When we look at that, it may be the case that there are some savings that we can potentially roll over and bring down those fixed costs.

502
01:00:11,503 --> 01:00:11,823
And so 2% is 2%.

503
01:00:16,517 --> 01:00:20,081
is pretty well calculated, and I think it's pretty sturdy.

504
01:00:20,461 --> 01:00:29,951
The $2.6 million is the one where there is potential for flexibility there, and that's something that we'll look at and we'll keep the committee apprised of going forward.

505
01:00:30,271 --> 01:00:31,633
And to Mr. Rousseau's point earlier,

506
01:00:32,627 --> 01:00:48,550
Ultimately, I think we have tried to sort of be very clear about what is likely to land in the ESSER budget, either because it's highly appropriate use of ESSER funding or it's both highly appropriate ESSER funding and it's urgently needed and that we know we have to do it.

507
01:00:48,890 --> 01:01:00,052
And so the ESSER funding in that case, in that sense sort of serves as our backstop to make sure that we're able to address all of the various challenges

508
01:01:00,562 --> 01:01:03,699
that we have as an organization coming out of the pandemic.

509
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:07,373
Thank you for that.

510
01:01:07,514 --> 01:01:09,916
Member McLaughlin, did you have another question or is your hand?

511
01:01:10,396 --> 01:01:12,919
No, go ahead.

512
01:01:12,939 --> 01:01:27,172
I also wanted to ask that, and I'm assuming that this will be the case, but I just want to put it out there, ask that the deck that was presented tonight be shared on the website, as well as obviously the full budget proposal.

513
01:01:27,712 --> 01:01:31,736
So that, you know, in our budget books that I know that we'll be receiving, and I know there are some things pending,

514
01:01:32,727 --> 01:01:38,134
So I understand that, but as soon as those are ready, I would ask that they be published on the website, please.

515
01:01:38,214 --> 01:01:38,635
Thank you.

516
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:43,522
The deck tonight will be published tomorrow and then as the book comes together, we'll have that as well.

517
01:01:44,082 --> 01:01:44,383
Thank you.

518
01:01:47,282 --> 01:01:58,007
And Mr. Murphy, correct me if I have this wrong, but the next steps, this is our request to the municipal government, which effectively will go to the mayor's office.

519
01:01:59,488 --> 01:02:09,512
As the mayor works on her overall city budget to present to the city council, she will have a well-informed understanding of what this committee has deemed priority.

520
01:02:10,133 --> 01:02:12,634
And she has been part of those discussions all along.

521
01:02:13,254 --> 01:02:14,274
And then we will,

522
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:25,308
await a budget approval from the city council to know what our allocation specifically will be come July 1st.

523
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:42,457
And based on that allocation, which hopefully is everything we've asked for, we would adopt, we would have, convene another meeting, take a vote to adopt the municipal, to adopt the school committee budget based on the municipal appropriation.

524
01:02:42,637 --> 01:02:43,237
Is that correct?

525
01:02:43,737 --> 01:02:44,238
It is correct.

526
01:02:44,278 --> 01:02:50,562
The only sort of step that would proceed that final vote to adopt to be the budget hearing that under statute, you'll need to have.

527
01:02:50,763 --> 01:02:55,366
And so that will be at some point in the next in the next month.

528
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:56,127
We'll do that.

529
01:02:57,268 --> 01:02:57,468
Great.

530
01:02:57,508 --> 01:02:57,848
Thank you.

531
01:02:58,348 --> 01:02:58,989
Member McLaughlin.

532
01:03:00,857 --> 01:03:02,418
Right, so the public budget hearing.

533
01:03:02,618 --> 01:03:15,263
And then also, I guess, you know, I don't want to jinx anybody, but I guess, what is the process if the appropriation comes in less than the amount that the school committee has asked for?

534
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:16,684
What do we do in that case?

535
01:03:17,364 --> 01:03:19,265
Yeah, and so I just want to be clear.

536
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:23,187
And again, like, I think these are like, well founded priorities.

537
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:25,548
And again, I appreciate the committee hearing us out on all of them.

538
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:25,848
But like,

539
01:03:26,649 --> 01:03:27,929
That is my expectation.

540
01:03:27,969 --> 01:03:29,250
I just want to be candid about that.

541
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:38,753
As I've said many times, our responsibility is to prepare for any eventual contingency and to also understand that there are competing priorities within the municipal government.

542
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:52,238
And that is just a fact of life and something that while we advocate zealously and try to keep the committee as well-informed as possible, we have a responsibility to make sure that we can implement a budget that serves students well, regardless of what that number is.

543
01:03:52,598 --> 01:03:55,319
And so similar to last year, in the event of a Delta,

544
01:03:55,832 --> 01:04:02,914
one that I fully expect, we will come back and we will identify how we'll bridge that delta.

545
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:05,295
We've tried to be as transparent as possible.

546
01:04:06,056 --> 01:04:08,736
So I think you probably can guess how we're going to recommend doing that.

547
01:04:09,117 --> 01:04:11,277
Category B, we're going to recommend goes to ESSER.

548
01:04:11,657 --> 01:04:21,141
Category A, we're going to recommend gets funded before category D. And then within category D, we're going to try to chop away that number through the use of other funding sources.

549
01:04:21,621 --> 01:04:24,722
And then if there are discrete decisions left to be made,

550
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:31,916
That's what we would come back to the committee with and seek your feedback on so that ultimately we get to the number we need to.

551
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:38,041
Member Graham, may I respond to that just or follow up on that?

552
01:04:38,061 --> 01:04:49,370
So just process-wise, though, if we don't get an appropriation until July 1, at what point will we be coming back to the table to figure out the reallocation, should that be the case?

553
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:50,651
Yeah, it would be in the month of June.

554
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:54,394
So I would imagine that we would come back to begin the work of bridging that

555
01:04:55,361 --> 01:04:57,803
Once the recommendation has gone to the council.

556
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:07,711
Last year, if you remember, we, the council was not voting on a final appropriation until the, like June 27 June 28 right around there.

557
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:17,118
And so you voted on June 24, a vote that was contingent upon the council making that appropriation had for some reason that not happen we'd have to go to a

558
01:05:17,562 --> 01:05:18,743
essentially a 112th budget.

559
01:05:19,764 --> 01:05:22,906
It gets more complicated, but essentially we'd have to come back and seek your guidance further.

560
01:05:22,946 --> 01:05:25,087
But that's what I would anticipate.

561
01:05:25,107 --> 01:05:30,972
At this point, I would expect you'd probably, I think you'd probably take that vote on June 13th.

562
01:05:31,032 --> 01:05:33,093
That's currently your final scheduled meeting for the year.

563
01:05:34,414 --> 01:05:38,497
If not, it could be a few days later for some reason, if there's something that is sort of up in the air.

564
01:05:38,557 --> 01:05:42,080
But right now, my expectation would be that it would be June 13th.

565
01:05:43,545 --> 01:05:52,529
And Mr. Murphy, has the mayor advised you of the schedule of releasing her budget and the council's review of it?

566
01:05:53,189 --> 01:05:54,250
Has that been established yet?

567
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:54,770
Are you aware?

568
01:05:55,490 --> 01:06:07,275
We're in continuous communication with the mayor's office and as usual, they've been good partners with us and strong dialogue and good communication, but I don't have this specific date.

569
01:06:07,355 --> 01:06:11,517
And if it's the date that's in my head, I'm not sure it's a public date nor is it necessarily my place to say it.

570
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:23,654
I think it's very soon, as you can imagine, because fiscal year is coming up, but I think the month of June, as is the case in every city in town, will be heavily weighted by the budget.

571
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,895
Great, thank you.

572
01:06:27,135 --> 01:06:28,755
We'll know it in the earlier product, I think.

573
01:06:30,576 --> 01:06:31,196
Awesome, thank you.

574
01:06:31,936 --> 01:06:32,256
Thank you.

575
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:38,994
I greatly appreciate Mr Murphy's opinions, frankly, on everything.

576
01:06:39,034 --> 01:06:49,083
And he and I disagree vehemently on this point about, um, the need for the school committee to spend so much energy and concerns about the municipal situation.

577
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:58,491
Um, I just, it's important to point out that the only communication we ever hear about competing priorities and municipality has is from Mr. Murphy.

578
01:06:59,472 --> 01:07:00,633
We don't hear it from any other.

579
01:07:02,106 --> 01:07:21,996
You know, it's not coming out of the mayor's office, it's not coming out of the city council, it's, it's as if the finance director for the school system is doing the job of explaining to the public, how complicated municipal finances are, and how there are competing priorities, and nobody else that I have seen in the city says that out loud.

580
01:07:24,978 --> 01:07:40,656
It's not a commentary on the staff at the city hall, but I do not believe that when I look at the statute on school committees, our responsibility does not say a thing about being concerned about the minute municipal financial situation.

581
01:07:41,297 --> 01:07:45,382
Our responsibility is on is the children.

582
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:49,206
and their education and it begins and ends there.

583
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:54,408
It doesn't have to do with whether or not the rec department can get more staff or the police department can get more staff.

584
01:07:55,048 --> 01:07:59,650
And I vehemently disagree that we should spend more than a minute thinking about it.

585
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:04,312
We should figure out what we need for the students and we should ask for it.

586
01:08:04,572 --> 01:08:16,117
And then let the mayor's office deal with whatever communications are required when that office cannot give us the money because of competing priorities, which I think are real.

587
01:08:17,655 --> 01:08:29,164
I don't live in a bubble, I get it, that they're real, but I just think that we spend too much time talking about and being worried about the municipal government's finances.

588
01:08:29,565 --> 01:08:34,608
We did start earlier with, we have no capacity to raise a nickel.

589
01:08:35,369 --> 01:08:36,170
And you know who does?

590
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:41,594
The municipal government can raise taxes if they see fit, and they don't.

591
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:44,256
So as far as I'm concerned,

592
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:48,383
It's not my concern whether they can afford our budget request.

593
01:08:49,563 --> 01:08:56,544
And I'm just tired of the conversation and I don't mean to berate you.

594
01:08:56,604 --> 01:08:58,405
I'm certainly not trying to berate you, Mr. Murphy.

595
01:08:58,705 --> 01:08:59,365
No, I don't.

596
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:01,365
But Mr. Rousseau and Ms.

597
01:09:01,385 --> 01:09:03,346
Graham, if I could just respond very quickly.

598
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:11,547
And I'd say this, as you know, as a former school committee chair, I actually don't think we vehemently disagree on that, Mr. Rousseau.

599
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,888
I think you're correct.

600
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:18,040
It is your job to zealously advocate for the needs of the school system.

601
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,902
And I mean this sincerely, I appreciate that you do.

602
01:09:22,482 --> 01:09:26,104
And I think, I think this committee does its job and I think it does its job well.

603
01:09:26,764 --> 01:09:33,588
But I think what you've heard me say is not that I think the committee should spend its time balancing the needs of the municipality.

604
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:44,073
It's at the school administration has to understand that we do have a nuanced function, not because we want to keep the municipal government happy as much as because we have to operate the district.

605
01:09:44,493 --> 01:09:49,494
And whatever that appropriation is, it is our responsibility to plan for any potential contingency.

606
01:09:49,854 --> 01:09:56,056
And I think it would be a disservice to the committee and to the community to not be very upfront about that with the community and say,

607
01:09:56,715 --> 01:10:00,598
that we're going to make this work regardless of where it lands.

608
01:10:00,618 --> 01:10:01,798
That's our responsibility.

609
01:10:01,878 --> 01:10:05,401
Now, am I saying we're going to make it work as well as we would?

610
01:10:05,421 --> 01:10:08,002
No, I'm not, because that's not true.

611
01:10:08,323 --> 01:10:10,464
But it is our responsibility to make it work at the end of the day.

612
01:10:10,484 --> 01:10:12,445
And that's just life in the administration.

613
01:10:12,485 --> 01:10:15,988
And I can tell you, when I was in your seat, that wasn't my problem.

614
01:10:16,048 --> 01:10:18,269
And I took very much a very simple stance.

615
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:22,652
But it is different when the work is what it is.

616
01:10:22,812 --> 01:10:23,813
I will say just one last point.

617
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,354
I promise then this is the last thing I'll say.

618
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:31,732
The audience that I'm speaking to, frankly, is not the municipal government.

619
01:10:32,653 --> 01:10:40,557
Every community has members of the community who watch the school committee meetings, but don't have a direct stake as commonly defined in the school system.

620
01:10:41,517 --> 01:10:53,983
And those members of your community are the ones that have to know that we take our responsibility with respect to fiscal stewardship seriously, just like you take your responsibility for advocating zealously on behalf of the kids of Medford seriously.

621
01:10:54,653 --> 01:11:07,218
And I think we have a better chance at engendering the trust and confidence of those community members who don't have that direct stake if they know we're asking only for what we need and for what we know we can make work.

622
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:13,540
And at the same time, we want to keep them informed about what we'll eventually need and how those priorities might develop.

623
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,782
And that's the transparency pillar that goes along with the coherence.

624
01:11:18,242 --> 01:11:18,842
But I know

625
01:11:19,517 --> 01:11:27,438
that there are people in your community that want to know about transparency, and there are people in your community that want to know about coherence.

626
01:11:27,938 --> 01:11:41,181
And I think our responsibility is to speak to both so that when the time comes, and it will, that they're asked to invest more in their schools, they know that we've done everything we can to spend every nickel they've given us wisely.

627
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:49,102
And I think that's sort of the context in which I go over that refrain.

628
01:11:49,665 --> 01:11:52,227
night in, night out of the contingency planning.

629
01:11:53,227 --> 01:11:53,588
Thank you.

630
01:11:54,168 --> 01:11:54,508
Thank you.

631
01:11:54,688 --> 01:11:55,449
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

632
01:11:55,689 --> 01:11:56,350

634
01:11:58,611 --> 01:12:00,292
Motion adjourned by Member McStone.

635
01:12:00,653 --> 01:12:01,093
Second.

Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

637
01:12:03,775 --> 01:12:04,815
Member Rossell, will you call the roll?

638
01:12:05,556 --> 01:12:05,876
I will.

639
01:12:06,236 --> 01:12:06,817
Member Graham?

640
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:08,098
Yes.

641
01:12:08,938 --> 01:12:09,438

01:12:10,019 --> 01:12:10,279
Yes.

643

Yes.

647

Member McStone?

648
01:12:17,204 --> 01:12:17,384
Yes.

649
01:12:18,198 --> 01:12:18,481
members.

650
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:19,830
So yes, they're longer current.

651
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:22,450
Excellent.

652
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:23,155
The affirmative one.
