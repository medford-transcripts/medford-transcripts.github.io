1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:06,715
[SPEAKER_07]: in the interest of time, get going through this meeting.

2
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:09,357
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have a quorum, so I think we can start.

3
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:14,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I will read the agenda and then we can call the roll.

4
00:00:16,043 --> 00:00:23,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Please be advised that on October 28th at 5 p.m., there will be a special meeting of the Medford School Committee to be held remotely via Zoom.

13
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:16,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.

14
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:26,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, member Branley, I believe member Graham here, member and Tapa absent member Olapade here.

15
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:28,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Reinfeld here.

16
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Members, so present Maryland, okay.

17
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:53,401
[SPEAKER_07]: So for president and three absent, um, if we can all please stand to salute the flag, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

18
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:57,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay.

19
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:02,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Our agenda today is long and short.

20
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,351
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one item on the agenda, that's the short part.

21
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:21,755
[SPEAKER_07]: The long part is that it is the first reading of Policy ACGB Title IX Sexual Discrimination Grievance Procedure Resolution 2024-38 offered by Member Rousseau.

22
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:24,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau, before we

23
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:28,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Dive into reading this 18 page policy, did you want to give us.

24
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:35,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, uh, some headlines about what this policy is all about.

25
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:41,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, it is really hard to just to know we have another member online now.

26
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:46,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

27
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:49,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very long policy.

28
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never draft a policy of this length.

29
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:58,059
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so long that we might be the only people to ever read it.

30
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:08,503
[SPEAKER_01]: But this came from our professional association and came down from a set of lawyers that they contract with regarding Title IX changes.

31
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:14,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Title IX has sort of been batted back and forth through each of the administrations that we have had

32
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:16,126
[SPEAKER_01]: White House.

33
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:19,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the Biden version.

34
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:23,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, we don't have to go through all of this again in the next couple of years.

35
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:30,874
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of many policies that we have been going through related to Title IX.

36
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:32,574
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the grievance procedure.

37
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:40,078
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody who wishes to file a grievance through Title IX would follow this procedure.

38
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,579
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of preamble.

39
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:48,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are step-by-steps, who has what rights and when.

40
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:54,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will admit that I lack knowledge about prior versions of this.

41
00:03:55,408 --> 00:03:59,351
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't really speak to what changed.

42
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:01,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Ms.

43
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:09,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Bowen, if you, I didn't even ask you, but is there any big, giant change that you feel?

44
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just such a wholesale change that you don't?

45
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:20,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most of it is like the scope of the sexual discrimination and sex-based harassment.

46
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:22,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very clearly defined in that.

47
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:28,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And also just bits and pieces here and there about the process, how that is different.

48
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:37,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Witnesses, there was a part in here previously about like being able to question the accuser.

49
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:40,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they've changed a lot of those types of

50
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:42,669
[SPEAKER_04]: language and processes.

51
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:51,311
[SPEAKER_04]: But it mostly was just about the sex discrimination and sex-based harassment that they really clearly defined, I feel.

52
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:53,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

53
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:54,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

54
00:04:55,052 --> 00:05:03,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So not having the knowledge of the previous one, it sounds like really fleshing out the areas where there was always litigation, because it's like, well, what does that really mean?

55
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:06,134
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good news.

56
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:06,854
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good news.

57
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,055
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have an update of this size, it's good to see that.

58
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:11,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, member of family.

59
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:27,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I attempted to do an AI summary and I failed because this is too big for the free AIs to ingest.

60
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:34,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't about to pay for a AI subscription just to be able to do it on this one giant policy.

61
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:36,669
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean,

62
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:45,400
[SPEAKER_01]: we could go through it page by page or section by section and just like this is what this section means.

63
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:53,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally have a strong dislike of the idea of reading it because I did time it if we were to have

64
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:58,703
[SPEAKER_01]: a Siri or AI read us the policy.

65
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:05,508
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an hour and 27 minutes just without us stopping or having questions.

66
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:07,830
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was with a pretty fast voice.

67
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,133
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping nobody here is desiring that we do that.

68
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:14,955
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing I

69
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:18,206
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll know in the policy, and this is something new.

70
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:20,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never put this in a policy before.

71
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:25,511
[SPEAKER_01]: At the very end, there's a statement that I think we might want to put into other policies.

72
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:32,776
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, updates to contact information of school staff identified within this policy may be made without school committee notification.

73
00:06:33,357 --> 00:06:40,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's bad form to have in your policies, like the names and phone numbers of individuals.

74
00:06:40,622 --> 00:06:45,203
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case where it's sort of part of the point of the policy is that that's all there.

75
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:47,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was a good workaround.

76
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:54,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are not reviewing this policy every single time a staff member retires or we hire somebody new.

77
00:06:55,467 --> 00:07:00,668
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's sort of the outlier for how the policy language is drafted.

78
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:06,950
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the 10-mile diversion.

79
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:10,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to waive the reading?

80
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make that motion.

81
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,723
[SPEAKER_07]: So a motion to waive the reading by Member Rousseau.

82
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:21,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second.

83
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:23,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Member Branley.

84
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:25,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call.

85
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:27,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Branley?

86
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:29,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

87
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:31,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

88
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:31,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

89
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:35,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Ntapa is presently absent still, I think.

90
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:37,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

91
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:37,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

92
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:37,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

93
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:37,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

94
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:37,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

95
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:38,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

96
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:39,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

97
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:40,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

98
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:40,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

99
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:41,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

100
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:42,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

101
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:42,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

102
00:07:56,201 --> 00:08:09,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so remember, so I think it probably makes sense to go through this like chunk by chunk and just ask for folks to let us know if they have questions or comments, um, about that as we go through.

103
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:23,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once we, um, go through that, we can sort of see where we land and decide, you know, if there's another motion to entertain, um, whether to pass this or, or, um, pass it on to another meeting or, um,

104
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:29,550
[SPEAKER_07]: take care of waving, reading both readings here tonight.

105
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:32,079
[SPEAKER_07]: So before we.

106
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:47,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we go, yes, can I ask, so this seemed to be, when I went through it, very much aligned with the notes that came out of Department of Education and this fact sheet, the final rule fact sheet that has kind of the key components.

107
00:08:48,170 --> 00:09:02,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm wondering how much of this is the language that was already recommended versus specific to Medford, because I think I am confident that in having a policy that complies with federal law,

108
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: We shouldn't be debating a lot of those things.

109
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:09,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember so.

110
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:12,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

111
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,914
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that language went to the lawyers I forget the law firm that ma SC uses, and they.

112
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:24,749
[SPEAKER_01]: expanded upon and translated it as much as was actually needed.

113
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:29,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't read the DESE, I mean, not the DESE, the Department of Ed Language.

114
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,751
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they simply copied it and stuck their name on it, I wouldn't know.

115
00:09:33,252 --> 00:09:42,734
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, this is, I did not make changes other than updating the contact information, replacing the district with Medford.

116
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:46,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also, there were a few places of punctuation and,

117
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, there were some typos.

118
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,093
[SPEAKER_01]: But so other than that, I did not change the content.

119
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:58,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, of course, malegal perspective, a comma can matter.

120
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:01,037
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very cautious.

121
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:03,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use Grammarly.

122
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Grammarly has a lot of recommendations to make this thing better.

123
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:14,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not take any of them other than where a comma was necessary or not necessary.

124
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:19,248
[SPEAKER_01]: It was clearly just a mistake in the drafting of the language.

125
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:22,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I really didn't like the format.

126
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:24,525
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many levels.

127
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:37,136
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I felt uncomfortable really making a big change because it did come from lawyers and because Title IX is such a gigantic, complex thing that I don't fully understand.

128
00:10:37,156 --> 00:10:41,260
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we're at.

129
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:47,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, so I think going through it piece by piece and maybe having member Ruseau and Ms.

130
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:55,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowen provide a little bit of the guidance of this is what this is doing here or how it plays out would be helpful.

131
00:10:55,555 --> 00:11:00,478
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you like me to share the screen?

132
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:01,699
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be great.

133
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I think that's a good idea.

134
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:07,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And then let's, we can start at the top.

135
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,350
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a preamble that goes on for several pages.

136
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:28,424
[SPEAKER_07]: So up until page halfway down page five is a preamble that, um, in my reading describes like what the intention of the policy is and why it was, um, built in the first place.

137
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:32,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will, um, open the floor to any questions about the preamble.

138
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:42,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Just realize you can't see me shaking my head probably because I have this text up.

139
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything on the preamble.

140
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:49,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing no questions on the preamble.

141
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,291
[SPEAKER_07]: The next section is definitions.

142
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:57,014
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it was what we what we were just looking at was the preamble.

143
00:11:57,034 --> 00:12:02,819
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one piece that says sex discrimination that right there where your mouse was prohibits sex discrimination.

144
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Should that be sexual discrimination?

145
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:07,462
[SPEAKER_05]: You know,

146
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:18,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else is really consistent and then I didn't know if that was just left in as sex discrimination, but I promise I'm not, this was the only place I got that detail.

147
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:22,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting that.

148
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:24,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I can search.

149
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:27,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm searching too.

150
00:12:27,543 --> 00:12:32,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so there's 26 instances of the words sex discrimination.

151
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:36,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not inclined to go in and

152
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:40,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's 43 of sexual discrimination.

153
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:48,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that it is not the only thing in this document that I have similar concerns about.

154
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:52,718
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't actually know technically if there are differences between the two.

155
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,599
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem like the same thing to me.

156
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:04,826
[SPEAKER_05]: My sense was that sexual discrimination was the term that was being used to cover all of these things laid out here, plus sexual harassment.

157
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:19,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I'm fine with a fine and replace sex discrimination with sexual discrimination if nobody has any reason to disagree with that.

158
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,910
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is, I guess my only thought is,

159
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:40,223
[SPEAKER_07]: that we're not changing anything of substance, but we might be if we make this change, right?

160
00:13:40,343 --> 00:13:47,148
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're not intending for it to be substantive, but it would be unbeknownst to us.

161
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:50,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would advocate that we leave it alone.

162
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:51,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

163
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:52,592
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

164
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,894
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

165
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:59,277
[SPEAKER_01]: We will completely mess up the formatting to add a few characters anyways.

166
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so about halfway down page five, we start with definitions.

167
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:14,786
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks like they go to page eight, halfway down page eight.

168
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:16,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham, are you looking at the agenda?

169
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:18,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am looking at the agenda.

170
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:19,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

171
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:20,788
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

172
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:27,991
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm on page three to page... Six.

173
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:28,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Six.

174
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:29,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

175
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:29,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

176
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:30,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

177
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:40,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, definitions, I don't think they're particularly consistent, but I don't want us to have to engage lawyers.

178
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Questions about the definitions?

179
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:55,789
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

180
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,593
[SPEAKER_07]: The next section is about reporting sexual discrimination.

181
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,936
[SPEAKER_07]: and filing a formal complaint.

182
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:08,577
[SPEAKER_07]: So that goes on for several pages.

183
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,600
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could just kind of give like quick go through the steps process real quick?

184
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:20,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, that would be great.

185
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:23,062
[SPEAKER_01]: So starts out with who may

186
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:29,222
[SPEAKER_01]: file reports, and it's anyone, which I think is interesting.

187
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:37,048
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be the victim or whatever the proper term isn't, according to the definitions.

188
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,234
[SPEAKER_01]: How to report the discrimination is in the

189
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,360
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not steps.

190
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

191
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:51,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this organization of this document was a challenge.

192
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:57,065
[SPEAKER_01]: There's internal reporting that's related to employees.

193
00:15:58,465 --> 00:16:03,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Next is the district response to the report, which, of course, the district will respond.

194
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:06,709
[SPEAKER_01]: There are five

195
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:25,037
[SPEAKER_01]: things that the district will do promptly and confidentially, contact the complainant, inform the complainant of supportive measures, consider the complainant's wishes.

196
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:34,500
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know what the point of number four is.

197
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:35,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And then,

198
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:42,459
[SPEAKER_01]: The complainant will have, it will be explained to the complainant what the process is for filing the complaint.

199
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Next we have filing itself.

200
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:51,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the actual process.

201
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Who may file it?

202
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:56,466
[SPEAKER_01]: A much longer version.

203
00:16:56,526 --> 00:16:58,968
[SPEAKER_01]: This document is very good at repeating itself.

204
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:05,431
[SPEAKER_01]: So a much longer version of who may file the process again.

205
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,052
[SPEAKER_01]: in longer words, more words.

206
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:20,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it say step one somewhere?

207
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:21,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It did, I apologize.

208
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:21,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Step one.

209
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:26,682
[SPEAKER_01]: So step two is the consideration of supportive measures.

210
00:17:26,702 --> 00:17:28,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So the complainant and the respondent.

211
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:35,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Step three is written notice of the allegations.

212
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a definition of the word consider?

213
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:41,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's not offer.

214
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:55,691
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, like, I suspect that is one of those words that is legally, it means one thing in legal terms and the other.

215
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,452
[SPEAKER_02]: For the rest of us.

216
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in the policy that I can see.

217
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:01,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

218
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:06,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

219
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:09,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Versus offering those supportive measures.

220
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:12,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I feel like that's implied here, but it isn't explicit.

221
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:19,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a section up here about, what was it?

222
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:23,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it up here?

223
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:29,194
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go up to the part D of the reporting section of discrimination.

224
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:30,354
[SPEAKER_05]: It's provided.

225
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:32,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bullet four.

226
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:39,949
[SPEAKER_00]: which I agree with Maru, so that doesn't make, how do you determine?

227
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:43,852
[SPEAKER_05]: That says if you're not providing supportive measures, you have to say why.

228
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:48,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we went straight to disciplinary action for these reasons.

229
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:49,976
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an imminent danger.

230
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:59,302
[SPEAKER_05]: This was not a safe environment in which to offer this supportive measure.

231
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:03,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that.

232
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:11,888
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the non-punitive.

233
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:19,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall I continue?

234
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:21,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

235
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:24,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the hard thing is, of course, thank you.

236
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:31,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the hard part is, of course, without specific examples, it gets really, this is not easy stuff to draft.

237
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:45,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so those are the written notice, what will be included in the notice, there will be a statement for evading retaliation, of course, submitting false information, all the things you'd expect.

238
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:04,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Step four is the consideration of whether to dismiss the formal complaint.

239
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some mandatory, yes.

240
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:16,085
[SPEAKER_08]: On section three, number seven, just need a capital on that.

241
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:19,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

242
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:20,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

243
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Grammarly didn't notice that.

244
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:33,019
[SPEAKER_07]: It also doesn't want to read 18 page prophecies.

245
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

246
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,883
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, step four is about whether or not the complaint is subject to mandatory discretionary dismissal.

247
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:48,387
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the district cannot identify the.

248
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:50,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Respondent.

249
00:20:52,128 --> 00:21:04,995
[SPEAKER_01]: which is often known as the accused in regular language, then of course there's no way to further deal with the complaint.

250
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:11,999
[SPEAKER_01]: There is may dismiss, these are the may dismiss.

251
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,205
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the person is not involved in their educational programs and is not involved with the district, we may dismiss, not to say we have to,

252
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,148
[SPEAKER_02]: if the complainant voluntarily withdraws.

253
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:41,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So then there's more stuff about dismissal.

254
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:50,593
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to summarize without just reading it, but I'm not reading it.

255
00:21:57,506 --> 00:22:03,527
[SPEAKER_01]: If the dismissal is appealed, the district will do a set of things, notifying all the right people.

256
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:11,128
[SPEAKER_01]: When the complaint is dismissed, the district will at a minimum offer supportive measures.

257
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:22,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Respondent will be notified of the allegations and supportive measures will be offered there as well.

258
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is this underscored?

259
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

260
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,623
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, so let's see.

261
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:34,124
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's more just dismissal.

262
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:36,744
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of stuff, but- Six is really important there.

263
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:40,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so let me read that one since I can't remember it.

264
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:53,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Dismissal of a formal complaint for purposes of Title IX nominal exclude the district from addressing allegations under any other relevant district policies or procedures, including but not limited to the civil rights grievance procedure,

265
00:22:54,269 --> 00:23:12,178
[SPEAKER_01]: the bullying prevention and intervention plan, that thing, the student code of conduct and or collective bargaining contract, nor will it preclude the district from addressing the allegations pursuant to the grievance process in section two of this procedure.

266
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:19,622
[SPEAKER_01]: The Title IX coordinator shall have the discretion to make any such referrals and proceed as appropriate in regard to the allegations.

267
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:29,138
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because a dismissal within this final line has happened, that doesn't mean it's the end, necessarily.

268
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:36,828
[SPEAKER_05]: This may not qualify for this type of measure, but it could still be a violation of other.

269
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:41,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

270
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:44,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Next step five is the initial inventory deletion.

271
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:49,222
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the details on what the district will do.

272
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Standard of proof.

273
00:23:53,886 --> 00:23:55,347
[SPEAKER_01]: The burden is on the district.

274
00:23:58,911 --> 00:23:59,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Collection of evidence.

275
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:01,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

276
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Presentation of witnesses.

277
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,638
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have no, there'll be no gag orders.

278
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:23,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Each party will have one advisor.

279
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,316
[SPEAKER_01]: written notice to seek privacy medical treatment.

280
00:24:38,536 --> 00:24:46,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So the district cannot access medical information in any situation here.

281
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:51,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless of course they can unless they consent to it.

282
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:57,303
[SPEAKER_01]: the investigator timelines.

283
00:24:57,723 --> 00:24:59,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So speed matters.

284
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,686
[SPEAKER_01]: It always matters to everybody involved in these things.

285
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:10,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the changes that did happen that there used to be a 10 day waiting period.

286
00:25:10,712 --> 00:25:17,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you're involved in this as the victim or accused or whatever the proper terms here are.

287
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:22,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And once all the investigations are done, everybody has to sit on their hands for 10 business days.

288
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:30,043
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's going to school, everybody's, you know, it didn't make a lot of sense.

289
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:37,027
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that was one big change that they made is that that 10 day mandatory waiting period is gone.

290
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:42,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

291
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:49,936
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't have any definitions of what a reasonable timeframe is.

292
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:51,875
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.

293
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:53,356
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't.

294
00:25:53,617 --> 00:26:11,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that for minor things, I think everybody would think reasonable is, you know, same day, a day or two, but for major, major things, I can certainly see it taking many days or longer once there's lawyers and, you know, all kinds of other things involved.

295
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,932
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's separate language for acknowledgement of the receipt of the complaint.

296
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:25,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's, this is the opportunity for parties to access and respond to the evidence.

297
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:31,966
[SPEAKER_01]: The evidence, there's limitation in here.

298
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:39,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to redact confidential information not directly related to the allegations.

299
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:44,048
[SPEAKER_01]: FERPA is very much still in effect here.

300
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:48,329
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an override FERPA.

301
00:26:50,194 --> 00:27:03,664
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anybody in the public that wants to know, that's the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which is, you'll hear school committee members use it when we respond to you about why we can't actually do things you ask us to do sometimes.

302
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:13,411
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody is prohibited from disseminating any of the evidence for any purpose not directly related to the grievance procedures.

303
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:18,454
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't take it and go to Facebook or anything.

304
00:27:19,494 --> 00:27:25,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It is evidence that you have the right to see, but you do not have the right to disseminate.

305
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, Randall wants to say something.

306
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:31,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

307
00:27:31,422 --> 00:27:36,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the section where I had a lot of questions, and I think it comes up in the bullying policy as well.

308
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:41,188
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are more than two parties, if we're talking about a group,

309
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:46,577
[SPEAKER_05]: like a team of people or multiple staff.

310
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:59,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of confusion on what gets investigated on a person by person basis versus people as a group talking amongst themselves.

311
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:06,812
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a group of students who is either filing a complaint or is being

312
00:28:08,928 --> 00:28:19,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is the respondent or respondents, whether they're getting individual, whether all of these words, multiple things happening simultaneously versus.

313
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:26,327
[SPEAKER_05]: An investigation into a group situation, and that's not really addressed, and I don't know.

314
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,009
[SPEAKER_05]: if there's guidance there.

315
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:50,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, I can try to talk to lawyers about that, but I don't know how that works in some of our other policies, because I know there has been a lot of concerns where I was told one thing and I was told another, and then parents start sharing with each other around the same situation, and there's just lots of conflicting information.

316
00:28:52,686 --> 00:28:53,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you give us an example?

317
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm not tracking like a group.

318
00:28:56,927 --> 00:29:01,988
[SPEAKER_07]: If a group does something, it's because individuals in the group did something, right?

319
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:03,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

320
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:09,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have examples that aren't Title IX specific.

321
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:09,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that?

322
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

323
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:11,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

324
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:21,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, a group of middle schoolers is caught with vaping supplies.

325
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:35,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And each student is being, the investigation is happening individually with those students, but the outcomes of those end up being different.

326
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:39,320
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the parents, you know, suspension might happen.

327
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:41,842
[SPEAKER_05]: One student is suspended, another one isn't.

328
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:45,071
[SPEAKER_05]: parents are comparing notes.

329
00:29:46,032 --> 00:29:48,612
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're saying, this is what the administration told me.

330
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:50,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, this is what they told me.

331
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:53,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't release information about this other student.

332
00:29:54,574 --> 00:29:56,514
[SPEAKER_05]: But the parent has given me this information.

333
00:29:56,554 --> 00:30:01,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to bring that as part of my complaint, because my kids were together.

334
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:02,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Our kids were together.

335
00:30:02,776 --> 00:30:03,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that helpful?

336
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:08,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a little helpful.

337
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:09,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Ms.

338
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Bowen, if you have any thoughts on that.

339
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:17,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think in the end, like, the district can't.

340
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:24,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, they can't broadly meet out.

341
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:28,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Consequences, like, they have to do that specifically and individually.

342
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:29,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

343
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So I could see why a parents would.

344
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:42,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that or want to know, like, what else is there's a video, the reviewing of evidence, like, there's a there's a video of something that happens and.

345
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:50,521
[SPEAKER_05]: 1 complaint complainant can't review a video because it contains footage of another complainant, for example.

346
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:53,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Must be when.

347
00:30:54,113 --> 00:31:00,939
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, I think it's not, so the consequence wouldn't necessarily be one size fits all.

348
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:14,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when we start doing these investigations, we find out more information and then apply what the discipline would be or what sort of restorative circles or supportive measures would be.

349
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,231
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's,

350
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:31,398
[SPEAKER_04]: like finding out what each student's specific role was, you know, like in regards to vaping, maybe the student that brought all the vapes in might have a heavier consequence than a student that just took one.

351
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:40,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's really doing a deep dive into all the information and then looking at what is going to be the best line of

352
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:43,824
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, how do we handle this with each student?

353
00:31:44,604 --> 00:31:57,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can have conversations with parents, like, your child's role was a little bit different and this is why the consequence was a little more severe or was not as severe, if that makes sense.

354
00:32:01,232 --> 00:32:05,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Member Reinfeld, as it relates to a Title IX investigation,

355
00:32:08,382 --> 00:32:37,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, if there is collective bullying for a group of LGBTQ students or the school say, I don't think this is going to happen, but school is not providing adequate pumping space for new parents.

356
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:45,390
[SPEAKER_05]: and we as a group want to file a complaint.

357
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:50,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we as a group file a complaint or does it have to be a series of individual complaints?

358
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:55,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it could be a group complaint.

359
00:32:55,878 --> 00:33:03,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it may separate into more individual investigations.

360
00:33:03,504 --> 00:33:06,506
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there are, say, four women who

361
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:16,892
[SPEAKER_04]: don't feel like the accommodations are appropriate and they file together, then we would look at it and as a group, look at a solution for them.

362
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:23,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be a little bit different, I think, than, say, a bullying or sexual harassment.

363
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:29,203
[SPEAKER_04]: like a group response to that.

364
00:33:29,624 --> 00:33:38,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's looking at each individual's actions and part of, say, a sexual harassment complaint, and then going from there.

365
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:42,891
[SPEAKER_04]: They vary so widely when things happen.

366
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:58,541
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really hard to give a if-then sort of answer because we, it's really, really, you never know, like once this complaint comes in and you start to do the investigation, it takes a life on its own and it does involve more people.

367
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:04,324
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like really doing that due diligence and looking into it and then going from there.

368
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:05,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know,

369
00:34:06,553 --> 00:34:09,955
[SPEAKER_04]: what are the ramifications for the students?

370
00:34:10,155 --> 00:34:11,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we discipline them?

371
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:12,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we not?

372
00:34:12,337 --> 00:34:20,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we say like, we work with the parents about maybe they need some social skills groups or counseling in school or whatever it may be.

373
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:33,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's really hard to say we're gonna do this if this happens, because when we're in the midst of the investigation, we're seeing a lot more things come to light, either for the positive or for the negative.

374
00:34:35,046 --> 00:34:42,749
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to jump in here also that this is the scenario given there has to be a victim.

375
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:46,991
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bunch of students getting in trouble for vaping is not Title IX.

376
00:34:47,411 --> 00:34:51,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we decided we were going to say just the girls are going to get in trouble and not the boys.

377
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:58,736
[SPEAKER_01]: The victim where who's the victim the district enforcing a policy.

378
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:04,845
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking action is we, I suppose we could be the perpetrator.

379
00:35:06,246 --> 00:35:13,909
[SPEAKER_01]: as a district, but I don't think this policy considers that the district is actually a perpetrator in violation.

380
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:23,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously plenty of Title IX things are about the district refusing to, you know, deal with sports and all the other types of things, but there are victims there.

381
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:27,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the sports scenarios are coming to mind, and I'm trying.

382
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

383
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:33,497
[SPEAKER_05]: To note that, I mean, we are in a public meeting and so.

384
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:38,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so let me find what page we're on since I've already.

385
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:44,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we were on page nine.

386
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Step seven, if you keep going down further.

387
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:47,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

388
00:35:48,638 --> 00:35:49,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad somebody's paying attention to that.

389
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:57,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so yeah, all right, so let's see.

390
00:35:57,985 --> 00:36:03,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and I see, yeah, for any purpose not directly related to this grievance procedure.

391
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:17,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there is a interconnected investigation that remains within the single grievance or, okay, thank you.

392
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:20,423
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

393
00:36:21,164 --> 00:36:24,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So next up is step seven, completion of the investigative report.

394
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:31,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Then eight is the parties opportunity to respond to the report.

395
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:35,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Step nine is directed written questions from the parties.

396
00:36:35,858 --> 00:36:42,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So after the investigative report has been sent to the parties, but prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility.

397
00:36:44,283 --> 00:37:05,617
[SPEAKER_01]: The decision-maker shall afford both the complainant and the respondent the opportunity to submit to the decision-maker relevant questions of the other party or any witness, provide the party with the other party's and our witnesses' written responses to said questions, and allow for additional limited follow-up questions from each party in writing.

398
00:37:06,878 --> 00:37:12,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions that seek disclosure information protected under legally recognized privileges, such as FERPA,

399
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:18,664
[SPEAKER_01]: will, shall not be permitted unless the person holding the privilege waives their right.

400
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:28,514
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, seems pretty standard, not as awful as an actual deposition, but.

401
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:28,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

402
00:37:38,516 --> 00:37:42,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is this 10 days to submit directed relevant questions.

403
00:37:42,497 --> 00:37:46,258
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is still 10 days.

404
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,519
[SPEAKER_01]: There was that other 10 days on top of that 10 days.

405
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:55,360
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be hard to feel like things are being taken seriously if we just keep adding two week increments.

406
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,321
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.

407
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:19,365
[SPEAKER_01]: So 10 days to craft your questions, five days to get before your answers are due, another three days, and then another three days.

408
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:25,108
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, it's no wonder things take forever, but they have to.

409
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:29,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody has to do the work and have their rights protected.

410
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:33,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

411
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:36,625
[SPEAKER_01]: And then step 10 is determination of responsibility.

412
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Findings are backed by the decision maker.

413
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:40,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's on this call?

414
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:42,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Joan is.

415
00:38:43,131 --> 00:38:43,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did Joan?

416
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:44,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we just lose Joan?

417
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:44,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we did.

418
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:45,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, there you are.

419
00:38:45,553 --> 00:38:45,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

420
00:38:45,813 --> 00:38:47,094
[SPEAKER_01]: She's here.

421
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:47,475
[SPEAKER_01]: She's here.

422
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:50,498
[SPEAKER_01]: You moved to the top for some reason on my screen.

423
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Standard of proof, decision makers' findings,

424
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:04,025
[SPEAKER_01]: The determination will be written, of course, and sent simultaneously to both parties.

425
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:12,771
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some more very long time frames here.

426
00:39:14,692 --> 00:39:16,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Section C, remedies.

427
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:20,476
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what can be done.

428
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:27,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the remedies, the elimination of the harassing environment,

429
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:41,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Next is section D, page will be on 15.

430
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:43,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Persons doing discipline.

431
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:48,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is about discipline, as you would imagine.

432
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:59,302
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there is a reference to the two Massachusetts general laws related to behaviors that are attributable to disabilities.

433
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,227
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go into those, because those stand alone.

434
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:10,133
[SPEAKER_01]: So then there's the imposition of sanctions.

435
00:40:14,198 --> 00:40:19,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Compliance with the imposition of the sanctions.

436
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:28,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this is sort of important.

437
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:45,587
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if there was a determination that it had not happened, or that it was not, sorry, not that it had not happened, that it was not considered, am I misreading this?

438
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does the sentence, this one mean, do you know?

439
00:40:55,474 --> 00:40:58,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say it means that if they make a false statement.

440
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:06,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, let me read this again.

441
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:07,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

442
00:41:08,402 --> 00:41:29,127
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may, it seems like it's reading as if the timeline coordinator will not discipline a party witness or other participating entity if they make a false statement about sex discrimination, or if they felt as though it was, but it was not actually based off of the determining criteria after a review process had occurred.

443
00:41:29,147 --> 00:41:33,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be no repercussions towards the original respondent.

444
00:41:34,748 --> 00:41:36,989
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is how it reads.

445
00:41:38,618 --> 00:41:38,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

446
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:41,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound right to you, Jo?

447
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:41,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

448
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

449
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

450
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

451
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:46,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

452
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:48,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawyers, do you know how to make it hard?

453
00:41:51,138 --> 00:42:03,320
[SPEAKER_05]: And this might've been the previous section, but so there's this timeline talks about the elimination of conditions once the determination has been made.

454
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:12,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't, this policy doesn't seem to say a lot about while the investigation is going on, making sure things are safe.

455
00:42:13,882 --> 00:42:16,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So those would be the supportive measures that you offer?

456
00:42:17,574 --> 00:42:18,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, in advance.

457
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:19,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

458
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

459
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:20,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

460
00:42:21,148 --> 00:42:21,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

461
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:27,161
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ms.

462
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:31,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Bowen, correct me if I'm wrong, but supportive measures could be quite substantial.

463
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:38,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if we felt the student couldn't be in the building, we would be offering them another option for how to get an education outside of the building.

464
00:42:38,885 --> 00:42:43,987
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that they just get to come to school and we're like, be nice.

465
00:42:44,087 --> 00:42:45,227
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what we mean.

466
00:42:45,267 --> 00:42:47,868
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be something as significant as that, correct?

467
00:42:48,524 --> 00:43:00,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct, and if it was a staff member who made a complaint that they were being sexually harassed, walking them to the car at night, offering them counseling, that sort of thing.

468
00:43:00,593 --> 00:43:09,599
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a wide range, but yes, it could be a big supportive measure that we offer depending on the situation.

469
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:13,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that supportive measure potentially include

470
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:18,895
[SPEAKER_05]: removal of the respondent or the alleged perpetrator.

471
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:40,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to go back and see, I don't think you can remove until you do the investigation, but you can separate sort of, you know, really close supervision, put in a safety plan, but I would have to go back and I haven't experienced that yet.

472
00:43:41,266 --> 00:43:49,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I don't, but I think you have to make sure that you do the investigation first before you can remove.

473
00:43:49,909 --> 00:44:03,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Because one of the real challenges of these situations is that a lot of the burden to remain safe is on the victim or alleged victim or complainant.

474
00:44:04,043 --> 00:44:11,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And that can be really hard and further exacerbating of a situation.

475
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:13,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

476
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:23,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's really important that when we have a conversation about the supportive measures, we also can have like counseling staff there with us.

477
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:28,316
[SPEAKER_04]: The parents can be involved in what sort of protections do we need to put into place?

478
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:37,524
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's any legal protections that may have to happen as well, like involving the school resource officer and that sort of thing as well.

479
00:44:43,257 --> 00:44:46,819
[SPEAKER_05]: but like administrative leave can't happen during it.

480
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:48,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And when does administrative leave?

481
00:44:50,102 --> 00:44:53,624
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's the... It could possibly, it could possibly.

482
00:44:53,684 --> 00:45:01,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where we really engage with our attorney to say like, this is what has been reported to us.

483
00:45:01,249 --> 00:45:03,130
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in the process of an investigation.

484
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:08,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Does somebody go out on paid leave until the full investigation is happening?

485
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:11,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where we would seek Howard Greenspan's

486
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:14,668
[SPEAKER_04]: advice on that.

487
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:17,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Privacy challenges on both sides are significant.

488
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,430
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

489
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:18,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

490
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:21,872
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

491
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up we have, did I finish this section?

492
00:45:25,794 --> 00:45:26,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.

493
00:45:28,356 --> 00:45:29,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Informal process.

494
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:37,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an option to have an informal process if the

495
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:43,271
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the right words to describe the different people here.

496
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:45,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, one second, Google is, okay.

497
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,459
[SPEAKER_01]: That was crashing on me.

498
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,904
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is an option to have an informal process.

499
00:45:59,795 --> 00:46:00,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

500
00:46:00,996 --> 00:46:04,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Next is section F emergency removal under Title IX.

501
00:46:06,422 --> 00:46:14,690
[SPEAKER_01]: The district may remove a respondent on an emergency basis at any time that the district one undertakes an individualized safety and

502
00:46:17,112 --> 00:46:33,906
[SPEAKER_01]: And risk analysis two determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual discrimination justifies removal and that there is no alternative to the respondent's emergency removal to mitigate the threat presented.

503
00:46:34,146 --> 00:46:40,811
[SPEAKER_01]: And three, provides the respondent with notice and the opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following removal.

504
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:44,014
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's there.

505
00:46:44,074 --> 00:46:45,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we never have to use that.

506
00:46:46,658 --> 00:46:47,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Anonymous reporting.

507
00:46:52,663 --> 00:46:56,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is that we may take anonymous reports.

508
00:46:57,547 --> 00:47:06,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, we can do supportive measures.

509
00:47:12,978 --> 00:47:14,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannot provide, oh, I'm sorry.

510
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:23,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we can't do supportive measures if we don't know who is supporting, who is reporting.

511
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:43,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, that seems, I mean, if we don't know who the reporter is, that's different than confidentially reporting, but there's really not much, there's pretty significant limitations.

512
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:45,566
[SPEAKER_01]: and what could actually be done.

513
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:49,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody want to talk about that one at all?

514
00:47:52,932 --> 00:47:57,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, an anonymous report is not a formal complaint.

515
00:47:58,936 --> 00:48:11,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's certainly where we've seen in higher education these things come out, is people saying, well, I can't do anything until a formal complaint is filed, and people don't feel safe submitting a formal complaint.

516
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:30,941
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever it is, but it's this horrible catch 22, maybe not even a catch 22, but a paradox of people just, people need to be good people, but.

517
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:34,883
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so next up is appeals.

518
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,165
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an entire appeals process, of course.

519
00:48:39,428 --> 00:48:45,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Says who to send the appeal to five days after the determination.

520
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:50,236
[SPEAKER_01]: The decision maker may not take.

521
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:55,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, the decision maker for the appeal cannot take part in the event.

522
00:48:57,341 --> 00:48:59,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Could not have taken part in the investigation.

523
00:49:02,538 --> 00:49:13,025
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have the original policy as I received it had frankly a lot more decision makers that we have decided to go with.

524
00:49:14,225 --> 00:49:17,027
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some freedom and leeway to do that.

525
00:49:18,328 --> 00:49:22,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see both sides of that, but I'll explain that when I get to that section later.

526
00:49:25,352 --> 00:49:30,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, because I did have a question is we have one appeal officer and what happens if

527
00:49:32,378 --> 00:49:38,669
[SPEAKER_05]: This is purely hypothetical, not based on the individual named, but what happens if the appeals officer is involved in this?

528
00:49:40,132 --> 00:49:41,474
[SPEAKER_05]: There needs to be an alternative.

529
00:49:43,618 --> 00:49:43,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

530
00:49:43,778 --> 00:49:44,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Bowen, can you answer that?

531
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So that could be, so the roles can be interchangeable.

532
00:49:49,320 --> 00:50:11,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one person could fill all these roles, but if say like John Bruno, who is the appeal officer is involved in the case, then I might be the appeals officer, or we might look at other people like the informal resolution facilitators that they were not involved, that they could make the decision at that point about the appeal.

533
00:50:13,066 --> 00:50:34,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, since you said part of this is about communicating what the avenues are, that was my question here is do we need to communicate that in the event of the designated person not being able to be that unbiased decision maker, these are the alternate paths.

534
00:50:34,557 --> 00:50:37,579
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only because that particular role had one person.

535
00:50:45,145 --> 00:50:49,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So is your suggestion that there be more than one person listed as an appeals facilitator?

536
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:57,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think what I'm hearing Ms.

537
00:50:57,927 --> 00:51:00,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Bowen saying is that, frankly, all these people are interchangeable.

538
00:51:01,068 --> 00:51:11,430
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, if John Bruno was involved, then obviously he's not going to be the investigator or the, I mean, you know,

539
00:51:13,746 --> 00:51:19,108
[SPEAKER_01]: that these are all roles that can just be swapped around to ensure that there's not a conflict.

540
00:51:19,128 --> 00:51:23,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we'd have to list every person under every section.

541
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:27,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the point is sort of that people know who to call.

542
00:51:28,772 --> 00:51:34,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you were concerned about John Bruno as like you're writing a complaint against him,

543
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:40,687
[SPEAKER_01]: then obviously you're not going to want him to be the appeals officer.

544
00:51:40,747 --> 00:51:42,829
[SPEAKER_01]: He also wouldn't be a very good investigator.

545
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:49,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are just sort of like defaults is how I take them.

546
00:51:52,313 --> 00:51:53,894
[SPEAKER_05]: That is how I take them as well.

547
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:58,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I just was wondering about how explicit we need to be about that.

548
00:51:58,737 --> 00:52:02,320
[SPEAKER_05]: And just since we're in public, I like John Bruno very much.

549
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.

550
00:52:06,663 --> 00:52:09,765
[SPEAKER_05]: At my child's school, just not picking on him.

551
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:12,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

552
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:15,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So where was I on this?

553
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:17,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Age 15?

554
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:25,851
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see, sorry.

555
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:29,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we had finished that section there.

556
00:52:29,552 --> 00:52:44,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Recordkeeping, so obviously just keep records related to this procedure maintained for a period of seven years.

557
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:46,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I said days, I was confused, years.

558
00:52:53,695 --> 00:52:55,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much standard stuff.

559
00:52:57,337 --> 00:52:58,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Employment agencies.

560
00:52:59,278 --> 00:53:02,560
[SPEAKER_01]: This is boilerplate stuff.

561
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Where to go.

562
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay is identification of key personnel.

563
00:53:10,703 --> 00:53:12,364
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's this section down here.

564
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:21,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And the boilerplate code that I originally had had an investigator at each school.

565
00:53:21,174 --> 00:53:24,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I can sort of see the value in that.

566
00:53:24,457 --> 00:53:32,503
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, if somebody's particularly well-trained in that, then maybe they're a better choice.

567
00:53:36,066 --> 00:53:40,709
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other part of that that I was a little bit like, so McGlynn is,

568
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,291
[SPEAKER_01]: of far away from the Missittook.

569
00:53:45,312 --> 00:53:52,195
[SPEAKER_01]: But that means that Mr. O'Brien is going to be doing Title IX investigations over at the Missittook.

570
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:59,198
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other side, I also was kind of like, it seems better to have somebody not at your school doing the investigation.

571
00:53:59,718 --> 00:54:06,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if we were to do it where we had really, it would have to be an entire

572
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,929
[SPEAKER_01]: table of like, if you're here, this is who you contact.

573
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:12,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it gets really messy.

574
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:20,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, Joan's at the top, so Joan's gonna get the calls.

575
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:28,864
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and this does not preclude an investigator at another school doing it.

576
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:30,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

577
00:54:31,431 --> 00:54:31,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

578
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:32,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

579
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:39,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we had two people to administrators that did any sexual harassment complaints.

580
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:45,605
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has expanded it to a few more roles throughout the district.

581
00:54:47,605 --> 00:54:54,008
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, if it's at the McGlynn Elementary School, then we might have Jen Skane or Sheila do it.

582
00:54:54,108 --> 00:54:55,668
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interchangeable.

583
00:54:55,748 --> 00:55:02,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So depending on the specific situation, we would look at who would be the best person to do the investigation.

584
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:09,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be myself, it might be, human resources might get involved as well.

585
00:55:09,274 --> 00:55:13,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do like how we have more people involved.

586
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:19,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

587
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:32,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So this prominently displayed on the district website.

588
00:55:32,803 --> 00:55:39,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's anybody who has an idea of what the word prominently displayed means in legalese.

589
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:58,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I will ask, I'll send an email afterwards to ask that, that if it's not already there that, you know, Joan is listed as the title and coordinator maybe in the about or section or somewhere very prominently.

590
00:56:02,168 --> 00:56:08,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think on the actual main page, just like right there makes a lot of sense, because that gets very much.

591
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:11,918
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have the non-discrimination statement.

592
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:19,985
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have the district educational statement.

593
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,787
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gets very long.

594
00:56:23,669 --> 00:56:24,610
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just my opinion.

595
00:56:25,518 --> 00:56:32,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are at an hour, and we have sort of been through it.

596
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:35,505
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot to digest.

597
00:56:40,149 --> 00:56:45,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will have another chance at a regular meeting when we do the second reading, which we will not read also, hopefully.

598
00:56:47,974 --> 00:56:49,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any other?

599
00:56:52,947 --> 00:56:56,769
[SPEAKER_07]: questions or changes suggested?

600
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:11,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been trying to figure out a way to rephrase the phrase victim without their consent because it implies that a victim can give consent up in the definition section, but I haven't settled on anything.

601
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:29,395
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another difficulty is trying to, if there are components of things that we want to change without changing like state or federal guidelines and the terminology that they're using.

602
00:57:29,735 --> 00:57:35,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to do anything that's going outside of what their expectations or recommendations are.

603
00:57:35,378 --> 00:57:39,079
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not kind of following their requirements.

604
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,720
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another difficulty, I think.

605
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:43,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean,

606
00:57:45,612 --> 00:57:59,922
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whenever I tell people what it's like to be on the school committee, I do talk about that the federal, the state, and, of course, the local, everybody's got their hands in the pie, and nobody talks to each other or cares, frankly, what the other one thinks.

607
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:07,468
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do end up with definitions that can not only be not consistent, but can even be contradictory.

608
00:58:07,768 --> 00:58:12,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just left to sit in that stew.

609
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:29,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's tough, especially when you're writing, you know, we write one policy, like the bullying one, which comes from the state house, and we are very specific definitions of, you know, aggressor is the word they use.

610
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:40,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here, there's the respondent, which is like the most mild-mannered version of that probably anybody could ever come up with.

611
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:40,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So

612
00:58:42,607 --> 00:58:49,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we just have to live with the fact that in some policies, we are calling those folks the respondent and other ones that are the aggressor.

613
00:58:49,654 --> 00:58:52,376
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the state one actually has two different words.

614
00:58:53,337 --> 00:58:56,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Interpreter, but until it's been proven, they can't put that in.

615
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

616
00:58:58,601 --> 00:58:58,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

617
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:03,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, victim isn't even listed in this one as the act in the definition section.

618
00:59:04,406 --> 00:59:08,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So they do say that alleged victim is a. Yeah.

619
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:14,034
[SPEAKER_05]: That person, but that's not.

620
00:59:15,174 --> 00:59:25,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's hard and hopefully nobody has to go through any of this, especially if they have to go through it in multiple offices because that would be terrible.

621
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:39,445
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a motion to approve the first reading.

622
00:59:43,137 --> 00:59:43,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll make a motion.

623
00:59:45,598 --> 00:59:48,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve the first reading by Member Olapade.

624
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second.

625
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:52,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Member Branley.

626
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:54,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call.

627
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Branley.

628
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:00,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

629
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:01,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham.

630
01:00:01,921 --> 01:00:02,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

631
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:04,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Ntuk is absent.

632
01:00:04,321 --> 01:00:05,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Olapade.

633
01:00:05,062 --> 01:00:05,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

634
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:07,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Reinfeld.

635
01:00:08,122 --> 01:00:08,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

636
01:00:09,202 --> 01:00:11,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Soyes, Mayor Lungokirn is absent.

637
01:00:16,496 --> 01:00:21,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So does this automatically go to a regular meeting or do we waive?

638
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:26,221
[SPEAKER_07]: So five in the affirmative, two absent, motion passes.

639
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:38,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the question that you have is, does this go, are we waiving a second reading or is this going to another meeting?

640
01:00:39,048 --> 01:00:39,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that your question?

641
01:00:39,948 --> 01:00:40,809
[SPEAKER_07]: That is my question.

642
01:00:41,894 --> 01:00:50,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I know we accidentally did we have 2nd readings 2 meetings ago and then several of us, we already did the 2nd reading.

643
01:00:50,904 --> 01:00:52,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it on the agenda?

644
01:00:53,147 --> 01:00:58,252
[SPEAKER_01]: The 2nd reading has to actually be on the agenda because that's the opportunity for the public to.

645
01:00:58,272 --> 01:01:01,075
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the 2nd chance it's not for us.

646
01:01:01,155 --> 01:01:02,357
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for the public to be like.

647
01:01:03,573 --> 01:01:11,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, if you're watching the meeting and you see something discussed and you wanna discuss it, you may not be prepared.

648
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:15,060
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second reading I think should happen at the next meeting.

649
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:21,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be submitting a clarifying rule update to make that clear, cause it's not clear.

650
01:01:21,824 --> 01:01:31,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the second reading will be on our next school committee agenda, which is a week from today.

651
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:38,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any other motions on the floor?

652
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:40,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

653
01:01:41,635 --> 01:01:43,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn by member Reinfeld.

654
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:45,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on a second roll.

655
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:46,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.

656
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:48,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Bramley, roll call.

657
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:50,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Bramley.

658
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:52,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

659
01:01:53,102 --> 01:01:53,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham.

660
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:54,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

661
01:01:55,724 --> 01:01:56,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Tapia is absent.

662
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:57,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Olapade.

663
01:01:58,165 --> 01:01:58,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

664
01:01:59,166 --> 01:01:59,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Reinfeld.

665
01:02:00,267 --> 01:02:00,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

666
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Members say yes.

667
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Lando Kern is also absent.

668
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:07,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been the affirmative to absent.

669
01:02:07,135 --> 01:02:08,158
[SPEAKER_07]: The meeting is adjourned.
