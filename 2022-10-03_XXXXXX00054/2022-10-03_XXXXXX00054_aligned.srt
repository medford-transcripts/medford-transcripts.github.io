1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,561
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:11,422
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:14,825
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:17,867
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and change maker.

5
00:00:18,488 --> 00:00:20,209
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:28,156
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,280
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,762
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:44,848
Right.

10
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:47,073
Thanks so much for both of you joining us today.

11
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:49,758
If you could just start by introducing yourself.

12
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:52,303
So a name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

13
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:56,385
Yeah, so my name is Erin Dowd.

14
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:59,425
My pronouns are she, her, hers.

15
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:03,446
I am a Medford resident.

16
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:04,147
I'm a mom.

17
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:10,508
I have a almost six-year-old kindergartner, and I'm a licensed clinical social worker.

18
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:22,431
I have a private practice, and I'm a member of Mom's Demand Action for Dumptown for America, and I am the lead for the local Medford team.

19
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:24,645
Oh, thank you.

20
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:28,892
So we're going to talk a lot more about that role with moms to moms demand action today.

21
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:36,726
But first we have a question that's sort of just our theme for the podcast, which is if you could share with us your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

22
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:46,458
So there's a lot of good places, but I live very close to Snappy Patties and I think was there on opening day.

23
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:48,259
And so we eat there a lot.

24
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:54,943
And the chicken schnitzel sandwich to me is like one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.

25
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:56,284
It's so good.

26
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:58,406
So that's like my favorite thing.

27
00:01:58,746 --> 00:01:59,366
Yeah.

28
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:02,768
We hear about Snappy Patties a lot, but I have never heard of that sandwich.

29
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:03,569
So thanks for.

30
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:11,161
Yeah, it's probably within the last two years they've had it on the menu and it's hard for me to order anything else going in there.

31
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,001
It's really weird.

32
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:12,442
Yeah.

33
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:12,582
Great.

34
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,103
All right.

35
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:19,025
So I think we're here to talk about, hear more about what you do with Moms Demand Action.

36
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:22,767
And so if you could tell us like a little bit about the organization, that'd be great.

37
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:23,788
Yeah.

38
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:38,443
Yeah, so Moms Demand Action is, the full name is Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and it's the largest in America, the largest grassroots volunteer network working to end gun violence.

39
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:44,326
It's a part of Everytown for Gun Safety, which is the largest gun violence prevention organization in the country.

40
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:46,367
It's got about 10 million supporters.

41
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:50,629
And Moms Demand Action was started by Shannon Watts,

42
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:52,770
after Sandy Hook.

43
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,937
She was a mom who just created a Facebook page basically wanting to connect with other people, feeling like you have to do something about gun violence.

44
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:03,220
And just to be clear, you don't have to be a mom to join Moms in Action.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,083
You don't have to identify as a woman to join Moms in Action.

46
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:11,987
Anybody can join, but that's the name because originally I see it was a group of moms.

47
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:14,109
And MomTag

48
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,833
700 local groups across the country and a chapter in every state.

49
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:24,018
So we have a really strong chapter in Massachusetts that I'm a part of.

50
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:33,852
I joined in 2018, actually my sister one day, I think there was a shooting, like another mass shooting that had happened.

51
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:36,234
And my sister asked me, do you want to go to this meeting?

52
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:42,440
And it was great when I was feeling kind of hopeless and not sure, wanting to do something and not sure what to do.

53
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,944
And I've kind of been involved in different ways ever since.

54
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:49,346
Yeah.

55
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:56,200
So, right now I'm on the public education team, and I'm the lead for the Medford local team.

56
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,388
And just to kind of talk about what mom does, there's a few things mom does.

57
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:06,874
They focus on, mom's main action focus is on legislative advocacy.

58
00:04:06,894 --> 00:04:07,915
So the goal is kind of

59
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:24,203
how to help pass gun sense legislation locally and nationally, how to elect what we call gun sense candidates, so candidates who are committed to working on and promoting legislation around preventing gun violence.

60
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:40,305
And a big part of long man mentioned a lot of what we've been doing at Medford is public education around around procure storage of guns and how that can actually stay live and around how to have conversations in general about guns and gun safety.

61
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:43,707
So mom's working on public education specifically around

62
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:56,381
secure storage of firearms, red flag log, which we do have one in Massachusetts, and how to just normalize the conversation, talking about guns and the reality of guns.

63
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:00,546
And I'll talk more about that with this specific program called Be Smart.

64
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:03,707
which is a public education program.

65
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:09,189
And then the other thing the management does is partnering with community organizations.

66
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:19,812
There's a lot of great organizations that already do violence prevention in communities and a big part of it is trying to amplify those voices and help them get grants and work together.

67
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:36,774
Yeah, can you speak a little bit about who are your stakeholders and partners and maybe how you've come to build those relationships and what the sort of interaction looks like a big part of what moms does is partnering with community organizations and advocating for funding.

68
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:44,598
Past legislative cycle, we lost demand action was successful in helping to advocate.

69
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:55,125
There was two programs in particular that received increased funding, a safe and successful youth initiative program and an employment for youth at risk.

70
00:05:55,825 --> 00:06:03,408
And these are programs that identify and invest in young people at the highest risk of being involved in violence and providing network support.

71
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:16,214
So it's not only looking at gun violence around guns, actual guns, but how to support communities that are the most negatively impacted, disproportionately impacted by gun violence too.

72
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:20,603
I guess I have a two part question.

73
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:32,000
Maybe I think while you're speaking, I'm wondering about how the organization discusses like the culture of violence or the reasons for sort of under the.

74
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:37,947
systemic reasons, I think for a lot of better word of why violence is touching families.

75
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:43,653
And then I appreciate it earlier, you mentioned that one of the largest portions of the work is really education based.

76
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:49,080
And I was just wondering, like, is that happening with adult spaces, admin schools, community spaces?

77
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:49,540
Yeah.

78
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,362
So all of the above, you know, thank you.

79
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:52,664
I know they're big questions.

80
00:06:52,984 --> 00:07:05,279
Yeah, well, just to speak to, you know, which I haven't said yet, it's just the kind of really alarming statistics around gun violence in the United States, which I think we feel, as we all know, but when you hear them, they're pretty shocking.

81
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,946
So, as of 2020, guns are now the leading cause of death in children and teens.

82
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:15,257
That's new before there had been a real accident.

83
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:17,518
So, you know, that's in itself huge.

84
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,679
It's the number one killer of children and teens.

85
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:27,142
And in the United States, we average 110 to 115 firearm-related deaths per day.

86
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:32,244
So another way of saying that is that in 2020, someone was killed with a gun every 12 minutes.

87
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:50,712
crisis very overwhelming crisis right it's huge and for every fire alarm related death there's actually two to three times the number of injury sure and you know the other thing is there are more gun belts there than ever there was a third

88
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,984
in buying guns with the pandemic, both nationally and actually in Massachusetts.

89
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:59,046
And that started in 2020 and it continued into 2021.

90
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:00,867
In Massachusetts, more than 275,000 guns were sold in 2020 and 2021.

91
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:02,348
That was a 25% increase.

92
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:02,428
Wow.

93
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,789
Compared to the year before the pandemic.

94
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:18,139
And, you know, like we said, gun violence disproportionately impacts communities of color in Massachusetts.

95
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,924
Black children and teens are eight times more likely to die by guns in Massachusetts than their white peers.

96
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:30,421
And actually in Massachusetts, the majority of our gun deaths are suicide.

97
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:33,983
56% of gun deaths are suicide.

98
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:36,946
So that's a huge issue for us here.

99
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:44,072
And just the cost of firearm injuries, it costs our state $1.8 billion every year, and $92.2 million of that is paid by taxpayers.

100
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:58,927
So this information, just for people to know, Everytown for Gun Safety, which is kind of the umbrella organization that Mom's been part of, has all of these facts on every state.

101
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:03,692
So if you go to their website, everytown.org, you can find all this information.

102
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:06,015
But it's pretty, it's pretty shocking.

103
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:09,519
It's such a part of our lives here.

104
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:35,161
Yeah, to that point, what are your thoughts on sort of, I don't know if desensitize is a correct way to say this, but like when we hear about sort of larger violent episodes, folks are in their feelings for a day or two and then general life comes back and how to, what are your thoughts on like sort of getting past that space and having people be able to buy into supporting the cause?

105
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:35,981
Yeah.

106
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:37,242
You know, it's hard because

107
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,782
Those are the, a lot of times those events like a mass shooting or school shooting are what gets people involved.

108
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:47,322
And moms do not actually, and we're happy for that.

109
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:49,763
You know, we're happy to have people come be involved.

110
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:55,745
Of course, we're not happy about the shooting, but the reality is that's about 1% of gun deaths in the United States.

111
00:09:55,785 --> 00:10:03,067
You know, people are dying more often from suicide, from unintentional gun deaths, from homicide.

112
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:04,247
And so, yeah, our,

113
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:19,256
What I like about mom demand action is that we're always there, you know, like every it's every day and when people like something happens and people want to come join their welcome and there's people who are just every day committed to doing this work.

114
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:20,177
yeah I mean so.

115
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:31,807
And so, honestly, I love this Shannon Watts sort of conversation because when Sandy Hook happened, I thought to myself, we're losing first graders at Christmas and we're not seeing change.

116
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:33,688
Then does change really come?

117
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:36,150
Like the NRA feeling is such an incredible monolith.

118
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:42,335
So the energy that it takes to sort of continue to shift the culture on this must be monumental.

119
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:42,655
Yeah.

120
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:43,335
And the commitment.

121
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:44,576
Yes.

122
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:52,842
And, you know, having this, this national legislation, you know, that's passed around gun violence was huge.

123
00:10:53,062 --> 00:11:03,830
You know, it wasn't everything that everybody wanted, but the fact that it kind of ended this log jam of years and years of, they're not seeing any ability to do this on a national level.

124
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,353
So, you know, Shayna wants to kind of say that it's like drops of water on a rock.

125
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:13,458
you know, that eventually creates a canyon, but it takes a really long time.

126
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:13,818
Yeah.

127
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,885
And, you know, what mom demand action is just kind of step by step on all levels.

128
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:27,633
So in Medford, that's kind of what we've been focusing on is like, you know, we, instead of

129
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,442
sometimes it can feel hopeless when you're waiting for there to be big change.

130
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:49,468
And one thing that has been really helpful to me in working with Mom In Action locally is there are things we can do right now in our own communities to prevent gun violence, to prevent deaths from guns.

131
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,670
And so that is what we've been working on.

132
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,491
And we've done a lot.

133
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:56,632
A big part of that is public education.

134
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:56,692
So

135
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:16,218
moms demand action have a program called be smart it's called be smart if you go to be smart for kids.org and this is like this wonderful really I think anybody can get behind once they learn about it program that

136
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:29,569
is a framework for how to have conversations and help parents and adults manalize the conversations about gun safety and to take responsible actions to prevent child's gun deaths and injuries.

137
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:30,870
This is for adults.

138
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,732
It's not to educate children about guns.

139
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:38,856
It's about the idea that adults are responsible for keeping kids safe.

140
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,659
And it's for gun owners and non-gun owners alike.

141
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,161
It's all about, number one, secure storage.

142
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:54,704
Massachusetts actually has very great, strict, strong, secure storage laws around how firearms have to be stored.

143
00:12:54,904 --> 00:13:00,626
And so part of it is just making the public aware of their legal obligations around gun storage.

144
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,488
And also, how do we have conversations about guns?

145
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:09,370
How do you ask when your kids are going to a play date to somebody's house?

146
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,030
Sure.

147
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:12,059
Do you own firearms?

148
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,803
Do you own guns?

149
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:13,829
And if you do, how are they?

150
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:28,822
I know that if you're not, and that there are more guns, I think, out there than people really realize.

151
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:41,209
And the great thing about Be Smart is it has examples of how to have these conversations, like how to, when you're asking about, you know, when your kids go into somebody's house, do you have a pool?

152
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:42,249
Do you have pet?

153
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:44,670
You know, are there limits on screen time?

154
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:46,031
Is there going to be an adult there?

155
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:47,452
You also ask.

156
00:13:47,952 --> 00:14:00,186
You know, do you own a firearm and if you do how is it stored and my experience in doing that personally if people are always receptive to this question and are grateful that it's being asked.

157
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:03,707
And if they're not, I would want to know that.

158
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:14,129
I would want to know, you know, if somebody did own a gun and they didn't really want to tell me how it was stored, I think I would want to move the play dates to a park or have them at our house.

159
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:29,872
So a big part of this is how do we in Medford just start having this conversation a little more and get people thinking about that and get reminding the gun owners that are in Medford around about the life-saving impact of secure storage.

160
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:39,561
So your beautiful segways, when you interacted with Medford, I was wondering what the reception to something like Be Smart has been in Medford.

161
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:49,231
And if, if moms has a culture of sort of saying like, this is who we are, this is what we're doing, or is there more of like a best fit discussion with cities and towns right now?

162
00:14:50,493 --> 00:15:00,586
It's the, you know, the beef program is actually almost universally well received because the message is, we all want kids to grow up healthy and safe.

163
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:01,207
Right.

164
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:06,334
And so whether you're gun owner or not, you agree with that, you know, nobody wants kids to be

165
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:09,977
killed, unintentionally killed or injured by a gun.

166
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:14,480
Especially gun owners, I think they don't want their gun to be the one that is going to hurt somebody.

167
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,583
So we've had a great response.

168
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:31,613
We have, just to speak to Medford specifically, we have met with the mayor and we have met with the police chief, Chief Buckley, and they are both very supportive of this idea as a public safety and have been supportive of us spreading this message.

169
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:45,442
Um, we've tables, so we've had a be smart table with information at the Medford farming market, at the MSN family concerts, the national night out that the police department did.

170
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:47,183
We had a table there.

171
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:55,948
And so people in general, the most people are, especially the parents are saying, Oh my gosh, they never thought of that.

172
00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:58,230
Like, yes, I want to ask about that.

173
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,172
And we've had conversations with gun owners, many of them who are

174
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,943
supportive and appreciative of the secure storage laws and the reminders of them.

175
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:16,367
And we've had conversations with people who are thinking about buying guns, and that's really helpful to just give them information about how important secure storage is.

176
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:21,029
And also that Massachusetts has pretty strict laws around secure storage.

177
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:26,151
So it's been a really great experience.

178
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:29,033
And another exciting thing that's happening is

179
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:40,636
One thing that Moms Demand Action has worked towards in many communities across the country and in Massachusetts is passing what's called the secure storage notification resolution.

180
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:46,818
And this is something that directs the school administration to inform parents

181
00:16:47,078 --> 00:17:12,396
caregivers and the broader school community on a regular basis so nearly about the life-saving effects of secure firearm storage and parents legal responsibilities to follow Massachusetts secure firearm storage laws and just raising awareness like this is one of the evidence-based solutions to prevent school shootings and other tragedies so this is really an idea that the school administration is in a

182
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:20,681
perfect position to give information to parents about this public health issue, just like they do other public health issues, right?

183
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:31,767
Our kids get information about fire safety and mental health and, you know, given that guns are now the number one cause of death for children and teens, this is really important too.

184
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:42,333
And so this is something I've been working on with other Medford Moms Demand Action volunteers over the past year, in particular with Melanie McLaughlin, who is a school committee member,

185
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:48,757
And on Monday, September 12th, Melanie put forward a motion for them to vote on this.

186
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:50,859
So number one, I want to invite people.

187
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,260
I don't know if this is going to air.

188
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,503
We'll put it out before then, but we'll be able to look out for that.

189
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:56,743
Yeah.

190
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:57,724
Yeah.

191
00:17:57,784 --> 00:18:00,566
So hopefully my, our hope is that this will pass.

192
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:05,290
We did a presentation about this for some school committee members and they were very supportive.

193
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:11,774
You know, when you see the statistics around this and how secure storage can actually save lives.

194
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:18,480
It's really kind of a no-brainer that we would want our community, our families to have this information.

195
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,203
And so we're really hopeful that that's going to pass.

196
00:18:22,423 --> 00:18:30,429
You know, the secure storage is obviously helpful in preventing unintentional deaths.

197
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:41,137
80% of school shootings, the person who, the person who committed the school shooting got the gun or the firearm from a family member or friend.

198
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:46,141
So that, you know, secure storage could have helped with that.

199
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:53,406
And then across suicide attempt, all suicide attempts without a gun, only 4% actually involved in death.

200
00:18:53,726 --> 00:18:56,088
But when a gun is involved, it's 90%.

201
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:00,971
So just a huge faster in the lethality around suicide.

202
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,794
So, you know, preventing access from that, from kids, especially

203
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:10,616
kids and contorium culture, you know, it's so it's life saving.

204
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,096
It's really important.

205
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:12,876
Yeah.

206
00:19:13,156 --> 00:19:13,396
Yeah.

207
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:27,919
And I think you you make some great points about how I think that we talked a little bit earlier about, like, kind of the helplessness around gun violence and that, like when we hear about a school shooting and it makes it sounds like there are some great action steps that that you all are taking.

208
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:34,080
And I wonder if you could share how other folks who might not already be involved in moms could get involved.

209
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:36,694
Yes, we would love this.

210
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:43,159
So mom is always welcoming new members, anyone can join at any time.

211
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,701
And there's a lot of ways to get involved.

212
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:54,428
So number one, if anyone wants to just join Moms Demand Action, you can just text the number, text the word join to 64433.

213
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:03,554
and then you'll be sent, they'll text you back with a link and you can join.

214
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:11,260
You can also go to momdemandaction.org and there's a way to click take action and you can join.

215
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,905
So that's a great way to just get to kind of connect with moms and then you'll be in the ID.

216
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:28,031
you'll join nationally but then the Massachusetts chapter is notified when people join and so you'll get information.

217
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:34,755
You can be texted when there's an action you can take and then you can also learn about your local group.

218
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:37,097
So we do have a local group in Medford

219
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:41,579
And we are always welcoming new members.

220
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:47,561
We've had a lot of people joining, especially since what happened to the Ocean Union Wild Day.

221
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:52,884
There was obviously a lot of interest and a lot of people joined our group, which has been great.

222
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:59,268
We are going to have a membership meeting on October 16th at 3.30 in Edsford.

223
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:01,710
Hopefully we'll have it outdoors where they're permitting.

224
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:07,975
And this is a great opportunity to kind of come and get a feel for what a meeting is like.

225
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:14,982
Usually we try to have a speaker, someone who can speak to either being a survivor of gun violence,

226
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,106
or just somebody who has particular knowledge about it.

227
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:23,334
And we also like to try to take action at a meeting, doing something specific.

228
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:29,643
It's election season, so there's going to be a lot people can help with if moms demand action around elections.

229
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:38,247
And one of the great things about MOMS that I found being a member for years is that you can be as involved as you want.

230
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:40,488
You know, you can just do a little thing here or there.

231
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:43,349
You could volunteer to send out some text.

232
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:45,230
You could volunteer to do postcarding.

233
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:53,317
all the way up to, you know, being a local group leader or being on one of the teams, like a public education team or the legislative team.

234
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,759
There's something for everybody.

235
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,362
So I would say if anybody's a little bit interested to just join.

236
00:21:58,382 --> 00:22:05,069
And it's been great in Medford particularly, because I get to know a lot of other people and make connections and

237
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:12,732
We have a leadership team we formed, so myself and four other people who have taken our leadership roles, and you know, we've done a lot.

238
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,253
So it's been a really good experience, so I'd encourage anyone to join.

239
00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:34,420
And if people want to join our Medford team specifically, they can email me at erindowd, so E-R-I-N-D-O-W-D dot M-A at Gmail, and I can give them all the information about our team and our meetings.

240
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,523
Thanks, and thanks for like making yourself so accessible for as a resource for all of this.

241
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:45,127
I do have one question, one more that like I'm wondering like if there's been a highlight for you.

242
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:47,789
So I feel like this could be kind of like heavy work to do.

243
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:52,233
I wonder like, yeah, has there been like a highlight for you or something that kind of like keeps you hooked?

244
00:22:53,754 --> 00:22:54,835
Yeah.

245
00:22:56,796 --> 00:22:57,517
You know, I think the

246
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:07,720
The gains we've been able to make in Medford, we've met with the police chief, like I said, and the mayor.

247
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:22,293
We have actually started to work on having a partnership with the Department of Health in Medford around how do we promote secure storage and how do we normalize the conversation around gun safety as part of public health

248
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:25,794
in Medford and everyone has been receptive.

249
00:23:25,975 --> 00:23:31,317
You know, we really haven't had anybody who has been negative or given us a hard time.

250
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:34,378
You know, what we're talking about is not radical.

251
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:41,121
We're just congesting and, you know, providing the evidence that there are things that we can do right now that are saving lives.

252
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:48,685
And I think those of us committed feel like if we can save the life of one person, you know, especially one child,

253
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:52,248
through this work, we have the obligation to do it.

254
00:23:52,909 --> 00:24:04,081
And these are numbers that we're actually not going to see, you know, like, we don't know that, we're not going to know that somebody's securely storing their firearm, you know, prevented an unintentional death, but that's okay.

255
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,903
Like, I believe that it's happening.

256
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:24,448
And so I think every time that we do a table or we do a presentation and people are so receptive, people really appreciate the work, they start thinking about it in a way that maybe they hadn't before, especially non-gun owners.

257
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:28,229
You know, to me, that's really fulfilling and it kind of keeps me going.

258
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:30,290
Thank you.

259
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,260
Yeah.

260
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,504
So is there anything that we haven't asked that you think, you know, people might want to know about before we wrap up today?

261
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:55,837
I would say for people, especially in this, especially in this election season, if people are interested in finding out candidates stance around gun violence and supporting legislation to prevent gun violence, Moms Demand Connection has kind of credential they'll give

262
00:24:56,397 --> 00:25:04,480
some candidates called a Gun Sense Candidate, which basically means that they are supporting legislation or want to act to prevent gun violence.

263
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:12,622
So there's a website called GunSenseVoter.org, which is a good resource for people to check and see, you know, before they vote.

264
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:20,365
And that's another, it's another benefit of being a member of Bomb Command Action is you can, and especially here,

265
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:27,614
that kind of information that they'll make sure that the members know who is the gun sense candidate and who isn't.

266
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,916
So that's been really helpful.

267
00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:31,019
And I think that's it.

268
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,080
Well, thank you so much.

269
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,703
I think thanks for all your time.

270
00:25:34,023 --> 00:25:36,306
And this was, this was like really helpful for me, I think.

271
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:55,119
I remember hearing a question I think at the pediatrician like bringing up that point about like asking about families if they you know if they own guns and all those things and that that really surprised me it was something that like was a little bit scary so I appreciate all the context and that that's something that you know a basic part of the education that you're talking about.

272
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:58,221
Yeah it's something we can all do and I love the idea that

273
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:07,323
if it's parents in Medford, if we're all kind of decided we're going to do that, but maybe it won't feel so awkward or weird to ask these questions.

274
00:26:07,543 --> 00:26:14,125
I just did it the other day at a play date and the parent was really receptive to it, you know, and appreciated me asking.

275
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:23,887
So I think it can feel a little odd at first, but once we start doing it and use these resources like the Be Smart for Kids, then I think it's something that

276
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:29,694
will feel left out and can kind of just be part of the normal conversation.

277
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,136
Yeah.

278
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:33,719
Thank you so much, Erin.

279
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,181
It was really good to be here.

280
00:26:35,622 --> 00:26:35,962
Yeah.

281
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,103
Thank you.

282
00:26:37,224 --> 00:26:38,005
Thanks a lot.

283
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:38,966
Thank you.
