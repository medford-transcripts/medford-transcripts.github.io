    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=27.228s">Councilor</a>  Tsengeed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=28.289s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=30.207s">present</a>  six present one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=31.627s">The</a>  meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=33.388s">There</a>  will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=35.61s">The</a>  whole at six p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=36.63s">in</a>  the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts and via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=43.314s">The</a>  action and discussion item for today is <a href="../resolutions/24-045.pdf"><font color="green">24-045</font></a> Annual Budget Process for Fiscal 25 Preliminary Budget Meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=51.519s">And</a>  we, I'll just go over the calendar again for the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=56.102s">We</a>  are following the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=59.284s">soon</a>  to be finalized budget ordinance which is eligible for third reading on April 30th but we have agreed to implement it already which is great and that started with individual budget recommendations submitted by councillors to the council by March 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=74.991s">The</a>  council submitted a collective budget recommendation to the mayor by March 22nd <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=79.133s">And</a>  now we are in the April 15th to May 15th, 2024, where we are holding preliminary budget meetings with department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=86.44s">Tonight</a>  we have the Council on Aging, Medford Community Media, and our Veterans Services Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=92.667s">And</a>  this is our first ever preliminary budget meeting under the new budget ordinance, so I'm excited for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=97.992s">I</a>  hope everyone's excited as I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=101.475s">But</a>  I think really just to go into that for a minute, I again want to thank the administration for this new process that we're working under. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=109.522s">The</a>  idea of these meetings is to hear from departments what they've requested before we get the budget so we can have some discussion, some input, hear what departments are thinking and wanting, and then obviously understanding what our fiscal limits are with what we're actually able to fund at the end of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=127.177s">We'll</a>  get the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=128.788s">see</a>  what the differences are, be able to come back and invite departments back if they need to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=134.094s">The</a>  mayor can invite, the council can invite after the budget is submitted, so that would be in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=140.836s">If</a>  what you present here today is what ends up in the budget proposal in June, then I'm guessing we're probably good to go and we'll have one meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=147.559s">Of</a>  course, if you want to come back, or if the mayor wants you to come back, or we do just for fun, maybe we'll invite you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=152.942s">But</a>  that's really the scope of the meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=158.404s">And</a>  we also received, thank you, Madam Chief of Staff for the budget to actuals up through quarter two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=165.648s">and</a>  some other materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=166.75s">And</a>  then next Tuesday, we'll be meeting with the finance director talking about the legislative clerk and finance department budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=173.679s">And</a>  we will also be talking about a general top line presentation of the city budget for fiscal 25, which I think will be <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=183.411s">Good,</a>  good to get going on sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=185.734s">We</a>  all have been talking about for over a year now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=188.397s">And</a>  really, since I've been on the council, the difficult type budgets that we've had this year, we have the fiscal cliff of the federal funding from ARPA and ESSER that are no longer going to be available to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=200.29s">It</a>  is going to be an important budget season, and I'm glad that we are moving ahead with the process as we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=205.913s">So</a>  with that, I will go to the Chief of Staff, if you want to say anything up front, since this is just our first meeting, if there's anything else you want to add, and then we can go through in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=218.038s">We'll</a>  go with Council on Aging, and then Medford Community Media, and then Veterans Services. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=222.12s">And</a>  I'll ask a few questions, and then Councilors will be able to ask some questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=226.308s">we're</a>  going to have a meeting with the city council after a presentation.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=228.35s">So</a>  when I'm chief of staff, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=229.911s">President</a>  Bears and members of the committee, the whole City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=233.515s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=234.456s">This</a>  is an exciting time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=235.857s">I'm</a>  I think we all feel very positively, and it's a great opportunity to have initial budget discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=242.823s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=243.924s">As</a>  you know, we have three budgets here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=245.546s">Three</a>  departments here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=246.346s">Three</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=251.451s">based</a>  on this process moving earlier than it has in the past, meaning these meetings occurring earlier, we are actually still in the formulation of the budget, as one can imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=261.238s">Normally</a>  we would be formulating the budget and then submitting it, as President Bears alluded to, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=268.423s">As</a>  we did last year, one of the first earliest budgets that was submitted to the mayor's recollection on May 31st, but we're even going as fast as possible, and we're here before the council tonight to discuss three budgets and then, as President Bears said, a couple more budgets next week and even more after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=287.341s">As</a>  we have many dates scheduled, so we're very excited, but I. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=291.605s">admit</a>  at this time we're still formulating and which means we're still going through a process to determine how to close a budget gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=298.949s">We've</a>  been working through that budget gap for the last few days, essentially, and we feel like we're in a decent place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=307.434s">We,</a>  I will say from the outset, we didn't really provide any major limitations to any department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=312.456s">There</a>  really, really was a <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=314.137s">short</a>  of do not send us your wish list, there was no limitations placed on department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=319.48s">So,</a>  you know, everyone submitted their budgets as they needed, which with ARPA, you know, coming to a close December 31st for things that are not contracted and for things that are operational that are staff in particular, when I say operational, I really mean staff, that's coming to an end December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=341.15s">And</a>  so with all those things into consideration, we are in a very good place, all things considered, because there is a large cliff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=349.935s">We</a>  want to invest more into the various areas that the council has provided as guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=356.379s">The</a>  reality of that may be somewhat challenging, but we are <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=362.222s">where</a>  we kind of hoped we'd be at this stage considering where we were a number of years ago in terms of reliance on one time funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=370.75s">So</a>  we're definitely almost if not completely off of those one time funds in a good place, working to close the budget gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=378.677s">I</a>  think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=380.307s">I</a>  think it's reachable, but we just have to continue to work through the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=384.229s">So</a>  we don't have a high-level presentation for the council tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=386.811s">As</a>  President Bears said, that high-level presentation would be on Tuesday of next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=390.693s">We</a>  look forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=392.094s">And</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=393.535s">Are</a>  there any specific questions for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=395.136s">I'm</a>  happy to answer them.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=395.897s">Any</a>  questions at this time, or do we want to hear from the departments?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=403.134s">Councilor</a>  say not a question, but I just wanted to thank you for being here to thank the administration for working with us on the new budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=410.578s">I</a>  think. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=411.919s">I,</a>  as one Councilor, I'm very excited that we're getting to such an early start. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=416.621s">I</a>  think it really helps us city to know what our. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=420.623s">what</a>  our reality is quite early on, and also to know what our department's looking for, what can we actually afford as a city to have those discussions early on to lay the groundwork of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=431.994s">So</a>  thank you very much, and I'm very much looking forward to these discussions.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=436.859s">Likewise,</a>  thank you on our behalf as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=438.961s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=440.422s">Any</a>  further comments, questions by the council before we move to our first department? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=447.421s">Seeing</a>  none, we will go to the Council on Aging, Director Kelly, and, you know, basically just some standard questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=456.387s">You've</a>  done this before, so you get to model it for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=459.409s">We'd</a>  love to hear just what was your budget request for the year, and then kind of anything you want to share narrative-wise about your year as a department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=469.676s">And</a>  then I'll ask a couple more follow-up questions, and then we can go to questions from the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=474.359s">So,</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=475.959s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=476.539s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=477.98s">Thank</a>  you for having me here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=480.082s">And</a>  yes, this isn't my first rodeo, but I'm very happy to meet all the new Councilors here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=487.166s">My</a>  name is Pam Kelly, I'm the director at the Council on Aging, and we are requesting a complete municipal budget this year of $275,226.79. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=502.336s">This</a>  covers primarily our staff payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=508.714s">Too</a>  close. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=510.32s">and</a>  then our ordinary expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=513.661s">So</a>  we did have a slight increase from FY 24 due to the increase for the clerical union, an increase in the RICO contract and updated office equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=530.527s">Other</a>  than that, our budget has been pretty much level funded the past couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=537.987s">We</a>  do a newsletter every month that shows all of the different programs, activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=543.354s">Many</a>  of you have been to the senior center and see all of the different programs, activities that we do on a daily basis and all of the seniors that come to the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=557.251s">Based</a>  on the 2020 federal census, there's 12,766 people age 60 years of age and older in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=568.135s">We</a>  have one of the largest senior populations in the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=573.698s">Granted,</a>  I don't see that many people coming into the center on any given basis, because we'd still here to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=582.201s">I'm</a>  not going there, that's for old people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=585.002s">So</a>  one of our... <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=587.33s">goals</a>  over the next few years is to reach those younger seniors because we all age every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=593.017s">And</a>  we want to make sure they know of the resources and information that we have to offer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=599.645s">We</a>  don't want them to wait for a crisis, we want them to be involved earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=606.064s">I</a>  believe you all seen our narrative of things that we're going to be doing over the next year, and I will present to you our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=615.03s">And</a>  now, if you have any questions for me, that I will be happy to answer.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=619.053s">We</a>  haven't seen the narrative yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=620.333s">Oh,</a>  you haven't? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=621.174s">I</a>  do apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=622.235s">No,</a>  that's if you want to read us through it, maybe an advanced copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=627.558s">This</a>  is our first one, so now we have some comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=630.42s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=637.983s">I'll</a>  read you a quick description. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=640.844s">Some</a>  of our highlights for fiscal year 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=642.785s">We</a>  served 33,769 duplicated participants at the senior center over 191 days that we were open. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=649.128s">On</a>  average, the senior center is averaging 177 people per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=662.498s">Nutrition</a>  was the focus for fiscal year 24, with 1,347 older adults receiving bags of groceries during a nine month period. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=674.628s">We</a>  have the food pantry twice a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=677.651s">which</a>  is for Medford seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=679.394s">There's</a>  no other requirement, just that they are a Medford senior and that they do have our participant card. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=688.105s">So</a>  we are able to check who's there and to keep these numbers for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=693.939s">We</a>  also had 315 filled bags of groceries donated by Tufts Health, Melrose-Wakefield Outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=701.864s">We</a>  dispersed 65 farmer's market coupons valued at $65 each to, again, Medford senior eligible residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=711.349s">We've</a>  distributed 200 stop and shop gift cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=716.05s">I'm</a>  working with Mystic Valley elder services who received a $25,000 grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=721.318s">I'm</a>  sorry, opera grant to assist Medford older adults with nutrition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=727.433s">Senior</a>  produce via Medford Farmers Market did a home delivered of 30 bags a week for 10 weeks to Medford seniors who wanted to participate in that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=740.299s">We</a>  also wrote a Tufts community grant for $3,000 that was just for nutrition, again to help the seniors that come to the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=749.764s">We</a>  received food donations from Medford Rotary, the Medford Police, Medford Boys Soccer Group, and other business partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=757.069s">That's</a>  all in just one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=760.171s">We</a>  are continuing to increase and promote activities and programs, as well as provide information to the public in a variety of ways, including more of a presence on the social media platforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=774.053s">We</a>  had a multi-partner senior scan presentation, provided much needed resources and information to the most vulnerable in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=783.638s">We're</a>  looking to have that again this coming September. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=787.881s">Our</a>  social worker, who's new, she started last March, has been outreaching more and showing more of a presence in the city to homebound seniors and to many of the senior housing buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=801.883s">Our</a>  goals for the future is to expand our initiatives in an even more organized and planned way to achieve identified marketing strategies that will not only promote the senior center, but assist in developing growth through new membership and participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=818.13s">We</a>  also want to continue the opportunities to research and write grants to expand our financial goals, continue our collaboration with other city departments, organizations, and business partners to create opportunities for our participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=833.223s">We</a>  want to collaborate with peers in the industry to see where the future is going for the next generation of older adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=841.42s">One</a>  of our goals for hopefully this summer is to outreach by taking our van on the road to different areas of Medford to connect to older adults in the community who do not come to the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=852.844s">So</a>  we're gonna go to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=855.131s">We</a>  want to create and distribute a new survey for residents 60 and older and research the unmet needs of our target audience and to create the means to assist with those needs that they survey back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=868.836s">Our</a>  goal is to reframe aging to be about the journey and not the destination. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=877.72s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
