16
00:00:31,627 --> 00:00:33,088
[SPEAKER_05]: The meeting is called to order.

17
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:35,590
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee.

18
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,570
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole at six p.m.

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,074
[SPEAKER_05]: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts and via Zoom.

20
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:50,559
[SPEAKER_05]: The action and discussion item for today is 24-045 Annual Budget Process for Fiscal 25 Preliminary Budget Meeting.

21
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:56,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And we, I'll just go over the calendar again for the budget process.

22
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:58,223
[SPEAKER_05]: We are following the

23
00:00:59,284 --> 00:01:14,611
[SPEAKER_05]: soon to be finalized budget ordinance which is eligible for third reading on April 30th but we have agreed to implement it already which is great and that started with individual budget recommendations submitted by councillors to the council by March 1st.

24
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,033
[SPEAKER_05]: The council submitted a collective budget recommendation to the mayor by March 22nd

25
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:25,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we are in the April 15th to May 15th, 2024, where we are holding preliminary budget meetings with department heads.

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight we have the Council on Aging, Medford Community Media, and our Veterans Services Department.

27
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:37,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is our first ever preliminary budget meeting under the new budget ordinance, so I'm excited for it.

28
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:39,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope everyone's excited as I am.

29
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:49,502
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think really just to go into that for a minute, I again want to thank the administration for this new process that we're working under.

30
00:01:49,522 --> 00:02:06,957
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea of these meetings is to hear from departments what they've requested before we get the budget so we can have some discussion, some input, hear what departments are thinking and wanting, and then obviously understanding what our fiscal limits are with what we're actually able to fund at the end of the process.

31
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:07,918
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get the budget.

32
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:14,034
[SPEAKER_05]: see what the differences are, be able to come back and invite departments back if they need to come back.

33
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:19,241
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor can invite, the council can invite after the budget is submitted, so that would be in June.

34
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:27,079
[SPEAKER_05]: If what you present here today is what ends up in the budget proposal in June, then I'm guessing we're probably good to go and we'll have one meeting.

35
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:32,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, if you want to come back, or if the mayor wants you to come back, or we do just for fun, maybe we'll invite you.

36
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:37,864
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's really the scope of the meeting tonight.

37
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:44,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also received, thank you, Madam Chief of Staff for the budget to actuals up through quarter two.

38
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:46,650
[SPEAKER_05]: and some other materials.

39
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And then next Tuesday, we'll be meeting with the finance director talking about the legislative clerk and finance department budgets.

40
00:02:53,679 --> 00:03:02,550
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will also be talking about a general top line presentation of the city budget for fiscal 25, which I think will be

41
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:05,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, good to get going on sooner than later.

42
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:08,317
[SPEAKER_05]: We all have been talking about for over a year now.

43
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:19,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, since I've been on the council, the difficult type budgets that we've had this year, we have the fiscal cliff of the federal funding from ARPA and ESSER that are no longer going to be available to the city.

44
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,773
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to be an important budget season, and I'm glad that we are moving ahead with the process as we are.

45
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:37,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, I will go to the Chief of Staff, if you want to say anything up front, since this is just our first meeting, if there's anything else you want to add, and then we can go through in order.

46
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:41,800
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go with Council on Aging, and then Medford Community Media, and then Veterans Services.

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll ask a few questions, and then Councilors will be able to ask some questions as well.

48
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:48,330
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to have a meeting with the city council after a presentation.

49
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,871
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I'm chief of staff, thank you very much.

50
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:52,814
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears and members of the committee, the whole City Council.

51
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:53,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

52
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:55,516
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an exciting time.

53
00:03:55,857 --> 00:04:02,022
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm I think we all feel very positively, and it's a great opportunity to have initial budget discussions.

54
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:03,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

55
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,486
[SPEAKER_12]: As you know, we have three budgets here.

56
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Three departments here.

57
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:06,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Three

58
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:20,678
[SPEAKER_12]: based on this process moving earlier than it has in the past, meaning these meetings occurring earlier, we are actually still in the formulation of the budget, as one can imagine.

59
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Normally we would be formulating the budget and then submitting it, as President Bears alluded to,

60
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:46,580
[SPEAKER_12]: As we did last year, one of the first earliest budgets that was submitted to the mayor's recollection on May 31st, but we're even going as fast as possible, and we're here before the council tonight to discuss three budgets and then, as President Bears said, a couple more budgets next week and even more after that.

61
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:50,604
[SPEAKER_12]: As we have many dates scheduled, so we're very excited, but I.

62
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:58,349
[SPEAKER_12]: admit at this time we're still formulating and which means we're still going through a process to determine how to close a budget gap.

63
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:07,253
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been working through that budget gap for the last few days, essentially, and we feel like we're in a decent place.

64
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:12,416
[SPEAKER_12]: We, I will say from the outset, we didn't really provide any major limitations to any department heads.

65
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:13,757
[SPEAKER_12]: There really, really was a

66
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:19,380
[SPEAKER_12]: short of do not send us your wish list, there was no limitations placed on department heads.

67
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:39,829
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, everyone submitted their budgets as they needed, which with ARPA, you know, coming to a close December 31st for things that are not contracted and for things that are operational that are staff in particular, when I say operational, I really mean staff, that's coming to an end December 31st.

68
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:49,755
[SPEAKER_12]: And so with all those things into consideration, we are in a very good place, all things considered, because there is a large cliff.

69
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:55,698
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to invest more into the various areas that the council has provided as guidance.

70
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:01,061
[SPEAKER_12]: The reality of that may be somewhat challenging, but we are

71
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:10,249
[SPEAKER_12]: where we kind of hoped we'd be at this stage considering where we were a number of years ago in terms of reliance on one time funds.

72
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:18,056
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're definitely almost if not completely off of those one time funds in a good place, working to close the budget gap.

73
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:19,197
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's

74
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:24,169
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's reachable, but we just have to continue to work through the numbers.

75
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:26,731
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't have a high-level presentation for the council tonight.

76
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:30,213
[SPEAKER_12]: As President Bears said, that high-level presentation would be on Tuesday of next week.

77
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:31,494
[SPEAKER_12]: We look forward to that.

78
00:06:32,094 --> 00:06:33,495
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you very much.

79
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:35,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any specific questions for me?

80
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:35,877
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy to answer them.

81
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:40,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions at this time, or do we want to hear from the departments?

82
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:50,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor say not a question, but I just wanted to thank you for being here to thank the administration for working with us on the new budget process.

83
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:50,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I think.

84
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I, as one Councilor, I'm very excited that we're getting to such an early start.

85
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:59,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it really helps us city to know what our.

86
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:11,934
[SPEAKER_09]: what our reality is quite early on, and also to know what our department's looking for, what can we actually afford as a city to have those discussions early on to lay the groundwork of transparency.

87
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:16,438
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much, and I'm very much looking forward to these discussions.

88
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:18,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Likewise, thank you on our behalf as well.

89
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:19,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

90
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:24,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further comments, questions by the council before we move to our first department?

91
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:36,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, we will go to the Council on Aging, Director Kelly, and, you know, basically just some standard questions.

92
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:39,389
[SPEAKER_05]: You've done this before, so you get to model it for everybody.

93
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:48,435
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to hear just what was your budget request for the year, and then kind of anything you want to share narrative-wise about your year as a department.

94
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:54,199
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll ask a couple more follow-up questions, and then we can go to questions from the Council.

95
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So, welcome.

96
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

97
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:56,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

98
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having me here tonight.

99
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:05,765
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, this isn't my first rodeo, but I'm very happy to meet all the new Councilors here.

100
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:15,972
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Pam Kelly, I'm the director at the Council on Aging, and we are requesting a complete municipal budget this year of $275,226.79.

101
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:27,691
[SPEAKER_06]: This covers primarily our staff payroll.

102
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:29,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Too close.

103
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,161
[SPEAKER_06]: and then our ordinary expenses.

104
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:50,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did have a slight increase from FY 24 due to the increase for the clerical union, an increase in the RICO contract and updated office equipment.

105
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:55,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, our budget has been pretty much level funded the past couple of years.

106
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:03,274
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a newsletter every month that shows all of the different programs, activities.

107
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:16,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of you have been to the senior center and see all of the different programs, activities that we do on a daily basis and all of the seniors that come to the senior center.

108
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:27,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on the 2020 federal census, there's 12,766 people age 60 years of age and older in the city of Method.

109
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:32,757
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one of the largest senior populations in the surrounding communities.

110
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:41,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, I don't see that many people coming into the center on any given basis, because we'd still here to this day.

111
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:44,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going there, that's for old people.

112
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:45,903
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of our...

113
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:52,997
[SPEAKER_06]: goals over the next few years is to reach those younger seniors because we all age every day.

114
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:59,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to make sure they know of the resources and information that we have to offer them.

115
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:03,710
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want them to wait for a crisis, we want them to be involved earlier.

116
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:14,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you all seen our narrative of things that we're going to be doing over the next year, and I will present to you our budget.

117
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, if you have any questions for me, that I will be happy to answer.

118
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,213
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't seen the narrative yet.

119
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you haven't?

120
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:22,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I do apologize.

121
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:27,538
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's if you want to read us through it, maybe an advanced copy.

122
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:30,300
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our first one, so now we have some comments.

123
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:30,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

124
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:35,242
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, I can read the narrative if you'd like.

125
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, yeah, if you want, or even a high-level summary.

126
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:40,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll read you a quick description.

127
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:42,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of our highlights for fiscal year 24.

128
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:49,048
[SPEAKER_06]: We served 33,769 duplicated participants at the senior center over 191 days that we were open.

129
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,889
[SPEAKER_06]: On average, the senior center is averaging 177 people per day.

130
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:13,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Nutrition was the focus for fiscal year 24, with 1,347 older adults receiving bags of groceries during a nine month period.

131
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:16,690
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the food pantry twice a month.

132
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,113
[SPEAKER_06]: which is for Medford seniors.

133
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:27,825
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no other requirement, just that they are a Medford senior and that they do have our participant card.

134
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:32,291
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are able to check who's there and to keep these numbers for all of us.

135
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:40,803
[SPEAKER_06]: We also had 315 filled bags of groceries donated by Tufts Health, Melrose-Wakefield Outreach.

136
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:50,368
[SPEAKER_06]: We dispersed 65 farmer's market coupons valued at $65 each to, again, Medford senior eligible residents.

137
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:54,511
[SPEAKER_06]: We've distributed 200 stop and shop gift cards.

138
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working with Mystic Valley elder services who received a $25,000 grant.

139
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:05,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, opera grant to assist Medford older adults with nutrition.

140
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:19,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Senior produce via Medford Farmers Market did a home delivered of 30 bags a week for 10 weeks to Medford seniors who wanted to participate in that program.

141
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:28,884
[SPEAKER_06]: We also wrote a Tufts community grant for $3,000 that was just for nutrition, again to help the seniors that come to the center.

142
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:36,929
[SPEAKER_06]: We received food donations from Medford Rotary, the Medford Police, Medford Boys Soccer Group, and other business partners.

143
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,450
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all in just one year.

144
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:51,619
[SPEAKER_06]: We are continuing to increase and promote activities and programs, as well as provide information to the public in a variety of ways, including more of a presence on the social media platforms.

145
00:12:54,053 --> 00:13:03,318
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a multi-partner senior scan presentation, provided much needed resources and information to the most vulnerable in the community.

146
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:06,560
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking to have that again this coming September.

147
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:19,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Our social worker, who's new, she started last March, has been outreaching more and showing more of a presence in the city to homebound seniors and to many of the senior housing buildings.

148
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:36,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Our goals for the future is to expand our initiatives in an even more organized and planned way to achieve identified marketing strategies that will not only promote the senior center, but assist in developing growth through new membership and participation.

149
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:52,342
[SPEAKER_06]: We also want to continue the opportunities to research and write grants to expand our financial goals, continue our collaboration with other city departments, organizations, and business partners to create opportunities for our participants.

150
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:59,569
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to collaborate with peers in the industry to see where the future is going for the next generation of older adults.

151
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:12,544
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our goals for hopefully this summer is to outreach by taking our van on the road to different areas of Medford to connect to older adults in the community who do not come to the center.

152
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:13,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're gonna go to them.

153
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:27,416
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to create and distribute a new survey for residents 60 and older and research the unmet needs of our target audience and to create the means to assist with those needs that they survey back on.

154
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:33,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Our goal is to reframe aging to be about the journey and not the destination.

155
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

156
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you so much.

157
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:52,934
[SPEAKER_05]: My only other questions are, were there any other programs that you didn't request this year that you might request in the future or any kind of future investments you're hoping to see from the city and the center?

158
00:14:54,274 --> 00:15:03,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, as we're growing and as the demographic is growing, I do see a need for future staff in our building.

159
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:06,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

160
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:19,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And just my only other question, and this is just for me looking at the, I know you have your position and the office manager position and the social worker position part-time in the budget.

161
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see there's a community outreach coordinator on the city website.

162
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a grant funded position?

163
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:27,861
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a state funded position.

164
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:29,062
[SPEAKER_05]: State funded position, great.

165
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:33,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And also building maintenance is also on the municipal.

166
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:35,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Great position.

167
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is the yes.

168
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:38,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

169
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:38,707
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

170
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:42,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Miss that one building maintenance as well.

171
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:51,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And my only other note, it just there's an office manager title on the city website, but then it says administrative clerk in the city budget.

172
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:55,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just wondering if there was a if there's a reason for that, or is that just technical?

173
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:57,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Her role, I think it's just more technical.

174
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:11,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Her role is more overseeing the office and we use and utilize a lot of volunteers at the center to man our reception desk, answer phones and do multiple things.

175
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:15,286
[SPEAKER_06]: So she does oversee that program.

176
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:18,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think for just

177
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:21,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it might be something we look at in the classification.

178
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:21,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

179
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:25,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe classification in the future because the role has changed.

180
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:27,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

181
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:27,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

182
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:28,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

183
00:16:28,643 --> 00:16:29,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are my questions.

184
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:31,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions or comments from members of the council?

185
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:34,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

186
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:40,897
[SPEAKER_09]: I with with Councilor Lemmy and Councilor Lazzaro a few weeks ago, we were at the Senior Center.

187
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:41,938
[SPEAKER_09]: We attended.

188
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:48,582
[SPEAKER_06]: There were so many people there for Connie Spinelli's 104th birthday.

189
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:49,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty good.

190
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:57,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Remarkable, truly remarkable with a huge turnout for the bingo game as well, which we sadly didn't win, but we got super close.

191
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:00,869
[SPEAKER_09]: We were one or one square off in the two of the matches.

192
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:09,368
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much good stuff happening at the senior center that's coming out, and really thanks to your leadership as well.

193
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:16,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there are two quick questions I had, given what you've told us today.

194
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:27,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I think on the topic of nutrition, there seems to be tons of donations coming in, tons of help from, for example, from the Greater Boston Elder Services.

195
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:31,117
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of that is coming from ARPA grants that

196
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:33,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we're running out of that money as well.

197
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:41,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was wondering, do we foresee being able to keep up with this level of food donations for the upcoming year?

198
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:50,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I do feel that we can keep up with the donations, especially, for example, during COVID.

199
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:55,646
[SPEAKER_06]: The community itself, as a whole, really stepped up and helped.

200
00:17:56,206 --> 00:18:01,770
[SPEAKER_06]: When we had to close our doors, we were able to have the

201
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:08,136
[SPEAKER_06]: food pantry filled inside the building, and then he passed the bags out the door.

202
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:11,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of times we had people from the community donating.

203
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,022
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd go to BJ's and pick up stuff.

204
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:15,823
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd go wherever.

205
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:17,405
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd give us gift cards.

206
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:17,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

207
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel that we'll have a problem.

208
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:32,262
[SPEAKER_06]: We work closely with Mystic Valley Elder Services as well, who provides the congregate meal every day, well, Monday through Friday, and the grab-and-go lunches Monday through Friday.

209
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:34,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is contracted through them.

210
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:39,988
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mystic community market is the food pantry

211
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,371
[SPEAKER_06]: provider.

212
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:45,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't believe that comes through ARPA.

213
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:45,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

214
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:51,681
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that that right there, it covers quite a bit of our programming for nutrition.

215
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:52,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

216
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:54,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I meant, I meant Mystic Valley Elder Services.

217
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:57,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, getting acronyms mixed up in my brain.

218
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:06,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that other grant that I mentioned for $25,000, that is above and beyond what we receive on a normal basis from Mystic Valley.

219
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:24,825
[SPEAKER_06]: This was an additional program that they reached out to the city of Method for, received the funding, and now they're giving it back to Medford by nutrition through Meals on Wheels, the senior center, and other multiple resources.

220
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:25,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

221
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:32,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Now with that ARPRA money going away, are those offerings staying on?

222
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that offering won't be on.

223
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:39,978
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Mystic Valley is always working on writing grants.

224
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:49,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Mystic Valley represents 11 different cities and communities, so they're always looking for additional funding to help in the communities.

225
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:50,990
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good to know.

226
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

227
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:56,634
[SPEAKER_09]: And one other question coming out of what you told us.

228
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:02,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess you said one of the goals moving forward is to expand the grant writing capacity.

229
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:05,299
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we do that?

230
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there people on your team who are working on doing that?

231
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:12,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we need eventually more staff to help that?

232
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:23,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it would be helpful in the future to have additional staff that are focused on grant writing because there are so many that we can't write possibly all of them.

233
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:27,756
[SPEAKER_06]: However, my staff assists with different grants.

234
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,158
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, the local cultural council grant.

235
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:39,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Grace, who is under the state financial payroll, writes a grant through the local cultural council and

236
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:52,458
[SPEAKER_06]: thankfully, has been successful every year in getting some funding that brings in, for example, entertainment and cultural events and programs to the senior center.

237
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So she writes that one specifically herself.

238
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:07,005
[SPEAKER_06]: We coordinated this year with myself, Grace, the volunteer outreach coordinator, and the social worker on writing a Tufts grant that is focusing on mental health this year.

239
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:11,702
[SPEAKER_06]: We wrote that maximum amount is for $3,000.

240
00:21:11,763 --> 00:21:16,932
[SPEAKER_06]: We wrote that for $3,000 and we hope to hear soon that we will be successful in that grant.

241
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:18,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Fingers crossed.

242
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:18,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

243
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:19,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

244
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:21,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Levee.

245
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:23,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

246
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:24,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

247
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:29,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also like to echo my disappointment that I didn't do better in the bingo game.

248
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:35,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Connie is 104th birthday, but I really enjoyed the cake and the company.

249
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:39,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, just a quick, just a brief question.

250
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,108
[SPEAKER_07]: If you just give us an idea of this.

251
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:46,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So you mentioned that you had a goal of increasing engagement among the senior community.

252
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:52,092
[SPEAKER_07]: in Medford, about a little over 12,000 people, you said.

253
00:21:53,073 --> 00:22:02,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you give us an idea of how many more you think you'd be able to get involved in the next five, 10 years, and what do you think it would look like?

254
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:07,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my goal is always to, any increase is better than no increase.

255
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:14,398
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, working with the demographic, people age out,

256
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:17,536
[SPEAKER_06]: and more people age in.

257
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,239
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's always up and down.

258
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:32,249
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanna just continue that role to have people know about us so that as people are aging out, we have people to fill that spot.

259
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:35,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

260
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:40,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

261
00:22:41,564 --> 00:22:42,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Burris.

262
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:43,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for being here.

263
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:43,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

264
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:46,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I always appreciate your presentations come budget time.

265
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:51,794
[SPEAKER_04]: My fellow Councilors have covered a lot of my questions at this point, which are pretty basic.

266
00:22:51,854 --> 00:22:58,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I know your department's budget is pretty straightforward, and this is pretty early in budget season, so it's great to be having the conversation now.

267
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:03,485
[SPEAKER_04]: But just want to take a moment to recognize you for the hard work that you and your department do.

268
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:08,888
[SPEAKER_04]: All year, we know that senior centers institutionally wear so many hats.

269
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:10,189
[SPEAKER_04]: You're providing basic services.

270
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:11,890
[SPEAKER_04]: You're also providing fun and community.

271
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,153
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of balls to keep in the air and on a pretty tight budget as well.

272
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:19,074
[SPEAKER_04]: So just thank you so much for your resourcefulness and for all that you provide.

273
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:20,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

274
00:23:20,235 --> 00:23:26,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that this council can remain supportive as senior centers programming and offerings continue to grow.

275
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

276
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:28,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

277
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've seen no other hands raised.

278
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:48,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'll try to summarize, but basically it looks like about an $8,000 increase from fiscal 24 to fiscal 25, and it's all in your fixed costs of the union contract and some equipment costs that went up.

279
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

280
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

281
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:56,494
[SPEAKER_05]: and all the other amazing things that you're doing as well, but we'll just boil it down to the brass tacks for the budget meeting.

282
00:23:56,514 --> 00:24:01,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so at this point, thank you so much for the presentation.

283
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:02,098
[SPEAKER_05]: We love all the work you do.

284
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:05,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, feel free to engage us any time of year in any way that we can be helpful.

285
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:14,847
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's ever anyone we want to recognize, if you want to pass along all the 100th birthdays for us to put on for commemorative resolutions, we're happy to do that.

286
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:15,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

287
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:31,154
[SPEAKER_05]: We will await to see the budget presentation and I'm guessing that if it's 275, 226, 79, then we're going to be all set and ready to we won't have to have you have you back to do another run through the through the machine.

288
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:33,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're hoping for that.

289
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:35,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you so much for everything that you guys do.

290
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:36,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

291
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:39,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And I welcome you all to stop by the senior center at any time.

292
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:47,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're all getting our newsletter every month so that you see the activities that go on in parties.

293
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,161
[SPEAKER_06]: We welcome you to come by.

294
00:24:49,602 --> 00:24:49,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

295
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:50,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

296
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:51,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

297
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:51,984
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

298
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:55,428
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

299
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:57,652
[SPEAKER_05]: One down, two to go.

300
00:24:57,672 --> 00:25:07,316
[SPEAKER_05]: We will go next to our Medford Community Media, Kevin Harrington, to present his budget for fiscal 25, budget request for fiscal 25.

301
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:25,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kevin, just if you wanna start off with what your request was, maybe how that differed from last year, and share a little bit of what, like Pam did, what your department's up to, what you're hoping to add, and see you over the next year.

302
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:45,253
[SPEAKER_01]: sure thing uh thank you president bears um hello everyone i'm kevin harrington i'm the station manager for medford community media um and for the upcoming fiscal year we are proposing a total budget of 204 427 and 37 cents um and most of our line items are staying the same the only exception is line item number

303
00:25:55,749 --> 00:25:55,849
[SPEAKER_01]: 010-190-5730.

304
00:25:55,889 --> 00:26:02,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Dues and subscriptions, we will be increasing that.

305
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:10,826
[SPEAKER_01]: We're proposing to increase that by $3,000, which I can get into momentarily on my requesting that.

306
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:29,339
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I would also, similar to how our director of the Council on Aging was able to sum up her department very cohesively, we are a, I think of Medford Community Media as a resource.

307
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:40,686
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a resource for the community, both in the sense that people can come to our station, they can put on programming, they can record shows.

308
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,447
[SPEAKER_01]: of pretty much any content they want.

309
00:26:44,968 --> 00:26:53,489
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also a resource in terms of our municipal meetings, including this one right now, just for a nice fourth-wall-breaking meta moment.

310
00:26:55,549 --> 00:27:10,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's a reason why PEG Access has the PEG acronym, public, education, government, and all three of those letters are interests that we have to be, you know, attending to throughout the year.

311
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:16,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And our continued mission is to literally give access to the members of our community.

312
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:22,479
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'll mention later in the narrative, we're hoping to grow our membership every year.

313
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:29,103
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started in 2021, having people come in person was still a little bit up in the air.

314
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:31,584
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot more people staying home.

315
00:27:31,644 --> 00:27:33,846
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot more mask wearing if you did come in.

316
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And we definitely saw in the past fiscal year,

317
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:45,574
[SPEAKER_01]: people's increased comfort of coming in to the studio and, you know, hoping to get some new members as well.

318
00:27:47,495 --> 00:28:03,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I also, in years past, I have neglected to give the requisite amount of appreciation to all the various folks that help out with MCM, including full-time staff, part-time staff, our per diem staff,

319
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:20,334
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially for meetings here in the chambers, we have Shane Colbert, MVTHS graduate, who is dutifully here well into the wee hours of the night, as is, well, you know.

320
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:20,594
[SPEAKER_01]: 2 a.m.

321
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:23,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane, that's what we call him.

322
00:28:23,396 --> 00:28:25,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, honestly, that's part of,

323
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:36,569
[SPEAKER_01]: this job that's part of our department as we are there to to survey and to just to provide that, you know, access and transparency.

324
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,972
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also want to shout out John McLaughlin.

325
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:41,544
[SPEAKER_01]: will cover school committee as well.

326
00:28:42,744 --> 00:28:46,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those folks have done a tremendous job in those spots.

327
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:51,248
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also had some of our part-time employees will cover these meetings.

328
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:53,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get to them in a moment.

329
00:28:53,889 --> 00:29:01,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank, we have last year, we were able to get approved a line item for our

330
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:03,894
[SPEAKER_01]: part-time salaries.

331
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:07,916
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have co-ops from the vocational technical high school.

332
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:10,377
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both seniors.

333
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:12,358
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be graduating shortly.

334
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:16,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Patrick Keene and Sam Buxton, we've had them alternating weeks.

335
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:19,302
[SPEAKER_01]: They've both been really excellent.

336
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:27,527
[SPEAKER_01]: They both brought their own strengths to the station and you know that that position is also meant to be a reciprocal kind of

337
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:31,048
[SPEAKER_01]: endeavor, it's learning experience for them as well.

338
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:41,953
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're getting the paid experience, they're getting professional experience, but it's also to help learn on their way out of the vocational technical high school.

339
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:43,693
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, our

340
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:53,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Previous, the production coordinator we started with this fiscal year, Kat Darnell, she changed to work at the vocational technical high school.

341
00:29:53,582 --> 00:30:00,768
[SPEAKER_01]: So while it was tremendously sad for me to know she was going to be leaving in July, she didn't go that far.

342
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:01,729
[SPEAKER_01]: She went down the hall.

343
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:04,272
[SPEAKER_01]: So there wasn't there wasn't too much.

344
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:06,213
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was tolerable.

345
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:07,054
[SPEAKER_01]: We see her plenty.

346
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:18,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've had Sarah Pendenza has taken over in the production coordinator role as the other full-time employee.

347
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:27,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's just hit the ground running, currently in the booth right now, probably blushing slightly, and has just been really excellent helping out.

348
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:35,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just wanted to, before I get into sort of the more nuts and bolts stuff, I don't often get in front of the camera.

349
00:30:35,732 --> 00:30:37,853
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm usually behind the camera in the control room.

350
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:42,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank all of our viewers.

351
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:54,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank all of our members, people who come and create shows and want to encourage, you know, I don't know if this violates a rule or anything to try to recruit for members during my budget presentation, but

352
00:30:55,589 --> 00:31:02,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly want to encourage people, if you want to come to our station, check it out, apply for a membership.

353
00:31:03,052 --> 00:31:08,174
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there for you for $0 to express whatever you want.

354
00:31:08,294 --> 00:31:16,378
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, if it's protected by the Constitution and it's not commercial speech, you can have all sorts of creative expressions.

355
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,901
[SPEAKER_01]: In any event, very quickly, I'll go through our, because I believe you said you don't have the narratives in front of you.

356
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:24,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

357
00:31:25,293 --> 00:31:42,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So for our fiscal year 24 highlights, we covered several local events, including the mayoral debate, which I think was was quite a success and we did with limited staff we were able to put put that together the MLK Day celebration in January was a highlight as well as.

358
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:54,236
[SPEAKER_01]: last year's commencement and we also collaborated with the media tech shop at the vocational school for their women's history day event.

359
00:31:55,276 --> 00:32:06,120
[SPEAKER_01]: We've updated some equipment including the audio mixing console we use on the mayoral debate, we added the co-ops, we also undertaken a project where

360
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:17,328
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had challenges with digital storage, especially now that videos, especially if they're decently high resolution, get bigger and bigger and bigger.

361
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:33,160
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to really successfully cut down on some of the data that was stored on our main CASUS unit so that we don't get any performance issues, and that was a very all-hands situation.

362
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:34,881
[SPEAKER_01]: We were also...

363
00:32:35,862 --> 00:32:54,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll sort of slightly skip ahead and mention one of the challenges was we had we were flooded in January, along with the high school, which I'll put in the, we, we handled it but wouldn't repeat it if I had the choice category, but we were very lucky, and we didn't really lose any equipment.

364
00:32:54,915 --> 00:33:05,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just helped bolster our already existing safeguards of how we store, you know, electronics that are very, very, very susceptible to water damage.

365
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,528
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, we were able to actually inventory a lot of gear.

366
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:17,256
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to purge a lot of no longer functioning or unnecessary electronic goods and have that disposed properly.

367
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:26,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also installed the new monitor displays that were provided, I believe, with the budget.

368
00:33:26,513 --> 00:33:30,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to work with Clerk Hurtubise and President Bears with that.

369
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:34,537
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have these nice big screens and the additional smaller screens down there.

370
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:38,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are continuing to progress.

371
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of ARPA funds, the only ARPA funds that I touch is our audio upgrade.

372
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:57,852
[SPEAKER_01]: that we will be, we are very, very close to getting that finalized, to be accepting a quote, and we'll be hopefully be able to move forward and get a contract drawn up.

373
00:33:58,532 --> 00:34:13,343
[SPEAKER_01]: And my goal is to get that installation going in the spring and summer, so that by the time the fall comes around, we've got a nice souped up delegate microphone audio system, and we'll be able to hit the ground running.

374
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:21,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just briefly for some of the goals, there's some, um, we have the video switcher that's currently being used at this moment in the booth.

375
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:24,270
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to be able to upgrade that if we can.

376
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:40,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Our equipment budget is 30 K. So that can be limiting for big ticket items, but it can be decent for a lot of most upkeep things like cables and batteries and stuff are pretty, pretty doable, but something like a video switching system might be a little bit different.

377
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:42,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might have to get creative.

378
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,403
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we want to upgrade that.

379
00:34:44,424 --> 00:34:48,408
[SPEAKER_01]: We are hoping to add an intercom system to the control room so people can use headsets.

380
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:53,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to continue our community outreach through social media.

381
00:34:54,185 --> 00:35:11,595
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things Sarah has been doing quite a bit of since she joined is using our Instagram, using our Facebook to not only notify when we have meetings, but also just posting every once in a while of, do you want to do a podcast?

382
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:12,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check out our stuff.

383
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:16,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that kind of, I guess I don't need to mansplain outreach to you guys.

384
00:35:16,457 --> 00:35:17,438
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand what I mean.

385
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:32,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, and then we would also try to, once we get our feet kinda under us, we're continuing to document things better in general, and we're hoping to relaunch regular classes.

386
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:42,077
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, if anyone comes in as a new member, we do individual classes to train them up, but we wanna get the regular classes back, so that's a goal for us.

387
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:47,100
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I can be prone to ramble and be a little bit,

388
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:51,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it lacrimose that means you're long-winded, or is that?

389
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:53,950
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good one, right?

390
00:35:54,671 --> 00:36:01,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, verbose is the one most of my family uses, but I'm open to any and all questions and follow-ups that you may have.

391
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I will ask no questions about SAT words.

392
00:36:06,335 --> 00:36:15,740
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do the one other kind of standard question, just as you kind of went into it a little bit, is there anything not requested this year and this year's budget request that you're probably looking for in the future?

393
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:26,025
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounded like maybe in the future, some capital related stuff around video switcher, but anything on staff side, personal side that you're looking towards that you knew we weren't going to go for this year?

394
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:47,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so like the two things like the two kind of like blue sky items that would be really great to have would be one an additional like non-co-op role that would be either part-time or full-time would be really helpful because you know the co-ops are excellent but there's some limitations of what they can do

395
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:59,350
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not allowed to bring them in cars and stuff to go places, which is obviously understandable, but then can make for logistical challenges if you're trying to have someone go cover something and leave the grounds.

396
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:03,693
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be really, really nice to have a 3rd kind of permanent employee.

397
00:37:04,674 --> 00:37:07,498
[SPEAKER_01]: The other would be to upgrade our lighting system in the studio.

398
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:20,833
[SPEAKER_01]: It's serviceable at the moment, but it's mostly, you know, we're basically using circuit breakers to turn the lights all the way on and all the way off, which I think is okay in a, you know,

399
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:25,518
[SPEAKER_01]: with the amount we're using them, but not like a great long-term solution.

400
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,963
[SPEAKER_01]: We, a long time ago, got a quote for a lighting system upgrade that was above $40,000.

401
00:37:31,003 --> 00:37:34,867
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would qualify for sure as a capital expense.

402
00:37:35,428 --> 00:37:43,095
[SPEAKER_01]: And even under our old line item for equipment, it would still have reached above that 10K threshold and all that stuff.

403
00:37:43,115 --> 00:37:44,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So those would probably be the ones I could think of.

404
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:45,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

405
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.

406
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,741
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I just want to say personally, thank you.

407
00:37:48,762 --> 00:37:52,943
[SPEAKER_05]: You're one of the departments we work with the most as you're broadcasting our meetings.

408
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:55,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, Sarah's been great.

409
00:37:55,665 --> 00:37:59,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And we miss Kat and we miss you filling in in the interim.

410
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:04,689
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but we, you know, and I've been really grateful to work with you on this ARPA project that we are.

411
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:14,035
[SPEAKER_05]: We're crossing the finish line on after floods and staff shortages and a variety of other natural and artificial disasters.

412
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:19,059
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be great, I think, just to talk about the project really quickly.

413
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,483
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a significantly improved audio quality for folks in this space and online.

414
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:29,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I think especially for online, I believe we're going to have the ability to change

415
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:34,271
[SPEAKER_05]: levels of microphones to adjust for different volumes of speech, which we currently can't do.

416
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:39,036
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes we go from a pretty quiet talk to a pretty loud talk.

417
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:47,445
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last thing you want is the mic all the way up for someone speaking quietly and someone chimes in loudly and we blow out everyone's TV speakers back at home.

418
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:47,505
[SPEAKER_05]: So

419
00:38:48,466 --> 00:38:49,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's going to be great.

420
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:51,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to have a little bit better meeting management as well.

421
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:57,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe a few fewer taped cables on the floor, which I think will make us all feel better.

422
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's been really a great project to work on.

423
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:07,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Really excited for MCM, hoping to get classes back and, you know,

424
00:39:08,672 --> 00:39:10,033
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a great, great stuff that you're doing.

425
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:12,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully we can expand it a bit more in the future.

426
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:17,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will go to Councilor Callaghan, Councilor Tseng, Councilor Leming, Vice President Collins.

427
00:39:17,677 --> 00:39:18,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate that, thank you.

428
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:20,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

429
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,331
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll use this opportunity to thank everyone for coming out.

430
00:39:24,252 --> 00:39:25,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Just save a little bit of time.

431
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:29,775
[SPEAKER_11]: So appreciate your work that you do every day as well as the time that you're taking in an evening to be here.

432
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:38,440
[SPEAKER_11]: My specific question for you is how much funding comes from the cable companies and sort of what percentage of your budget is that?

433
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Just curious about that.

434
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:48,668
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as I understand, both Comcast and Verizon, that money comes into the city and that goes into my budget.

435
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:50,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't exactly know.

436
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,771
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in between kind of those connections, you know, kind of how it gets managed.

437
00:39:57,792 --> 00:40:03,073
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, most if not all the budget we have is from those sources.

438
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:10,435
[SPEAKER_01]: But that I don't know, because I don't get those like statements or receipts mailed to me directly.

439
00:40:12,095 --> 00:40:18,097
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I do know what I was able to get a report from Comcast that

440
00:40:19,281 --> 00:40:21,703
[SPEAKER_01]: basically over what would have been, yes, fiscal year 24.

441
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:23,644
[SPEAKER_01]: The total was $236,376.92, just from Comcast alone.

442
00:40:23,684 --> 00:40:25,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Verizon did not get back to me.

443
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:25,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

444
00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:26,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

445
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:39,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

446
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:42,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if the L word you were looking for was loquacious.

447
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:44,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, it was loquacious.

448
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:50,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we talk about a certain admittance to a certain school of a certain sweatshirt?

449
00:40:51,145 --> 00:40:55,068
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why you're wearing the sweatshirt.

450
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:58,731
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is me running from Cambridge.

451
00:40:59,151 --> 00:41:04,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Harvard Law Advice Councilor Tseng you can always tell a Cornell man.

452
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:11,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I, I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more to the increase in dues and subscriptions.

453
00:41:11,723 --> 00:41:13,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yes, thank you.

454
00:41:13,803 --> 00:41:14,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for reminding me that.

455
00:41:14,963 --> 00:41:15,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

456
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:28,367
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is for, so our dues and subscriptions line item was created last budget season because we were using a lot of those services and it was all funneled under equipment and that seemed to be kind of not.

457
00:41:28,827 --> 00:41:37,939
[SPEAKER_01]: A proper and accurate description and what that mostly involves is our Verizon Internet service that we have for the office itself.

458
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:45,568
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the things that we use to just operate like keeping our website and our domain.

459
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,832
[SPEAKER_01]: The Castor IO service, which helps us live stream.

460
00:41:50,493 --> 00:42:03,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Castus is basically the actual piece of hardware, the quick roll for, is what sends video to our two channels, among other places.

461
00:42:03,965 --> 00:42:06,727
[SPEAKER_01]: It also sends video to our video on demand platform.

462
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:10,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm mentioning those because that's where the kind of increase comes in.

463
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:18,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's annual fees that we pay to CASAs every year.

464
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:22,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it is the, I have it written right here.

465
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:30,749
[SPEAKER_01]: So we essentially, we have support and maintenance, that's 1200 every year.

466
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:35,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the additional is for our video on demand platform.

467
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:42,414
[SPEAKER_01]: So our video on demand platform, if you go to medfortv.org and you click watch MCM, and you see a sort of,

468
00:42:43,414 --> 00:42:51,502
[SPEAKER_01]: old-fashioned looking YouTube-esque scenario with video thumbnails and the ability to watch live and watch old stuff, that's our VOD.

469
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:52,983
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we call it, our VOD.

470
00:42:53,424 --> 00:43:00,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So that VOD, I found out from talking to CASTIS support, is called Old VOD in their parlance, which

471
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:13,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm more of a video guy, but I'm like that sounds like something that should be updated And so we looked into the pricing of that and so essentially what we would be able to do is that

472
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:18,003
[SPEAKER_01]: We are basically going to upgrade.

473
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:22,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially for the entire year, we were paying $3,695.

474
00:43:22,328 --> 00:43:25,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the upgrade that we are budgeting for would be a total of $6,198.

475
00:43:25,573 --> 00:43:28,637
[SPEAKER_01]: So the $1,200 would be for the regular support and maintenance.

476
00:43:35,265 --> 00:43:39,968
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be $3,999 for the CCS 1080p.

477
00:43:40,028 --> 00:43:44,191
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name for the kind of updated cloud-based FOD we would do.

478
00:43:45,011 --> 00:43:49,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a one-time migration fee of $999, so essentially $1,000.

479
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:55,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And so essentially, that would then get reduced in years forward.

480
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:55,798
[SPEAKER_01]: It would only be...

481
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,282
[SPEAKER_01]: $5,199 because that one-time fee wouldn't be included.

482
00:44:01,862 --> 00:44:10,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So I essentially rounded up because the actual increase from what we have to what we're hoping to get was about $2,503.

483
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:21,456
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I decided to round that up to $3,000 to allow for any and all price fluctuations, additional fees, hidden fees, that kind of thing, so that we'd be covered.

484
00:44:22,717 --> 00:44:26,018
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is if this budget is, oh, that was a close one.

485
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:38,522
[SPEAKER_01]: If this budget were to be approved, we would then be able to go forward with CASIS, migrate the data, and our new VOD would be a better user experience.

486
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:40,643
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be more reliable.

487
00:44:40,723 --> 00:44:42,643
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to maintain.

488
00:44:43,404 --> 00:44:47,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think our VOD, you know, that's how most people watch our meetings.

489
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:53,988
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they might watch them live on their channels, but a lot of times they go to our website and that's where they go.

490
00:44:54,048 --> 00:44:58,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like that's such a mission critical part of what we do.

491
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,451
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was hoping to upgrade that going forward.

492
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:02,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

493
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:04,812
[SPEAKER_09]: That was so well explained.

494
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:08,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just make sure we don't have to spend even more to buy a new computer.

495
00:45:08,474 --> 00:45:09,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, exactly.

496
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost loquaciously destroyed this computer.

497
00:45:15,216 --> 00:45:17,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Saint, Councilor Leming.

498
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:18,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

499
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:21,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a real brief question.

500
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:37,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So, virtual access as a virtual access being covered by open meeting laws had to expire in Massachusetts March of next year, which may or may not go through, depending on whether or not the governor.

501
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:39,440
[SPEAKER_07]: puts another extension to it.

502
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:49,272
[SPEAKER_07]: But my question is, if that does go through, and this may not even necessarily affect this budget season, but if it does go through, would that affect your job at all?

503
00:45:49,352 --> 00:45:52,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just the technologies you're using, the workflows and so on?

504
00:45:53,698 --> 00:45:55,079
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say

505
00:45:57,295 --> 00:45:59,136
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty that it wouldn't affect.

506
00:45:59,396 --> 00:46:11,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we still would be, the way we currently cover these meetings, we would still be able to have, you know, if essentially you weren't having anyone on Zoom anymore, it might make some things slightly easier.

507
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:21,084
[SPEAKER_01]: We would actually probably still use Zoom on like the backend in order to access our broadcast, just cause it's a kind of like, it's a fairly,

508
00:46:22,685 --> 00:46:25,208
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good, my predecessor came up with it as a workaround.

509
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:39,984
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that would be challenging to answer that question a little more directly is some of the meetings that are not here in the chambers, for instance, you know, the charter study or zoning board of appeals, if those all had to go in person.

510
00:46:41,024 --> 00:46:51,646
[SPEAKER_01]: we would have to look at where are those going to be and how would we be able to broadcast those, to continue to broadcast those meetings as we were when they were Zoom only.

511
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:53,826
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would definitely be a challenge.

512
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:57,007
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be something that, and you said, is that March of 25?

513
00:46:58,387 --> 00:47:03,848
[SPEAKER_07]: March 31st, 2025 is when it's set to expire.

514
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:08,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe they've already extended it once.

515
00:47:08,149 --> 00:47:09,309
[SPEAKER_07]: They could extend it again,

516
00:47:10,919 --> 00:47:12,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's an excellent question.

517
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you bringing that up.

518
00:47:14,723 --> 00:47:16,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll have that on my radar.

519
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:21,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it would definitely be doable, but would require preparation for sure.

520
00:47:21,892 --> 00:47:28,059
[SPEAKER_01]: It would require a decent amount of planning to make sure that all the I's are dotted and D's are crossed if that was to expire.

521
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:31,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just throw out two things on that.

522
00:47:32,322 --> 00:47:36,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the administration has a remote participation policy of some kind.

523
00:47:36,786 --> 00:47:41,410
[SPEAKER_05]: We have also, so that would be for boards and commissions, and I don't know what the school committee's policy is.

524
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:46,195
[SPEAKER_05]: We have in our rules said that we will permanently maintain virtual access.

525
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:50,679
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that the change in state law would change would be the presence of Councilors.

526
00:47:51,229 --> 00:48:04,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So virtually present Councilors would not count towards quorum if that law were to expire, but they could participate remotely and we would still, we've put it into our rules to maintain the virtual access as part of council business going forward.

527
00:48:05,493 --> 00:48:10,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't wanna speak to the intent of the administration's policy, but when I said, hey, Steve, link to the records, he said, hey, we already linked to the policy.

528
00:48:10,915 --> 00:48:17,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm guessing they might be in the same ballpark of some kind, but I also know that there's just been some dispute

529
00:48:18,377 --> 00:48:24,342
[SPEAKER_05]: in the legislature about the specifics of making it permanent and how that applies to towns and communities.

530
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:30,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it applies here in Medford, quite frankly, you know, it's another, I think it's a great value.

531
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:34,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the MMA and some other cities and town governments have said it was an unfunded mandate.

532
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:40,574
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have the technology and resources to, we don't have the money to pay for the technology resources and staff to maintain the system.

533
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:53,736
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the state requires it is the state going to pitch in some funds and I think there's been disputes as to what that would look like and who would be eligible, and if the state is going to create some sort of fund that communities can apply for grants from or not.

534
00:48:54,437 --> 00:48:55,338
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping that.

535
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:57,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping they work that all out.

536
00:48:58,027 --> 00:49:01,010
[SPEAKER_05]: But for us, I think we should be good for the council.

537
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:09,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Although we have had some requests to go back to meeting in the smaller committee rooms and maybe the more collegial atmosphere that that enshrines.

538
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:12,342
[SPEAKER_05]: So that may be something to discuss as well.

539
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:20,320
[SPEAKER_05]: not to steal any, for some reason I read too much.

540
00:49:22,742 --> 00:49:26,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go to Vice President, unless you're done Council, do you have more questions?

541
00:49:27,626 --> 00:49:28,086
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm good.

542
00:49:28,307 --> 00:49:30,048
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, cool, Vice President Collins.

543
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much for being here.

544
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:40,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, the whole soft speakers, loud speakers, I don't think it's an issue, I never hear about that.

545
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:54,775
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know we're reaping the benefits of some of the improvements that's been made over the past year with these additional monitors.

546
00:49:55,576 --> 00:50:00,761
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really helpful for Councilors I hope that there's been some benefits for folks in the audience as well and it's.

547
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:09,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Great to hear some of the things that are in the percolator for continuing to expand access for making the meetings more accessible, even within the chambers.

548
00:50:09,545 --> 00:50:19,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, not because of anything that has to do with your department, because of this room and its acoustics, we frequently hear from folks, you know, gosh, it's really hard to hear kind of no matter what.

549
00:50:19,448 --> 00:50:24,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's awesome to hear that those headsets are on the eventual to-do list.

550
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that could help out a lot of folks who have a hard time reading the subtitles and hearing in the chambers.

551
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:32,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for letting us know that that is in the hopper.

552
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:40,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that it's a tough year across the board for those blue sky items, but I think it is helpful for us to get a benchmark on what needs are coming down the pike.

553
00:50:42,308 --> 00:50:57,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that even like 30K for the video switcher is pretty small in terms of capital investments go, but I hope that we can kind of stay in conversation about what those needs are so we can make sure that they get allocated and budgeted for in a way that we can make movement on them when the time is right.

554
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:03,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you touched on this quickly before, but just a question about one of the funding streams.

555
00:51:03,682 --> 00:51:09,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the cable company fee, a portion of that is earmarked towards community media.

556
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:11,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know a lot about this.

557
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:14,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned about this relatively recently from a community media station in another city, actually.

558
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:24,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that earmark from the cable companies that they pay to the city, does all of that funding go to MCM or does part of that go to the general fund as well?

559
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Just curious the streams that funnel into.

560
00:51:26,744 --> 00:51:28,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that I'm not sure of.

561
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,968
[SPEAKER_01]: My presumption is that that we get a portion of it.

562
00:51:33,388 --> 00:51:34,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what portion of it is.

563
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:40,193
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so unfortunately, I don't know if I actually have an answer for you on that one.

564
00:51:40,478 --> 00:51:40,718
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

565
00:51:40,758 --> 00:51:42,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a pretty regular question.

566
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can send those questions.

567
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:46,764
[SPEAKER_05]: We maybe have a motion to ask those questions of the finance department.

568
00:51:47,684 --> 00:51:50,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Given what you looked up, you said it was 236 from Comcast.

569
00:51:50,867 --> 00:51:51,668
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, yeah.

570
00:51:51,868 --> 00:51:53,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And I double checked.

571
00:51:53,109 --> 00:52:00,096
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent me two different kinds of forms, but I thought the PDFs that were called access, I thought were the ones I should look at.

572
00:52:00,756 --> 00:52:03,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was because essentially what they do is they take

573
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:15,844
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all the fees and all the stuff they collect from that community, and they take 2% of that, and that's what gets funneled to PEG access stations all throughout the Commonwealth.

574
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:20,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it sounds like Verizon didn't reply, but Comcast did.

575
00:52:20,714 --> 00:52:20,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

576
00:52:20,954 --> 00:52:23,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was, it was relatively short notice.

577
00:52:23,737 --> 00:52:26,740
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like last week I was like, well, I should see if I can get that information.

578
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'll follow back up with Verizon.

579
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:36,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have more contacts with Comcast due to a couple of years ago when we had the Comcast issue.

580
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:38,471
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have more folks that I can kind of lean on there.

581
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:40,893
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to build that back up with Verizon.

582
00:52:41,354 --> 00:52:41,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

583
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:41,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

584
00:52:42,074 --> 00:52:44,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just like to like, you know, my understanding is that,

585
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:49,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Comcast, there's more Comcast subscribers than Verizon subscribers.

586
00:52:49,193 --> 00:52:52,696
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's based on the total charge, I'd guess.

587
00:52:53,216 --> 00:52:55,098
[SPEAKER_05]: The Verizon is probably less than the Comcast.

588
00:52:55,538 --> 00:53:03,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other thing, and maybe it's just useful to put out budget wide all the time, because sometimes even I get a little mixed up with it.

589
00:53:03,824 --> 00:53:05,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there is one thing that kind of,

590
00:53:06,377 --> 00:53:12,358
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of money that is technically going to pay for benefits for employees of MCM.

591
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:14,939
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not in the MCM budget line item, right?

592
00:53:14,979 --> 00:53:18,540
[SPEAKER_05]: So health insurance, pensions, other benefits, those are in the health insurance line item.

593
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:28,942
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, paying for the full cost of our staff, it actually doesn't all appear in the line item for the departmental budget for that department.

594
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:35,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes it's like, you know, I mean, you can look at it a lot of different ways, but, and I think it's probably for,

595
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:48,479
[SPEAKER_05]: readability purpose is better than it's in its own thing, in its own budget line that it's split up across the entire city and with individual lines and then having to figure out how much is health insurance for X, Y, Z person.

596
00:53:48,539 --> 00:54:04,047
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is something where there could be funds, like say there was a restricted, if PEG funds are restricted, we can ask the question, they may be going to benefits for you that are technically not in your line item budget, but that are being, that you're entitled to.

597
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:14,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, is there a motion to request the peg fees paid to the city by Comcast and Verizon?

598
00:54:14,394 --> 00:54:18,797
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Vice President Collins, do you want to amend it?

599
00:54:18,817 --> 00:54:20,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Or second it?

600
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:21,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Second it.

601
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:30,903
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion, Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callaghan to request from the Finance Department the peg fees paid by Comcast and Verizon.

602
00:54:32,524 --> 00:54:34,185
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're ready, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

603
00:54:36,256 --> 00:54:36,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

604
00:54:40,617 --> 00:54:40,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

605
00:54:43,578 --> 00:54:43,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

606
00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:47,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

607
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:54,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 70 60 affirmative one absent the motion passes and we are there any more questions members of the council?

608
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:56,882
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a member of the public's hand raised on zoom.

609
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:07,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing no questions by the Council, I will recognize Eunice on Zoom if you have a question about the Medford Community Media Budget.

610
00:55:08,861 --> 00:55:10,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you very much.

611
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:12,642
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have three, hopefully, quick questions.

612
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:20,464
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, I want to start out by giving props to Kevin and Sarah, and prior to that, Cat.

613
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:28,486
[SPEAKER_13]: I know they hear from me a lot, and they do a wonderful job getting the meetings out and responding to people and so forth.

614
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:32,067
[SPEAKER_13]: So, definitely, thank you very much to the MCM staff.

615
00:55:32,087 --> 00:55:32,667
[SPEAKER_13]: They're terrific.

616
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:36,353
[SPEAKER_13]: My questions are kind of as follows.

617
00:55:37,913 --> 00:55:50,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Number one, I think, Zach, you mentioned back at the beginning of this term that council meetings were going to go to YouTube as well, similar to what the school committee does.

618
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:53,958
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm wondering when that is going to happen.

619
00:55:56,455 --> 00:56:03,239
[SPEAKER_13]: The school committee does it and it's a pretty great thing to be able to go back and watch the meeting pretty much immediately.

620
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,921
[SPEAKER_13]: My 2nd question is.

621
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:14,910
[SPEAKER_13]: With the video on demand, is there a way to determine how many people are watching the meetings?

622
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:29,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I think one of the prior station managers used to always indicate, you know, when you bring up the video on demand, how many replays, you know, had been done for that particular meeting.

623
00:56:29,941 --> 00:56:31,622
[SPEAKER_13]: So, in essence, how many,

624
00:56:33,543 --> 00:57:01,304
[SPEAKER_13]: uh you know residents are watching um you know once the replay goes up and my last question is with all the meetings that are held in the city right now um between the city council the school committee the boards the commissions etc and this might be you know it's not a good budget year we all know that but has there ever been any given any thought to outfitting any other places across the city so that

625
00:57:02,512 --> 00:57:22,207
[SPEAKER_13]: boards commissions or community meetings or whatever if the council is if the chambers are occupied as they are on tuesdays and wednesdays and you know alternate mondays that meetings can be held in other locations i know at one point 207 rooms 207 and 217 were

626
00:57:25,652 --> 00:57:33,677
[SPEAKER_13]: outfitted with AV stuff years ago, but those rooms are pretty small for, you know, pretty much anything.

627
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:40,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly wouldn't fit any community members beyond, you know, the members of whatever board or commission it is.

628
00:57:41,122 --> 00:57:43,684
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm thinking, like, senior center.

629
00:57:43,924 --> 00:57:53,171
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the West Medford Community Center is outfitted already, or the superintendent's conference room up at the high school so that

630
00:57:54,031 --> 00:58:03,956
[SPEAKER_13]: if the school committee needed to meet on a Tuesday or a Wednesday night, when you guys are in there, that they could be meeting up there and meeting in person rather than just on Zoom.

631
00:58:03,976 --> 00:58:19,624
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, in essence, has there been any thought given to outfitting any other locations in the city where meetings could be held and, you know, continue to be hybrid, but at least have the in-person option?

632
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:21,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

633
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:22,285
[SPEAKER_13]: And Kevin and Sarah, thanks.

634
00:58:22,305 --> 00:58:23,406
[SPEAKER_13]: You do a fabulous job.

635
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:25,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Eunice.

636
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I got the three questions down.

637
00:58:28,232 --> 00:58:31,294
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have them down, I will just say on the YouTube, we're still working on it.

638
00:58:31,314 --> 00:58:38,378
[SPEAKER_05]: We ran into a bit of a logistical thing where you can only attach a one YouTube account to one zoom account.

639
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:43,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we kind of had the discussion, do we have to make a separate YouTube account for every, um,

640
00:58:44,342 --> 00:58:46,363
[SPEAKER_05]: for every meeting of the city.

641
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:49,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And that became kind of, I think, a sticking point of, do we want to do that?

642
00:58:49,504 --> 00:58:54,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And if people have to go look for 20 different Zoom accounts or YouTube accounts, does that really make it accessible?

643
00:58:54,806 --> 00:59:00,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my understanding where we left and are still talking through it, but that's the only piece of this that I have any answer to.

644
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:01,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll go to you, Kevin.

645
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:02,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

646
00:59:02,391 --> 00:59:03,992
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to say thank you, Eunice.

647
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the kind words.

648
00:59:06,234 --> 00:59:13,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also, it's, listen, you know, when you're, when you're in either the public or in video production, you know, it's always good to have feedback.

649
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:20,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always appreciate the feedback letting us know, because if our stuff is not serving the community, then who is it serving at all?

650
00:59:20,384 --> 00:59:23,607
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always appreciate, appreciate reaching out.

651
00:59:23,987 --> 00:59:24,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

652
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:28,570
[SPEAKER_01]: The YouTube thing of it is, I think you nailed it, President Bears.

653
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:36,024
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way to do it would be to have a dedicated YouTube channel for each commission.

654
00:59:36,685 --> 00:59:43,288
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, if you stop for a second and think about, you would have to have a dedicated Google account for each of those.

655
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:50,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So then if you have a department where there's turnover, then you have to, now you have a Google account that has to be like managed passwords.

656
00:59:51,552 --> 00:59:52,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So that part would be tricky.

657
00:59:53,533 --> 01:00:03,326
[SPEAKER_01]: The other, the more the short term work around you could do is you could treat we have the West, we have the metric community media YouTube account that already exists.

658
01:00:03,787 --> 01:00:09,935
[SPEAKER_01]: We typically use that for access live broadcasts for like special events that happen live on public access.

659
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:20,501
[SPEAKER_01]: The tricky part with that is, again, it would be similar to the logjam we get with the channels where we only have two channels to do live meetings on.

660
01:00:21,061 --> 01:00:23,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would then still have kind of a logjam.

661
01:00:24,982 --> 01:00:28,963
[SPEAKER_01]: If more than one meeting was happening at the same time, only one of them would be on YouTube.

662
01:00:29,603 --> 01:00:31,704
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I guess in a longer, more detailed way.

663
01:00:34,016 --> 01:00:37,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Figuring out it's definitely something on my radar is definitely something we've been talking about.

664
01:00:37,477 --> 01:00:39,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I know between myself and President Bears.

665
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:41,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've talked to some folks in the city about it.

666
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,919
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is still kind of in progress.

667
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:49,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take the question and we'll try to revisit it and see if there's ways we can.

668
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,223
[SPEAKER_01]: make that manageable.

669
01:00:53,264 --> 01:00:56,188
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the VOD, is there a way to determine how many people are watching?

670
01:00:56,228 --> 01:00:58,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's a way to enable play counts.

671
01:00:59,452 --> 01:01:09,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I will, what I'll do is I'll reach out to other local access stations, see what they do, just because, and the only reason why I say that is because they are currently disabled.

672
01:01:09,785 --> 01:01:12,006
[SPEAKER_01]: and I didn't disable them, they were like that.

673
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:18,788
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no documentation saying, dear next station manager, this is why I disabled play counts.

674
01:01:19,408 --> 01:01:21,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to do a little bit of fact-finding.

675
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:28,331
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's some reason one way or another that they discourage it, I'll take that under advisement.

676
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:34,773
[SPEAKER_01]: But if people in other communities have the play counts visible, then I don't see any reason why not.

677
01:01:35,573 --> 01:01:36,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's pretty doable.

678
01:01:44,443 --> 01:01:47,404
[SPEAKER_05]: once we went into the hybrid mode, there were play counts at some point.

679
01:01:47,964 --> 01:01:58,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was, and maybe it's changed since then, and maybe there's a way to set, I don't know anything about the settings or anything, but I think it was only showing play counts for full playthroughs.

680
01:01:59,146 --> 01:02:06,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'd have to have watched zero to three hours, 40 minutes, or at least fast forward to the end and then let it finish.

681
01:02:06,627 --> 01:02:09,908
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would show like a play count of like three for every meeting.

682
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:11,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously I've, you know,

683
01:02:12,248 --> 01:02:20,014
[SPEAKER_05]: One person probably looked at it more than three times, but I think that may have been why Patrick shut it off was it was, you know, people are like, well, only three people watch this meeting.

684
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:22,916
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, well, that's just because nobody watched it to the end.

685
01:02:22,976 --> 01:02:31,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like when you're on iTunes and it doesn't count if you played the song, if you skip it, like, even if you want listen to the first two hours, two minutes and 30 seconds, the last 15 seconds.

686
01:02:31,121 --> 01:02:31,161
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

687
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:45,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what I can do is I can reach out to Castus and figure out how they manage play counts, because I can imagine if it's not an accurate number, I could see that end up being kind of more, you know, kind of more annoying.

688
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:48,944
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a COVID haze memory, so I could be wrong, but that's what I remember.

689
01:02:49,104 --> 01:02:50,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll certainly look into that.

690
01:02:50,345 --> 01:03:02,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as this is a short one, I would be open to any and all discussions if people wanted to try to outfit other places to be more broadcast ready.

691
01:03:02,471 --> 01:03:07,953
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the giant asterisk is I don't have any power or ability to

692
01:03:09,694 --> 01:03:12,776
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, commandeer someone's conference room and decide to put stuff in it.

693
01:03:13,317 --> 01:03:25,165
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we did, it would probably be a, you know, 10 K plus project that would require, you know, it would be a capital expense with the exception of.

694
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:48,320
[SPEAKER_01]: we currently have in 207 a workaround that's essentially a USB speaker, a USB webcam, and then a USB adapter, kind of dongle situation, so that you could just bring your own laptop, plug it in via USB-C, and you have access to a webcam and a microphone.

695
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's good to go for any and all Zoom meetings, but...

696
01:03:52,503 --> 01:03:56,485
[SPEAKER_01]: that would only be broadcast if we were able to log into the Zoom meeting from the station.

697
01:03:56,985 --> 01:03:59,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not quite as broadcast ready as here.

698
01:03:59,386 --> 01:04:09,790
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, yeah, if we were going to convert someplace for real, it would definitely be a pretty big expenditure to do that, to replicate what we have in there.

699
01:04:10,371 --> 01:04:20,795
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm open, you know, to any and all proposals that people want to loop me into if this, you know, you know, coming down the road, if people want to look into that.

700
01:04:22,961 --> 01:04:24,382
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of a non-answer.

701
01:04:25,182 --> 01:04:27,203
[SPEAKER_05]: We need money to do things.

702
01:04:27,223 --> 01:04:29,784
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an answer we hear a lot.

703
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:33,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Kevin.

704
01:04:33,766 --> 01:04:40,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Eunice, I see your hand still up, so I will unmute you if you just have any further comments you want to make or if you want to ask any follow-ups.

705
01:04:41,492 --> 01:04:48,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope, sorry, I didn't lower it, but thank you very much for answering.

706
01:04:49,198 --> 01:04:54,021
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope the YouTube thing gets straightened out, at least for City Council.

707
01:04:56,311 --> 01:05:09,136
[SPEAKER_13]: The school committee has it and it's really invaluable to be able to, you know, play something back pretty quickly or, you know, you walk in and the meeting just got over and you want to, you know, listen to it or something like that.

708
01:05:09,256 --> 01:05:12,277
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, hopefully that can get straightened out.

709
01:05:12,357 --> 01:05:13,918
[SPEAKER_13]: But thanks very much.

710
01:05:15,247 --> 01:05:15,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

711
01:05:16,888 --> 01:05:17,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Kevin.

712
01:05:18,528 --> 01:05:27,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I'm guessing that we'll do the bottom line summary again, you said 20442737, which is about a 3000 dollar increase from prior year.

713
01:05:28,552 --> 01:05:34,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just essentially fixed cost increases and some, some materials and staff and.

714
01:05:36,377 --> 01:05:43,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing that if that's what ends up in the final budget, that we won't need to see you back here again, unless you want to, feel free to ask.

715
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,701
[SPEAKER_05]: We're happy to hire you from here again.

716
01:05:44,961 --> 01:05:47,402
[SPEAKER_01]: At least not in this capacity, I'll just be in there.

717
01:05:49,903 --> 01:05:50,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you so much.

718
01:05:50,884 --> 01:05:51,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all, everyone.

719
01:05:55,026 --> 01:05:59,668
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and we are going to now our last budget of the night.

720
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:01,629
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to veteran services.

721
01:06:02,717 --> 01:06:07,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to Director Veronica Shaw, welcome for your first meeting with us.

722
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,341
[SPEAKER_05]: We're excited to have you here.

723
01:06:09,901 --> 01:06:12,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a first for you and it's a first for us in the preliminary budget meeting.

724
01:06:14,243 --> 01:06:20,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you can see, that is our current workaround system for our podium microphone.

725
01:06:20,587 --> 01:06:22,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really excited for that to get fixed in the next few months.

726
01:06:23,516 --> 01:06:32,260
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to take the opportunity to introduce our new Veterans Director, Veronica Shaw, as none of you have really had a formal setting.

727
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:36,461
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've spoken with her, I'm not sure, but I'm delighted for this opportunity.

728
01:06:36,481 --> 01:06:38,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm delighted that Veronica has joined our team.

729
01:06:39,243 --> 01:06:41,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Veronica comes to us as an Army medic.

730
01:06:42,424 --> 01:06:49,347
[SPEAKER_12]: So her experience in that field was particularly interesting, and I think it was one of the reasons that set her apart in the interviews.

731
01:06:50,287 --> 01:06:52,910
[SPEAKER_12]: when we met with her in late 2023.

732
01:06:54,591 --> 01:07:00,256
[SPEAKER_12]: She owned her own business at one point in the middle of the pandemic, which, as you can imagine, was a very challenging time.

733
01:07:00,296 --> 01:07:04,060
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a bakery, and so that was obviously very challenging.

734
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:08,724
[SPEAKER_12]: That also was a very interesting piece to Veronica as a candidate.

735
01:07:09,184 --> 01:07:11,466
[SPEAKER_12]: She is graduating with her

736
01:07:12,287 --> 01:07:16,813
[SPEAKER_12]: degree in public health this May, so we're very excited about that and happy for Veronica.

737
01:07:16,933 --> 01:07:19,496
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not her first degree, so kudos to her.

738
01:07:19,896 --> 01:07:22,980
[SPEAKER_12]: So with distinct pleasure, I want to welcome Veronica.

739
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,668
[SPEAKER_12]: The only other thing I'd like to say is because of the process in which we've taken these budget meetings, it occurred to me that

740
01:07:30,649 --> 01:07:36,393
[SPEAKER_12]: we have started to ask departments to fill out their budget narrative as their budget gets finalized.

741
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:40,056
[SPEAKER_12]: As of right now, Veronica hasn't been asked to do that yet.

742
01:07:40,176 --> 01:07:46,621
[SPEAKER_12]: So she does not have a budget narrative and that is no fault of Veronica's, but partly because I was away for a few days last week.

743
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:49,984
[SPEAKER_12]: So please do not fault Veronica for that, but we'll be working on that.

744
01:07:50,384 --> 01:07:54,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if every department head will have a narrative when they come to see you.

745
01:07:54,687 --> 01:07:57,069
[SPEAKER_12]: So just to say that now.

746
01:07:57,409 --> 01:08:01,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you could send, if they will, or may, you know, just let me know.

747
01:08:01,336 --> 01:08:06,865
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you could send the request sheet to the budget request, like the spreadsheet, because folks are coming up with it.

748
01:08:06,885 --> 01:08:10,752
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could send that and just say they will have a narrative, won't have a narrative, and then perfect.

749
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's why we have this first meeting.

750
01:08:12,932 --> 01:08:22,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, happy to discuss this further because I'm not really sure the logistics, the narratives are getting built to be placed into the budget.

751
01:08:22,216 --> 01:08:22,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

752
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:27,618
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we're trying to do, as we thought through how we would

753
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:42,173
[SPEAKER_12]: meet the, we would attempt to meet the timelines, right, because this is our first pass at this, is instead of getting all the budgets done and then asking departments to do their narratives, which is how we'd handled it in the past, we're dynamically moving right now.

754
01:08:42,273 --> 01:08:44,655
[SPEAKER_12]: We're finishing certain budgets, then

755
01:08:45,276 --> 01:08:52,080
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, really, essentially, I'm sending an email to our communications team, who's then contacting our department head to develop the budget narrative.

756
01:08:52,121 --> 01:08:56,463
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not always in the back end of that to know what a budget narrative is.

757
01:08:56,744 --> 01:09:00,386
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we have to tie that end of it, too, it's another step that we haven't tied.

758
01:09:00,726 --> 01:09:08,331
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not impossible, but we are definitely in, you know, uncharted territory, and we're trying to move and flex as quickly as possible.

759
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:13,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And the request is more just to say that, traditionally, these have been opportunities for departments to share.

760
01:09:14,495 --> 01:09:42,921
[SPEAKER_05]: the wonderful things they're doing and we don't want to not have that opportunity so if folks haven't had aren't at the stage where they have the narrative yet you know we would be happy to invite them back after the budget proposal to come back and we can have the supplemental conversation and if you want to do that more than welcome to have you to do that um and uh and just for me to just have the heads up to know who who does and doesn't and we can keep track of if we want to have people back because that is something i think that's really a nice thing and sometimes otherwise kind of

761
01:09:44,673 --> 01:09:53,550
[SPEAKER_05]: more boring, technical, detailed, and sometimes difficult budget conversations to at least have the public forum to share all the great work that the administration team is doing.

762
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:55,709
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll definitely talk it through and see what we can do.

763
01:09:56,009 --> 01:09:56,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

764
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:56,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

765
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

766
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:58,610
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

767
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, director.

768
01:10:00,691 --> 01:10:02,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to have you.

769
01:10:02,931 --> 01:10:14,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we'll just start out with, you know, your budget requests, anything you want to share about the department this year that you've done this year or anything you're planning about the future year.

770
01:10:14,594 --> 01:10:17,955
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to be a full narrative or anything, but, you know, just really anything.

771
01:10:19,195 --> 01:10:22,217
[SPEAKER_05]: especially as you've started, and just really anything you wanna share about what you do.

772
01:10:22,277 --> 01:10:25,319
[SPEAKER_05]: We've heard from some of your predecessors.

773
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:32,624
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the amazing work and how much money has been brought in to support veterans and their families in our community and how important and valuable that is.

774
01:10:32,724 --> 01:10:39,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, I have, I shouldn't speak for Councilor Callahan, Councilor Levin, and Councilor Lazzaro, because this is their first budget cycle.

775
01:10:39,849 --> 01:10:42,791
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, just take it away.

776
01:10:42,911 --> 01:10:46,393
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to hear your budget request, what's changing, and then anything you'd like to say about what you do.

777
01:10:46,744 --> 01:10:46,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

778
01:10:47,004 --> 01:10:48,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you for having me.

779
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:50,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't have much for budget.

780
01:10:50,607 --> 01:10:56,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing has changed other than we do have an increase in our personnel budget.

781
01:10:57,852 --> 01:11:02,215
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an increase of 7,000, I believe.

782
01:11:03,116 --> 01:11:04,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else has stayed the same.

783
01:11:08,274 --> 01:11:10,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everything else has stayed the same, other than the personnel.

784
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:17,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were just the increases for the annual raises.

785
01:11:18,258 --> 01:11:18,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

786
01:11:18,518 --> 01:11:21,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you have the total number there, just so we can write it down?

787
01:11:22,019 --> 01:11:25,841
[SPEAKER_02]: For the personnel, our total request is $120,838.

788
01:11:26,061 --> 01:11:28,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our total, everything together, ordinary expenses and personnel, is $443,552.

789
01:11:37,674 --> 01:11:37,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

790
01:11:38,034 --> 01:11:38,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

791
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:44,260
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's going on in Veterans Services?

792
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,421
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it been the first few months?

793
01:11:45,441 --> 01:11:46,121
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.

794
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:46,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it here.

795
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only been here since the beginning of January.

796
01:11:49,924 --> 01:11:53,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't done a whole lot.

797
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:55,910
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I have done, I think, is pretty awesome.

798
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:14,671
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the process of getting ADA compliant for our office, which is huge because right now when we have veterans that are in wheelchairs or on walkers, sometimes they have to be left out in the hallway or personal conversations have to happen at the counter.

799
01:12:15,171 --> 01:12:22,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we are working to make our office completely ADA compliant, which is really awesome and will benefit our veterans and their families.

800
01:12:24,737 --> 01:12:35,179
[SPEAKER_02]: For Chapter 115, we did lose four veterans this year, and then just in the past month or so, we also gained five.

801
01:12:35,879 --> 01:12:44,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one waiting on paperwork to be approved, and then we have two more in the works that will be hopefully approved within the next few weeks.

802
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:49,762
[SPEAKER_02]: We do get money back from the state for each veteran that is part of that program.

803
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:54,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working with the senior center.

804
01:12:55,104 --> 01:13:03,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be working with their veterans once a month, getting together with them, see what they're needing, do any organization things that they want to do.

805
01:13:04,693 --> 01:13:06,975
[SPEAKER_02]: My first meeting with them is in two weeks.

806
01:13:09,157 --> 01:13:20,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working with Mass Hire, along with some of the other VSOs from our area, to do a job fair exclusively for veterans in the first part, and then it'll be opened up for the community.

807
01:13:21,269 --> 01:13:22,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be huge.

808
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:29,457
[SPEAKER_02]: We've reached out to employers from all over our region to be there to help hire veterans.

809
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:50,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a part of the Massachusetts Women Veterans Network just for myself as a veteran, but that will also help me be able to bring some of that information to our female veterans, which I think will be huge because our needs are different from our male companions.

810
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:57,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, it's just I'm learning the job, getting to know my veterans, who have been absolutely fantastic.

811
01:13:58,363 --> 01:14:00,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I have worked with the historic committee.

812
01:14:01,064 --> 01:14:08,287
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the Salem Street Burial Ground, you'll notice that we have a light on our flagpole and flags that will be flown year round.

813
01:14:10,107 --> 01:14:17,170
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is the American flag, the other is a more historically accurate flag for that cemetery.

814
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:18,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty awesome.

815
01:14:20,132 --> 01:14:25,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much it in a nutshell for the first three and a half months that I've been here.

816
01:14:27,403 --> 01:14:28,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you so much.

817
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:29,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Much appreciated.

818
01:14:30,344 --> 01:14:31,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Really up to you.

819
01:14:31,444 --> 01:14:37,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, well, unless the council requests it, up to you and the administration if you wanna come back later and share even more.

820
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:42,988
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'd love to have you and we really appreciate the work that you do.

821
01:14:44,008 --> 01:14:50,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will go to Councilor Leming, Vice President Collins and Councilor Callahan in that order.

822
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:51,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

823
01:14:52,366 --> 01:14:53,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

824
01:14:53,747 --> 01:14:55,848
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very pleased to have you on Medford.

825
01:14:56,409 --> 01:15:02,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in your time here, what have been some of the more common concerns that veterans have been bringing to you?

826
01:15:06,915 --> 01:15:07,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Money.

827
01:15:10,418 --> 01:15:12,399
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it, is money.

828
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working with several veterans right now that either are or about to be homeless.

829
01:15:19,363 --> 01:15:27,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting them into safe housing is the biggest challenge.

830
01:15:27,213 --> 01:15:29,115
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough housing to go around.

831
01:15:29,836 --> 01:15:35,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And having veteran status does very little to get them the housing that they need.

832
01:15:38,069 --> 01:15:41,650
[SPEAKER_02]: So money and housing, that is their biggest concern right now.

833
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:45,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a veteran who lives with a disabled child.

834
01:15:45,532 --> 01:15:47,073
[SPEAKER_02]: He is an adult, but he's still a child.

835
01:15:47,453 --> 01:15:54,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's being forced to choose between having safe housing for him and safe housing or both of them being homeless.

836
01:15:54,676 --> 01:16:02,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is not an option that he shouldn't have to choose, but he is because there's not enough housing and there's not enough money.

837
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:07,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

838
01:16:08,953 --> 01:16:09,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

839
01:16:09,373 --> 01:16:13,898
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan, and then Councilor Zargarpur.

840
01:16:14,979 --> 01:16:16,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for being here and welcome again.

841
01:16:16,881 --> 01:16:25,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's been several months, but we're so happy to have you on board, and I think it's such an advantage for our community to have somebody who brings so many perspectives to this role.

842
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:27,352
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for being here.

843
01:16:27,432 --> 01:16:28,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to your first budget season.

844
01:16:28,814 --> 01:16:29,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

845
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:43,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I think part of the reason that it's really great to have a presentation from department heads during budget season is it's not just an opportunity to share with the community, what you're up to 365 days a year.

846
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:51,173
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's really important context for us and all the work that we do, like what is the other work that we're trying to do in the community that has those

847
01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:57,479
[SPEAKER_04]: direct and indirect shared goals with what your office is working so hard to accomplish.

848
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,543
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for that, for being here to provide that context and that perspective.

849
01:17:02,404 --> 01:17:05,267
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like it's been a really busy first several months.

850
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:05,848
[SPEAKER_04]: So busy.

851
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:07,930
[SPEAKER_04]: On the job, which is very impressive to hear.

852
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:11,013
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fantastic to hear about the ADA upgrades for the office.

853
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:14,176
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems like a really important, really overdue thing.

854
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for getting right on that.

855
01:17:15,957 --> 01:17:19,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any specific questions for you at this point.

856
01:17:19,059 --> 01:17:22,121
[SPEAKER_04]: The departmental budget is pretty straightforward, but just thank you so much for being here.

857
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:25,623
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that we can be partners in the work of your office.

858
01:17:25,663 --> 01:17:31,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do feel free to be in touch with us any time of the year with how we can support you and what your office is working on.

859
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:31,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

860
01:17:33,368 --> 01:17:34,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

861
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:35,429
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Councilor Callaghan.

862
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:37,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

863
01:17:37,681 --> 01:17:38,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful to have you.

864
01:17:38,622 --> 01:17:39,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Very excited.

865
01:17:39,282 --> 01:17:40,883
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you so much for being here.

866
01:17:41,643 --> 01:17:43,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a few questions.

867
01:17:43,824 --> 01:17:51,087
[SPEAKER_11]: And pardon me for my sort of not having a lot of history with the veteran services and asking some very basic questions.

868
01:17:51,147 --> 01:17:56,429
[SPEAKER_11]: But do you have a sense for just the number of veterans that we have in Medford is one question.

869
01:17:56,509 --> 01:18:06,193
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe if there's any sort of age breakdown, like how many of them are really older and are also able to use the senior center and the Council on Aging services.

870
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:12,796
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's two questions I'm happy to, I don't even, I'll tell them all to you and then I can remind you.

871
01:18:12,936 --> 01:18:22,420
[SPEAKER_11]: And the third question, and this is my nubiest question, which is, in addition to payroll, I actually would love to just get some vague sense of what the other funding.

872
01:18:22,681 --> 01:18:23,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, absolutely.

873
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So as of, ooh,

874
01:18:27,705 --> 01:18:28,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

875
01:18:28,025 --> 01:18:29,386
[SPEAKER_02]: As of 2022, there were 1,982 veterans in Medford.

876
01:18:29,407 --> 01:18:29,847
[SPEAKER_02]: A good year.

877
01:18:29,867 --> 01:18:31,608
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the breakdown, I don't know.

878
01:18:31,628 --> 01:18:33,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I can certainly find that out.

879
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:33,730
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have

880
01:18:51,308 --> 01:18:53,832
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have as many of our older veterans anymore.

881
01:18:53,852 --> 01:19:01,382
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely a big gap between our Vietnam guys and then desert storm age area.

882
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:07,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I am trying to reach out to our younger demographics.

883
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:11,603
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not, they're not needing the services right now.

884
01:19:12,684 --> 01:19:15,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to find them where they're at.

885
01:19:15,046 --> 01:19:16,688
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are looking for education help.

886
01:19:17,068 --> 01:19:20,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So the younger veterans, I've been helping them get their GI bills.

887
01:19:21,092 --> 01:19:26,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I've directed several to VRE, which is just another pot of education money.

888
01:19:27,758 --> 01:19:28,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's,

889
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:31,721
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of what they're looking for, is they're looking for help.

890
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:33,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now I'm out of the military.

891
01:19:33,882 --> 01:19:34,743
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I do?

892
01:19:35,743 --> 01:19:39,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's helping them find jobs, helping them get into their education.

893
01:19:39,425 --> 01:19:43,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our older veterans, we're doing chapter 115.

894
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:46,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be meeting with the senior center.

895
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:49,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that they don't have a lot.

896
01:19:50,112 --> 01:19:57,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say the veteran I spoke with this morning said there's only about five or six of them over there that meet on a regular basis.

897
01:19:59,768 --> 01:20:03,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is, I love community outreach.

898
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:04,413
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to do.

899
01:20:04,453 --> 01:20:05,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be in the community.

900
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:07,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to see me and to know me.

901
01:20:08,657 --> 01:20:14,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hopefully next year I will have that answer of how many veterans and what demographics they are.

902
01:20:18,322 --> 01:20:22,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so non-personnel, we have office supplies.

903
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:24,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a big part of it.

904
01:20:24,985 --> 01:20:27,866
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Veterans Cash Aid, which is our Chapter 115.

905
01:20:28,846 --> 01:20:31,107
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we pay them their stipends.

906
01:20:31,567 --> 01:20:33,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical expenses come out of that.

907
01:20:34,228 --> 01:20:38,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of the cash aid also is flags for Memorial Day.

908
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:40,911
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes out of that budget.

909
01:20:43,274 --> 01:20:53,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Travel conferences, I go to the VSOs have a conference every year where we learn more about how we can help veterans.

910
01:20:53,421 --> 01:20:54,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So that comes out of that budget.

911
01:20:55,402 --> 01:20:59,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Celebrations and holiday, that's things like wreaths that go up around the city.

912
01:21:00,205 --> 01:21:07,770
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be meet and greets with the VFW and with the American Legion, anything that we want to do to

913
01:21:09,151 --> 01:21:13,652
[SPEAKER_02]: help when the new flags and the lights that we put up at the Salem Street burial.

914
01:21:14,093 --> 01:21:18,974
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a new flag and a light at Oak Grove that our office paid for.

915
01:21:18,994 --> 01:21:20,495
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes out of that budget.

916
01:21:21,355 --> 01:21:25,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's more of community things that we can do.

917
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:29,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

918
01:21:29,917 --> 01:21:31,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to Councilor Lazzaro on Zoom.

919
01:21:35,947 --> 01:21:37,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

920
01:21:37,488 --> 01:21:52,919
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to introduce myself, Director Shah, because I am not in person, I'm on Zoom, but I wanted to say hi since you're new and just voice my support for your department and you being here and the work that you're doing.

921
01:21:52,999 --> 01:21:56,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so happy to hear that you're trying to make your office accessible.

922
01:21:56,782 --> 01:22:02,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a particular interest in the work that you're doing when you mentioned affordable housing and

923
01:22:03,546 --> 01:22:22,119
[SPEAKER_00]: um, work to try to make sure that our veterans are accessing the services that they need, especially around homelessness, um, uh, avoiding homelessness and making sure that we're taking care of people who are facing that sort of, uh, challenge is really critical, especially in the veteran community.

924
01:22:22,139 --> 01:22:30,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, just to kind of reiterate that that is a concern in Medford and, um,

925
01:22:30,985 --> 01:22:53,239
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we have a lot of these conversations in our city council meetings a lot of the time and sometimes it's easy to forget that the people that may be facing these kind of concerns are people that have served our country and that have been really critical to our community and that, you know,

926
01:22:54,139 --> 01:23:23,207
[SPEAKER_00]: uh our our city hall staff are are working on a regular basis to try to make sure that we're taking care of them and um I just really appreciate the work that you're doing and I just didn't want to get lost in the sort of zoom universe here I just wanted to like sort of say thank you for coming out and for um mentioning uh the work that you're doing and um also I I think probably Kevin and um my her name is slipping my mind or um

927
01:23:24,313 --> 01:23:25,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Council on aging.

928
01:23:25,074 --> 01:23:35,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Pam, yes, Pam has left, but I wanted to say thank you to everybody also that have been paying close attention, and I appreciate everybody's presentations tonight.

929
01:23:36,802 --> 01:23:38,483
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really great process.

930
01:23:38,523 --> 01:23:41,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad to hear everything in such great detail.

931
01:23:41,785 --> 01:23:47,609
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for presenting tonight, Director Shaw, and I appreciate the work you're all doing for us.

932
01:23:47,629 --> 01:23:49,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

933
01:23:50,671 --> 01:23:51,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

934
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:52,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

935
01:23:53,089 --> 01:23:56,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further comments or questions by members of the council at this time?

936
01:23:56,991 --> 01:23:57,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng.

937
01:23:58,292 --> 01:23:58,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

938
01:23:58,932 --> 01:24:03,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to thank you for coming to our council meeting tonight.

939
01:24:03,474 --> 01:24:07,056
[SPEAKER_09]: We know it can be daunting at times, and it's your first one.

940
01:24:08,557 --> 01:24:11,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's been smooth, and I hope you've had a good time here.

941
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:11,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.

942
01:24:11,718 --> 01:24:12,759
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been entertaining.

943
01:24:13,959 --> 01:24:15,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you think this is entertaining?

944
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,540
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a learning experience.

945
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,661
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some meeting recordings.

946
01:24:18,902 --> 01:24:21,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard the stories.

947
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:38,944
[SPEAKER_09]: We're very excited to have you on the team effort to have you as part of our group and very much looking forward to hearing more and to working more with you.

948
01:24:39,124 --> 01:24:39,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

949
01:24:40,644 --> 01:24:41,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you so much.

950
01:24:42,418 --> 01:24:45,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Just going to do the same thing as I've done for every other department so far.

951
01:24:46,259 --> 01:24:52,241
[SPEAKER_05]: The request is about a little over 7000 more than the previous year's budget, just addressing fixed cost growth.

952
01:24:52,281 --> 01:24:54,342
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no new major programs, no new staff.

953
01:24:55,162 --> 01:24:59,203
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's essentially a slightly slightly above a level funded budget.

954
01:24:59,743 --> 01:25:04,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly what I think we can all call a level service budget, you'll be able to keep doing next year what you're doing this year.

955
01:25:04,987 --> 01:25:10,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, at the very least, is our baseline, especially during difficult budget years.

956
01:25:10,571 --> 01:25:17,235
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really glad to hear that that's going to happen for veteran services, and as well our Medford Community and our Council on Aging.

957
01:25:17,355 --> 01:25:18,076
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is great.

958
01:25:19,997 --> 01:25:24,880
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is nothing else, so thank you very much for joining us, and we will go to the Chief of Staff.

959
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:25,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

960
01:25:33,609 --> 01:25:34,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

961
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:35,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Just one quick item.

962
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:42,514
[SPEAKER_12]: While we're here tonight, um, been working through developing the elections department budget over the course of the last.

963
01:25:43,535 --> 01:25:52,079
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in pieces of time, so to speak, and I also wanted to mention that I am anticipate we are presently anticipating where we're in a

964
01:25:58,963 --> 01:26:10,893
[SPEAKER_12]: information so that when I'm either here to the council to present the deficit for a transfer, or I'm here before the council to present the budget for FY 25, I can answer the questions of the council at that time.

965
01:26:10,933 --> 01:26:13,976
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just figured that might be helpful information to have at this point.

966
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:21,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, one of the pieces of that deficit is a recount, which I think there was a number of different

967
01:26:24,599 --> 01:26:24,679
[SPEAKER_12]: that.

968
01:26:24,699 --> 01:26:25,079
[SPEAKER_12]: We did have some.

969
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:30,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Understandings as we approach that recount, but the bottom line was that the city did pay for it.

970
01:26:30,543 --> 01:26:33,625
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't able to be passed on to the petitioners.

971
01:26:34,005 --> 01:26:46,013
[SPEAKER_12]: So just wanted to put that in the back of your minds and also will be before you either at that transfer time or at the time in which we're discussing the elections budget to discuss it in more depth.

972
01:26:46,413 --> 01:26:46,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Great

973
01:26:53,936 --> 01:27:01,323
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you know, just my only housekeeping on this, do you know when Director Dickinson will be able to get the quarter three materials?

974
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:07,789
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't, my hope is this week, but I don't want to, I don't want to speak for him.

975
01:27:07,849 --> 01:27:10,832
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that I'm pulling and pushing in a lot of different directions.

976
01:27:11,012 --> 01:27:13,074
[SPEAKER_12]: But my hope and my goal is this week.

977
01:27:13,393 --> 01:27:13,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

978
01:27:13,674 --> 01:27:23,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And anything you have, I understand some of it may not be ready yet, but maybe the legislative clerk and finance, the departmental budgets, if we can have those sheets, we can put them in.

979
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,761
[SPEAKER_05]: the packets for everybody for before next Tuesday's meeting.

980
01:27:26,801 --> 01:27:26,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

981
01:27:27,221 --> 01:27:27,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

982
01:27:27,521 --> 01:27:27,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Understood.

983
01:27:27,781 --> 01:27:28,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

984
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:29,582
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, everyone.

985
01:27:29,602 --> 01:27:30,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

986
01:27:30,382 --> 01:27:30,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

987
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:38,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will see you Tuesday, which is just so everyone knows is a reschedule from it's not administration finance of the committee of the whole 6 p.m.

988
01:27:39,126 --> 01:27:43,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Big fun presentation from our leadership team.

989
01:27:43,328 --> 01:27:47,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will also hear the legislative clerk and finance department budgets at that meeting.

990
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:50,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe Vice President Collins will buy us some food.

991
01:27:57,349 --> 01:27:59,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just making sure we traditionally have food at budget meetings.

992
01:27:59,811 --> 01:28:03,493
[SPEAKER_07]: We're starting to have Council Vice President Collins bring us food.

993
01:28:03,513 --> 01:28:06,915
[SPEAKER_04]: To be clear, my only objection is being the one to pick it out.

994
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:08,156
[SPEAKER_07]: To pick it out?

995
01:28:08,196 --> 01:28:08,596
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it?

996
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:10,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want that to happen.

997
01:28:10,437 --> 01:28:12,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Kit, are you not cooking for all of us?

998
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:14,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a fan of Indian food.

999
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:16,151
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, okay.

1000
01:28:16,311 --> 01:28:17,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's we've gone too far.

1001
01:28:17,811 --> 01:28:18,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callaghan.

1002
01:28:18,772 --> 01:28:19,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Move to adjourn.

1003
01:28:19,612 --> 01:28:21,193
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Callaghan to adjourn.

1007
01:28:26,136 --> 01:28:31,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, that was a very like, that was a military attack.

1008
01:28:31,779 --> 01:28:31,939
