Signed, Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vinson, Superintendent of Schools.

18
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:12,425
I will turn it over to you, Dr. Edouard Vinson and Mr. Murphy.

19
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:12,825
Thank you.

20
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:23,719
Today is our third budget and I just look forward to us continuing to go through this process.

21
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:39,165
And I'm going to thank the team for all the hard work that has been happening in order to present the budget to everyone in this new format, organized in a manner that is much more comprehensible for all to understand.

22
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:41,586
So Mr. Murphy, I pass it on to you.

23
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:42,126
Thank you.

24
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:48,675
I hope that that's true, but I look forward to the comments at the end, and we will see whether that assertion is validated or not.

25
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:51,015
So thank you, Dr. Edward, Vincent.

26
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:52,436
Thank you, Mayor, members of the school committee.

27
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:54,636
It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.

28
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:04,219
As the mayor said in announcing the agenda, tonight we're moving into the first group of our academic departments.

29
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,880
We have, as the committee knows, previously presented on May 3rd and May 6th.

30
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:31,707
the budgetary priorities for fiscal year 2022, as they relate to our school communities at the elementary and secondary level, as well as our office of pupil services, under which includes special education health services, counseling, behavioral health, the Curtis Tufts High School, and a variety of other important offices and departments in serving the needs of all students.

31
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:38,172
So for those who are watching their first committee of the whole budget meeting of this season,

32
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:48,376
or any season perhaps, I have over the course of these meetings began this presentation with a recitation of the process that we're in.

33
00:03:48,396 --> 00:04:05,071
I recognize that that may seem repetitive or redundant for those of you who are tuning into each of these meetings or attending or participating, but because these meetings live in perpetuity and people go back and watch them at different points, I do think it's important to

34
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:14,386
make sure that we discuss the context in which these budgetary priorities are being developed and the process under which we are going about building the fiscal year 2022 budget.

35
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:19,807
So if you'll indulge me again, I'm gonna go through the first several slides.

36
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:27,228
I have added a few others, either to keep people on their toes or to just give people context.

37
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:31,109
I'm not sure which exactly, but Mayor, do you have a question before I start the screen sharing?

38
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:34,959
If we could just, right before you screen share, if we could just call the roll.

39
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,200
Oh, of course, sure.

40
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,621
Thanks, Member Vander Kloot.

41
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:38,201
Sure.

42
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:39,782
Jenny Graham?

43
00:04:40,462 --> 00:04:40,702
Here.

44
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,125
Kathy Kretz is on her way.

45
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,767
Melanie McLaughlin is absent.

46
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:51,369
Mia McStone is, I believe, on her way.

47
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,191
So absent, Paul Rousseau?

48
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:56,332
Present.

49
00:04:58,073 --> 00:04:59,874
Paulette Vander Kloot is present.

50
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,098
And Mayor Lungo Kern.

51
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:04,879
Thank you, Member Van de Kloet.

52
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:08,300
For present, three absent as of right now.

53
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:10,881
We have a quorum.

54
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:11,661
We can continue.

55
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:12,522
Great.

56
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:13,662
Thank you.

57
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:16,103
So I'll bring this up.

58
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:27,266
I would also just note, as the committee knows, we did have a few technical difficulties in the district, particularly at the high school over the course of the last two days.

59
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:33,661
That did result in a delay in you receiving the documents that you typically receive prior to these meetings.

60
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:34,761
So I apologize for that.

61
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,321
And thank you for your patience.

62
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:42,723
It also resulted in me not editing the cover slide, as you can now see, because we've already discussed people services.

63
00:05:42,823 --> 00:05:47,504
But prior to this going up on the website, we will rectify that.

64
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:54,906
Let me just, okay.

65
00:05:55,546 --> 00:06:07,230
So we've discussed the, this is the sequence of the budgetary process that began at the beginning of the calendar year with the development of budgetary priorities for the district and continue with a series of internal meetings.

66
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:18,834
This is leading up to the superintendent's recommendation to the school committee for a proposed FY22 budget, which will then lead to the school committee's vote, which will constitute a request to the municipal government.

67
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:24,256
The municipal government weighing all the various priorities and interests of the city will then make an appropriation

68
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:33,714
will then reconvene as the school committee prior to the close of the fiscal year to review the appropriation that's been made, the budgetary priorities that will be fulfilled.

69
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:39,475
And at that time, the administration will ask the school committee to take a vote to adopt an FY22 budget.

70
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:51,618
There are a lot of variables, many of which concern the external funding that is realized on an annual basis and a significant amount of external funding that will be realized for FY22 as it was for FY21

71
00:06:54,028 --> 00:07:03,133
due to the various COVID-19 pandemic mitigation funding sources that are flowing in primarily from the federal government, but the state government as well.

72
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:08,455
So this is where we are right now, as we have been throughout these committees of the whole.

73
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:18,661
We discussed in the pupil services budget, this is the organization that will be in receipt of the tens of millions of dollars that we're discussing.

74
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:20,722
And I did, similar to how

75
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:30,235
We built the flowchart as a way of pointing out to where we are in this process for those tuning in midway through the process.

76
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:35,659
On May 3rd, we discussed the school budgets based at elementary and secondary level.

77
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,580
You'll recall Ms.

78
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:45,487
Scalucci, Dr. Cushing, and representatives from our school leader cohort presenting to you about their information related to the priorities and how they affect their schools.

79
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:49,410
On May 6th, we discussed the Office of Pupil Services.

80
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:53,613
and the special education budget and the various offices under Ms.

81
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:54,793
Bowen's supervision.

82
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,655
And tonight, we're discussing the academic content areas.

83
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:01,236
And we will be hearing from Dr. Cushing and Ms.

84
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:18,624
Galluzzi about some of the high-level priorities that are being developed within these content areas, as well as Dr. Chiesa, director of humanities, Rocco Seri, director of science, Dr. Ricciardelli, director of curriculum and instruction, who is and has been for some time overseeing world languages and fine arts.

85
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:22,553
as well as Rachel Perry, our Director of Physical and Health Education.

86
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:25,494
So that's what we're talking about tonight.

87
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:28,196
And then just a little bit more with regard to process.

88
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:36,440
As we've discussed, the funding comes through our Chapter 70 allocation from the state, as well as our local contribution from the city.

89
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,184
Those are numbers that we have a general idea about, but are still in a developmental stage, as they always are during this time of year.

90
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:46,265
And again, the variable distinguishing FY22

91
00:08:48,289 --> 00:09:00,957
than your normal fiscal years, your pre-pandemic fiscal years, is the significant injection of external funding coming from the federal government with the intent of mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

92
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:13,606
And as we've discussed and we'll discuss as well tonight, as we build this budget, there is the idea that the two sort of conflicting ideas that we've discussed in this forum,

93
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:24,033
One that our ESSER funds, those are funding coming from the federal government, earmarked for schools and meant to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

94
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:37,036
One school of thought that they should be incorporated into the operating budget, and that's their intent because everything we do is in some way related to mitigating the impact of the pandemic from an instructional perspective.

95
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:42,858
And then another school thought that the ESSER funding should be walled off and used solely

96
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:47,719
for priorities that are derived from the impact of the pandemic.

97
00:09:48,019 --> 00:10:08,488
And as we've discussed in the previous two budget forums and meetings previous to that, adopting either of those two positions in a sort of hardened sense is really untenable because our priorities are integrated in many respects between our normal operating priorities and those that we are pursuing for purposes of mitigating the impact of the pandemic.

98
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:11,950
And at the same time, we know that there are additional expenses

99
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:22,130
that our school district and school districts across the country are incurring as a result of the impact that COVID-19 has had on students and the disruption to their instruction.

100
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:32,638
So we are, as we develop this budget, identifying those priorities with the strongest nexus between that pandemic and the work that we're trying to do in the district.

101
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:39,283
And we're identifying those so that as the permissible usage of those external

102
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:46,714
external funding becomes more clear, both at the city level with regard to ARPA funding and at the school district with regard to ESSER funding.

103
00:10:47,054 --> 00:11:05,083
We're keeping those priorities very clearly articulated so that we can be mindful of the sustainability of the priorities that we pursue and also mindful of our obligation to respond in an aggressive fashion to try to ensure that students' academic careers are not defined by this difficult period.

104
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:13,888
Again, I appreciate everyone's patience based on the fact that you've heard this, many of you have heard this several times over the course of the last few weeks.

105
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:35,735
So when we went to our principals and our department heads and asked them to give us their feedback on what they are seeing with regard to what is going to be most useful for purposes of repairing and bringing remedy to the difficulties and challenges that the pandemic has caused, we asked them to essentially bucket their budgetary priorities

106
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:37,598
in three main areas.

107
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:45,881
Personnel and staffing, which for those of you who have been around school budgets for some time know, this is the biggest bulk of our budget is always going to be staffing.

108
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:51,743
We are a people-led organization that is responsible for the well-being of other people.

109
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:55,324
And so people is where most of the money is always going to go.

110
00:11:55,724 --> 00:12:05,768
Materials and infrastructure, and what are the key pieces of materials and infrastructure that may have always been important with regard to having an impact on student outcomes, but is even more important

111
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:35,152
under the conditions in which we're operating with regard to the pandemic, and then training and professional development, which you'll hear a decent amount about that tonight, in part because the external funding that became available in FY21 positioned the Medford Public Schools in a way to really have a good sense as to, and this is actually true for materials and infrastructure as well, but it positioned us and put us in a position where we are able to capitalize on that funding and identify best practices and identify resources

112
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:40,126
that can have a lasting and meaningful impact on our students and our staff.

113
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:44,106
And that is something that I know our directors, as well as Dr. Cushing and Ms.

114
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:51,508
Galussi, will be referring to later this evening as we talk about at a high level what our budgetary priorities are and then field your questions.

115
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:58,149
With regard to the types of investments we're looking for, again, staffing is going to play a significant part of that.

116
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:04,730
We also know that we need to target and engage in intensive interventions with students who

117
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:10,972
have those who have become disengaged from their schooling process or more disengaged than they otherwise would have been.

118
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:17,475
That's, frankly, students who are, in some cases, it's students who are learning remotely, in some cases, students who are learning in person.

119
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:25,998
The effects of this disruption are profound and we are being very cognizant of that as we develop these priorities.

120
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:33,921
There's a number of programming-based initiatives that, again, based on the departments that you're hearing from tonight, that's a piece that will be

121
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:43,742
returning to, and then as we've talked about before, we've made a substantial investment in the vicinity of $2.5 million with regard to instructional technology.

122
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:51,429
And so while there'll always be other priorities that we have to address on a technology front, that is something that we've made significant progress on in the last year.

123
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,876
With regard to the projections that we're looking at right now, as you know, we're coming in with an operating budget of $62.3 million.

124
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:13,684
We look, as we always do at this time, at what are our fixed costs, what are the increases in the budget that are necessary based on contractual obligations, compliance obligations, or the need to just maintain the level of services that we are providing.

125
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:24,266
This is always an estimate in part due to the unrealized external funding that will come in and will offset some of these increases in fixed costs.

126
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:26,647
But at the moment, we would project that at approximately $2.1 million.

127
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:32,183
The middle bucket here are some of the pieces that we'll talk about tonight.

128
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:34,584
And these are some of the priorities that we want to address.

129
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:37,405
And we know that we'll have an impact on students.

130
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,646
That is sort of our goal and our priority bucket.

131
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:55,774
And then our 750 to 2 million are the pieces that, as we know, with nine expiring collective bargaining agreements and that major variable that's as yet undetermined, we know that the, and I apologize, there's still a people services bullet in there too, but I'm going to fast forward so nobody sees it.

132
00:14:56,153 --> 00:15:01,636
we know that that variable is still undetermined and something that we will be addressing in the coming weeks.

133
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:07,880
The ESSER fundings, we're looking at approximately $7.6 million, but again, this is over an extended period of time.

134
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:19,967
But we are identifying those priorities as we go, in part because of the degree to which these priorities are intertwined with one another, and also because of the urgency of some of these priorities.

135
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:24,050
We are in the process of developing what our summer initiatives will be.

136
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:46,715
Those summaries and initiatives, again, are being developed in the context both of needing to have a sense of urgency with regard to the remedial support that students will need after two years of disruption and also being cognizant of the fact that of the exhaustion that students and staff are feeling as a result of the challenges that they've lived through over the course of the last two years.

137
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:52,197
And what I mean by that is we know that we can't just open up a six-week intensive academic camp

138
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:56,344
and expect somehow that's going to magically repair the disruption that's been caused.

139
00:15:56,604 --> 00:16:02,245
And frankly, there's an element of fatigue that we have to factor into all of this as well.

140
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:07,265
But we're trying to be smart and we're trying to be strategic with regard to that.

141
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:16,887
So with that, I'm going to pause for a second to talk a little bit about the departments that we're going to hear from prior to asking Dr. Cushing and Ms.

142
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:20,788
Galussi to walk us through the high-level priorities that they're seeing at their respective levels.

143
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:22,108
And then we'll go through

144
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:36,705
department by department, starting with the humanities department to talk a little bit about the specific initiatives that we will be identifying as our chief priorities coming into fiscal year 2022.

145
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:48,729
So these departments, again, you remember the middle bucket, they're ranging from humanities, science, typically we would have math as well, there was a scheduling conflict there, that was entirely my fault, and you will hear from Ms.

146
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:49,389
Kahn

147
00:16:51,807 --> 00:17:14,779
on May 18th, but the rest of the academic departments, World Languages, Fine Arts, and Health and PE will be, again, they were asked the same questions that our principals were asked as to what are the priorities that we think will have the most significant impact on student outcomes in the context of recovering and repairing the damage caused by this disruption.

148
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,461
So I think we'll start maybe at the, if it's okay with you, Ms.

149
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,002
Gosi, at the elementary level.

150
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:24,643
to talk about some of the high-level priorities that cut across these departments.

151
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:31,146
I think if you could just give us a brief overview, we'll go to Dr. Cushing, and then we'll go department by department.

152
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:37,488
And then at the end of that, after the hearing from each of the directors, we'll be happy to take your questions.

153
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:40,649
If that's okay with you, Mayor, I'll ask Ms.

154
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:45,351
Kalusi to talk a little bit about our high-level elementary priorities within the academics world.

155
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:48,052
That sounds great.

156
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:48,332
Thank you.

157
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:50,921
Thank you very much.

158
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:51,781
Good evening, everyone.

159
00:17:51,801 --> 00:18:00,223
I'm not quite sure if you are going to display something on the screen or do you want me to just I was going to save the slides for the directors, if that's okay.

160
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:04,664
But I can, I can not do that if you'd like.

161
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:08,165
Just because they're department by department.

162
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:12,106
So I thought if you guys just wanted to cover the high level themes and then we'll go to the directors.

163
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:14,406
share twice.

164
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:15,807
share twice.

165
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:16,307
Okay, great.

166
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:17,127
I'll share twice.

167
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:20,799
There we go.

168
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:21,860
So starting with humanities.

169
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:23,801
Thank you.

170
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:24,061
Thank you.

171
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:27,864
So I'll just discuss the high level priorities that are at the elementary level.

172
00:18:28,804 --> 00:18:36,229
In speaking with Dr. Chiesa, we've worked together collaboratively on all of this.

173
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:39,971
One of the things that we've been speaking about is making sure that

174
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:50,042
We know that we're, Dr. Keizer is gonna speak about this, but we wanna make sure that we have the remote platform for ThinkCentral.

175
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:59,864
next year, because that is going to be the continuation of what the students are utilizing, as well as the early literacy screening tools, which she will be speaking about.

176
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:04,728
As you are well aware, we've been piloting both the Lexia and the map growth.

177
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:08,850
She'll discuss a little bit of that, but that needs to continue as well for next year.

178
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:14,915
We've really worked a lot in terms of professional development in the

179
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:21,196
uh, science of reading and in literacy, and we brought in and have partnered with Hill for literacy.

180
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:23,477
We're continuing with that this year.

181
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:31,919
Um, as a matter of fact, this week and next week, there's been some trainings that are happening at grade levels across the district, and Dr Keyes will speak more about that.

182
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,960
But that is a need that will continue.

183
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,020
Um,

184
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:40,628
as well as the program resources that we've utilized this year.

185
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:46,070
Many that were pre-COVID, but a lot that we brought in this year that we want to see continue.

186
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,791
And you'll get a little bit more detail on that.

187
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:53,333
Should we go to Dr. Chiesa for the speaking with humanities?

188
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:54,873
Excuse me, Dr. Cushing?

189
00:19:57,814 --> 00:20:04,817
Well, I think, Dr. Cushing, which of the areas would you like to just touch upon from a high level to secondary level?

190
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:08,738
I don't want to keep, I know people bought their tickets tonight for the directors, so.

191
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:09,979
Right.

192
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:13,201
So I'll just briefly hit all, all of them at once.

193
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:21,146
I think the, at the middle school level, it's a really a focus on restoring what COVID took away in the math and reading interventionists.

194
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:25,068
Those are two, those are actually four critical positions.

195
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:28,911
One in each subject area at each school.

196
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:36,110
that are really designed to be direct boots on the ground, helping students to improve their instructional outcomes.

197
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:54,914
I also, you know, think that there's a critical need for us to make sure that we're following through with our math curriculum updates, which you'll hear about next week, and our literacy and ELA curriculum updates as those come about through the humanities department.

198
00:20:55,668 --> 00:21:07,313
Finally, we're moving forward in the science department with several initiatives and textbooks and things of that nature that Mr. Cieri will be able to really talk about.

199
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:22,060
But it's really the opportunity to restore some of that personality that is direct to kids to provide the supports that are needed and to make sure that we're providing the best supervision and support

200
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:26,813
for our teachers necessary to make sure that they're doing the best that they possibly can.

201
00:21:27,714 --> 00:21:38,520
We've got some amazing educators who've done really well this year, having not been able to replace the interventionists, and I think that's a critical piece for us to move forward with.

202
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:47,064
I'll let the directors carry forward as they're the experts in the fields, and we'll provide you the most up-to-date information.

203
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:48,725
Great.

204
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:53,427
So I think we'll start with humanities.

205
00:21:54,007 --> 00:22:00,352
I know we're building some suspense toward world languages, fine arts and health, but I think that'll be okay.

206
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:18,507
So Dr. Chiesa, if you'd like to take us through with a slightly higher level of specificity related to the investments and priorities as they relate to our ELA and social studies content areas, and then we'll move from there back into science and then

207
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,887
continue on our journey through the academic departments.

208
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:25,310
Certainly.

209
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,031
Good evening, everybody.

210
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:35,378
I want to start by thanking you for all of your support throughout this entire year, both with the budget and beyond.

211
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:43,844
It's obviously been a hectic year, but in the English and Social Studies Department, we've still been moving along quite nicely.

212
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:48,648
Tonight, by looking at the different priorities, I just want you to keep in mind that

213
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:55,800
All of the things that I note here are in an effort to be consistent and equitable K through 12.

214
00:22:56,401 --> 00:23:00,625
So I want to just keep that in mind that we're looking at it at that macro level.

215
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:10,296
In the secondary ELA world, we've been really committed to improving our cultural proficiency and streamlining with our pacing guides.

216
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:33,783
We did have the loss of the reading specialists and that is something that I am asking the committee to look at restoring because given the deficits and gaps and interruptions in learning, I really do feel that those middle school reading specialists will be very important for next year, just as the elementary continue to be quite important.

217
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:39,905
At the elementary level in ELA, we have been really committed to evidence-based literacy practices

218
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:54,801
We spent a lot of time in professional development, and that is something that I feel strongly needs to continue, looking at the science of reading and continuing with promoting our new program, which zones in on the foundational skills in reading.

219
00:23:55,442 --> 00:24:03,967
So that is something that we've been doing for the past year quite comprehensively, but we'll still need to continue to do more.

220
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:16,055
As you know, we have, we will certainly, one of the pieces of that too, is we do have our reading program, which we will eventually, per another presentation, be looking at replacing.

221
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:26,907
But for this year, we're looking at building capacity with the teachers and pulling in additional supports as we embrace the evidence-based literacy practices.

222
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:39,603
And what comes with that, as you can see throughout the requests are assessing the students, both with the early literacy screener which we were able to pilot for the past two years.

223
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:45,269
This January, my department absorbed some of the costs for the remainder of this year.

224
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:51,591
But next year, we know we need to implement an early literacy screener, and there is a cost associated with that.

225
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:57,732
And in addition, what I feel is very important, and what I feel Dr. Cushing and Ms.

226
00:24:57,752 --> 00:25:13,217
Galussi agree, and as well as Dr. Vinson, of course, is procuring an assessment tools for our students' grades three through 11, so that we can get a better understanding of where the gaps and deficits may be as it relates to literacy.

227
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:23,966
If you look at social studies, we have done quite a bit, a reminder that we are fully on to the brand new frameworks for social studies.

228
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:36,397
So we've spent the year adjusting, spending a lot of time on the civics commonwealth project, which is required both through DESE and by law at the eighth and high school level.

229
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:39,080
So we've done quite a bit with that as well.

230
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:50,215
really looking at streamlining the curriculum and figuring out how we're going to cover the gaps and put four years of social studies into freshman, sophomore and junior year of high school.

231
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:53,897
Luckily, we've been able to pilot quite a few books this year.

232
00:25:54,638 --> 00:26:03,564
So we didn't have as extensive a cost and I do anticipate we'll be able to pilot some and have to make some purchasing decisions for others this year.

233
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:06,927
And I don't think the

234
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:10,096
Yeah, the whole screen is up.

235
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:12,157
So yes, I'm happy to answer any questions.

236
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:13,657
I wanted to keep that short and sweet.

237
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:22,840
I did want to point out one thing, and that is that this year, through the CARES Act, literacy was very well supported.

238
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,482
So the budgetary impact increase is quite high, as you can see from ELA.

239
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:32,003
That's due to the fact that we did lose two middle school reading specialists last year.

240
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:35,104
We did lose one high school social studies staff member.

241
00:26:35,664 --> 00:26:37,185
And luckily, Alexia Core 5,

242
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:47,042
and Lexia Power Up were fulfilled through the CARES Act, not my budget, as well as part of Nuzella.

243
00:26:47,363 --> 00:27:00,152
So the reason that budgetary impact is quite extensive is because several of these items were procured through the CARES Act this year, and we found them to be very helpful and really essential for our students.

244
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:04,955
And I think that's one of the common threads you'll see is that

245
00:27:06,623 --> 00:27:18,567
We were put in a position as a result of the external funding, as I said, to identify some best practices and some new innovative tactics or initiatives that we're able to employ.

246
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:34,713
And it's, to some degree, it's fortuitous timing because, as we know, the whole point, the whole sort of backdrop of this budget is that FY22 is going to be a pivotal year with regard to repairing some of that damage done

247
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:40,939
and getting us back to where we'd like to be and positioned for further progress and growth.

248
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:52,787
So with that, Rocco, can you just take us through, I will just point out as Rocco gets ready to walk us through some of the high level science based budget priorities.

249
00:27:53,107 --> 00:28:02,113
The committee knows as we've reported that we are in a relatively good position with regard to our closing out FY22.

250
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,735
And as a result of that, we've been able to

251
00:28:05,462 --> 00:28:14,747
identified funding within the science budget to take care of what would have been an FY22 priority amounting to about $47,000 in the procurement of biology textbooks.

252
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:29,894
So that the elegant line through the word biology there is representative of that and some of the creative thinking that we've been able to employ to put us in a position to address FY22 priorities in science.

253
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:34,236
So Rocco, can you just walk us through science before we move on to our other departments?

254
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,541
Before Rocco walks us through science, member Van de Kloet has a question.

255
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:39,322
Sure.

256
00:28:39,882 --> 00:28:41,783
Well, I'll ask for the preference.

257
00:28:42,023 --> 00:28:43,984
I had a question for Dr. Chiesa.

258
00:28:45,145 --> 00:28:47,427
Do you want to do the whole presentation first, Dave?

259
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,688
I would probably recommend that.

260
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:52,670
I think we've sort of timed it out to do two or three presentations.

261
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,832
minutes per content area.

262
00:28:54,852 --> 00:29:01,598
Obviously, Dr. Gazer overseeing two departments, that's not to suggest that anyone went over.

263
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,085
I think we can run through the next few in short order, and then we can get into all the questions.

264
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:13,269
And I think that's worked fairly well the last two nights, but I would defer to the committee.

265
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,651
Okay, I'm okay to wait.

266
00:29:16,372 --> 00:29:17,293
Okay, thanks.

267
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,069
Good evening, everybody.

268
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:25,350
And thank you for all the support that we've gotten this year.

269
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:42,055
It has been a challenging year across the board, but as Mr. Murphy has pointed out, we've made some decisions and have been able to leverage a lot of things to be able to move forward in science with digital resources.

270
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:48,917
And we've preserved some of the hands-on materials due to the pandemic, so we can move forward

271
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:53,920
a reduction of some sort because of what we have at this point.

272
00:29:54,001 --> 00:30:03,088
So while there aren't as many bullets to review in the science budget, you can see that some things are going to be prioritized.

273
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:08,032
For example, the textbooks in anatomy and physiology and a couple of AP courses.

274
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:10,730
The biology has been taken care of.

275
00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:16,974
The STEM scopes program does require an annual digital license and some consumable materials.

276
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:36,427
Again, these are somewhat reduced given the pandemic has left us with sometimes using less than what we would have needed in a typical situation when remote instruction was more significant.

277
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:44,968
And then we have some smaller items in the FOS kits that we need to replace, consumable materials primarily.

278
00:30:47,049 --> 00:31:00,018
However, as you can see in the long-term budgetary priorities, we will require some more investment to replenish the kits in future years, to replenish consumable supplies, wear and tear on some of the hands-on materials.

279
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:06,242
So while we're moving forward and it seems like there aren't big ticket items at the moment,

280
00:31:07,191 --> 00:31:12,053
We do anticipate in future budgets that there will be some bigger ticket items.

281
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:22,658
We also think that it would be very beneficial to support inclusivity and differentiation with NewZilla.

282
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:33,003
NewZilla is something that teachers are using in other subject areas and also is being used by our science teachers and we want to really continue that use.

283
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:43,722
Within the department, we found these articles very supportive of the types of nonfiction reading and also writing for students.

284
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:55,109
And as we move forward and we think about what kinds of opportunities we want to provide for students, we will likely look at some extended school day programs for science.

285
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,071
We're not quite sure what that will be at the moment, but certainly

286
00:31:59,595 --> 00:32:12,756
something to recapture some of the losses and hands on activities that we've been so strong at in K to eight instruction and even up in the ninth and 12th grade instructional areas, we don't want to.

287
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:16,748
we want to really recapture some of that moving forward.

288
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:39,867
So really, even though there are a small number of bullets and doesn't look like very high cost items, we really are in a position to strengthen science due to last year and the year before, the continuous investment, K to five and then K to eight, and now going into the ninth through 12th grade.

289
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:43,550
So we'll take questions after.

290
00:32:44,717 --> 00:32:46,619
but this is what we have for you at the moment.

291
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:47,920
Thanks, Rago.

292
00:32:47,940 --> 00:33:05,413
And I think just to sort of point out the sort of interconnectedness of this budget, the committee's heard us say on a number of occasions that as we look toward the 21-22 school year, we're looking to see what variables we can control as we work to rebuild our capacity and try to serve students while in the wake of the pandemic.

293
00:33:05,574 --> 00:33:13,800
And when we think about one of those variables being the length of the school day and start to think in terms of extended school days and potential afterschool programs,

294
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:16,434
as a way of providing some of that support and instruction.

295
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:25,377
Oftentimes, we're thinking in terms of, especially in the K-8 world, of additional math support and additional literacy support.

296
00:33:25,657 --> 00:33:29,679
And that's important, and there's a reason that those are foundational content areas.

297
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:38,542
We also know that for some students, getting them to participate and enroll in an extended day program of some kind, science is going to be one of the major draws.

298
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:41,123
And that's part of why we want to make sure that we are

299
00:33:41,773 --> 00:33:44,455
Providing as much content and exposure to science as possible.

300
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:49,699
We also know that sometimes science is what's going to get students in the door to participate in a program like that.

301
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:55,043
So that we can then make sure that they're also getting some of the remedial support and math and literacy that they might need.

302
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:56,944
So thank you for that.

303
00:33:56,965 --> 00:34:04,310
And I'm going to ask Bernadette to start with world languages before transitioning into our finance discussion.

304
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:09,869
It's muted.

305
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:11,250
Good evening.

306
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,351
Good evening, everyone.

307
00:34:13,412 --> 00:34:19,718
So I am here tonight to go over the superintendent's draft priorities for world language.

308
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:34,392
So as I brought up and presented at the curriculum subcommittee meeting, in world language, we are planning to introduce French in grade six.

309
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:38,694
That will require the purchase of textbooks.

310
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:46,117
We believe that at this point we can introduce French in grade six with current staffing levels.

311
00:34:47,257 --> 00:34:52,859
Also in the middle school level, there is a need for textbooks in all three languages.

312
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,520
So that would be the French, Italian, and Spanish.

313
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:04,663
It has been years, probably 18 years since textbooks were adopted for those

314
00:35:05,341 --> 00:35:05,922
those grades.

315
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:18,411
Grades six, seven, and eight collectively are level one of the language, so it is really important to have that, to have the text, to have those materials, to really ground the students in their learning.

316
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:32,623
Looking outside, looking beyond, one thing that we thought might be really helpful is, as you know, the World Language Department sponsors many trips to different places.

317
00:35:34,104 --> 00:35:39,887
Most recently, they had planned to go to France, that was last year, and that trip was canceled because of COVID.

318
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:52,763
Because those trips are quite costly, we are thinking that in the future it would be nice to be able to offset those costs with some opportunity programs.

319
00:35:55,214 --> 00:36:10,201
In terms of getting our students up and running and recovering from the loss that occurred during COVID, I will say I think our teachers have done a phenomenal job, but still there are areas where there is going to have to be some bolstering.

320
00:36:10,762 --> 00:36:16,645
So trying to think outside the box, we are thinking that perhaps a peer tutoring program

321
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:18,926
could be established.

322
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:34,195
We have a newly formed World Language Honor Society, and we are thinking that we could use those upperclassmen to help in a peer tutoring program, similar to what the National Honor Society does for English, math, and other subjects.

323
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:45,587
With regard to professional development, just within the past three weeks, the new frameworks for world language were approved by the Board of Education.

324
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:55,813
And although they're not drastically different, there are some differences that need to be addressed, and we need to offer professional development to our staff.

325
00:36:56,473 --> 00:36:57,674
in that area.

326
00:36:58,074 --> 00:37:11,224
We also wanna offer professional development that is going to help teachers accelerate the instruction at an appropriate pace to try to recoup some of that learning loss that happened during COVID.

327
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:24,053
There is the possibility that if we're able to offer a potential extended day program, world languages would be one of the options for students.

328
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:30,105
So those are the highlights.

329
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:34,728
I think we'll go right to fine arts now, if that works for you.

330
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:35,569
It does.

331
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:36,149
Great.

332
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:54,189
Okay, so last June I was asked upon the retirement of the former director to step in and I am enjoying the experience working with the music and the art departments.

333
00:37:54,950 --> 00:38:05,276
When I came on, the concern with the teachers and of myself was how do we get our students ready for remote instruction, for hybrid instruction?

334
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,557
So we got together as a team

335
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,196
And we looked at programs.

336
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:18,699
So we looked at Quaver, we looked at the Art of Education for Art, and we brought in those programs to help us, again, with the remote and the hybrid.

337
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:30,523
What we have discovered is that there are many elements of those programs that extend beyond remote and hybrid that would be useful and really helpful for our students moving forward.

338
00:38:32,825 --> 00:38:37,430
Right now we have a high school teacher who does travel to the Curtis Tufts School.

339
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:42,176
I would like to see an expansion of opportunities at the Curtis Tufts.

340
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:44,318
I have spoken to the director over there.

341
00:38:44,678 --> 00:38:52,627
I think the students should have every opportunity available that other students have at the Curtis.

342
00:38:53,951 --> 00:39:06,343
With regard to long-term budgetary priorities, whether this is this year or moving forward, looking at a supervisor coordinator that has specific fine arts content experience.

343
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,646
Some of you know that I was a social studies teacher.

344
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:15,532
Although I have a lot of management experience, actually 14 years as an administrator,

345
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:20,124
You know fine arts is not my content area.

346
00:39:20,864 --> 00:39:31,329
I've been able to use my management experience, my ability to work with the teams to refine curriculum, and to move forward with the program.

347
00:39:33,977 --> 00:39:50,915
One of the one of the target areas that we're identifying is the increasing the inventory of instruments that we have available to our students, specifically the ukuleles and guitars for middle school level this is going to allow each student to have an instrument in the classroom.

348
00:39:51,937 --> 00:40:00,848
That is really important because right now it's one, they're either sharing and right now during COVID, really can't share.

349
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:05,374
So it's difficult when not everyone in the class has an instrument.

350
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:08,979
So we really would like to bolster the supply of instruments.

351
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:17,828
With regard to funding, what I'm looking for is what we had for the 1920 school year.

352
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:25,472
Last year that budget was cut because a lot of the art supplies, the transportation lines weren't used.

353
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:29,216
the budget was cut back.

354
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:33,640
I am hoping that we are able to restore that to 19-20 levels.

355
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:37,024
That includes the line for transportation.

356
00:40:37,545 --> 00:40:40,108
Our banned travels, this year they did not.

357
00:40:40,548 --> 00:40:46,615
We anticipate next year we'll be back on track and the travel will resume.

358
00:40:48,282 --> 00:41:02,149
Again, like world language, trying to think outside the box, we're looking at other opportunities for some online peer tutoring, and then, you know, perhaps having staff members serve in a mentoring role to support that type of a program.

359
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,632
Those are the highlights of the Fine Arts program moving forward.

360
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,833
And again, at the end of the program, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

361
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:12,394
Thank you, Dr. Rizali.

362
00:41:12,414 --> 00:41:14,035
And then we'll go now to Ms.

363
00:41:14,115 --> 00:41:15,516
Perry, who will walk us through

364
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:23,832
FY 22 budgetary priorities for the health and PE program.

365
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:24,812
Good evening, everybody.

366
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:26,053
Right before Ms.

367
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:29,855
Perry speaks, I just want to note that Member Kretz is now present.

368
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:31,876
Go ahead, Ms.

369
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:32,096
Perry.

370
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:32,417
Thank you.

371
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:33,497
You're welcome.

372
00:41:33,978 --> 00:41:34,878
Good evening, everybody.

373
00:41:34,898 --> 00:41:40,341
I want to take the time to thank you all for your help and support all year long through this crazy time.

374
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:45,595
Remote instruction has been difficult, especially in phys ed and health education.

375
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:52,821
But I also wanna thank my staff for their hard work and dedication to our students and keeping them active and healthy throughout this year.

376
00:41:54,182 --> 00:42:00,487
We have been committed to building a curriculum to health and physical education based on our national standards.

377
00:42:01,107 --> 00:42:07,633
And we're looking forward to unpacking the state standards and aligning them at when they come out, hopefully by the fall of next year.

378
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:13,777
Our goal is to provide quality physical education and health education to all of our students.

379
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:22,536
Looking at our budgetary priorities for next year, I have asked in the past for a couple of additional positions.

380
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,658
And again, I will be asking for those this year.

381
00:42:25,158 --> 00:42:28,781
One being a certified adaptive physical education teacher.

382
00:42:29,262 --> 00:42:38,089
As a direct service, the adaptive phys ed teacher will be provided to students who have needs that cannot be adequately addressed in regular phys ed program.

383
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:45,993
This teacher will assess recommended students and specifically design or modify physical education lessons to meet the needs of the student.

384
00:42:47,874 --> 00:42:49,655
And that would be across the district.

385
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,697
We're looking also for a health teacher.

386
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:59,781
This would be specifically in the middle school to relieve school counselors of the classroom based duties.

387
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:01,622
Right now we have a

388
00:43:02,522 --> 00:43:06,945
one middle school health teacher that goes from the Andrews over to the McGlynn.

389
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:11,228
If we had an additional one, we would have one health teacher at each building.

390
00:43:12,388 --> 00:43:19,553
Another piece also would be to add staffing at the Curtis Tufts High School to make sure that we are equitable there as well.

391
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:23,735
And we have licensed teachers teaching our students in that location.

392
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:30,660
Looking at our long-term budgetary priorities, one of the things we were looking at is

393
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:35,350
creating a yoga studio at the high school for our yoga classes for our students.

394
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:43,515
This could also cross over to before or after school activities where we could offer classes at both of those times.

395
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:47,397
We're also looking to replenish some of our equipment.

396
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:54,801
We were remote this year for a great part of the year, as well as not using equipment till later in the year.

397
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:58,043
So we were able to save some money this year and not have to purchase equipment.

398
00:43:58,363 --> 00:43:59,984
But going forward, we will have to

399
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:02,445
start to replenish some of that equipment.

400
00:44:04,085 --> 00:44:16,769
And looking at our COVID mitigation priority, offering some opportunities for our kids before and after school to stay, to continue to be physically fit, maybe some kind of health activity, healthy cooking, things like that.

401
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,830
Those would be great opportunities for our students to take part in.

402
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,731
And that's it for health in physical education.

403
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:27,132
I'll be glad to answer questions when we are able to.

404
00:44:27,152 --> 00:44:29,433
Thank you very much.

405
00:44:30,037 --> 00:44:30,517
Rachel.

406
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,358
You're welcome.

407
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,160
And so I'm going to pull this off just for the time being.

408
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,962
So it's a little easier to see each other.

409
00:44:39,022 --> 00:44:44,625
But if there are specific references that anyone would like, it's only a couple of quick clicks away.

410
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:46,186
So I'll be happy to go back to the slides.

411
00:44:46,286 --> 00:44:50,788
But just to sort of finish up with regard to the points that Ms.

412
00:44:50,828 --> 00:44:59,853
Perry was making, as we're developing this, I understand the need for a really flexible mindset and to some degree more patience than many of us are.

413
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:06,194
well suited to exercise due to the uncertainties related to some of the external funding.

414
00:45:07,134 --> 00:45:12,936
We are attempting to push ourselves and to think as creatively as possible.

415
00:45:12,996 --> 00:45:24,921
So I know that in this, the committee has asked them on several occasions in the past with regard to how to prioritize and make reality adaptive PE in the district.

416
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:27,822
And so you could see as Ms.

417
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:28,602
Perry articulated,

418
00:45:29,325 --> 00:45:39,134
we're essentially taking a bit of a hybrid approach in that in the short term, we are looking to fund a position to bring on board an individual certified in adaptive PE.

419
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:48,964
That is not a solution long term with regard to making sure that our PE classes are inclusive and are accessible in an equitable manner for all students.

420
00:45:49,464 --> 00:45:52,527
And so our long term priority

421
00:45:53,215 --> 00:45:56,156
And as you can see on the slide, it's not terribly long-term.

422
00:45:56,196 --> 00:45:59,518
This is something we're talking about for the 22-23 school year.

423
00:45:59,978 --> 00:46:15,624
It is our expectation that we will require an adaptive PE certification, at least one per building, to make sure that our classes are, as I said, being properly inclusive and making sure that those opportunities are available to all students.

424
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:20,506
That alone might not solve that, resolve that challenge in its entirety.

425
00:46:20,983 --> 00:46:23,025
but it will certainly put us in a much better position.

426
00:46:23,425 --> 00:46:28,169
There are some obligations that the district will have to fulfill in order to make that a reality.

427
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:34,274
And that's something that we have and we'll be communicating to our bargaining partners as appropriate in the coming weeks and months.

428
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:43,502
So with that, we are more than happy to take your questions and hear your feedback as we have in the previous budget meetings.

429
00:46:43,522 --> 00:46:46,665
And I'll stop talking for that.

430
00:46:50,211 --> 00:46:50,952
Yes, thank you.

431
00:46:51,553 --> 00:47:01,184
So I could, if I would suggest that we do questions subject by subject, so that all members can ask questions about a particular subject and then we move on.

432
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:04,729
I'd like to start since Dr. Chiesa was first.

433
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:06,991
English language arts.

434
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:13,916
Nicole, you referenced that in the future we're going to be looking at our reading program journeys.

435
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:18,420
As you know, it's been under fire from community members quite a bit.

436
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:28,387
So could you just define when you say does in the future mean next year we're going to be looking at reading or could you just address that?

437
00:47:29,088 --> 00:47:29,608
Absolutely.

438
00:47:29,668 --> 00:47:33,712
So I have talked about this a few times at committees of the whole and

439
00:47:34,649 --> 00:47:36,329
at a separate meeting with parents.

440
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:49,552
So we do know that we are certainly planning to update our core reading program, no question there, and that's been made clear numerous times throughout the course of the past two years, really.

441
00:47:49,952 --> 00:48:03,974
The plan this year, and the only thing I will say that may disturb this plan in a good way, in a more expedited way, is that we did today submit a grant that might expedite the process.

442
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:10,352
If we do not receive the grant, the plan is to form a reading committee this year.

443
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:19,463
So it's out for this year to form a committee with teachers towards the end of this year and into the summer to begin looking at new core reading programs.

444
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,665
We will continue next year to

445
00:48:23,343 --> 00:48:35,706
make sure that we're looking at solid programs that meet the needs of all students in Medford, and then we would begin the piloting process with a final selection once the pilot is done.

446
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:46,810
The reason, as Member Van de Kloot, you may recall, is because math is also set to be updated.

447
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:52,111
We have to think about the capacity of our teachers and their ability to pilot a new program.

448
00:48:52,983 --> 00:48:57,624
Now, with all that said, I will say that today with Ms.

449
00:48:57,664 --> 00:48:58,464
Glucy, Ms.

450
00:48:58,484 --> 00:48:59,244
Campbell, and Ms.

451
00:48:59,264 --> 00:49:08,386
Champoli, we also submitted Medford Applied, and of course with Dr. Vincent's endorsement, Medford Applied for the GLEAM grant.

452
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:19,168
The GLEAM grant would expedite this process so that it would be done a year earlier, and the state would contribute half of the funding towards a new core reading program.

453
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:21,029
It's a very competitive grant.

454
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:22,249
We spent numerous hours

455
00:49:22,979 --> 00:49:28,785
working on that grant to make it, to make, you know, hopefully us as the selection.

456
00:49:29,285 --> 00:49:33,810
And should we do that, the plan that I just outlined for you would occur a year earlier.

457
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:43,039
Regardless, right now we are looking at new core reading programs and we do anticipate piloting as soon as possible.

458
00:49:44,863 --> 00:49:45,563
Okay, great.

459
00:49:46,544 --> 00:49:47,524
Thanks for that update.

460
00:49:47,704 --> 00:50:05,391
Just as part of that question, I just wanna know, the community member who spoke the other day at the school committee meeting also mentioned, and she's mentioned this before multiple times, the use of some teachers, and she didn't clarify whether this was an ongoing problem.

461
00:50:05,471 --> 00:50:09,873
I know she's suggested it in the past, but they were using picture clues.

462
00:50:10,394 --> 00:50:11,214
And you've mentioned

463
00:50:12,094 --> 00:50:17,937
in our professional development, development on science-based evidence for reading.

464
00:50:18,357 --> 00:50:27,760
So this little issue about teachers using picture clues, has that kind of now been discussed with the science-based evidence?

465
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:34,523
The evidence-based literacy and science of reading do not support picture cues per se.

466
00:50:34,563 --> 00:50:36,784
It would not be the main go-to.

467
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:38,825
Just this past week, we had a

468
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:51,945
We began a very small group PD where we have like kindergarten teachers working with Hill for Literacy on ECRI.

469
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:55,427
ECRI is phonological awareness, the foundational skills.

470
00:50:55,487 --> 00:51:04,354
There were no picture cues for that phonics piece that are part of our new ECRI program, which is

471
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,225
where I think the phonics would be coming from.

472
00:51:07,405 --> 00:51:19,074
I do not know the exact specifics of what was being referenced, but our science of reading and all the PD is not discussing picture cues.

473
00:51:20,255 --> 00:51:21,856
And just one quick last one.

474
00:51:22,276 --> 00:51:24,278
When will we find out about the GLEAM grant?

475
00:51:24,338 --> 00:51:26,900
And by the way, thank you all for applying for it.

476
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,462
I actually don't know when.

477
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:31,823
I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

478
00:51:31,843 --> 00:51:32,964
We submitted today.

479
00:51:32,984 --> 00:51:42,332
I do anticipate it's extremely competitive, but we really put a lot of energy into it, but I don't, I believe by the mid-summer, we would know.

480
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:44,674
That's my anticipation.

481
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:52,540
Yes, because then the work begins according to the timeline on the grant, the work begins in fall of this year.

482
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,102
All right, so we'll keep our,

483
00:51:54,797 --> 00:51:56,358
Yeah, it would be wonderful.

484
00:51:56,418 --> 00:52:06,225
It would allow us, we have really worked hard to partner with some very reputable organizations like Hill for Literacy, Dr. Orkin, and Crafting Minds.

485
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:20,896
And part of this grant, it's not just about funds, of course, that's wonderful, but the other piece is we would have the ability to work exclusively with a literacy consultant who subscribes to these practices.

486
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:25,245
So we would have them with us as we go through the selection process.

487
00:52:25,305 --> 00:52:28,386
So I am very hopeful that we will get this grant.

488
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:29,767
Thank you.

489
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:30,688
Thank you.

490
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:36,250
Member Graham.

491
00:52:39,592 --> 00:52:39,992
Thank you.

492
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:53,907
I thought at the beginning of your conversation about the grant, you said that the reason that we couldn't move faster in replacing the journey's curriculum is because the teachers can't absorb two new curricula at the same time.

493
00:52:53,947 --> 00:52:56,709
So effectively math and reading at the same time.

494
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:59,590
But if we get this grant that magically that problem goes away?

495
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,492
No, of course not.

496
00:53:02,352 --> 00:53:07,315
I think what we would then have to do, and that would be a conversation of course, with Dr. Vincent and Ms.

497
00:53:07,335 --> 00:53:08,476
Galussi and Ms.

498
00:53:08,496 --> 00:53:11,038
Khan, would be we would have to make a decision on

499
00:53:11,508 --> 00:53:14,752
Right now, we have mathematics going first because there's a great need.

500
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:23,142
We would probably have to make a flip, but I don't want to speak for our superintendent, but certainly the funds would have a twist to it.

501
00:53:23,963 --> 00:53:27,828
Dr. Vincent, does that sound accurate to you or am I misrepresenting?

502
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:39,813
And to member Graham's question, this grant was such a great opportunity that we really didn't want it to go by.

503
00:53:40,753 --> 00:53:47,496
What was stated in the subcommittee meeting about really trying to balance the capacity of the teachers.

504
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:53,738
And I'm not saying it from the perspective of thinking that there's a limited intellectual capacity.

505
00:53:54,658 --> 00:53:59,921
I know that they have the capacity to learn more than one content area at a time.

506
00:54:00,261 --> 00:54:21,193
But to really be able to fully absorb curriculum the same way they had the opportunity to absorb and learn the FOSS science and continue with their other content area, by adding one layer, we wanted to give them that opportunity to go deeper with the next content area.

507
00:54:22,574 --> 00:54:37,809
This Gleam grant offered by the state was such a great opportunity that if in fact Medford is selected, we would have to kind of go back to the drawing board to figure it out.

508
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,732
I personally am a proponent of doing something

509
00:54:41,633 --> 00:55:05,853
across the board doing it fairly and in an equitable fashion but it was such a great opportunity we did not want to let that opportunity pass by but we would have to if in fact we were to find out in the summer that we were awarded the grant then we would have to really strategize and just look at where we are at right now and

510
00:55:08,335 --> 00:55:13,639
what we could do to meet the needs of the state grant and the needs of the district.

511
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,582
I hope that is helpful Member Graham.

512
00:55:18,213 --> 00:55:18,693
Thank you.

513
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:30,222
Yeah, and as somebody who spends most of my professional life educating adults, it's not about intellectual capacity, but you get out what you put in.

514
00:55:30,342 --> 00:55:36,586
So I'm completely in support of not drowning our teachers in new content.

515
00:55:36,706 --> 00:55:37,927
I think that's really unfair.

516
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,629
It's not fair to students.

517
00:55:40,229 --> 00:55:43,812
It's definitely noteworthy in the middle of a pandemic

518
00:55:44,532 --> 00:55:54,519
recovery and a pretty considerable set of variety that we will see in the classroom come fall.

519
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:59,783
I think differentiated learning is going to be harder than it's ever been before because I don't

520
00:56:00,343 --> 00:56:03,365
the pandemic has not impacted every student in the same way.

521
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:16,692
So I think that all of those complexities, like I still remain concerned about that, but I also remain concerned about all of the kids that we are not serving with our ELA program.

522
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:25,837
And I would ask that regardless of whether we get this grant, we do all the creative thinking you plan to do about how to juggle this,

523
00:56:28,311 --> 00:56:33,653
Anyway, and whatever support you need, let's talk about what that support is.

524
00:56:34,154 --> 00:56:36,814
We talked about two different ESSER grants.

525
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:40,476
There's American Rescue Plan money coming to the city.

526
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:46,458
The grant funding certainly is a very big deal and it would be welcome.

527
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:53,039
if there is a way for us to be much more creative about how we accomplish these goals.

528
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:03,088
Like, unfortunately, we have a lot of curriculum deficiencies, particularly at the elementary level, and those only built.

529
00:57:03,568 --> 00:57:07,331
So fixing those at the foundation will pay off in spades.

530
00:57:08,452 --> 00:57:16,779
So I would just ask that you all do that creative thinking regardless of whether this grant comes through and figure out how to move faster on behalf of the students.

531
00:57:17,597 --> 00:57:42,423
And I just want to also just comment that it is true, we are aware that we've been using Journeys for quite some time, but I really have to say under the leadership of Dr. Chiesa and what she's doing with the humanities team, pursuing partnerships with Hill for Literacy, the work with Dr. Orkin, the ECRI training that they're receiving that although we're using an older

532
00:57:43,563 --> 00:57:53,809
program right now that isn't, you know, as current as we would want it to be, we are supplementing and finding ways to enhance what is available.

533
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:59,012
So I don't want people to feel that, oh, you know, this is 10 years old.

534
00:57:59,752 --> 00:58:14,088
And it's outdated, I think the professional development, the training and really trying to be creative with making sure that we're adding appropriate professional development that that is supporting and supplementing what is happening in the

535
00:58:14,468 --> 00:58:25,897
So I don't want people to feel like, oh, you know, literacy is being completely neglected because we are, given the givens, we are being very creative.

536
00:58:26,077 --> 00:58:32,802
And I'm very appreciative of what Dr. Chiesa has been doing to supplement the programming that is in place.

537
00:58:33,952 --> 00:58:43,496
Yeah, and I would just close by saying, I think all the ways that we're supplementing are an indicator that our program is deficient.

538
00:58:43,596 --> 00:58:48,037
So I don't care if it's 10 years old, if it's still good, but it's deficient.

539
00:58:48,538 --> 00:58:52,259
And that's sort of unequivocal at this point.

540
00:58:52,819 --> 00:58:55,460
So I think, to me, that's the big driver.

541
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:59,202
The age doesn't bother me if we feel like it's supporting things.

542
00:59:00,562 --> 00:59:10,086
When we're bolting all kinds of things onto something, the foundational issue there is what we have isn't working, and we're working really hard to make it work.

543
00:59:12,587 --> 00:59:19,729
And I would just challenge that if we have to work that hard to like bolt lots of things to it, then it is the problem.

544
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:22,430
And we need to sort of solve that root cause.

545
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,031
Otherwise, we're going to spend a lot more energy trying to

546
00:59:27,027 --> 00:59:28,228
sort of make up the gap.

547
00:59:28,788 --> 00:59:36,893
So I just want to make sure that you all know that I am absolutely in support of whatever you need from this committee.

548
00:59:36,913 --> 00:59:45,179
I think it would be a more than appropriate use of funds in any of those categories to figure out how we do this more quickly.

549
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:47,339
Thank you, Member Graham.

550
00:59:47,379 --> 01:00:01,472
I just want to respond and say one of the pieces we are making a deep effort is to continue to get feedback from not only teachers and going through that inclusive process to bring everyone along, including family members.

551
01:00:01,933 --> 01:00:03,775
So I think that's also what's

552
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:15,945
making our process of piloting curriculum taking a little longer because we are trying to have teachers involved, getting buy-in, getting the feedback from the experts.

553
01:00:16,265 --> 01:00:23,512
And so by doing that and providing opportunities for more people to weigh in, it prolongs, it lengthens the process.

554
01:00:24,072 --> 01:00:27,175
instead of saying we're making a decision and this is the final decision.

555
01:00:27,715 --> 01:00:42,868
So I just also want to say yes to what you said, but the reasoning behind the longer process is to be able to have more voices weigh in so that we can feel very confident that we've made an inclusive decision and many voices were heard.

556
01:00:43,568 --> 01:00:43,929
Thank you.

557
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:48,112
If I can just, may I just say one extra, one additional thing?

558
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:48,593
Yes.

559
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:57,217
I want to thank you first, I want to thank you for your support member Graham because I certainly will need it as we continue on looking at core programs.

560
01:00:57,637 --> 01:01:08,782
One of the biggest deficits that we noticed with journeys was the foundational skills, and so I feel very fortunate that we've been able to find a strong phonics program to support.

561
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:10,319
our students.

562
01:01:10,399 --> 01:01:17,024
So that was one of the big deficits and the phonics is moving along nicely, which is good.

563
01:01:17,724 --> 01:01:31,134
The assessment tool that's listed on the budget as well is something where we're looking at, you know, moving towards an assessment tool that will give us better indicators of where we need support.

564
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:38,699
And the great thing about Lexia Core 5 is it does have those tier two interventions built in like letters.

565
01:01:39,272 --> 01:01:48,838
like Power Up, like Core 5, that will really be beneficial as we begin to personalize the reading needs, especially given the interruptions.

566
01:01:48,898 --> 01:01:50,539
But thank you so much for your support.

567
01:01:58,263 --> 01:01:59,124
Member Russo.

568
01:02:00,485 --> 01:02:01,045
Thank you, Mayor.

569
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:02,426
Thank you for the presentation.

570
01:02:03,206 --> 01:02:06,148
And I'm happy to see

571
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:09,531
even though we've been in a pandemic, but there has been progress.

572
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:19,137
Not that I didn't expect that you would continue working during the pandemic, but I just, I don't see any reading specialists for the high school.

573
01:02:19,477 --> 01:02:33,525
And, you know, I know that the superintendent's goals from her first, after her first year, math was pretty much, was the number one goal.

574
01:02:33,906 --> 01:02:35,767
I know you all can walk and chew gum at the same time,

575
01:02:36,165 --> 01:02:39,066
So it's not like I think it's all math and nothing else happens.

576
01:02:39,286 --> 01:02:40,546
I don't think that for a second.

577
01:02:40,946 --> 01:02:50,269
But when I look at reading, I keep going back to the only two studies I can find on reading.

578
01:02:51,210 --> 01:03:01,873
And the two studies show that about half the prisoners in our entire prison system are dyslexic and two thirds of them have terrible reading comprehension.

579
01:03:02,957 --> 01:03:08,262
both of those things seem like rather critical inputs to literally every other academic area.

580
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:26,897
If you're dyslexic and have terrible reading comprehension and haven't had the services to overcome your dyslexia or compensate, I don't think any of us believe looking at what we see on MCAS questions or SAT questions, that there's a chance for these kids.

581
01:03:29,019 --> 01:03:30,921
There isn't, let's just be clear and honest.

582
01:03:31,452 --> 01:03:45,741
You know, if you get out of our high school and your reading comprehension is not good, you know, we're not sending you off into the world with the skills you need and that's on us.

583
01:03:46,862 --> 01:03:58,369
So I just, you know, if we have to choose between math and reading, regardless of the, sorry, I'm a little tired today, of the grant,

584
01:03:59,187 --> 01:04:05,990
I mean, I will, as I have said multiple times at each budget, reading should be ahead of math.

585
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:07,590
It should be ahead of world languages.

586
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:13,233
It should be ahead of even music, which I tend to struggle to put anything ahead of fine arts.

587
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:26,618
But if our kids are not, all of our kids are not reading and having exceptional, you know, meeting standards, according to the state for reading comprehension,

588
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:37,327
You know, I find it, I feel like we will then, you know, when that is evident, we turn to look at our AP and honors students and be very proud of that.

589
01:04:37,547 --> 01:04:38,247
And we should be.

590
01:04:39,548 --> 01:04:49,994
But I just feel like that focusing on the bright spots and not focusing where there isn't much light is a real problem.

591
01:04:51,275 --> 01:04:54,977
It's not a Medford only problem, of course, but I just,

592
01:04:56,623 --> 01:05:10,613
you know, the schedule that I heard sounded like one or two years, maybe we'll have all the staff up and running and then we'll be not putting out students that are not getting what they need to be able to read properly.

593
01:05:10,633 --> 01:05:16,017
And, but then again, this budget does not include any high school reading specialists.

594
01:05:17,058 --> 01:05:23,723
And so, you know, the last 10 years of students, we're just gonna not,

595
01:05:24,366 --> 01:05:24,966
worry about them?

596
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,288
I don't know.

597
01:05:26,308 --> 01:05:27,448
It just feels a bit like that.

598
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:29,690
I'm certainly not going to not worry about them, Mr. Tsai.

599
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:46,884
I think that if Dr. Gazer would like to respond to the substantive point with regard to the importance of that level, but before that, I would just say that while you're correct that, I mean, the elementary reading specialists that have been prioritized and are one of the chief priorities of the overall budget process are also not listed.

600
01:05:46,904 --> 01:05:53,690
That's a departmental, that's a manifestation of the way in which we're structured, that as you know,

601
01:05:54,454 --> 01:06:00,216
those were presented on May 3rd of the school budget and that wouldn't necessarily land on the humanities budget here.

602
01:06:00,616 --> 01:06:05,518
I think there are three variables that we always have to keep in mind in the development of all budgetary priorities.

603
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:12,160
One is the limitation on funding, which here, that is not what's driving this process.

604
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,701
As you know, we're assessing the authentic needs of the district to build that.

605
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,682
And at the same time, we have to be mindful of the

606
01:06:18,202 --> 01:06:21,124
that there are always parameters in which we're operating.

607
01:06:21,564 --> 01:06:33,012
The second piece is that there's a limitation on people and that we are in this process through ESSER funding and through operating funding, going to be adding to our headcount in all likelihood.

608
01:06:33,532 --> 01:06:45,540
And in doing so, we have to be mindful that if we had, and generally speaking, they're not necessarily the same pool of people, but if we have, we have to, to some degree, prioritize as to where we think those

609
01:06:45,993 --> 01:06:52,016
those human resources can be concentrated, which leads to the third variable, which is what can be the most impactful.

610
01:06:52,476 --> 01:07:09,365
And so when we look at this, these budgetary priorities in the context of coming out of years of disruption, it is true that we are in some respects focusing on the K-8 levels as to where we think the investments can be most consequential.

611
01:07:09,705 --> 01:07:15,648
And that third one is not to in any way say that we just, we ignore, we neglect, and certainly that we don't care,

612
01:07:16,122 --> 01:07:17,943
about what's happening at the high school level.

613
01:07:18,203 --> 01:07:27,126
But there is a responsibility to be thoughtful about where the resources can be maximized to have the biggest impact.

614
01:07:27,446 --> 01:07:40,810
And I think those three variables go into identifying the four elementary reading intervention specialists that you've heard about, the restoration of the literacy intervention specialists at the middle school level.

615
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:45,692
And it's our hope that there will be other ways in which we can invest and prioritize

616
01:07:46,065 --> 01:07:48,747
in a way that will assist the older students as well.

617
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:55,633
But, you know, I think there is a reality, I think, to the level of the sort of consequential nature of the dollars.

618
01:07:55,694 --> 01:07:58,436
So, Nicole, did you want to add anything to that?

619
01:07:58,836 --> 01:08:07,404
Yeah, I just want to quickly add, I do value your point, Mr. Russo, and I don't know, it seems like eons ago, but when we had our wish list, you know,

620
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:12,064
over a year ago, we did talk about pulling in a high school reading specialist.

621
01:08:12,504 --> 01:08:20,191
I don't think anybody on this committee was pleased at all when the middle school reading specialists were not able to be part of last year's budget.

622
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:21,332
I know I certainly wasn't.

623
01:08:21,492 --> 01:08:30,841
So my priority is making sure that they are back in as we deal with those interruptions in learning and the deficit.

624
01:08:30,881 --> 01:08:31,882
So that's number one.

625
01:08:32,615 --> 01:08:41,141
One thing we have done at the high school over the past couple, two years is to look at the schedule and start creating something we call literacy challenge classes.

626
01:08:42,222 --> 01:08:53,169
Those are not for our tier three students, but those are for our tier two students who do show deficits or gaps in reading, writing, comprehension.

627
01:08:54,190 --> 01:09:01,335
And so we do have those electives where students will work in literacy challenges instead of maybe going to another mini.

628
01:09:01,773 --> 01:09:03,534
It's not taught by a reading specialist.

629
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:07,856
I want to be very transparent with that, but it is supported by our humanities teachers.

630
01:09:09,157 --> 01:09:12,759
So getting the middle school reading specialist back is a huge priority.

631
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:13,960
We need to get them back.

632
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,400
We need to get those gaps in.

633
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:25,666
And continuing to support the literacy challenge courses, looking at perhaps bringing some specialists into the high school would be something certainly I would be in favor of.

634
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:28,697
When we talk about our dyslexic students, I know Ms.

635
01:09:28,717 --> 01:09:34,158
Bowen's on the call, so obviously that would be where the reading, writing, and support classes come in at the high school.

636
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:45,782
But I do, for our tier two learners, I do certainly share the same concerns, and it's a very important priority of mine to make sure we're supporting them as best as we can, given the different schedules.

637
01:09:47,222 --> 01:09:47,543
Thank you.

638
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,063
Mayor, if I could just quickly respond.

639
01:09:50,143 --> 01:09:50,984
Yes, Member Russo.

640
01:09:51,584 --> 01:09:51,904
Thank you.

641
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:58,912
I think you did mention the literacy class or whatever it was called.

642
01:09:58,972 --> 01:10:03,475
I apologize for forgetting it that quickly, but at the high school and that's exciting.

643
01:10:03,515 --> 01:10:11,421
And certainly if we could figure out how to get reading specialists to either be assisting or doing the teaching in that, that would be wonderful.

644
01:10:11,801 --> 01:10:19,966
But as for dyslexia and special ed and being on IEP, I mean, the estimates I keep seeing are 15% of the population, 15 to 20% of the population is dyslexic.

645
01:10:23,055 --> 01:10:27,798
I'm quite sure that 15 to 20% of our students are not diagnosed with dyslexia.

646
01:10:27,838 --> 01:10:50,549
So, for all the students that are reading good enough that they've never get an IEP or they don't have parents who feel empowered enough to force it down our throats to get an IEP, which isn't, I'm not saying we don't do that on our own, but we all know that certain, parents of certain characteristics

647
01:10:52,821 --> 01:10:56,502
get IEPs more than other parents of other characteristics.

648
01:10:56,542 --> 01:10:57,362
That's just a fact.

649
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:21,670
And so for all those kids that don't have, you know, masters and PhD level parents who are going to make sure their kids get what they need no matter what, they're the ones that are going out into the world having never been identified with dyslexia and never having learned how to read and do proper, read sufficiently or to have the reading comprehension that the world demands.

650
01:11:23,435 --> 01:11:27,197
I'm not talking about the demands of going into a PhD program.

651
01:11:27,217 --> 01:11:37,303
We're talking about the demands for just office work or many other kinds of jobs that we want our students to be able to have success in.

652
01:11:37,444 --> 01:11:39,505
So I do appreciate that.

653
01:11:40,273 --> 01:11:40,833
Yeah, I know.

654
01:11:40,913 --> 01:11:42,014
I really appreciate your point.

655
01:11:42,074 --> 01:12:02,602
And one of the exciting things that is on the budget that I didn't, you know, have a lot of time to talk about in my intro was that assessment tool that you may have seen grades three through 11 that we're working on to bring for next year is going to be huge because we need to use an assessment tool like that to identify all students who might be

656
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:04,899
having those gaps in reading comp.

657
01:12:04,939 --> 01:12:08,600
They might not be eligible for special education, but they're still struggling.

658
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,721
They might have low growth or low output.

659
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:25,585
Those types of tools, you know, I feel very strongly, and I know the assistant superintendents and the superintendent does as well, that those tools are things we need so that we don't miss those students that may not have a disability

660
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,701
but certainly have some skills to catch up on.

661
01:12:28,841 --> 01:12:38,824
So the goal would be to get those assessments in, which is costly, but I still think very important, vital really, and then get that data and do something with that data.

662
01:12:38,884 --> 01:12:42,726
Put those students in the literacy challenge classes if they're not eligible for IEPs.

663
01:12:43,146 --> 01:12:49,968
Give them to the middle school reading specialist so we can really have experts working on where are the gaps and how can we remediate.

664
01:12:50,338 --> 01:12:51,759
so that we can leave successfully.

665
01:12:51,799 --> 01:12:54,279
So that is something on the budget, and I totally agree with you.

666
01:12:54,320 --> 01:13:01,342
I think it will help to catch students that maybe don't have the advocacy, as you referred to.

667
01:13:01,702 --> 01:13:05,144
We're certainly advocating for them, but it will be another voice in there.

668
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:06,324
Thank you.

669
01:13:09,165 --> 01:13:09,705
Thank you.

670
01:13:10,706 --> 01:13:11,926
If I could ask a quick question.

671
01:13:13,367 --> 01:13:13,527
Ms.

672
01:13:13,547 --> 01:13:18,749
Casey, you had mentioned there'll be assessment tools for grades three through 11

673
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:22,837
Is that in addition to obviously the K-2?

674
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:24,979
Is that why you didn't mention the K-2?

675
01:13:24,999 --> 01:13:27,840
So this is extra due to COVID?

676
01:13:28,761 --> 01:13:31,742
Yeah, extra, but of course we don't want to be assessing the students all year.

677
01:13:31,802 --> 01:13:34,204
So we would look at what are we getting rid of?

678
01:13:34,604 --> 01:13:37,586
And now we're pulling in a really strong assessment three through 11.

679
01:13:38,226 --> 01:13:41,888
K-2 would be, you're correct, Mayor, the early literacy screener.

680
01:13:41,988 --> 01:13:46,631
That's why I didn't include that in there, because they'll be zoned in on that early literacy screener.

681
01:13:47,793 --> 01:13:58,296
And will all the students be screened at the end of the year to see where they're at and to potentially this summer help that we might be providing?

682
01:13:59,437 --> 01:14:01,297
I think that this was a purchase for next year.

683
01:14:01,357 --> 01:14:02,378
It's a costly purchase.

684
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,379
The early literacy screener, yes, that's going on right now.

685
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:07,039
We do look at that data.

686
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:08,400
It happens three times a year.

687
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,241
We will be using that data as we look at the

688
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:16,996
summer reading or the summer intervention that was listed on the budget.

689
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:21,159
So we can use that K through two early literacy screener data now.

690
01:14:21,759 --> 01:14:29,406
The three through 11 is something that all of us are hoping can be part of next year's budget.

691
01:14:29,446 --> 01:14:37,652
So we can begin assessing the students early in the fall and placing them in those literacy challenge classes or math challenge.

692
01:14:38,032 --> 01:14:41,075
It has a math, science and ELA component.

693
01:14:42,355 --> 01:14:43,396
Does that answer your question?

694
01:14:43,916 --> 01:14:44,136
Yes.

695
01:14:44,456 --> 01:14:44,737
Okay.

696
01:14:44,757 --> 01:14:47,478
So K through two is getting assessed through the end of the year.

697
01:14:48,559 --> 01:14:52,522
Now we'll add three to 11 with this program to place in the fall.

698
01:14:53,262 --> 01:14:53,523
Yes.

699
01:14:53,563 --> 01:14:56,745
And that would three through 11 would be for all three subject areas.

700
01:14:56,845 --> 01:15:00,167
We haven't quite figured out, you know, when we would test in science.

701
01:15:00,227 --> 01:15:01,648
I'll, I'll leave that to Mr. Ceri.

702
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:06,671
I don't want his department, but for English, it would be every year, multiple times throughout the year to show growth.

703
01:15:06,691 --> 01:15:08,793
Yeah.

704
01:15:08,853 --> 01:15:11,875
I think this is an example, frankly, of the, how

705
01:15:12,463 --> 01:15:17,727
the operating and COVID related priorities are so intertwined with one another.

706
01:15:18,287 --> 01:15:29,275
It is because of the absence of the assessments that all districts have relied on, and frankly, the absence of reliable data, even if the assessments are administered, that we have to be thinking creatively.

707
01:15:29,335 --> 01:15:35,779
And so this would qualify essentially as a critical priority that we're going to have to invest in one way or another.

708
01:15:35,859 --> 01:15:39,582
As Dr. Piazza said, it is not going to be necessarily the least expensive,

709
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:50,802
of the priorities that have been discussed tonight, but one way or another, this is an investment the district will need to make in order to make sure that we have an accurate sense as to what progress students are making.

710
01:15:50,862 --> 01:16:07,329
And so while we would love for the operating budget to absorb it frankly, because it's not necessarily direct support to students, which is what we really, that's sort of our chief priority is how do we put the people and the services and the programming in place that are helping students to learn rather than measuring what they're learning.

711
01:16:07,649 --> 01:16:09,890
At the same time, we know that this is imperative

712
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:14,592
and we can't frankly function at the level that we need to if we don't have this tool in place.

713
01:16:14,632 --> 01:16:20,374
And so one way or another, this will be an investment that the district will make.

714
01:16:22,695 --> 01:16:23,196
Thank you.

715
01:16:23,756 --> 01:16:29,518
So we still, I might be mindful of time, but we do have a number of content areas still to go.

716
01:16:29,999 --> 01:16:37,982
As Mr. Sears mentioned, our science priorities, because of the strength of our science program are relatively simple.

717
01:16:38,042 --> 01:16:39,143
And so we should be able to

718
01:16:40,736 --> 01:16:49,778
Well, I know Siri would like to and could regale us with the tales of the Medford Public School Science Department for the remainder of the evening.

719
01:16:49,798 --> 01:16:51,479
And that would be very enjoyable.

720
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:52,879
We can provide time for that later.

721
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:57,961
I would say that we want to make sure that we get to each of those areas within the time that we have.

722
01:16:57,981 --> 01:17:03,602
Yeah, I was going to move on to questions on science, and then I'll move on to questions on health and phys ed.

723
01:17:04,562 --> 01:17:06,603
So on science, member van der Kloop?

724
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,001
Just a quick one.

725
01:17:11,021 --> 01:17:19,948
Mr. Seary, you mentioned Mozilla and Mozilla especially for science, but it sounded like we weren't moving with that yet.

726
01:17:20,128 --> 01:17:28,155
And I was unclear why, whether it's just another budget item, expense, how expensive is it?

727
01:17:29,796 --> 01:17:35,501
If it seems like it's been so successful in other subject areas, why aren't we putting it forth right now?

728
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,631
Thanks for the question, Ms.

729
01:17:41,651 --> 01:17:42,171
Vander Kloot.

730
01:17:42,211 --> 01:17:46,592
I believe it's already, we are moving forward with it this year.

731
01:17:46,652 --> 01:17:48,153
It's not that it's not included.

732
01:17:48,813 --> 01:17:49,333
Oh, okay.

733
01:17:50,073 --> 01:17:52,254
I didn't understand that from your presentation.

734
01:17:52,314 --> 01:18:01,897
It was funded in part through the CARES funding, and so it's frankly a matter of which budget, whose budget is this going to land on, but it'll be an investment that the district will make, and it's a relatively modest one.

735
01:18:02,837 --> 01:18:06,038
Okay, so- We do use it in ELA and social studies.

736
01:18:06,825 --> 01:18:07,045
Right.

737
01:18:07,626 --> 01:18:09,928
So it will be included for science as well.

738
01:18:10,348 --> 01:18:11,309
Is that correct, Dave?

739
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:12,971
They're using it and using it well.

740
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:16,394
So it's just a matter of whether or not ROC is going to pick up some of the tap at this point.

741
01:18:17,195 --> 01:18:17,455
OK.

742
01:18:17,695 --> 01:18:17,916
Great.

743
01:18:18,136 --> 01:18:18,496
Thank you.

744
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,482
Anybody else with questions in science?

745
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:25,723
Member Rousseau.

746
01:18:28,425 --> 01:18:28,906
Thank you, Mayor.

747
01:18:29,514 --> 01:18:33,257
Um, my, I just have a quick, uh, uh, sort of a point last question.

748
01:18:33,437 --> 01:18:40,423
Um, so when we went with the new FOSS program, um, you know, we obviously talked a lot about it.

749
01:18:40,603 --> 01:18:51,132
Um, and I just hope that, um, you know, Maybe next year, the fact that we're going to have renewables every year, like we just bake it in.

750
01:18:51,939 --> 01:18:55,461
It doesn't really, to me, it feels like, why do we keep talking about it?

751
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:58,963
When we agreed to it, we knew they were gonna be renewables every year.

752
01:18:59,523 --> 01:19:02,005
And we don't talk about the cost of water or electricity.

753
01:19:02,085 --> 01:19:14,092
And I fully, and I understand that it's here, cause this is new still, but I hope at some point soon we can just stop bringing it up the fact that we have to pay for this.

754
01:19:14,172 --> 01:19:19,495
Cause we knew that when we agreed to buy the program and the program doesn't even function if we don't do it.

755
01:19:20,982 --> 01:19:24,984
That's just sort of a point to make maybe these move along.

756
01:19:25,264 --> 01:19:25,625
Thank you.

757
01:19:27,065 --> 01:19:27,646
It's a good one.

758
01:19:27,706 --> 01:19:35,810
And just to tie our previous conversation together, ultimately, to Mr. Rousseau's point, this would be considered a fixed cost increase, a relatively modest one.

759
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:36,550
And I think you're right.

760
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:45,375
Ultimately, some of it, frankly, may already be incorporated, to be totally candid, particularly with the investment in textbooks that we're able to move on to the FY21.

761
01:19:45,415 --> 01:19:48,336
We may be able to absorb it in a total science budget.

762
01:19:48,376 --> 01:19:50,237
But it's still a key priority that we want to point out.

763
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:52,659
But I think in the future, you're right.

764
01:19:53,299 --> 01:19:56,460
For as long as the district's committed to it, we should consider a fixed cost increase.

765
01:20:02,503 --> 01:20:02,943
Thank you.

766
01:20:04,123 --> 01:20:07,464
We have health and physical education.

767
01:20:08,105 --> 01:20:08,865
Any questions?

768
01:20:17,628 --> 01:20:18,989
Mayor, I just have one question.

769
01:20:19,895 --> 01:20:21,856
It's member Russo and then member Kratz.

770
01:20:22,677 --> 01:20:23,057
Thank you.

771
01:20:23,957 --> 01:20:26,959
So, wait, am I in the wrong?

772
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:29,420
I apologize, I'm in the wrong slide on my computer.

773
01:20:31,281 --> 01:20:37,284
So the health, I was, the 160,000 was sort of for everything.

774
01:20:42,147 --> 01:20:47,450
But the description is of a certified PE teacher at each building.

775
01:20:47,992 --> 01:21:00,940
And that's that conversation, Mr. Murphy, you talked about where with the negotiations about we're not gonna add another PE teacher at every building, but we're gonna end up hopefully with a PE teacher who is certified.

776
01:21:01,701 --> 01:21:08,485
And then one perhaps who is literally like we hire a specialist.

777
01:21:09,105 --> 01:21:17,651
So that's for school year 21, 22, we are recommending that we add a position to make sure

778
01:21:18,144 --> 01:21:21,745
with certainty that we have an adaptive PE teacher on staff.

779
01:21:22,145 --> 01:21:41,389
Part of that is for that person both to provide adaptive PE services to students, but potentially to also serve as the point person in building out our capacity in what would essentially be a train the trainer model to make sure that eventually we have at least one adaptive PE certified teacher at each building.

780
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:48,011
And so we sort of see this as a bridge year to make sure that this priority is being addressed

781
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:53,343
as we build out our institutional capacity to make sure that this is a service that's being offered.

782
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,225
There is a bargaining implication to that.

783
01:21:55,265 --> 01:22:10,542
It is an impact bargaining implication and one that we're prepared to pursue in the coming months with, you know, again, we're going into the conversation saying it's our expectation that while timeline is always one of the things that we need to discuss with our partners,

784
01:22:11,329 --> 01:22:19,913
our expectation at this point is there's enough of a runway, particularly if we add this position for next year and have someone on staff prepared to assist with that.

785
01:22:20,553 --> 01:22:27,737
We believe that 22-23 school year is a reasonable timeline to ensure that we have one person at each building, at least one person at each building.

786
01:22:28,857 --> 01:22:29,177
Thank you.

787
01:22:29,197 --> 01:22:31,018
I have another question I'll ask after Member Kratz.

788
01:22:32,599 --> 01:22:32,939
Thank you.

789
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:35,000
Member Kratz and then back to Member Russo.

790
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:36,630
Yes, thank you.

791
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:39,192
And I just had a question for Ms.

792
01:22:39,212 --> 01:22:39,432
Perry.

793
01:22:39,472 --> 01:22:40,713
Thank you for the presentation.

794
01:22:41,313 --> 01:22:50,037
And before COVID, I did get to tour the site that was going to be the yoga studio and the spin studio.

795
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:55,420
And I can see in the narrative that that work was put on hold.

796
01:22:55,900 --> 01:23:03,885
And I know it's to be determined, but I'd be really excited to see if maybe we would be able to get that going.

797
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:15,633
I have been receiving messages from parents who, you know, because of COVID, their students have not had, you know, enough, you know, exercise in their routine.

798
01:23:15,653 --> 01:23:23,758
It would be nice to have, you know, another available space with different types of exercise.

799
01:23:24,619 --> 01:23:31,124
Everybody adapts to different exercise, like some people like running, some people like yoga, and it would be really nice.

800
01:23:31,204 --> 01:23:32,845
So, you know, I hope

801
01:23:33,285 --> 01:23:37,166
that it is something that we could do, hopefully in the longterm.

802
01:23:39,167 --> 01:23:44,629
Yes, so we were working with the vocational students really in that area.

803
01:23:44,669 --> 01:23:48,470
So that's something that is definitely on our radar to continue to pursue.

804
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:53,031
I think Mr. Murphy, we had talked about this as well.

805
01:23:53,091 --> 01:23:57,232
And I know it's something that central is backing and supporting as well.

806
01:23:57,933 --> 01:24:01,774
I think the only sort of caveat I would put on that is that,

807
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:07,786
A lot of, we're using this opportunity to present the totality of the priorities and strategies.

808
01:24:08,187 --> 01:24:13,430
So some ultimately might land on a capital budget and some, you know, there could be external funding opportunities.

809
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:20,495
I think the construction of the yoga studio would probably constitute a capital priority and one that we will pursue in due time.

810
01:24:20,535 --> 01:24:28,060
But I would be surprised if it landed on the operating budget in any fiscal year, frankly, but I do think it's something that we can pursue.

811
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,782
It's something that, as to Ms.

812
01:24:29,802 --> 01:24:31,743
Kretz's point, would have tremendous value

813
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:33,067
for students.

814
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:36,468
I just probably would be a capital priority ultimately.

815
01:24:38,409 --> 01:24:38,849
Thank you.

816
01:24:38,969 --> 01:24:48,692
And I just was happy to see that the athletic teacher, the adaptive PE teacher is in the critical budget.

817
01:24:49,152 --> 01:24:50,692
I know for two years, Ms.

818
01:24:50,732 --> 01:24:55,594
Perry, you've been trying to get that and I'm just really happy to see it and I hope it stays there.

819
01:24:56,614 --> 01:24:57,094
Thank you.

820
01:24:57,114 --> 01:24:59,915
Thank you.

821
01:25:01,487 --> 01:25:02,287
Member Ruzzo.

822
01:25:02,928 --> 01:25:03,288
Thank you.

823
01:25:03,928 --> 01:25:06,748
I just wanted to sort of double check.

824
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:10,789
Will we say a health teacher for the Michigan model?

825
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:15,791
This is the sort of the health teacher we've talked about numerous times.

826
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:17,131
This is that person, correct?

827
01:25:17,431 --> 01:25:19,892
Who will fill in and be able to... Thank you.

828
01:25:20,272 --> 01:25:20,672
That is correct.

829
01:25:20,752 --> 01:25:29,934
I will say, as we prioritize that, and this is true for a lot of our priorities, we are trying to maintain flexibility around things like certifications and licensure.

830
01:25:30,578 --> 01:25:41,480
We want to make sure that these priorities are incorporated into our schedules or our schedules are adjusted in a way that puts students first, in a way that provides the maximum amount of flexibility.

831
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:59,804
So I think it's inclusion in this presentation speaks to the administration's prioritizing from a funding perspective, what that ultimately looks like, and it's a middle school priority, what that ultimately looks like, how it's incorporated, what building the position would be assigned to,

832
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:03,441
Those are things that would have to be ironed out in the coming months.

833
01:26:03,481 --> 01:26:04,141
But yes, it is.

834
01:26:04,161 --> 01:26:05,542
The short answer to the question is yes.

835
01:26:05,882 --> 01:26:08,703
It's the position that's been discussed at length in the past.

836
01:26:09,843 --> 01:26:10,163
Thank you.

837
01:26:10,463 --> 01:26:19,166
I just hope we do not get too liberal around certifications, teaching.

838
01:26:19,186 --> 01:26:25,028
Well, frankly, the sex ed parts are not for the faint of heart.

839
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:26,941
as I understand it.

840
01:26:27,601 --> 01:26:47,434
And, you know, if we struggle to find the right person that rather we struggle to keep finding rather than put somebody in who doesn't really do it justice or does worse, you know, cause this stuff taught the wrong way or taught in a way that it can be taught in a harmful way.

841
01:26:48,235 --> 01:26:51,116
And I think that's what I'm afraid of.

842
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:51,817
So thank you.

843
01:26:54,338 --> 01:26:55,039
Member Van de Kloot.

844
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:02,498
I wanted to move on, if we could, to music and oral language.

845
01:27:04,061 --> 01:27:05,844
And I had several questions first.

846
01:27:05,905 --> 01:27:08,550
I think I'm going to take the music part up first, the fine arts.

847
01:27:11,341 --> 01:27:11,621
Okay.

848
01:27:12,462 --> 01:27:30,089
So my concern is, and we touched upon this in our subcommittee meeting on curriculum, but we've had a whole group of students miss their fourth grade string program and a whole group of students miss their fifth grade string program.

849
01:27:30,589 --> 01:27:31,490
And as we all know,

850
01:27:32,094 --> 01:27:40,297
This becomes the feeder programs for the upper level high school band and orchestra, which I think are such vital opportunities for our kids.

851
01:27:41,078 --> 01:27:46,860
So I'm curious about, and I realize this strays slightly from the budget, but there may be budget implications.

852
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:56,444
How are we going to, so let's take for the group of next year's fifth graders who missed fourth grade strings.

853
01:27:57,015 --> 01:28:04,978
Will the violin become a possible alternative for them in the lineup of beginning instruments?

854
01:28:05,538 --> 01:28:07,679
And will we need more instruments for that reason?

855
01:28:09,945 --> 01:28:14,846
And so I'm trying to figure out how we're going to address that.

856
01:28:15,346 --> 01:28:22,528
And then that goes into, then we've also missed a whole group of students who missed their first year of instruments.

857
01:28:23,348 --> 01:28:31,070
And it's crucial for them to have that start if they're going to be in middle school music opportunities.

858
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:32,891
So could you address that?

859
01:28:34,531 --> 01:28:34,811
Sure.

860
01:28:35,491 --> 01:28:35,871
I can.

861
01:28:38,352 --> 01:28:51,676
As you probably know, the Department of Ed had put out some pretty serious guidance, some strict guidance, I should say, on the use of instruments and other materials that are shared.

862
01:28:52,016 --> 01:28:56,998
And there were three different iterations of that coming out in July, October, and March.

863
01:28:57,558 --> 01:29:04,440
So the reason why we did not offer those subjects, just to be clear to the public, was because we were following the public guidance.

864
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:09,023
So we have had numerous discussions within the department about this.

865
01:29:09,923 --> 01:29:17,009
A big thank you to Haley Rella, who I think is on this call, Sophia Chang.

866
01:29:17,409 --> 01:29:21,612
Both of them have been very, are being very aggressive.

867
01:29:22,192 --> 01:29:29,938
We've sent out an email, actually just went out this morning, and I actually have been following it as this meeting has been going on.

868
01:29:30,318 --> 01:29:55,403
in which we are reaching out to parents, and we will continue to reach out to parents, not only by the Google survey to find out who is interested, but we will be following up that with classroom presentations and even other communication to try to reach out to parents, to let them know these programs exist, and to encourage them to get their children involved in

869
01:29:57,546 --> 01:29:59,527
in band and in an orchestra.

870
01:29:59,948 --> 01:30:03,250
So not just for the middle schools, we've started with the middle school with that form.

871
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:12,196
It is going, we are going to be reaching out to our incoming fourth grade parents as well as the fifth grade.

872
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:22,362
So we do, we are gonna be in direct communication with parents to try to bolster this program.

873
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:23,463
So I had,

874
01:30:25,571 --> 01:30:27,312
I had mentioned adding instruments.

875
01:30:27,692 --> 01:30:35,716
Specifically, we mentioned the ukulele and the guitar, but there are other instruments too that we may need.

876
01:30:38,077 --> 01:30:39,998
So we are cognizant of that.

877
01:30:41,818 --> 01:30:48,460
I think a lot of this is the outreach that has already started that will need to continue.

878
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:51,420
Bernadette, you've really not answered my question, though.

879
01:30:52,561 --> 01:30:57,702
If you would, will fifth graders have the opportunity to play violin next year?

880
01:30:57,722 --> 01:31:00,243
They will.

881
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:05,395
I mean, depending on what the demand is.

882
01:31:05,775 --> 01:31:10,400
So one of the things, so with our staff, we have some flexibility in our staff.

883
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:12,882
All of our music staff is K-12.

884
01:31:13,643 --> 01:31:19,189
So in the past, what has been done is we have strategically placed those staff where the need is.

885
01:31:19,689 --> 01:31:36,817
So I think it first needs to, it needs to start with, where is the, where's the need, where's the demand, we're going to try to bolster it, then we need to position our staff, so that they are there to teach the students and then to get them involved in, in the various instrument lessons.

886
01:31:37,972 --> 01:31:48,423
So I'm just wondering if we might need more violins next year, even if the school district is renting them because all of a sudden we have the kids who are moving from third to fourth.

887
01:31:48,463 --> 01:31:55,891
Now I'm working on the assumption that next year we are going to at least be able to offer violin because it's not a woodwind, it's not a blowing instrument.

888
01:31:57,099 --> 01:31:59,582
So that's why I'm starting there.

889
01:31:59,642 --> 01:32:04,886
I'm saying, you know, there may be fifth graders who didn't get the opportunity in fourth grade.

890
01:32:05,306 --> 01:32:11,732
Do we have, we've traditionally provided those instruments for the students for a nominal, I think $25 a year fee.

891
01:32:12,272 --> 01:32:12,572
Yes.

892
01:32:13,073 --> 01:32:14,134
Some of which is waived.

893
01:32:14,634 --> 01:32:22,817
do we have the capacity in terms of number of instruments or do we need to think about what are we going to do in order to expand?

894
01:32:23,617 --> 01:32:39,882
Because the goal has to be that in the long run that we're offering kids the opportunity so that we can get over this hump so that we continue our wonderful thriving orchestra which has boasted more than 100 members strong for years.

895
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:45,742
Yeah, and it's a very serious concern that we have.

896
01:32:45,842 --> 01:32:53,247
So, I mean, I know Sophia Chang has been working on that, the violin supply.

897
01:32:53,327 --> 01:32:57,029
She was just in there, actually, I think she was in there today, again, doing the inventory.

898
01:32:57,449 --> 01:32:59,790
So we've been going through the inventory.

899
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:00,791
We know what we have.

900
01:33:01,211 --> 01:33:04,573
Depending on what the demand is, we may need to bolster that.

901
01:33:04,593 --> 01:33:06,094
Okay.

902
01:33:06,114 --> 01:33:10,396
I think we have to explore efforts to cultivate demand as well, because to Ms.

903
01:33:10,436 --> 01:33:11,317
Vander Kloot's point,

904
01:33:12,305 --> 01:33:24,173
I mean, this is a very concrete example of when we talk about how we don't want students' academic careers to be defined by the 1920 and 2021 school years, right?

905
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:40,104
That you miss that year, or it could be the year that is lighting the flame around music education, and then all of a sudden you're not participating in the extracurricular activity that you would have in high school that kept you engaged, that put you in a position to pursue post-secondary opportunities.

906
01:33:40,404 --> 01:33:40,965
So these are real,

907
01:33:41,795 --> 01:33:56,048
concrete risks that we have to look at every single initiative and every single budgetary priority through the lens of how do we ensure that this global pandemic does not define Medford public school students for their educational career.

908
01:33:56,328 --> 01:34:07,778
And so we will work on cultivating that interest and we will work on procuring the instruments or whatever other infrastructure we need to make sure that we can put students back on the path that they

909
01:34:08,218 --> 01:34:09,279
that they deserve to be on.

910
01:34:09,299 --> 01:34:20,433
But I think it's a great question because I think it's such a concrete example of how a student's path can be altered as a result of a disruption totally beyond their control.

911
01:34:20,753 --> 01:34:20,933
Yes.

912
01:34:24,935 --> 01:34:27,997
So if I can follow up on that.

913
01:34:28,177 --> 01:34:30,399
So obviously that's a big concern of mine.

914
01:34:31,659 --> 01:34:39,284
And also how we look at the fifth grade band instrument program as well.

915
01:34:40,044 --> 01:34:47,668
I still don't know what we don't necessarily know whether we'll be able to be offering all those instruments as far as I know.

916
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:51,951
This is one area where I'm wondering whether a summer program makes any sense at all.

917
01:34:52,732 --> 01:34:57,723
Um, you know, just to bolster if depending on what the, what the requirements are.

918
01:34:58,485 --> 01:35:00,229
Um, and, um,

919
01:35:01,485 --> 01:35:04,026
I guess it also opens up a bigger question.

920
01:35:04,066 --> 01:35:17,171
Now, Bernadette, I'd wanna be clear that this is with no reflection on the job you've been doing, but you will know that from all my years on the committee, I've been a proponent of the fine arts.

921
01:35:17,491 --> 01:35:29,855
And while I'm very mindful and understand that perhaps we're looking at how departmentalized we are, I am concerned that in the fine arts, it's really important

922
01:35:30,467 --> 01:35:38,813
for us to have the specialty of musicians and artists overseeing the department and the work.

923
01:35:40,474 --> 01:35:49,380
And so while Bernadette has stepped in and done the hard work this year, I've always said,

924
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:55,163
hey, I don't want fine arts to become a second fiddle to all the other departments.

925
01:35:55,564 --> 01:36:06,891
There was a joke in there, but you know, to all the other departments over time, we need to make sure that our fine arts department is as important as all the other departments.

926
01:36:07,311 --> 01:36:18,918
And so I worry about that and I want to know, you know, going forth right now, you're not suggesting a separate director, but the question will be, what will the plan be?

927
01:36:20,178 --> 01:36:34,972
Um, yeah, I mean I what I can say is that there have been several, actually all the teachers have stepped, stepped up, I have to mention lead teacher Haley Rallo has, has, has helped me immensely.

928
01:36:35,392 --> 01:36:40,998
Sophia Chang has stepped up all of them I really shouldn't, you know, aside from a lead teacher.

929
01:36:42,355 --> 01:36:45,038
They all have stepped up, they've offered their help.

930
01:36:45,598 --> 01:36:49,982
They have expressed a concern for the continuation of the program.

931
01:36:50,343 --> 01:36:53,726
So it's part of every discussion that we have in our department meetings.

932
01:36:54,907 --> 01:36:57,769
So we are being very aggressive with it.

933
01:36:59,095 --> 01:37:09,747
Um, you know, not knowing what the fall is going to bring in terms of restriction, my mindset has been, let's go, let's go full in, and if we need to retreat we will retreat.

934
01:37:10,448 --> 01:37:15,273
I think it's easier to do that to plan, and then, you know, if we need to cut it we will.

935
01:37:16,474 --> 01:37:24,423
I don't anticipate that, though, all the signs when we look at what's going on in a global manner, things are coming back.

936
01:37:24,623 --> 01:37:28,568
So in no way are we planning to retreat.

937
01:37:28,688 --> 01:37:33,473
We're planning to move forward in a full way.

938
01:37:34,294 --> 01:37:50,740
I just want to make sure that we budgetarily have plans as well and to make sure that we have enough resources to cover the needs whether it be an instrument or additional teaching staff or whatever to make up for this year.

939
01:37:51,140 --> 01:38:03,565
Yeah miss just from a budget perspective I'll just say that the fine arts department music and art they should be spending no more time than any other department being concerned with regards to their existence because

940
01:38:04,389 --> 01:38:16,160
It is central to our values as an organization, and from an instructional perspective, it is integral to making sure that students are having the well-rounded experience that they need, and to the point that Ms.

941
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:21,184
Brandenclute raises, even more so coming out of this period of disruption.

942
01:38:21,464 --> 01:38:31,233
With regard to the administrator position, I would just say that the priorities are built on, we are trying to concentrate as many resources on direct support

943
01:38:31,804 --> 01:38:35,186
And I think that's probably why you might not see it at the top tier.

944
01:38:35,546 --> 01:38:39,688
It's something that has to be addressed in the long-term in some way, shape, or form.

945
01:38:39,708 --> 01:38:41,770
And that's why it's identified in the long-term priorities.

946
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:55,537
But we frame the budgetary priorities around making sure that we're concentrating as many resources as possible on personnel and programs that touch students directly.

947
01:38:56,658 --> 01:38:58,719
But it's certainly not something that we've lost sight of.

948
01:39:00,051 --> 01:39:00,452
Thank you.

949
01:39:00,592 --> 01:39:03,841
We have Dr. Edward Vincent and then member Rousseau.

950
01:39:03,861 --> 01:39:06,968
Oh, just unmute yourself, please.

951
01:39:07,881 --> 01:39:13,626
sorry, Member Russo's hand had gone up before me, so you don't mind.

952
01:39:13,986 --> 01:39:29,740
I just was gonna say then, in response to Member van der Kloet's questions, Mr. Murphy ended up kind of addressing the district position, but we definitely prioritize the arts and

953
01:39:30,861 --> 01:39:48,865
at this point in time, the work that Dr. Riccadeli has been doing to really make sure that even our fine arts programming is coherent and aligned K through 12, the supplemental curriculum that we use this year during the pandemic year.

954
01:39:48,885 --> 01:39:58,227
I just wanted to acknowledge and thank her for her leadership and the great work that is happening in the fine arts department in all categories.

955
01:39:58,927 --> 01:40:09,669
So I just wanted to say, although we know that we're operating a little differently right now, that a lot of positive work is definitely happening in the area of fine arts.

956
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:25,473
And member van de Kloet, to your question about if additional instruments were to be needed for the fifth grade, we definitely would be able to address that based on the interest of the students and or their families for

957
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:27,814
continued fine arts programming.

958
01:40:28,254 --> 01:40:29,895
So I just wanted to assure you of that.

959
01:40:30,315 --> 01:40:30,635
Thank you.

960
01:40:33,437 --> 01:40:34,257
Member Rousseau.

961
01:40:35,258 --> 01:40:35,818
Thank you, Mayor.

962
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:47,824
So I have some concerns about the fine arts department and not the staff, obviously.

963
01:40:48,324 --> 01:40:53,987
I noticed that the fine arts department, as far as I can see, is the only one we have not indicated that it might be

964
01:40:55,381 --> 01:40:57,142
appropriate to have extended school day.

965
01:40:57,222 --> 01:41:00,764
We did talk about how the sciences will pull kids into extended school day.

966
01:41:01,664 --> 01:41:04,606
I'm pretty sure music does the same thing.

967
01:41:04,626 --> 01:41:09,788
So I'll just ask my couple of questions and then let them get answered.

968
01:41:10,428 --> 01:41:12,610
So I'm wondering why the discrepancy there.

969
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:19,493
And then, I guess there were three quick questions here.

970
01:41:19,613 --> 01:41:20,914
I think that's an oversight.

971
01:41:21,034 --> 01:41:23,695
I think to your point that it should be included

972
01:41:24,617 --> 01:41:37,927
for exactly the reason that you're stating that even if we're gonna build an extended school day program on the basis of literacy and math support, very often fine arts and performing arts are gonna be what is what's pulling, what are pulling students in.

973
01:41:37,947 --> 01:41:44,772
So I think that similar to science, you can expect to see that being prioritized in the COVID mitigation budget.

974
01:41:44,852 --> 01:41:50,095
And I apologize for it not being spelled out explicitly because it certainly should be.

975
01:41:50,135 --> 01:41:50,436
Thank you.

976
01:41:51,036 --> 01:41:52,897
We did have a discussion about that this morning.

977
01:41:53,907 --> 01:41:54,067
Yes.

978
01:41:54,407 --> 01:41:55,187
Great, thank you.

979
01:41:55,307 --> 01:42:18,655
And so I also noticed, thinking about, I believe there are some funds left in ESSER I, I don't know anything about what's left in ESSER II, but don't share your instruments, even though the science around contact transmission of COVID, I think is practically settled at this point.

980
01:42:18,775 --> 01:42:23,337
But I mean, is there not a case to be made for

981
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:27,573
get all the instruments that we think we could possibly need.

982
01:42:27,853 --> 01:42:33,596
It looks like a COVID expense on paper based on the guidance that has come out in the past.

983
01:42:35,156 --> 01:42:39,879
I mean, if we already are gonna spend all that money on something else, then of course you have to prioritize.

984
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:54,685
But at the end of the day, if we have a nickel left of that money and we didn't buy extra instruments when we could have, that will seem like a sad day, because someday we're in the future, we're gonna have a budget where we're gonna need to decide whether we're gonna have enough

985
01:42:55,733 --> 01:43:00,516
violins or we're going to have health education somewhere.

986
01:43:00,556 --> 01:43:06,019
I mean, you know, we're going to have awful choices in a future budget, just like we do in every budget, frankly.

987
01:43:06,139 --> 01:43:21,887
So I just wonder why we are, have we considered, you know, maxing out our spending of our ESSER funds to make sure that we, I mean, the thing about buying extra, you know, violins, if you buy too many, you stick them in the storeroom.

988
01:43:22,107 --> 01:43:25,269
And when they start to, the ones we're using start to get

989
01:43:25,582 --> 01:43:29,345
destroyed by the kids, you take them out and there they are.

990
01:43:29,365 --> 01:43:33,528
It's not like, they don't go bad by sitting in a storeroom, unlike many other things.

991
01:43:34,129 --> 01:43:40,353
So, textbooks age, a violin in a box can sit there for probably a century.

992
01:43:41,614 --> 01:43:43,516
So, I don't know, have we talked?

993
01:43:43,536 --> 01:43:44,356
Let's do that.

994
01:43:44,837 --> 01:43:51,542
We've made such a heavy investment in technology, but we know that technology will ultimately become obsolete the longer it waits.

995
01:43:52,005 --> 01:43:59,249
But I think that these types of concrete consumables, I think in the past, we've always aligned to interest.

996
01:43:59,709 --> 01:44:00,870
But again, back to Ms.

997
01:44:00,930 --> 01:44:06,453
Vander Kloof's point that if interest wanes as a result of this disruption, then we have to really be doing two things.

998
01:44:06,613 --> 01:44:12,816
One, cultivating the interest, but also building up a reserve for exactly the reasons they're pointing out.

999
01:44:12,876 --> 01:44:19,540
So whether it's SR1 or SR2, I think is probably gonna come down to timing, frankly.

1000
01:44:20,395 --> 01:44:41,432
uh and and to some degree possibly supply and when we might be able to do that but I think it's a worthwhile investment um and one that I I think I don't want to say that to the girls without saying because I think it's extremely important that we have this conversation and that it's reflective of our values as an organization we point this out but I definitely think that that's something that you'll see as one of one of the investments in the ESSER budget.

1001
01:44:43,413 --> 01:44:48,157
Thank you I mean I'm not advocating for us just having a a stock of a million dollars worth of violins that we

1002
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:51,101
have hidden away somewhere in the vast high school.

1003
01:44:51,141 --> 01:44:57,684
But I do, you know, like if we can buy these instruments, we can stop making kids find the money to rent them.

1004
01:44:58,504 --> 01:45:04,427
And that gets very much to my other issues around expecting families to pony up money to go to public school.

1005
01:45:04,967 --> 01:45:05,768
So thank you.

1006
01:45:06,888 --> 01:45:07,269
Thank you.

1007
01:45:08,169 --> 01:45:09,009
Member Graham.

1008
01:45:12,891 --> 01:45:16,193
The only other question I had about the fine arts budget, and maybe it's,

1009
01:45:17,335 --> 01:45:26,485
I think it's sort of related to the phys ed budget in in some regards, but I would ask that we think about how we determine

1010
01:45:28,921 --> 01:45:34,703
replacement costs of equipment in the same fashion for fine arts as we do in athletics.

1011
01:45:35,563 --> 01:45:37,824
And I would say the same of transportation.

1012
01:45:37,964 --> 01:45:47,007
So I believe that on the athletic side we do as a district subsidize transport for some amount of athletic

1013
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:55,761
Travel and if we are subsidizing for athletics, we should be subsidizing for the fine arts travel as well.

1014
01:45:55,861 --> 01:46:05,629
So whatever that like whatever that that decision making is, I would ask that we apply it consistently across those departments, because I think they speak to like

1015
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:11,831
what brings joy in learning to students.

1016
01:46:12,611 --> 01:46:23,580
And that may not be to all students, but there are students who uniquely find their home in either of those places, whether it be athletics or fine arts.

1017
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:35,129
So I would just wanna make sure that we are looking across departments and making sure that we are making concrete and similar choices for both of those.

1018
01:46:36,711 --> 01:46:37,571
Subject areas.

1019
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:44,338
And I would say, you know, last in last year's budget, we had a conversation around supply like

1020
01:46:44,835 --> 01:46:46,596
office supplies for schools.

1021
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:50,837
And there was just like this flat amount of money being issued to each school.

1022
01:46:50,977 --> 01:46:54,559
And I would say that that doesn't feel super defensible.

1023
01:46:54,599 --> 01:47:04,142
Like when I think about how supplies are consumed, it seems to me that a building with a hundred more students in it needs more supplies than the building with a hundred less students.

1024
01:47:04,222 --> 01:47:07,764
But yet we've sort of always applied the same number and said,

1025
01:47:08,604 --> 01:47:18,595
All elementary schools are created equal, so there are some places and opportunities like that in the budget where understanding the basis for evaluation of like what constitutes a rational budget.

1026
01:47:19,736 --> 01:47:26,364
makes a lot of sense, this is one of those places for me that you know sort of jumps out at me when we when we when I think about athletics and.

1027
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:33,167
and fine arts, but there are other places in the budget where I think there's similar opportunity for us to say, like, what is the basis?

1028
01:47:33,267 --> 01:47:37,209
And then it becomes not a discussion about, is this enough?

1029
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,550
And does one school have more than the other?

1030
01:47:40,170 --> 01:47:42,331
Because we have something defensible to fall back on.

1031
01:47:42,351 --> 01:47:45,192
Thank you.

1032
01:47:45,272 --> 01:47:46,173
Member van der Kloot?

1033
01:47:47,413 --> 01:47:53,356
Yes, I had a question now, if we're ready to move on to world language?

1034
01:47:54,417 --> 01:47:54,977
Yes, please.

1035
01:47:56,214 --> 01:48:17,548
So my question is, Bernadette, you mentioned that there's a $49,000 line item for the introduction of French in grade six, but it didn't look like, was that inclusive of also money for needed textbooks in French, Italian, and Spanish?

1036
01:48:18,309 --> 01:48:23,092
So that 49,000 is all three languages in all three grades in middle school.

1037
01:48:24,043 --> 01:48:26,125
Okay, and at the high school level we're okay.

1038
01:48:26,785 --> 01:48:35,273
So right right now we are we're okay so the upper level in world language they use a lot of small readers, it's less textbook base.

1039
01:48:37,675 --> 01:48:39,577
With regard to a level one of a language.

1040
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,941
it is more important to have a textbook.

1041
01:48:44,641 --> 01:48:47,141
So level one is in our grade eight.

1042
01:48:47,361 --> 01:49:00,184
We have a few classes, level one in grade nine, which we could use the same textbooks, but when you get into those upper levels, it's just, it's not as important.

1043
01:49:00,645 --> 01:49:08,406
Not that it's unimportant, but we do have textbooks that are not as, they're not as old, they're usable.

1044
01:49:08,426 --> 01:49:10,747
So if we're gonna put money, it's the middle school textbooks.

1045
01:49:11,367 --> 01:49:23,576
Okay and the second question is really has to do with something you didn't mention but that is we've now no longer have an Italian program at the elementary level.

1046
01:49:24,837 --> 01:49:40,208
We really haven't talked too much about what's going to happen there but I'm going to direct the question of saying you know the one thing about the Italian program is it brought in kids horizons in understanding that there are countries that speak a totally different language and use different money and

1047
01:49:41,473 --> 01:49:48,457
you know, all of the different things that go along with learning about a different language.

1048
01:49:49,298 --> 01:49:57,703
And I'm just wondering how we are going to incorporate that type of learning into our curriculum.

1049
01:50:00,124 --> 01:50:06,928
You know, again, because we're doing without it, what are we losing and how are we going to,

1050
01:50:08,826 --> 01:50:14,330
make sure that our students have that, you know, without waiting until sixth grade.

1051
01:50:15,471 --> 01:50:22,576
You know, I've mentioned before, I have a grandson who goes to school in another state, and he's in an intensive French program from kindergarten.

1052
01:50:22,997 --> 01:50:23,737
He speaks French.

1053
01:50:23,757 --> 01:50:25,398
He's in first grade now, and he speaks French.

1054
01:50:26,839 --> 01:50:31,463
It's amazing, and we're not doing that, but his also understanding of things like

1055
01:50:31,903 --> 01:50:32,704
Time zones.

1056
01:50:32,804 --> 01:50:41,052
He's in first grade of time zones and of, you know, money and games and all the other things that learn that take place about learning about another country.

1057
01:50:41,933 --> 01:50:46,858
So I'm kind of curious, and I realized that maybe it hasn't been thought about too much at this point.

1058
01:50:47,719 --> 01:50:53,585
Because it's been a tough year, but I'm wondering about that type of learning and how are we going to incorporate it into our

1059
01:50:55,425 --> 01:50:57,626
the lives of our elementary kids.

1060
01:50:57,926 --> 01:51:00,046
So I think there are two questions here.

1061
01:51:00,246 --> 01:51:02,827
One is what are we doing with that fifth prep?

1062
01:51:03,047 --> 01:51:10,669
And I know that Suzanne Glusi has been, she has been working very hard on creating that fifth prep.

1063
01:51:10,769 --> 01:51:17,351
She has determined that there is a need elsewhere for that fifth prep.

1064
01:51:18,591 --> 01:51:22,972
Your question, how did the students get that, the knowledge of,

1065
01:51:24,214 --> 01:51:31,407
globalism, culture, you know, part of that comes in with the elementary social studies curriculum.

1066
01:51:33,363 --> 01:51:38,024
And perhaps it's not gonna be as great as it was with the Italian program.

1067
01:51:38,524 --> 01:51:54,628
But when they do get to middle school, remember they have that global scholars program, which I think does, it's a wonderful program that very directly deals with the time zone issue because they're communicating with students across the world.

1068
01:51:55,468 --> 01:51:57,109
That does happen in middle school.

1069
01:51:57,729 --> 01:52:02,130
I think with this, yeah, we are losing something by losing the Italian.

1070
01:52:03,617 --> 01:52:07,079
but we are going to gain another program with what Ms.

1071
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:13,381
Galussi has put in, which is going to be more of a, well, actually I will let her speak to what that is going to be.

1072
01:52:13,401 --> 01:52:20,945
So yeah, I mean, we can't completely, you know, bring in that cultural piece.

1073
01:52:21,625 --> 01:52:24,927
So we are losing something by losing the Italian.

1074
01:52:25,307 --> 01:52:25,527
Yes.

1075
01:52:26,747 --> 01:52:27,088
Thank you.

1076
01:52:27,788 --> 01:52:28,168
You're welcome.

1077
01:52:30,108 --> 01:52:32,450
I was just gonna say, is it okay if I jump in.

1078
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:41,277
Um, I just wanted to say, of course, there'll be a somewhat of a void in losing the Italian program but I do want to be mindful that

1079
01:52:42,828 --> 01:52:53,434
What we're putting in place moving forward for the additional specialist program for students is based on the current need right now coming out of a global pandemic.

1080
01:52:54,135 --> 01:53:09,664
And what students need right now is a little bit more concentrated and extended focus on social emotional skills, as well as developing some of those executive functioning skills that were lost in these past 14 to 15 months.

1081
01:53:10,485 --> 01:53:11,506
And I do wanna say that

1082
01:53:12,466 --> 01:53:18,531
And I'm not minimizing at all the Italian program, but it also did not service every student in the building.

1083
01:53:19,031 --> 01:53:26,798
And this fifth additional special will service every student in the building, especially at this moment in time.

1084
01:53:27,458 --> 01:53:41,432
And I also wanted to mention in reference to your question, member Van de Kloot, that a lot of what you're talking about in that void, that is woven into all of the ELA curriculum, the social studies curriculum.

1085
01:53:41,992 --> 01:53:47,297
It's embedded in part of the responsive classroom and the content that the teachers focus on in morning meeting.

1086
01:53:48,098 --> 01:53:55,720
and as well as the addition of all of the cultural proficiency work that we're doing with staff and bringing into the classrooms every day.

1087
01:53:55,820 --> 01:54:09,884
So that kind of global piece, though it may not be answered by what the Italian program did, but it actually, in all of the other areas of the day, it's more of a broader scope.

1088
01:54:11,097 --> 01:54:17,762
Susan, who's going to be teaching the period you just spoke about?

1089
01:54:19,443 --> 01:54:22,866
We're going to have to hire some new staff for that position.

1090
01:54:23,586 --> 01:54:25,187
And what are we going to call that?

1091
01:54:26,228 --> 01:54:26,488
Do we?

1092
01:54:27,409 --> 01:54:28,950
We're going to have to mail that next week.

1093
01:54:30,727 --> 01:54:40,054
So we don't want to make sure that we keep our viewership up for budget meeting number four next week.

1094
01:54:41,475 --> 01:54:47,840
This is just a bit of a teaser and everyone can look forward to unveiling that.

1095
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:54,225
And, and again, this is of course something we discussed at the May 3rd presentation where we discussed our elementary school priorities.

1096
01:54:54,706 --> 01:54:57,748
And we talked about both from a logistical perspective and making sure that

1097
01:54:58,512 --> 01:55:06,317
We are reaching a deeper level of learning and also broadening the exposure our students have in the post-pandemic context.

1098
01:55:06,417 --> 01:55:13,261
And so that's why we've identified this as an important strategic investment going into the FY22.

1099
01:55:13,301 --> 01:55:22,167
But there are a few of the details and content pieces that are still being ironed out by not just Miss Galussi, but by the entire team at the elementary level.

1100
01:55:22,687 --> 01:55:26,109
And the hope is that this is a multidisciplinary

1101
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:37,778
approach to this special, and we'll get into really the sort of branding of it and making sure that people are clearly communicating exactly what's going to take place when we convene next week.

1102
01:55:38,219 --> 01:55:38,779
Okay, great.

1103
01:55:38,899 --> 01:55:39,279
Thank you.

1104
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:40,580
Thank you.

1105
01:55:47,446 --> 01:55:47,686
Great.

1106
01:55:50,008 --> 01:55:51,449
If there's no further questions.

1107
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:53,230
Mayor?

1108
01:55:53,451 --> 01:55:53,651
No.

1109
01:55:53,931 --> 01:55:54,952
Yes, Member Graham.

1110
01:55:56,263 --> 01:56:08,385
I just wanted to make a motion to accept the recommendations outlined tonight in the superintendent's draft recommendations across all the categories to be included in the budget for May 19th.

1111
01:56:10,206 --> 01:56:10,526
Second.

1112
01:56:11,026 --> 01:56:14,346
For a final review, if we could just have that language for a final review.

1113
01:56:15,007 --> 01:56:17,567
Seconded by member Van de Kloet.

1114
01:56:18,247 --> 01:56:19,707
Member Van de Kloet, do you mind taking the role?

1115
01:56:20,228 --> 01:56:20,348
No.

1116
01:56:25,123 --> 01:56:26,523
So member Graham?

1117
01:56:27,004 --> 01:56:27,264
Yes.

1118
01:56:28,264 --> 01:56:29,145
Member Kretz?

1119
01:56:29,805 --> 01:56:30,065
Yes.

1120
01:56:31,046 --> 01:56:32,867
Member McLaughlin is absent.

1121
01:56:33,067 --> 01:56:35,669
Member McStone is absent.

1122
01:56:36,609 --> 01:56:37,410
Member Rousseau?

1123
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:38,830
Yes.

1124
01:56:39,771 --> 01:56:40,891
Member Van der Kloot, yes.

1125
01:56:40,992 --> 01:56:41,912
Mayor Lungo-Kern?

1126
01:56:43,373 --> 01:56:43,733
Yes.

1127
01:56:44,433 --> 01:56:45,994
Five in the affirmative, two absent.

1128
01:56:46,595 --> 01:56:49,136
The motion passes as amended.

1129
01:56:49,156 --> 01:56:50,717
Is there a motion to adjourn?

1130
01:56:51,208 --> 01:56:53,389
Mayor, just a couple of quick housekeeping.

1131
01:56:53,409 --> 01:56:58,893
Dave, you have about 30 seconds because it's 8.59 and this meeting ends at nine.

1132
01:57:01,254 --> 01:57:05,637
Actually, we were over by six minutes last time too, so we're actually supposed to go further into depth.

1133
01:57:05,677 --> 01:57:07,738
You used your six seconds.

1134
01:57:09,079 --> 01:57:13,622
May 18th and May 19th, we have our remaining academic programs in some of our operational areas.

1135
01:57:14,362 --> 01:57:20,046
We have in the agenda posted for May 19th listed that as both a wrap up of the remaining departments

1136
01:57:20,465 --> 01:57:22,406
as well as a budget hearing.

1137
01:57:22,746 --> 01:57:28,428
That is completely up to the school committee as to whether you'd like to hold a hearing that night and hear from the public speaking rather for or against.

1138
01:57:28,728 --> 01:57:32,409
Again, what you're driving toward here is the vote on the request.

1139
01:57:32,849 --> 01:57:45,393
There will be an additional set of meetings, or at least one, and I imagine a set of meetings in June once the appropriation is made and we're presenting the budget as it's outlined going into the start of fiscal year.

1140
01:57:46,467 --> 01:57:53,713
Statutorily, the wording is the proposed budget, and so that's why we listed it, just in case you wanted to hold a hearing that evening.

1141
01:57:54,113 --> 01:58:01,159
But certainly, you're not obligated to hold only one, and you could hold one in June when the appropriation is made as well.

1142
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:07,665
We just wanted to post that correctly, so I defer to you as to how you would like that structured on May 19th.

1143
01:58:09,086 --> 01:58:10,527
Member Russo?

1144
01:58:11,665 --> 01:58:12,245
Thank you, Mayor.

1145
01:58:12,966 --> 01:58:17,788
I thank you, Mr. Murphy for that question slash point.

1146
01:58:18,768 --> 01:58:20,989
I personally feel like they should not be together.

1147
01:58:21,009 --> 01:58:40,337
I think that when we finish the part like we're doing right now, I know I'm gonna wanna be able to sit down and do some math and add some things together and talk to people I know that are paying attention who may be on this meeting now, or simply at whom I'm gonna be like,

1148
01:58:41,203 --> 01:58:51,232
care about this, this is what's actually in that, in the budget, so that they can think about and prepare themselves to come and speak as members of the public.

1149
01:58:52,113 --> 01:58:58,219
And I think that there's, that happening together doesn't give enough time.

1150
01:58:58,279 --> 01:58:59,300
That's my opinion.

1151
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:01,442
I see everybody else's hands are up too, so.

1152
01:59:04,945 --> 01:59:06,767
Member Kretz, then Member Graham.

1153
01:59:09,608 --> 01:59:12,449
Yes, I have the same thoughts as Mr. Russo.

1154
01:59:12,929 --> 01:59:22,933
I think that that would be too much in one meeting and a lot to absorb in one meeting for everybody and then to have the public join in.

1155
01:59:23,033 --> 01:59:31,596
So I do recommend that we make a separate date to have the public hearing so that the community can participate.

1156
01:59:36,617 --> 01:59:37,038
Thank you.

1157
01:59:37,098 --> 01:59:37,698
Member Graham?

1158
01:59:39,771 --> 01:59:51,616
My question was about, I thought that last year there was some issue about posting requirements in that the budget hearing has to go in the newspaper some amount of time ahead.

1159
01:59:51,696 --> 01:59:52,757
Is that true?

1160
01:59:53,477 --> 02:00:03,921
So similar to the, if you remember when we talked about our process, I referenced that the vast majority of school committees don't take the second vote to adopt the budget.

1161
02:00:05,042 --> 02:00:08,343
The language in the statute related to the newspaper is similar to that.

1162
02:00:09,295 --> 02:00:14,416
from an enforceability perspective, we will certainly call the newspaper and tell them that this budget is posted there.

1163
02:00:14,736 --> 02:00:18,217
We don't have any authority to tell the newspaper what to publish.

1164
02:00:18,277 --> 02:00:24,539
And in many communities, the reason this is becoming even more of an issue is there aren't as many newspapers to publish this.

1165
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:27,359
And so school committees are running into this all over the Commonwealth.

1166
02:00:27,419 --> 02:00:31,840
But whether you, I mean, I think I hear the sentiments of the committee.

1167
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:34,301
So it sounds like we're not gonna have to worry about this for May 19th.

1168
02:00:35,092 --> 02:00:43,008
We'll post the agenda appropriately, and we will find newspaper and ask them to run the fact that we're having a hearing when the time comes.

1169
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:44,932
And I would.

1170
02:00:46,084 --> 02:01:00,752
I would agree that having that budget hearing and ultimately the vote of what we will send to the mayor's office as our request should not be on the same night as we're like sort of wrapping everything else up.

1171
02:01:00,812 --> 02:01:04,914
But I actually also wanna say that I don't want that to languish.

1172
02:01:04,974 --> 02:01:08,176
Like I think that is an important thing for us to get done in the month of May.

1173
02:01:08,196 --> 02:01:15,020
I don't want to delay because I think in all fairness to the rest of the community that,

1174
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:20,322
The mayor's going to need that for her consideration, the council is going to want to know what we had to say.

1175
02:01:20,342 --> 02:01:27,325
And as you mentioned like all of that has to like fall into place in order for us to then come back.

1176
02:01:29,666 --> 02:01:35,511
deal with whatever appropriation is allotted to Medford Public Schools and make those final decisions.

1177
02:01:35,571 --> 02:01:40,075
So I would still wanna see that budget hearing happen in the month of May.

1178
02:01:40,095 --> 02:01:44,759
So I would like to get that on the calendar as quickly as possible.

1179
02:01:44,939 --> 02:01:47,621
I think the will of the committee seems pretty clear.

1180
02:01:47,661 --> 02:01:52,966
We'll send some proposed dates around to you tomorrow and we will put that on our calendars.

1181
02:01:54,027 --> 02:01:54,747
Okay, thank you.

1182
02:01:57,029 --> 02:01:57,430
Mayor.

1183
02:01:58,570 --> 02:02:10,775
Thank you, I just have a quick question for Mr. Murphy about the, you know, since we've always done the one vote, does the statute say that we must post for the first vote or the second vote?

1184
02:02:11,995 --> 02:02:13,536
Post with regard to the hearing, you mean?

1185
02:02:14,896 --> 02:02:15,636
For the hearing, yes.

1186
02:02:16,037 --> 02:02:26,741
Yeah, the wording is proposed, and I haven't read the legislative history in some time, but I believe when I last did, the language of using the term proposed budget is

1187
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:31,242
predates some of the changes in the law.

1188
02:02:31,683 --> 02:02:45,573
It also, and my guess is this is why they haven't bothered to change it, in other forms of government, the proposed budget would have a different set of implications because it would be the budget that would go directly to the town meeting for adoption there.

1189
02:02:45,633 --> 02:02:52,779
So it doesn't specify, I think it's, frankly, I think it's fine either way.

1190
02:02:53,639 --> 02:02:58,103
From a practical perspective, stepping away from the statutory lane, you know,

1191
02:02:58,637 --> 02:03:05,140
I think we've had, we will have had five public discussions of this in which the administration, the school committee have engaged.

1192
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:11,063
And I think what has been a constructive discourse so far related to what the budgetary priorities are, what some of the pressure points are.

1193
02:03:11,083 --> 02:03:19,466
I certainly think it makes sense to open that up to the community and hold a hearing, but that's not to suggest, as I said before, you can only have one.

1194
02:03:20,627 --> 02:03:27,290
So I think you'll have time to sort of entertain that as over the course of the next month.

1195
02:03:28,524 --> 02:03:33,425
It isn't specified whether it's the vote to request or the vote to adopt.

1196
02:03:34,026 --> 02:03:37,126
And I think you're not restricted to one or the other anyway.

1197
02:03:38,487 --> 02:03:38,847
Thank you.

1198
02:03:38,967 --> 02:03:39,607
