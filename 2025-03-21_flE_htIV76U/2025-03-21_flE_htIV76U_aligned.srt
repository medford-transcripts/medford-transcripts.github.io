1
00:00:02,758 --> 00:00:05,258
The 37th regular meeting of the Memphis City Council will come to order.

2
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:06,139
The clerk will call the roll.

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,019
Councilor Arena?

4
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:07,579
Present.

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,099
Councilor Camuso?

6
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:09,599
Present.

7
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:11,059
Vice President De La Rosa?

8
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:11,420
Present.

9
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,700
Councilor Longo Fernandez?

10
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,100
Present.

11
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,160
Councilor Monk?

12
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:14,820
Present.

13
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,420
Councilor Pepin?

14
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:15,660
Present.

15
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,281
Councilor Malauulu?

16
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:17,961
Present.

17
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:19,241
Seven members present, none absent.

18
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,021
Kindly please rise to salute the flag.

19
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:31,723
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,

20
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:34,889
Do you recognize Vice President Del Russo for suspension?

21
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,530
Mr. President, move suspension so that we can hear from the representative of the Jingle Bell Festival.

22
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,430
Yes.

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,051
Representative from the Jingle Bell Festival, Mrs. Judith Lonegan, why don't you give us an idea of what's going on.

24
00:00:49,291 --> 00:01:00,534
Well, tomorrow night starts the Jingle Bell Festival and the mayor has all his festivities with the ice carving, Santa Claus, hot dogs, all kinds of things going on.

25
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:15,887
The first time we're going to do a community carol sing, not to beat our Guinness Book of World Records, which we hope to attempt again in a couple of years or maybe next year, but just to bring the community together to sing during the tomorrow night's festivities.

26
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:31,630
And then the trees will be on display, which we have 60 decorated trees who have been donated by some of our counselors and businesses, people in the community, citizens in the community have graciously donated over the last, this is our 13th festival,

27
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:34,382
Some of them have donated for 13 years to us.

28
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:42,164
All the money that's raised on the chances is donated to Medford's Buddy Coholan Alzheimer's Daycare Center on Washington Street.

29
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:49,807
On Saturday night, the trees will be available for chances from tomorrow night on up until 7 o'clock at night.

30
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:53,108
And from like 12 o'clock to 7 o'clock, someone will be here.

31
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:59,770
And then on Saturday night at 4 o'clock, we have a gala house tour and we have six homes that are decorated in Medford.

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,621
and they do the house tour, and then we come back for dinner at City Hall afterwards.

33
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:11,322
And then on Sunday, that starts at four o'clock, and on Sunday we have a tour again that starts at 12 o'clock.

34
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:13,463
Tickets can be purchased.

35
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:23,905
We're sold out for Saturday night pretty much, but if people are interested, they can contact me or go to jinglebelfestival.org in Medford, Mass., if you're interested in tickets.

36
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:25,945
We still have tickets available for Sunday.

37
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:29,646
And we invite everybody in the community to participate either tomorrow night,

38
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:36,652
or come in by chances from us for this worthy cause, or over the weekend attend the house chores and the dinner and receptions.

39
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:38,073
Thank you very much.

40
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:40,433
And you have some of your committee members here, Judy?

41
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:40,873
I do.

42
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:44,754
Rosemary Adagna, Rosalie Sullivan, Claire Qualantino.

43
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:52,116
We have a committee of about 40 women and men who have been working on this festival for 13 years.

44
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:55,116
And it's become kind of a great tradition in the community.

45
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:57,257
You get on the radio in the morning, too.

46
00:02:57,297 --> 00:02:57,677
I've heard you.

47
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:00,297
Great publicity, it's great work.

48
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:01,958
Thank you very much.

49
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:03,518
Nice work, congratulations.

50
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:04,018
Terrific.

51
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,780
Also, we're under suspension.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,180
If we could have a moment of silence.

53
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:19,303
Rita Snyderman was mother of Sandra Finn and mother-in-law to our city clerk Edward Finn passed away recently.

54
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:20,963
If we could all rise for a moment of silence.

55
00:03:21,963 --> 00:03:24,144
Remembering Mrs. Snyderman.

56
00:03:34,997 --> 00:04:00,294
Also on suspension, 2011-727 off by Councilor Marks, be resolved that the Mayor McGlynn appointed Citizens Transportation Advisory Committee to establish a new transportation policy and planning framework to include a parking management plan, a traffic flow study, bicyclist-friendly master plan, transportation needs, and to develop a long-term plan to improve pedestrian safety features like crosswalks, signage, and lights.

57
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:01,475
Councilor Marks.

58
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:03,917
Thank you, Mr. President.

59
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:18,642
Uh, the purpose of this resolution tonight, uh, is to create a transportation advisory committee, uh, with volunteer citizens who shall act as a clearing house for transportation issues affecting the city of method.

60
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:32,533
The committee should provide input and advisory direction to boards and commissions and city administration to assist in suggesting creative ways to deal with the myriad of traffic, pedestrian safety issues, transit service,

61
00:04:32,993 --> 00:04:37,516
and transportation planning issues in the city of method responsibilities.

62
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:48,583
I perceive this committee to have Mr. President is to review and provide comments and recommendations on a longterm plan to improve pedestrian safety within our community.

63
00:04:49,324 --> 00:05:01,552
Also to review city bus ridership, bus routes every six months and make appropriate recommendations to the council review and provide recommendations on transportation policies, issues and programs,

64
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:04,995
which involved the MBTA and the commuter rail.

65
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:10,217
Review and advise on citywide parking management plan and traffic flow.

66
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:14,479
Review and provide recommendations on a citywide bicycle plan.

67
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,360
Establish an annual work plan to address specific issues.

68
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:29,140
You know, the town of Arlington has had a Transportation Advisory Commission, which they refer to as TAC, in place for several years now.

69
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:37,670
And the city of Newton has had this same advisory committee in place, manned with volunteers throughout the community.

70
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:46,035
And they are not to replace current traffic commissions, boards, authority of anyone in the city.

71
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:54,445
It's to act in an advisory capacity to assist in moving issues forward that deal with pedestrian safety.

72
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,357
deal with transportation issues in the community, traffic flow.

73
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:05,280
These are the issues that we hear week after week, month after month, year after year within our community.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,045
And we as a community can no longer afford to sit back and wait for accidents to happen on our street and then react.

75
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,666
We can no longer afford to do that.

76
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:18,987
We need to take back our streets.

77
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,169
Our streets have become raceways.

78
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:30,859
They're no longer a place safe for children, seniors, families to walk down our sidewalks or cross the street.

79
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,222
We as a community have to get serious about this.

80
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:49,571
And one way I believe we can do this is not to react on every street that comes before us or every issue that comes before us, but to have a board, an advisory committee, whatever you want to call it,

81
00:06:50,485 --> 00:07:00,928
that is there to address issues, to do research, to offer opinions, to hold meetings, to get community input, and to follow through on issues.

82
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:07,750
One of the biggest concerns I have in this community is the lack of follow through.

83
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,971
And it's not just the administration, it's this council.

84
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:15,512
We need to follow through on issues.

85
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:20,446
You know, we had the residents of Golden Ave that came up before us several months ago.

86
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:27,828
I'm still getting emails from those residents that were concerned about heavy trucking and speeding on their street.

87
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,950
Nothing has been done to date to improve the conditions on Golden Ave.

88
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,771
This is symptomatic throughout the entire community.

89
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:45,513
We need, Mr. President, to tap upon

90
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:48,590
the many involved citizens in this community.

91
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:56,336
We can no longer say that this is being handled by the traffic commission, or this is being handled by off-street parking.

92
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:07,884
We need to get people that want to be involved in this community, want to offer their expertise, their life experience, and involve them in committees.

93
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:11,747
Residents want to get active.

94
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,328
They want to know how they can help out.

95
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,310
I've already had several emails

96
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:22,761
from residents of this community stating, Mike, if I can get on this committee, please mention my name.

97
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:23,881
I'd be interested.

98
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,041
Unsolicited.

99
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:28,782
People want to get involved.

100
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:31,263
People want to know how they can help out their community.

101
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:36,604
There's no salary attached with this citizen advisory board.

102
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:40,065
It won't cost the city a penny to establish this.

103
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:57,553
And I'm hoping the mayor sees fit in his capacity as the chief executive officer to create a committee, not just to serve for a year and then dissolve or two years and dissolve, but to be established lifelong committee in this community.

104
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:06,999
Transportation, although the forms may change and the type of transportation, there'll always be a need to oversee transportation within our community.

105
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,261
There will always be a need.

106
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:16,305
to make sure pedestrian safety is at the forefront of every issue.

107
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:32,120
There will always be a need to make sure that our streets are safe, that the T's are accessible, that the current routes work, that the Green Line extension, whatever the capacity may be,

108
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:35,603
It's going to be beneficial for our community.

109
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:44,149
These are the things I envision this volunteer committee to work on and make recommendations and they will have a yearly agenda.

110
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:46,430
This won't be behind closed doors.

111
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,832
This won't be operated in a vacuum.

112
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:57,217
These will be meetings held by committee posted by the city clerk and attended by residents of this community.

113
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:00,940
You know,

114
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:13,296
I talked to one of the town administrators over in Arlington and they said, honestly, they don't know where they would be without this advisory committee.

115
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:31,689
That's how involved, how influential and how active this committee is in pushing issues forward and doing the research and offering the framework that needs to be done in order to get the plans.

116
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:39,989
You know, these are the issues that need to be looked at, and we can't afford to address them one at a time.

117
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,392
What street comes up that doesn't have resident permit parking?

118
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:50,457
The unfortunate accident on Winthrop Street where a student was hit, and now we have painted crosswalks and signage.

119
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:56,361
No, we can't afford to operate a city no longer like this, Mr. President.

120
00:10:56,711 --> 00:11:02,535
I know there's a resident that came up, there was several residents that emailed me that said they couldn't make it tonight, but we're in full support.

121
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:05,537
I believe they sent the entire council the email also.

122
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:14,444
They're in full support of this and I'm hoping, Mr. President, that the mayor sees fit, that it's time that we move this community forward.

123
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:16,825
We start addressing the transportation issues.

124
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,727
You know, we're five minutes from Boston.

125
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:24,531
We have all sorts of commuter rail access, T access into town and it's about time

126
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:28,317
that we take this issue by the horns.

127
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:31,978
And it's about time we take our streets back.

128
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:48,442
And I don't want to hear from families that they're afraid to send their kids out because of the speeding on their street, or they're afraid to send them to the square because of the traffic and the cars and the lack of enforcement.

129
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:51,482
Thank you, Mr. President.

130
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:52,343
Thank you.

131
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:54,383
Councilor Penta.

132
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:57,482
Councilor Camuso or Penta?

133
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,103
My light went on.

134
00:11:58,523 --> 00:11:59,083
Your light was on.

135
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,823
Councilor Longo-Curran.

136
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:01,203
Thank you.

137
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:02,564
Oh, I'm sorry.

138
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:05,325
It was Councilor Camuso.

139
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:05,945
Sure.

140
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:06,745
I'll be brief.

141
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:09,326
Thank you, Councilor Mayeco.

142
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:11,386
I just want to go on record.

143
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:12,727
I think it's a good resolve.

144
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:16,708
I think it's something that obviously is working for other cities and towns.

145
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:20,469
And I think it's something that, you know, I thank Councilor Mox for bringing it forward.

146
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,170
I think it's something we definitely need to look at and hopefully the mayor will

147
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:37,784
really take this under advisement and go forward, and especially if we have residents who are willing to, whether it's once a week or once a month, meet and really go through our city bit by bit to see where the traffic problems are, what can be improved upon.

148
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:41,826
I think it's a way, and we speak about it all the time, to be proactive.

149
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:53,413
You know, what happened a couple weeks ago with the Winthrop Street, George Street intersection, that was a, it needed to be in front of the council, but that was a reactive situation where the city reacted

150
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:55,946
to an unfortunate accident.

151
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,706
And these accidents are happening all the time, all over.

152
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:04,228
And it's because there's truly concerned residents with small children in that area.

153
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:05,228
They came forward.

154
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:09,369
We were able to push the resolutions forward.

155
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:13,410
And I think because of us, it got done quicker than it may have gotten done.

156
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,010
But it was a reactive situation.

157
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,651
I think we need to be more proactive.

158
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:21,792
We need to, what Councilman Marks alluded to,

159
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:33,514
go through the city and really map out a master plan on how we can improve upon the speeding, the traffic, the accidents, and a whole host of different issues.

160
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:52,338
My one concern, Council Box, and the rest of the council would be the fact that you sat on a committee for over a year and discussed traffic with the chief of police, you went to other, you know, the committee went to other communities, you come up with this lengthy report on what is needed in the city,

161
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,172
and it just fell on deaf ears.

162
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:55,613
It went nowhere.

163
00:13:55,733 --> 00:14:03,575
So I would hate to see residents of our community sit and give up their time to not be heard.

164
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:10,616
So my hope would be not only to implement this committee, but to take the recommendations seriously and to act upon them.

165
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:17,158
Some of the things that will need to be acted upon are going to cost some money, but at the same time I hope the administration

166
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:22,528
And I know this council will be committed to improving on what is going on in our community now.

167
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:24,069
So that would be my concern.

168
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:29,633
And I hope the administration would not act as they did with the traffic commission report.

169
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:37,620
Um, my last comment is, you know, the people serving on our traffic commission, they do a good job, they're working hard, but they also have full time jobs.

170
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,245
We're talking the chief of police, Lauren D Lorenzo from the office community development, Jack Buckley from the DPW yards.

171
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:46,584
from the DBW director.

172
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:55,787
Those are three people work too many hours to being, you know, to really get into the nitty gritty of what a traffic committee would be able to do.

173
00:14:55,907 --> 00:15:05,451
So I'm in favor and I hope that it not only moves forward, but that the recommendations and the time put into resolves are acted upon.

174
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,212
Thank you.

175
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:08,232
Councilor Camuso.

176
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:12,372
Thank you, Mr. President, and I applaud Counselor Marks for bringing this forward.

177
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:21,656
I think now more than ever, Mr. President, this is something that would be a good addition to the boards and commissions that we have that look at some of these issues.

178
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:32,280
As we know, statutorily, under mass general laws, certain boards and commissions have the statutory obligation to act or not act on these because it falls under their jurisdiction.

179
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,282
With that being said, though, having more citizen input, other than just having them attend the

180
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:44,865
regular business meetings of the boards that are tasked with putting some of these into place, I think is great.

181
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:48,606
And now more than ever, Mr. President, there's more vehicles on the road.

182
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:54,569
And quite frankly, I think this may be a good time for the mayor to look at all the boards and commissions.

183
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,189
throughout the entire city.

184
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,251
Maybe some of them are not needed anymore.

185
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:05,393
Maybe new ones are needed, maybe more in technology area or other areas.

186
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:24,280
So at the same time, if Councillor Marks wouldn't mind, actually make it a B paper because I certainly, I understand the importance of his proposal before us to maybe take a look at all the boards and commissions and see if it's an appropriate time, Mr. President, to either add

187
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:31,130
combine or delete some of the commissions or boards based upon, um, uh, just today's day and age.

188
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,991
And we have many fine members that are on these boards.

189
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:43,235
And, uh, if the, uh, board is no longer needed, maybe they're willing to serve in another capacity, uh, where their professionalism will be recognized and, uh, help this community move forward.

190
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,097
But, uh, thank you, councilor marks for bringing this forward.

191
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:47,697
Thank you.

192
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:48,918
Vice president Del Rosso.

193
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:53,640
Uh, mr. President, uh, through the chair to council marks, thank you for your, uh,

194
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,911
You're moving this.

195
00:16:56,872 --> 00:17:07,219
I think I have over the years mentioned in one way or another that what we have doesn't work all that well most of the time.

196
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:10,081
I'm grateful for the people that serve on those boards and commissions.

197
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:13,223
But there's some things not working in this community.

198
00:17:13,763 --> 00:17:23,369
I know a lot of it boils down to money that we're not able to implement and do the things that a lot of people have the vision to see done.

199
00:17:25,302 --> 00:17:27,084
This is a worthy step.

200
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:34,831
I wonder if, I just wonder out loud, I don't have the answer to it, if it adds another layer to government that might become cumbersome.

201
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:37,693
So the whole thing needs to be looked at.

202
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:51,806
The other point that Councilor Lungo-Kern had brought up so aptly is that sometimes one is left with the feeling that these boards

203
00:17:52,410 --> 00:18:14,208
that have great participation, which is what you envision, Counselor, great participation, talent from the community, insight, vision, forward thinking, oftentimes they end up in stagnation in an action because of whatever reasons not being theirs.

204
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:21,514
And I wouldn't want to see something so grand as this to be diminished.

205
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:24,367
and to have people's hopes dashed.

206
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:27,349
I don't know what the answer is.

207
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:28,690
This is a worthy start.

208
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:34,975
What we have and what we're doing in this community isn't working.

209
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:41,780
And I think that's what this is motivated out of my senses from what you shared with us tonight.

210
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:49,266
And I, as the chairman of the subcommittee on transportation and as somebody who's worked

211
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:56,705
at sometimes more diligently than others on the Green Line project.

212
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:07,673
I share your frustration to some level with this, and I'd like to see progress be made in that area.

213
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,534
I'll support this.

214
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:10,815
Thank you.

215
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,917
On the motion for approval, want to speak on this?

216
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:15,718
Name and address for the record, please.

217
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:17,443
Anthony D'Antonio, Yale Street.

218
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:21,346
Thank you for bringing this up this evening, Councilor Marks.

219
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:29,133
I'd like to go on record as saying I'd like to volunteer to be a member of this advisory committee if it does become, if it does come to fruition.

220
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:34,137
And I will promise you that if I'm on this board, it will not lead to stagnation.

221
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:34,977
Thank you.

222
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:35,858
Thank you.

223
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:40,342
Here we go again.

224
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:43,184
Dr. William Wood, 25 Basel Row.

225
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:45,166
Mike, it was a great job.

226
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:48,428
Fantastic, but it's political.

227
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,752
You talk to people in Arlington, I did too.

228
00:19:53,993 --> 00:20:11,788
I brought their names up at public meetings, people who didn't like what was going on and had no root to discuss it other than through politics, by coming up in their town meetings and screaming, we don't want the green line here.

229
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:13,889
We don't want it at Route 16.

230
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,328
It's in the record, public record.

231
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:27,136
By the way, I am one of the organizers of GLAM, Green Line Meeting Group.

232
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:29,818
I'm not opposed to what you're saying.

233
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,904
In fact, you and I have been friends for many, many years, Michael, and I support community import.

234
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:40,907
But I support total community import.

235
00:20:41,686 --> 00:21:07,455
meaning everybody gets a chance, not like some of the things that have happened at the Green Line, where certain people, certain educated class people, certain, as was said in today's Boston Globe, barbarians at the thing about the Harvard 99 group that's inside Harvard, are the only ones that get the permission to work on these committees.

236
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:25,275
We and GLAM are the only recognized federal transportation group in Massachusetts that work with disabled environmental justice.

237
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,077
You never talked to me, Mike.

238
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:29,548
You never asked me a question.

239
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:31,609
You never even knew what it was.

240
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:35,031
I'm embarrassed since I've been your friend for many years.

241
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,694
I'm embarrassed that I have to come up here and say I can't support it.

242
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:41,995
Parts of it.

243
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:43,556
There's many parts of it I can.

244
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:47,018
But there are many parts of it that need to be hacked out of it.

245
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:56,464
Because if they're not, what you're gonna do is set up a political group that's gonna fight for things that people in this city don't really want.

246
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,091
And they proved it by voting for you.

247
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:06,873
And they proved it by electing you people for transportation.

248
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:20,858
As I went out there and screamed for my candidates, well, you being one of them, and I do look at my candidate over there, who is not on the board right now, against the green line.

249
00:22:21,721 --> 00:22:27,049
That's against the transportation because of what the tragedy it will commit in our community.

250
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:33,096
Now, I ask you to go back, and the council to go back, and rephrase all this.

251
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:49,488
Rephrase it where people like myself actually get on it, or my wife gets on it, or some African-American who wants to be on it but can't, as what the state did on the design workshop, did not allow.

252
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:55,933
In fact, there's a gentleman in the first row, right there, who was denied being on it because he was disabled.

253
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,023
Jimmy, you don't mind me saying that, do you?

254
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:01,124
Go right ahead.

255
00:23:01,624 --> 00:23:06,424
So, you know, you've got to really look at these things and talk to them.

256
00:23:06,544 --> 00:23:10,485
Now, on planning, Mike, MPO, we just sued MPO.

257
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:11,285
We won.

258
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:17,886
They left out disabled and African-Americans out of their planning process.

259
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:20,487
I'm going to say it one more time, Mike.

260
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:23,987
They left out... Dr. Wood.

261
00:23:24,107 --> 00:23:24,327
Bill.

262
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:25,728
It's Councilor Mox.

263
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:26,608
Councilor Mox.

264
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:26,888
Thank you.

265
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:28,827
Yes.

266
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:30,228
Point of information.

267
00:23:30,428 --> 00:23:34,509
And I respect the gentleman at the podium, as he said, stated, I've known him for a lot of years.

268
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:38,011
Um, I think he's missing the resolution.

269
00:23:38,331 --> 00:23:41,592
And if I could just state, no, you're hiding the resolution, Mike.

270
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:44,173
I met counselor marks.

271
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:45,674
He's got a point of information.

272
00:23:45,814 --> 00:23:47,634
The resolution is printed on our agenda.

273
00:23:47,654 --> 00:23:48,995
So nothing is hidden here.

274
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:54,617
The intent of the resolution, Dr. Wood is to establish an advisory committee in nature

275
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:58,980
to assist the city, and I know you're trying to make this a Green Line issue.

276
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,940
No, I'm not.

277
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,701
That's all you've stated is Green Line.

278
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:02,902
Well, you want me to go further?

279
00:24:02,962 --> 00:24:04,603
This is not a Green Line issue, Bill.

280
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:10,307
This is an issue relative to having citizens of this community take an active role

281
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:12,348
and taking back our streets.

282
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:29,357
If you heard the issues that I hear on a daily basis regarding people that are afraid to cross our streets, regarding transportation issues, regarding speeding on our streets, regarding the lack of signage, the lack of crosswalks, and the list goes on and on, Dr. Wood, then you would realize

283
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,871
that there is a need to supplement what's currently taking place, as Councilor Del Russo alluded to.

284
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:40,812
What's currently taking place right now is this community reacts to everything.

285
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:51,475
Rather than having a committee, in my opinion, there would be advisory in nature, and it would be appointed, and that's why this wasn't crafted to create a committee.

286
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:55,995
There's no language here that says how many members, who will appoint, or so forth.

287
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:58,296
We're asking the mayor in his capacity

288
00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:04,081
as the chief executive officer to look into this and establish a transportation advisory committee.

289
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:07,623
We're not asking him to turn this into a political ball.

290
00:25:07,944 --> 00:25:16,889
We're not asking him to sway this to put people that are in favor of the green line on this committee and, and, and, and make everyone else not part of this committee.

291
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:24,814
So I don't think there's any, um, you know, as you state that, uh, you know, there's no malice behind this.

292
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:27,115
There's no intent to exclude people.

293
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:30,638
Anyone would be welcome to serve in a citizen advisory committee.

294
00:25:30,918 --> 00:25:36,223
I appreciate your input, but I just don't want people to believe this is Green Line or against Green Line.

295
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:41,407
This has nothing to do other than with improving transportation within our community.

296
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:46,372
Now, Mike, you just, I mean, Mr. Counselor Marks, you just made a great speech.

297
00:25:46,952 --> 00:25:52,222
It was wonderful and I agree with most of what you said, but you didn't let me finish.

298
00:25:52,663 --> 00:25:57,532
I also served on a bike committee, the formation of a bike committee in the city.

299
00:25:58,497 --> 00:26:02,419
Most of those people had no idea what a tricycle meant to a disabled person.

300
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,663
Most of them didn't understand what it meant to be in a wheelchair for disabled people.

301
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:13,566
I brought this up, by the way, at a meeting which, unfortunately, you weren't at.

302
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:14,867
You were working.

303
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,449
But I think other counselors can remember.

304
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:22,352
I said that Bruce Kulick and I served together.

305
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:25,297
to work on a committee on bicycle.

306
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,563
Two years ago, they didn't even know what the real name of a bicycle path is.

307
00:26:31,604 --> 00:26:37,490
And I asked the councillor, are you sure it's a bike path, ladies and gentlemen, and it's not a community path?

308
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:44,931
And those issues we've been working on, I only bring the green line up because it's the biggest political issue now.

309
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:53,377
I can bring up others that you don't know I have worked on in terms of transportation in the city.

310
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:55,578
I do volunteer my time.

311
00:26:56,139 --> 00:27:01,923
I also research extremely on issues like this.

312
00:27:02,503 --> 00:27:04,305
I found out that new stops.

313
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:12,951
a program that would give us money for such things as bike paths, pedestrian ways, in this.

314
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:19,556
I brought it to the city and to other people in the state level.

315
00:27:20,617 --> 00:27:24,300
So, Mike, maybe you ought to talk to people more

316
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,600
I'm sorry, I apologize.

317
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:32,827
Counselor Marks, maybe you need to talk to others who are critics and skeptics too.

318
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:37,292
Not just those people who raise a flag and say we should do it.

319
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:39,054
The cost factors.

320
00:27:39,214 --> 00:27:40,655
I've studied cost factors.

321
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:41,596
I've studied it.

322
00:27:41,816 --> 00:27:47,883
Yes, I would love to be on that committee because I'll be back here at this council if it doesn't go right.

323
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,075
and bringing up the same issues.

324
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:52,604
It won't be something brand new to me.

325
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,072
It won't be something I'm learning about.

326
00:27:56,084 --> 00:28:08,349
And yes, I do agree with Councilor Marks and Councilor De La Russo on things like transportation in the pedestrian ways.

327
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:10,150
I do agree with that.

328
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,152
But I also agree that there needs to be more handicapped spaces.

329
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:20,614
There needs to be more disabled people being able to ride down the street in their...

330
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:24,276
bicycle, tricycles, or in their wheelchairs.

331
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:30,821
I also agree that there's a lot more to transportation than we've seen in your amendment.

332
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:35,744
Whether the mayor appoints a committee or not will not matter to me.

333
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:44,630
I'll probably be there as a participant without chairman status or status as a member of the committee.

334
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,973
But it's a damn shame you're not listening.

335
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:53,239
And Councilor Marks, it's the first time I've ever heard you not listen.

336
00:28:54,039 --> 00:29:01,361
I said in the beginning, I used the green line as an example, only as one.

337
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:04,382
There are many other examples I could talk about.

338
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:11,525
I also went to the parking thing and also was one of the people who favored

339
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:19,037
And I know some people don't favor it, but I favored the parking lot in Medford Square.

340
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:22,580
So it's not something new, Mr. Marks.

341
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,382
And I do not like the way you've written this.

342
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:31,726
If you take certain things out of it and split it in two, I think you've got a great idea.

343
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:45,616
But more community active, more what the city needs in terms of parking, in terms of traffic, in terms of pedestrians,

344
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:52,043
And leave the rest to people who are arguing on both sides of it to argue it out.

345
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:53,465
And leave the commissions alone.

346
00:29:54,747 --> 00:29:56,228
They're doing the best job yet possible.

347
00:29:56,489 --> 00:29:58,591
I'm not saying it's the best that can be done.

348
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:04,142
But you're usurping your own commissions, and I don't see the sense in usurping a commission.

349
00:30:04,662 --> 00:30:11,567
I see the sense of fighting with them, and I think everybody here knows if there's something wrong, I will go in and fight.

350
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:16,090
So thank you very much, Councilor Marks and all the rest of your councilors.

351
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:16,911
Thank you.

352
00:30:18,172 --> 00:30:19,773
Councilor Pater, the motion for approval.

353
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:22,715
I think it's very unfair that Mr. Wood came to this podium

354
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:44,702
and virtually attacked a city councilor on a resolution that is nothing more than a result of numerous, because we all received them, numerous resolutions of public safety issues in this community, whether it's signage, crosswalks, intersection, lights, speeding, not enough police protection at certain places.

355
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,280
I think maybe Mr. Wood didn't get the issue.

356
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:56,647
I don't think he understood the fact that Councillor Marks, in his resolution, did talk about pedestrian safety, did talk about bicycle paths.

357
00:30:57,107 --> 00:31:06,555
He made references to a long-term approach, and in this long-term approach would be inclusive, I would assume, of all the things that Mr. Wood would want to be talking about.

358
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:21,406
The unfortunate part about it is you can't win in this council, because when you put a resolution, this isn't even my resolution, I don't even know why I'm talking about it, but I will talk about it, because it's one of my colleagues, and if I agree with one of my colleagues, I'll support it, if I disagree, I won't support it.

359
00:31:21,906 --> 00:31:36,056
But I support it only for one reason, because we all have been inundated over the last few months from resolutions of people throughout this community who just get absolutely no satisfaction from this administration on their issues.

360
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:52,924
I have to assume that part of this resolution smacks with a sense of frustration because we are at a, this council as a whole is sometimes just handheld with inability to do anything because it's this mayor who just refuses to do anything.

361
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,906
Now the best part about this most recent election, hopefully you got a wake up call.

362
00:31:58,806 --> 00:32:02,408
from someone who was brand new running for office and got almost 36% of the vote.

363
00:32:02,908 --> 00:32:03,809
That's a wake-up call.

364
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,310
He's got to start listening to what's going on out there.

365
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:10,073
Councilor Camuso, you brought up a good point about maybe consolidating the commissions.

366
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:18,718
But before we get to the idea of consolidating or eliminating any of these commissions, look at all the people that are sitting there with terms that have been expired for months, if not years.

367
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:20,960
That needs to be reviewed first.

368
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:29,973
Why would somebody be sitting on a board that's been expired for months and years and you're worried about whether they're even capable of doing the job or consolidating or merging them?

369
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:32,096
I think it's a good resolution.

370
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:34,700
I think the unfortunate part, one correction to Councilor Langel.

371
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,651
It was two years, not one year.

372
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:50,420
Counsel Mark said on that traffic commission report, it was submitted in September, October of 2009, and this is now 2011, so two years after the fact, and the mayor is yet to act on that traffic commission report.

373
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,625
You have traffic supervisors on the street right now being told that they're gonna lose their benefits because they don't work enough hours.

374
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:01,588
So we're gonna figure out a way how to give you more hours to work it out.

375
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:05,750
Maybe the game plan, they're going to be the new traffic enforcement division.

376
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,291
I don't know, but you know that's going to stir apart with the unions around here.

377
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:18,496
You know, it's very hard to make a conversation come to a life where everybody can understand what's going on, especially the folks who might be watching and the audience that's here tonight.

378
00:33:18,976 --> 00:33:23,278
There's absolutely no communication coming from this administration on these particular issues.

379
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:31,922
And I guarantee you, this issue, this resolution wouldn't even be on the agenda if the concerns that have been expressed by taxpayers, when a phone call is made to City Hall,

380
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,453
as a resolution that I have on later on tonight, from over a year ago, has yet to be responded to.

381
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:39,075
That's frustration.

382
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:44,759
That is frustration from taxpayers who are paying their taxes in this city for simple little things.

383
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:48,321
If you can't accomplish it right away, at least return the phone call.

384
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:51,043
Let the taxpayer know that they've been acknowledged.

385
00:33:51,423 --> 00:33:53,645
So I support it, Councilor Marks.

386
00:33:53,705 --> 00:33:54,886
I think it's a good resolution.

387
00:33:55,286 --> 00:33:56,947
I think in whole the council supports it.

388
00:33:57,447 --> 00:34:00,930
It's just a matter of fact that, you know, when is the mayor gonna wake up and understand

389
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:04,732
that these resolutions all revolve around the taxpayers of this community.

390
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:07,618
It's not about any one of us, singularly or collectively.

391
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:11,826
It's about the taxpayers within this community who pay the bills every single day, every single week.

392
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:13,509
And that's what this is all about.

393
00:34:14,383 --> 00:34:18,747
Well, you might have your agenda, Dr. Wood, and I know it's the green line that you're impassioned about.

394
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:33,939
I don't think there's any one member on this council at any point in time that does not have the public safety at heart of the people in this community, whether it's a crosswalk, a sign, a policeman, speeding, fire, public safety, public works, whatever it might be.

395
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:41,065
That's one thing I don't think you can take away from this city council, because that's been our public priority since I think all seven of us have served on this council.

396
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:44,107
On the motion for approval, I'd like to speak

397
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:44,682
Yes.

398
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,123
Name and address for the record, please.

399
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:48,424
Robert Capucci of 71 Evans street.

400
00:34:49,204 --> 00:35:04,212
Uh, several months ago, a fellow citizen of mine, uh, John Stareller and I, we tried to get, uh, a charter commission formed by, by through petition, but we realized that we couldn't, we couldn't do this because it was a huge undertaking.

401
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:12,757
So I'm just asking the council again, if it's within your means to do so, to appoint a charter commission, to serve as a body that could caucus

402
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:18,720
I greatly agree with Councilor De La Russo in adding another layer of government.

403
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,740
That's not what I'm all about.

404
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:33,006
But if we had a charter commission that could carcass on various issues like traffic control, like the expenditures in a parking garage, like lights going out all around the city.

405
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:38,110
sidewalks that need to have crosswalks that are there.

406
00:35:38,811 --> 00:35:46,497
A board that can serve for the people to come as a third and final check and balance in our check and balance system of our public government.

407
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:49,880
The federal government operates on it with a president.

408
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:52,604
a judiciary and a legislature.

409
00:35:53,104 --> 00:36:04,167
This city has the city council and the mayor who never see eye to eye and a constituency that has to either keep emailing or running up to this podium.

410
00:36:04,987 --> 00:36:15,770
If it's within the purview of the Memphis City Council to appoint a charter commission to caucus on all these various issues to consolidate different

411
00:36:17,462 --> 00:36:23,948
conglomerations of, of, of big government here in this little city, then please, by all means do so.

412
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:39,583
Uh, uh, citizens, I'm going to have to ask citizens to, to help me like John Sterella and I, and we're going to have to get to this petition form to form a group, uh, as a charter commission that could serve the city and the citizens in a multitude of

413
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:56,479
of areas that I think would only help to ensure better roads, better lighting, better expenditures spent by our tax dollars, and to review the policies and actions, or lack thereof, of this board and of the CEO.

414
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,059
Thank you.

415
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:57,979
Thank you.

416
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,681
Hi there, my name's Laurel Aruma.

417
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:03,321
I live at 149 Burgett Avenue.

418
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:07,722
And thank you, Council Martz, for bringing up this commission idea.

419
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:08,403
I think it's a great one.

420
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:10,557
I have two points.

421
00:37:10,677 --> 00:37:19,199
One is from last week, which I didn't get to because I was making my pies, but you can get reverse 411 calls to your cell phone.

422
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:20,999
It'll also text you and email you.

423
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:23,779
So I hear from Mr. Clemente often.

424
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:33,841
And then the other one was the part about doing Yeoman's work, figuring out where the permit parking needs to really be done in Medford.

425
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:37,402
And it's pretty evident that we almost have like two cities.

426
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,042
One is much more,

427
00:37:40,447 --> 00:37:50,732
urban, and a lot like Somerville, where there's a lot of people living in dense areas, and the other one is a lot more like Winchester, where we have a lot of open space and not as much dense population.

428
00:37:51,312 --> 00:38:08,359
So anyway, because we have a lot of parking on our street for Tufts, and with the, you know, thinking that the Green Line's gonna come to our neighborhood at some point, on some day, and Burgett Ave is a direct abutter to that Green Line stop, I went to the traffic commission to get permit parking on our street.

429
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,720
So what I did,

430
00:38:10,225 --> 00:38:11,386
This is the yeoman's work part of it.

431
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:17,070
We created a map of all the streets around Burgett Avenue that already have permit parking.

432
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:18,111
Thank you.

433
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:25,376
So this is easy to tell that, with one map, where the parking problems are, right?

434
00:38:25,396 --> 00:38:29,059
Because people have already spent a lot of time and effort to get permit parking on their streets.

435
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,562
So this is just a simple example to show that there's a lot that can be done in the city.

436
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:33,942
Thank you.

437
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:39,947
And with the data and interested citizens, we can actually show

438
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:44,269
the problem spots that we need to actually address and do something about.

439
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:49,930
And this is why I think it's important to have a traffic commission and also a traffic enforcement policy of some sort.

440
00:38:51,010 --> 00:39:05,113
I fully expect that when permit parking goes in on our street on January 1st to be that crazy woman who calls constantly to complain that yet again there is someone parked in front of my house that works at Tufts all day long and I can't get my work done in the house or deliveries or whatever it may be.

441
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:07,433
So I would like to say that

442
00:39:07,988 --> 00:39:15,894
Council Marks, I think this is a great idea, and there's also a lot of other places in the city that we can look at that need this sort of improvement that does come with citizen involvement.

443
00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:16,334
Thank you.

444
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:17,455
Thank you.

445
00:39:20,537 --> 00:39:23,219
Hi, John Byers, 25 Brooks Park, Medford.

446
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,663
I'm all for the idea of a commission, and I'd be willing to sit on that type of commission.

447
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:32,106
I ride a bike throughout the city of Medford, and the one thing I see

448
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:42,936
is the only place where I can ride it is on the sidewalk because the danger of riding on the street is just too inherent for anyone to be able to ride a bike.

449
00:39:43,136 --> 00:39:51,381
The only safe place to ride it is on the street, but then you run into the problem of having to watch out for pedestrians on the sidewalk.

450
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:59,203
So it's just a no-win situation, and there aren't too many shortcuts around the city to get to where you want, so you gotta take the main roads.

451
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:02,543
So I'd be more than willing to sit on a committee like that, thank you.

452
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:03,483
Thank you.

453
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,884
On the motion of approval by Councilor Marks, all those in favor, all those opposed?

454
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:10,585
Roll call has been requested, call the roll, madam.

455
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:11,605
Councilor Weiner.

456
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:12,105
Yes.

457
00:40:12,145 --> 00:40:12,405
Clerk.

458
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:13,946
Yes.

459
00:40:13,966 --> 00:40:14,166
Yes.

460
00:40:14,226 --> 00:40:14,326
Yes.

461
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:22,466
Yes.

462
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:23,386
Yes.

463
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:24,607
Yes.

464
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:25,727
Yes.

465
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:26,427
And about a 70 per minute.

466
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,688
None of the negative papers approved now on the B paper offered by council.

467
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:37,011
So review boards and commissions, uh, across the mayor to, uh, perhaps a point, uh, yes.

468
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:42,417
dates, the dates of expiration.

469
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:46,358
Why don't we get a listing of all the boards and commissions in there with their names?

470
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:48,399
I have that it's turned yellow, the paper.

471
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:56,981
So all the boards and commissions with their point, their expiration dates, uh, date of service on that motion.

472
00:40:57,141 --> 00:40:57,701
We'll talk on this.

473
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:58,121
No.

474
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:03,442
All those in favor.

475
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,703
No roll call.

476
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:06,983
One roll call.

477
00:41:08,488 --> 00:41:10,029
On motion approved by Councilor Camuso.

478
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,709
All those in favor?

479
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:10,789
Aye.

480
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:11,950
All those opposed?

481
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,690
Paper is approved.

482
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,572
Now, want to revert back to regular business?

483
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:18,753
Did you want to speak?

484
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:19,133
Yes.

485
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:20,594
We're running suspension.

486
00:41:20,614 --> 00:41:22,135
You name an address for the record, please.

487
00:41:22,155 --> 00:41:23,555
51 Metcalf Street.

488
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:25,616
A friend of mine passed away a couple of days ago.

489
00:41:25,656 --> 00:41:28,938
He's a retired metric firefighter, Larry Kelleher.

490
00:41:29,498 --> 00:41:31,439
And I'd like to see if we can get a moment of silence.

491
00:41:31,499 --> 00:41:33,940
I believe the wake was today and the funeral is tomorrow.

492
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:36,822
Offered by Councilor Camuso.

493
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:41,522
A moment of silence for former firefighter Larry Kelleher, recently passed away.

494
00:41:49,484 --> 00:41:49,704
Thank you.

495
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:54,185
On the motion of Council Penta, revert back to regular business.

496
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:54,725
All those in favor?

497
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:55,405
All those opposed?

498
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,626
On page one, motions, ayes, resolutions.

499
00:41:58,646 --> 00:42:05,908
2011-726 off by Council Penta being resolved that the issue of agenda 21 in the UN International Baccalaureate

500
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:16,272
IB program be discussed as to the educational consequences of harm it can cause, if in fact the Memphis public school system is participating in such programs, officially or unofficially.

501
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:16,912
Councilor Panto.

502
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:25,895
Mr. President, um, some weeks ago, a young gentleman who's sitting out in the audience right now, Mr. Capucci came and brought an issue before us, which was called agenda 21.

503
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:29,136
It's a very, depending how you view it,

504
00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:34,360
It either can be complex, or it can be very simple, or it's cut and dry, depending on how you view it.

505
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:48,327
To me, I find this to be somewhat complex, because the ingredients that make up Agenda 21 have a spillover effect, and that also, unfortunately, spills over into the whole educational philosophy of what Agenda 21 is all about.

506
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:54,150
The IB program, the International Baccalaureate Program, it's hard to pronounce that.

507
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,050
Baccalaureate.

508
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,251
Baccalaureate Program.

509
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:22,188
It's something that started back in 1968 and it came out of, it was a result of a United Nations type of activity where they were looking at the idea of where are we going as United Nations and how are we going to get our agendas, so to speak, better understood throughout the world, throughout the world and the world economy.

510
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:23,990
And as a result of that,

511
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:29,649
I mean, I've just spent oodles and oodles of times and hours getting this thing, trying to understand it.

512
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:38,052
Because what I want to understand is after Agenda 21, I have been inundated with phone calls with people for and against Agenda 21.

513
00:43:38,553 --> 00:43:50,338
And then these phone calls have now diverted themselves to the educational school system here in the city of Medford, be it public or private, but leaning more toward the public school system.

514
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:53,339
And if in fact, or does in fact, the public school

515
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:56,334
officially or unofficially participate in any of the programming.

516
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:10,204
And to some degree, I would have to assume it would, because some of the things that are in the budget for which the city of Medford pays for, for which the Medford city council votes on and approves as part of this international, um, baccalaureate, what'd you call it?

517
00:44:10,785 --> 00:44:11,345
Baccalaureate.

518
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:12,426
Baccalaureate program.

519
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:13,227
But anyway,

520
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:20,756
It started off in the beginning years as a secondary level high school type of a level program.

521
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:24,538
It's now got itself down from the third grade all the way up to the 12th grade.

522
00:44:24,638 --> 00:44:27,320
Strike that from three years old up to a 12-year-old person.

523
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,922
And it's recognized it's a non-governmental activity.

524
00:44:32,143 --> 00:44:36,726
And its recognition is that it's not an advanced placement.

525
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:38,087
It's not an AP program.

526
00:44:38,687 --> 00:44:43,630
And by not being an AP program, colleges are not accepting any of these classes or any of these courses.

527
00:44:44,205 --> 00:44:49,589
that unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on whether you're a supporter or a non-supporter of the program, takes place.

528
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,853
I'm going to just quote some of the terminology that they use.

529
00:44:53,933 --> 00:45:02,280
It is basically, it's a transformation system of education, instructed to change the attitudes, values, beliefs, and behavior of the student

530
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:04,917
to conform to the world government system.

531
00:45:05,177 --> 00:45:24,125
So if you watch anything about what the United Nations is all about, and part of their whole effort is to bring a world agenda together, and if this world agenda together is actually going to be successful, it has to go through an educational process, not a military or a political process, it's an educational process.

532
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:25,885
Most recently, the U.S.

533
00:45:25,905 --> 00:45:28,766
Department of Education established a $1.2 million grant program

534
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:36,726
for middle schools that are willing to participate in this program, which become feeder schools for the high schools throughout the entire country.

535
00:45:37,426 --> 00:45:40,807
And as a result of that, the programming consists of six questions.

536
00:45:41,568 --> 00:45:51,151
Who we are, where are we in place and time, how do we express ourselves, how does the world work, how do we organize ourselves, sharing the planet.

537
00:45:51,951 --> 00:45:55,972
These are the six themes that basically make up this whole idea of the agenda.

538
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:57,853
And as a result of that,

539
00:45:58,357 --> 00:46:14,061
In 2004, the Washington Times reported the following, that the America's foundational principles of national sovereignty, national law, and inalienable rights are at odds with the IB curriculum, and they're not being taught as such.

540
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:17,962
What information, Vice President Del Rosso?

541
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:21,422
What is the source of this information that you're giving to us?

542
00:46:22,723 --> 00:46:28,224
I think I just got through saying that, number one, the Washington Times reported in the newspaper article

543
00:46:28,975 --> 00:46:33,738
My other report comes from Newsweek.

544
00:46:33,978 --> 00:46:39,342
It also comes from Britannica, Encyclopedia Britannica.

545
00:46:39,502 --> 00:46:42,023
It also comes from people who are well established.

546
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,385
It comes from the United States Department of Education.

547
00:46:44,405 --> 00:46:45,385
Where do you want me to stop?

548
00:46:47,426 --> 00:46:47,827
I'll stop.

549
00:46:48,787 --> 00:46:50,829
Are you questioning the authenticity of what I'm saying?

550
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,852
I hope you're not, Counselor, because this is a very serious program.

551
00:46:57,032 --> 00:47:03,316
And if the program is operating here in the city of Medford, we are paying for it in part, whether you realize it or not.

552
00:47:03,536 --> 00:47:05,098
And that's what I'm trying to find out.

553
00:47:05,438 --> 00:47:11,322
And as a counselor, I'm trying to find out how this budget works and what incorporates itself into the taxpayers of this community.

554
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:12,483
It's an important issue.

555
00:47:13,505 --> 00:47:16,287
So if you want to question me, go ahead and question me all you want.

556
00:47:16,508 --> 00:47:18,449
Everything I have here is verified.

557
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:21,171
Aren't we have somebody from the school department here?

558
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:31,300
Well, my agenda at the end will be asking a joint meeting, because there are many parents that would like to have a meeting with the school committee and the council, because they don't feel they're getting satisfaction from the school committee.

559
00:47:32,341 --> 00:47:33,782
Continuing on, Mr. President.

560
00:47:35,963 --> 00:47:37,825
You know, I just want to say something.

561
00:47:39,206 --> 00:47:42,229
Of all the things that this council is going to get itself involved in,

562
00:47:43,063 --> 00:48:08,447
whether you want to call it a school department issue or a city issue, there is nothing that's more valuable than making sure that the kids in this community are getting an education that talks about, that talks about whether it's in their social studies, their sciences, or their math, that they are individuals, and their rights as individuals are protected, and they should not be taught that they have to live as a world society person.

563
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:26,527
There's nothing wrong with looking out for your fellow man, but there is something wrong when they tell you you have to share your wealth and everything that you've earned to take care of people that are in other countries that are impoverished.

564
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:31,910
That's why we have our freedom of choices to make our donations whenever and whoever we want to make it to.

565
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:40,016
The United Nations is ongoing right now, trying to do between now and the year 2020, they're going to be down in Africa,

566
00:48:41,232 --> 00:48:56,196
at a convention on November 28th, well it's already yesterday, to raise $100 billion a year to fight air pollution for which they want the United States to be the prime mover on because we are the richest country in the world.

567
00:48:56,876 --> 00:49:04,658
But that's not the way for us to spend our money and we shouldn't be told by people in the United Nations or 40 other countries

568
00:49:05,548 --> 00:49:07,709
We became successful for one reason.

569
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:08,450
We worked at it.

570
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:09,891
We used our brain.

571
00:49:10,071 --> 00:49:11,812
That's what we teach our kids in school to do.

572
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:13,453
Use your brain.

573
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:19,337
And if you use your brain to become successful, then your intellect as an individual will surface and rise.

574
00:49:19,977 --> 00:49:34,366
But if you want to go to this group world attitude that we have to think of ourselves globally as an individual and share whatever we have globally as an individual, we have now dumbed down upon ourselves and relegated ourselves

575
00:49:34,566 --> 00:49:38,969
to the same third world opportunities, or lack thereof, that those countries don't have.

576
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:46,473
They can have the same world opportunities, they just need to get themselves and their political right of way, so to speak, in order.

577
00:49:47,074 --> 00:49:47,814
We did it some 243 years ago.

578
00:49:49,879 --> 00:49:51,160
And look what's trying to happen right now.

579
00:49:51,180 --> 00:50:03,033
They're trying to have, through the United Nations, couched this IB program to take away everything that our servicemen that we go and celebrate every Memorial Day and Veterans Day died for.

580
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:07,097
The individual rights of freedom, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

581
00:50:07,678 --> 00:50:21,704
not globally to take away your right of religion, to take away your right of making a living, and to take away the fact that you have to take care of the rest of the world because unfortunately your parents or grandparents made it for you and you've succeeded upon that.

582
00:50:22,264 --> 00:50:23,504
That's not what we're all about.

583
00:50:24,405 --> 00:50:29,847
We're all about a country, a group of citizens whose family and parents emigrated here, Mr. President.

584
00:50:31,748 --> 00:50:32,528
You detoured me.

585
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:36,970
You did a good job of it, but I'm glad I got it out because I'm gonna finish what I have to say, Councilor DelaRusso.

586
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:42,630
More importantly, Mr. President, partnerships.

587
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:44,432
They talk about working in partnerships.

588
00:50:45,053 --> 00:50:48,496
Well, you can be partners with anybody you want politically or socially.

589
00:50:49,377 --> 00:50:52,921
And if you want to put a child in a classroom to be a partner with the student next to him, that's okay.

590
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:58,867
I'll leave the name of the school, and I'll leave the name of the teacher, and I'll leave the name of the class that's out.

591
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:14,897
But there's a program that's being distributed right now and implemented in one of our schools that talks about the fact that you should share that for what you have, which is your wealth and your right to have things that other kids and other families and other people don't have.

592
00:51:15,798 --> 00:51:23,205
That's okay to learn as a learning process, but don't indoctrinate a child at that age who has never, ever gone through the process

593
00:51:24,368 --> 00:51:31,552
of knowing what the difference is between right and wrong, because this is when they're their most, this is when they're their most informative.

594
00:51:31,832 --> 00:51:33,993
This is when their mind and their imagination takes place.

595
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:37,415
And if this is all that they're hearing, that's what they're gonna grow up to think and believe.

596
00:51:38,135 --> 00:51:41,437
And where does that put us in future 10 or 20 or 30 years as a country?

597
00:51:42,117 --> 00:51:44,158
It takes away everything that we stand for.

598
00:51:44,678 --> 00:51:51,562
Our ability to stand alone, to be alone, and be that individual that our parents told us and taught us to be.

599
00:51:53,003 --> 00:51:53,663
Mr. President,

600
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:23,209
We have in our public school system here, Meffitt is part of a $9.5 million National Science Foundation and it's called TERG, it's the other part of the Meffitt Public School math program for which unfortunately is causing a problem with some parents who believe that the program is not satisfying or completing the child and the MCAS scores and grades like they're supposed to be.

601
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:32,899
At the elementary school level, the worst of the National Science Foundation funded programs is widely used in the K through five series.

602
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:39,422
The program relies heavily on calculators and does not include textbooks in the usual sense.

603
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:44,245
And as a result of that, there are parents who have addressed this issue before the school committee.

604
00:52:45,025 --> 00:52:52,529
And the school committee, through some of their members, leaving them nameless, just do not want to address it or accept that for which the parents are talking about.

605
00:52:53,418 --> 00:52:56,139
We are part of that $9.5 million programming.

606
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:03,583
And therefore, Mr. President, it's well within our daily work to talk about it, and it's well within the school committee's department to talk about it.

607
00:53:03,803 --> 00:53:05,544
You're talking about the kids within this community.

608
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:07,385
Also, Mr. President.

609
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:08,306
Point of information?

610
00:53:08,626 --> 00:53:10,367
Point of information, Vice President Del Russo.

611
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:16,610
So this curriculum that you're speaking about comes out of Agenda 21?

612
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:16,870
No.

613
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:31,683
interruption here, with all due respects, is to, has any administrator or anybody who helps form our school's curriculum spoken on this matter?

614
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:37,045
From my understanding and speaking with parents, they have addressed this to the school department.

615
00:53:37,865 --> 00:53:44,247
Certain individuals in the school committee, they have not responded in a like manner of concern.

616
00:53:45,336 --> 00:53:46,517
Has it been before the school committee?

617
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:48,760
Yes, people have addressed it before the school committee.

618
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:57,589
As a matter of fact, one of the issues that were addressed before the school committee some two to three weeks ago was the fact that the school committee might be considering taking algebra out of the eighth grade.

619
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:05,297
I mean, these are one of the prerequisites for children to go to college if they want, if they want to be math folks, they want to succeed.

620
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,974
If you start taking away some of these programs, once again, it goes to this whole IB program.

621
00:54:10,134 --> 00:54:12,255
Where are the high school administrators in this?

622
00:54:12,695 --> 00:54:14,356
Or the school administrators?

623
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:15,636
Where are the principals in this?

624
00:54:16,817 --> 00:54:21,658
I can't answer that, other than the fact that parents are now starting to bring this up.

625
00:54:21,818 --> 00:54:30,961
And I want to thank Mr. Cappucci for bringing this thing up a few weeks ago, because this whole thing with Agenda 21, it's more than land, and it's more than smart growth, and it's more than that.

626
00:54:31,341 --> 00:54:32,942
It's the whole educational philosophy.

627
00:54:33,514 --> 00:54:39,215
And if this thing gets itself entrenched into the minds of these students, as I just said a few minutes ago, they're gonna know nothing different.

628
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:40,675
They're not gonna know what we knew growing up.

629
00:54:42,436 --> 00:54:43,436
Let me ask you this from the chair.

630
00:54:43,456 --> 00:54:44,436
If it's so nefarious.

631
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:46,556
I didn't say it's nefarious, no.

632
00:54:46,856 --> 00:54:47,977
It's not what I'm saying.

633
00:54:48,057 --> 00:54:49,217
Your inference is bad.

634
00:54:49,457 --> 00:54:50,837
No, my inference is this.

635
00:54:52,097 --> 00:54:53,417
Let me get to finishing what I'm gonna say.

636
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:54,298
Finish what you're saying.

637
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:55,318
Go ahead.

638
00:54:55,698 --> 00:54:57,318
All right.

639
00:54:58,418 --> 00:55:01,259
There's a critical review which comes out of Texas, the place where the

640
00:55:02,235 --> 00:55:05,917
It's called We the People, the Citizens, and the Constitution.

641
00:55:06,558 --> 00:55:10,980
It's a civic textbook written by the place in Texas that writes the textbooks for the entire country.

642
00:55:11,621 --> 00:55:17,264
And what they are doing, they are being taught that in the United States, number one, we are the number one terrorist nation.

643
00:55:17,725 --> 00:55:18,285
That's what it says.

644
00:55:18,785 --> 00:55:25,630
And they are being taught that the rest of the world is mired in poverty because of the greedy capitalists in the United States.

645
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,491
That's what these kids are being taught.

646
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,412
That's what's in these textbooks.

647
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:30,833
Point of information.

648
00:55:31,837 --> 00:55:33,038
What textbooks have that?

649
00:55:33,718 --> 00:55:37,081
These are the history books that are coming out of Texas, which serve the entire country.

650
00:55:37,341 --> 00:55:40,163
When we buy our textbooks, the civics.

651
00:55:40,243 --> 00:55:41,324
This is already in print.

652
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:42,564
It's already in print.

653
00:55:43,545 --> 00:55:44,386
They are in our schools.

654
00:55:44,406 --> 00:55:49,309
I can't tell you, it's in this school, but if it's coming in this school, it's in print and it's ready to go.

655
00:55:49,669 --> 00:55:52,792
These are the new textbooks that are now being printed and ready to go.

656
00:55:52,812 --> 00:55:53,472
Who's the publisher?

657
00:55:55,974 --> 00:55:58,375
This sounds like something out of the McCarthy era.

658
00:55:58,415 --> 00:55:59,076
No it isn't.

659
00:55:59,476 --> 00:56:00,437
I'm concerned here.

660
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,241
Well, it's not that it's Marxism.

661
00:56:07,022 --> 00:56:08,222
Let me just go on.

662
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:16,908
The United Nations Global Education Program took a major step in 1968 when they started this whole programming.

663
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:22,151
And it basically said we're living on a planet that is becoming exhausted.

664
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:25,093
A guy by the name of George Walker wrote this.

665
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:26,434
He is the director in general.

666
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:28,315
He comes out of Geneva, Switzerland.

667
00:56:28,656 --> 00:56:33,699
And he says that the program remains committed to changing children's values so they think globally,

668
00:56:34,098 --> 00:56:39,359
rather than in parochial national terms from their own country's viewpoint, okay?

669
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:45,001
Mr. President, the IB program has been dropped.

670
00:56:45,021 --> 00:56:47,101
550 schools have picked it up.

671
00:56:47,341 --> 00:56:54,283
74 of the high schools that have picked it up have now dropped it because they have seen what it's done everywhere from California to Rhode Island.

672
00:56:54,863 --> 00:56:59,184
The goals and the methods of the IB program reach much further than the 502 U.S.

673
00:56:59,664 --> 00:57:01,004
schools now officially enrolled.

674
00:57:01,345 --> 00:57:03,005
The Center for Civic Education,

675
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:15,549
which by law writes the curriculum for civics education in the United States, says, quote, in the past century, the civic mission of schools was education for democracy and a sovereign state.

676
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:30,058
In this century, by contrast, education will become everywhere more global, and we ought to improve our curricular frameworks and standards for a world transformed by globally accepted and internationally transcendent principles.

677
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:32,340
The global influence can be clearly seen

678
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:35,998
in the new mission for the National Curriculum Standards for Social Studies.

679
00:57:36,218 --> 00:57:37,439
This is the national curriculum.

680
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:39,700
This comes right out of the United States government.

681
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:46,424
This is their philosophy, which is now gonna be transcended into their new books.

682
00:57:46,644 --> 00:57:47,685
Point of clarification.

683
00:57:47,825 --> 00:57:49,666
I don't know if we have the new books yet.

684
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:50,887
Whose philosophy?

685
00:57:51,307 --> 00:57:53,329
The International Baccalaureate's philosophy?

686
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:53,629
No, no.

687
00:57:54,329 --> 00:57:56,390
What I just read to you comes from the United States.

688
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:57,911
It's in Washington.

689
00:57:57,931 --> 00:58:00,353
They print the civics books for the entire country.

690
00:58:01,029 --> 00:58:03,530
It sounds like post-war socialism from Europe.

691
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,392
Well, that's part of the argument, and I'm not saying that it is.

692
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:15,177
The whole idea of bringing this to the attention of everyone, I want to find out if in fact, what if in fact our Methodist public school systems are involved with this, if anything.

693
00:58:18,779 --> 00:58:20,360
The idea of an automatic cutoff.

694
00:58:20,881 --> 00:58:28,005
The United States cut off its financing because the United Nations decided to give money to Pakistan.

695
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:38,286
And the argument in rebuttal by certain legislators and congressmen is that we should be cutting off this type of IB information being disseminated through schools.

696
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:48,413
Now remember, as I told you before, the IB information is something, if I understand this correctly, it's something that does not garner college graduate credits or college accepted credits.

697
00:58:48,954 --> 00:58:51,956
So it takes away from the AP programs if kids are taking this.

698
00:58:52,238 --> 00:59:11,663
with the 502 schools that have already accepted and the 74 that have opted out, they've opted out because they found out what this programming entails, which basically allegedly is diminishing the value of the individual and making the individual feel that he or she needs to transform their way of thinking globally.

699
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:14,364
The question then becomes, if you read

700
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:15,961
Read what they have.

701
00:59:16,381 --> 00:59:23,246
Their whole program is revolved around environmental, multicultural, and citizen global world agenda.

702
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:24,566
That's their agenda.

703
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:27,548
This isn't my agenda, this is their agenda.

704
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:35,194
And my question that needs to be asked, and through the Memphis Public Schools system, are they in fact participating in any shape, manner, or form?

705
00:59:36,054 --> 00:59:40,256
We accepted this in 1999, September 2nd, 1999.

706
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:41,776
The city of Medford accepted this.

707
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:43,657
Mayor McGlynn signed off on it.

708
00:59:43,677 --> 00:59:47,078
And at that point in time, none of us probably had any idea what it was.

709
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:50,380
And if you signed off on it and you're a participant, they pay you.

710
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,961
Anyway, it's up to $135,000 a year to be a member in this particular program.

711
00:59:55,361 --> 01:00:00,622
And if you are and you're getting inundated or indoctrinated with that type of philosophy, that can cause a concern.

712
01:00:01,142 --> 01:00:18,086
Whether it's the sciences that talk about believing and worshiping the earth, or whether it's the multiculturalism and believing that we should be a hyphenated society of one, or whether it's the extreme belief that we should be echo green for everything because that's gonna save the world,

713
01:00:18,766 --> 01:00:32,543
There's more to the educational process than those three agendas, and that's the concern that I have, and I believe that's the concern that's been translated to me from folks, and I hope I've said it somewhat clear, but I think I've got the point out that needs to be addressed.

714
01:00:33,084 --> 01:00:36,928
I think we need to have a review of what the Memphis public school system

715
01:00:37,729 --> 01:00:42,132
has in their civic books, what are they teaching in their sciences, in their social studies?

716
01:00:42,592 --> 01:00:46,815
Does it follow any of this philosophy of the United Nations IB program?

717
01:00:47,116 --> 01:00:48,997
And if it does, I think it needs to be reviewed.

718
01:00:49,637 --> 01:00:57,763
When parents bring these up to the school committee, as they did some two to three weeks ago, and they're ignored, or it's not what you're saying it is, you can't do that.

719
01:00:57,783 --> 01:00:59,204
I mean, last week was the best example.

720
01:00:59,484 --> 01:01:02,986
We had people come up here who for months and months and months complained about George and Winthrop Street.

721
01:01:03,387 --> 01:01:06,389
They finally came here, the council heard it, and it got itself corrected.

722
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:08,492
This is a multiplying issue.

723
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,773
This is so recent as of today in California.

724
01:01:13,854 --> 01:01:16,475
It's a big issue, and the issue is this.

725
01:01:17,415 --> 01:01:30,121
Are and is the United States gonna conform to the wishes of the United Nations, whether it's their political or their educational agendas, and if it's an educational agenda, how is that gonna reflect upon we as a country?

726
01:01:30,481 --> 01:01:34,583
Keeping our sovereignty, keeping our nationality, and keeping our individuality.

727
01:01:34,829 --> 01:01:36,630
because those three things they do not teach.

728
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:42,295
And if they take that away from the kids that are being taught, then they've taken away everything that this country stands for.

729
01:01:43,076 --> 01:01:43,376
Thank you.

730
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:44,837
Mr. President.

731
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:45,238
Yes.

732
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:46,319
Vice president Dela Rousseau.

733
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:57,148
My recollections may be flawed, but I, as a former admissions officer of a college, I remember dealing with students that took part of this, uh,

734
01:01:58,058 --> 01:01:59,839
international baccalaureate program.

735
01:01:59,879 --> 01:02:01,239
Some of them were foreign students.

736
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:10,123
Some of them, if I remember correctly, I visited a high school operated by the United Nations over there on the east side of Manhattan.

737
01:02:11,048 --> 01:02:12,428
and interviewed students there.

738
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:16,129
They seemed like bright young men and women.

739
01:02:16,209 --> 01:02:19,110
They didn't at all seem like fifth column communists or anything.

740
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:32,633
I want to get to the bottom of this in some sort of way here, because that's not how I recall the program as in my recollections.

741
01:02:33,593 --> 01:02:36,033
It was akin to an AP program.

742
01:02:36,713 --> 01:02:38,954
A lot of these kids were very bright and capable.

743
01:02:40,045 --> 01:02:42,066
They came in with some degree or another.

744
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:50,470
I mean, every college had its own policy as to what degree of advanced placement credit they'd be able to get.

745
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:58,795
And it pointed more to a rigor in the curriculum that these kids did some serious work.

746
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:02,877
It wasn't necessarily the content of it.

747
01:03:03,885 --> 01:03:13,090
It was, you looked at a kid that applied out of New York State, for instance, took the Regents program and did well on their Regents exams.

748
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:22,595
You looked at that as an indicator and that was my recollection of the International Baccalaureate program and not as something as a political agenda.

749
01:03:24,552 --> 01:03:34,557
While the United States often points historically to its rugged individualism, there's also the concept of e pluribus unum.

750
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:48,003
And aspects of what's being purported here, though it might be extreme and secularist in my point of view, aspects of what the UN

751
01:03:50,965 --> 01:03:59,690
also could be attributed to the social gospel and a certain person from Palestine in Judea.

752
01:04:02,771 --> 01:04:03,071
Thank you.

753
01:04:04,872 --> 01:04:05,553
You want to speak on this?

754
01:04:06,693 --> 01:04:07,874
Name and address for the record, please.

755
01:04:08,205 --> 01:04:10,406
Robert Capucci from 71 Evans Street.

756
01:04:10,486 --> 01:04:20,530
First and foremost, Councilor Pinto, thank you for your eloquence, your wisdom, and your passion in sticking up for the fundamental American individualism.

757
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:22,811
That is the whole reason why I brought this up.

758
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:30,995
I didn't know myself the extent of reach into children three to 12 years old that this Agenda 21 has.

759
01:04:31,015 --> 01:04:32,616
Agenda 21, make no mistake,

760
01:04:35,457 --> 01:04:37,678
is about the redistribution of wealth.

761
01:04:38,158 --> 01:04:48,580
The United Nations charter calls for taking a back seat to individual freedoms.

762
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:57,462
The director of ICLEI, a guy named Dr. Harris, I believe his name is, states right out that individualism

763
01:04:57,858 --> 01:05:02,982
has to take a back seat towards the redistribution of wealth.

764
01:05:03,402 --> 01:05:11,348
They blame the United States, as Councilor Penta said, for the problems environmentally of the world.

765
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:19,815
So what they do, and what socialism does itself, is it doesn't raise the lower up to the higher.

766
01:05:19,895 --> 01:05:23,438
What it actually does is lowers the higher

767
01:05:24,078 --> 01:05:26,079
down and that doesn't help anybody.

768
01:05:26,479 --> 01:05:33,803
Now, counselor Della Russo, I'm sure that high school you visited did have individuals that were very bright and smart.

769
01:05:33,823 --> 01:05:36,205
That's, that's not the point of argument here.

770
01:05:36,865 --> 01:05:50,953
And you also brought up, uh, Joe McCarthy, McCarthyism and you, and it, and it kinda, it kinda puts this whole question that counselor pent is bringing up that I, I tried to enlighten the city and the citizens to in a light as a certain,

771
01:05:51,325 --> 01:05:56,707
form of, oh, it's crazy wackoism to talk about something like this happening.

772
01:05:57,047 --> 01:05:57,927
But it is happening.

773
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:03,429
And communities all over this nation have gotten rid of ICLEI and Agenda 21.

774
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:11,612
The town of Cuyver Mass, Las Cruces, New Mexico, towns all over the United States are getting rid of it.

775
01:06:12,293 --> 01:06:12,453
Sir?

776
01:06:13,728 --> 01:06:21,693
Councilor DelaRusso, Joe McCarthy brought up an issue in the 50s stating there were 53 communists in the United States government.

777
01:06:22,553 --> 01:06:24,435
And he was ridiculed for this.

778
01:06:24,675 --> 01:06:25,395
He was dogged.

779
01:06:25,755 --> 01:06:26,676
He was called an idiot.

780
01:06:27,156 --> 01:06:31,719
He eventually left the Senate, became an alcoholic, and died young.

781
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:33,140
Did you know that in 1995,

782
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:40,142
the government of Russia put out something called the Venona Papers.

783
01:06:40,742 --> 01:06:52,412
And in those Venona Papers, it proved everything Joe McCarthy was saying as accurate to a T. There were 53 communists in the United States government.

784
01:06:52,932 --> 01:06:53,993
This is a real issue.

785
01:06:54,273 --> 01:06:55,454
It's nothing crazy.

786
01:06:55,894 --> 01:06:57,836
It's something very simple.

787
01:06:58,857 --> 01:07:00,298
I passed out that pamphlet.

788
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,801
to you folks when I gave my presentation on the first.

789
01:07:04,461 --> 01:07:09,303
On the bottom, it had a website for a quick 12-minute video.

790
01:07:09,343 --> 01:07:15,145
I watched it before I came here tonight, and it's from 629 to 641.

791
01:07:15,385 --> 01:07:16,486
Did all you folks watch that?

792
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:20,787
I certainly hope you did, because there were resources in there to look up

793
01:07:22,668 --> 01:07:28,392
All sorts of other things about Agenda 21, and Councilor Penta brought up a lot of things I didn't know myself.

794
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:37,838
An environmental officer from the western part of Massachusetts first introduced me to Agenda 21, ICLEI and sustainable development.

795
01:07:38,198 --> 01:07:48,645
He's a conservationist officer for Massachusetts, and he's been going around this state giving a two-hour presentation

796
01:07:49,263 --> 01:07:52,446
on the true nature behind Agenda 21.

797
01:07:53,106 --> 01:07:55,888
And it is an indoctrination of our youth.

798
01:07:56,129 --> 01:07:57,170
It is teaching kids

799
01:07:57,975 --> 01:08:06,638
away from individualism and the foundations of the United States Constitution towards the UN Charter and the UN Constitution.

800
01:08:07,078 --> 01:08:16,681
And it's really a shame if that's happening because I'm 41 and when I'm 55, I don't want to see the United States of America where a 20-year-old

801
01:08:21,323 --> 01:08:38,753
Kids that are now stepping up to your positions, having their idea that it's not about the free individual American citizen, but it's about the big bad America and its corporate greed and how they have to be punished and their wealth has to be redistributed to other countries around the world.

802
01:08:39,213 --> 01:08:42,575
American excellence and American individualism must be fought for.

803
01:08:43,055 --> 01:08:46,577
And it's great that Councilor Pinto brought this up,

804
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,362
The way he argued the point was flawless.

805
01:08:50,783 --> 01:08:51,363
It was great.

806
01:08:51,704 --> 01:08:59,651
And I highly discount, uh, the counselors for his interruption and for trying to highlight it as McCarthyism and crazy.

807
01:08:59,972 --> 01:09:04,556
When, when please look up the Venona papers, counsel DelaRusso, Joe McCarthy was proved right.

808
01:09:05,036 --> 01:09:05,757
Thank you very much.

809
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:09,901
Jim was 51 Metcalf street.

810
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:12,724
I don't know if you remember the story of doubting Thomas.

811
01:09:12,984 --> 01:09:13,845
Well, I'm the original.

812
01:09:15,018 --> 01:09:18,443
And when I first heard Mr. Capucci get up here and speak, I went right out.

813
01:09:18,943 --> 01:09:21,507
I've put maybe a hundred hours into research.

814
01:09:21,607 --> 01:09:23,509
It's a very, very complex issue.

815
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:25,972
Today I got this from the city clerk.

816
01:09:26,553 --> 01:09:32,040
This is the official approval of the meeting that was held on August 10th, 1999.

817
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,762
Councilor Penter and Mayorco are on it.

818
01:09:34,647 --> 01:09:37,708
And it is proof that we are a member of Italy.

819
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:40,009
It's quoted in the climate control plan.

820
01:09:40,069 --> 01:09:40,630
I have this.

821
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:46,532
I also posted it on patch today in the blog entitled agenda 21 in the IB.

822
01:09:46,973 --> 01:09:49,574
I'm just going to say IB cause I have trouble saying that word too.

823
01:09:50,134 --> 01:09:51,254
This document is there.

824
01:09:51,555 --> 01:09:52,135
It's real.

825
01:09:52,475 --> 01:09:56,777
If you don't believe it, you're either very naive or too busy because it's true.

826
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:06,320
Okay, since then, for the last three weeks, I've been posting stories on my website, and for the home viewers, that's jimmymors.com.

827
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,202
It's on the front page, more important than anything on my whole website.

828
01:10:11,143 --> 01:10:14,205
And my website's been in existence for five years in January.

829
01:10:14,265 --> 01:10:16,826
I have people from all over the world looking at it.

830
01:10:17,027 --> 01:10:21,209
I have 85,000 hits on YouTube, so people are reading what I'm saying.

831
01:10:21,289 --> 01:10:22,270
Evidently, they trust me.

832
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:34,900
What I did, counselor, specifically because I doubt things too, I wrote what's called ICLEI, part 10, science fiction of fact, because my friends were saying it's science fiction.

833
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:36,782
My good friends were saying that.

834
01:10:37,222 --> 01:10:43,548
You read part 10, read it tonight, and you tell me that we aren't a member of a United Nations organization.

835
01:10:44,068 --> 01:10:45,410
I have no question about it.

836
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:47,652
Now, what I did after that,

837
01:10:49,047 --> 01:10:51,689
is I started a very simple introductory course.

838
01:10:52,109 --> 01:10:54,731
Remember, agenda 21 is 40 chapters.

839
01:10:55,132 --> 01:10:56,673
It's huge, all right?

840
01:10:57,033 --> 01:11:00,035
The first thing you'll see in part one is Bob Cappucci.

841
01:11:00,496 --> 01:11:02,437
I spent a week trying to get that.

842
01:11:02,497 --> 01:11:03,618
Remember the motion I had?

843
01:11:04,378 --> 01:11:07,501
Not the motion, the request to speak to get that tape?

844
01:11:07,801 --> 01:11:08,421
I couldn't get it.

845
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,821
I had to get it from a friend, from a neighbor who taped it.

846
01:11:12,221 --> 01:11:13,621
It was squashed in my opinion.

847
01:11:14,261 --> 01:11:14,621
Okay.

848
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:16,902
Number two is false choices.

849
01:11:17,522 --> 01:11:22,483
That is the video that Mr. Capucci recommended you all watch.

850
01:11:22,943 --> 01:11:23,903
I wanted to get the name.

851
01:11:24,043 --> 01:11:24,723
I got the name.

852
01:11:24,783 --> 01:11:25,604
It's on my website.

853
01:11:25,624 --> 01:11:26,584
It's 14 minutes.

854
01:11:27,024 --> 01:11:31,085
If you don't have 14 minutes to watch that, I don't know what to say.

855
01:11:31,865 --> 01:11:36,391
The next one, Glenn Beck on agenda 21, 15 minutes.

856
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:40,676
His presentation, he goes into detail what it's all about.

857
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:50,630
Number four, Newt Gingrich on agenda 21, one minute video where he is pledged to not to fund the United Nations.

858
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:55,973
Today, Rick Perry came out and said, he's questioning whether to fund the United Nations.

859
01:11:56,414 --> 01:12:00,176
These are Republicans, which by the way, I joined the Republican party today.

860
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:05,420
This is my first day as a member of the Republican party and I'm very proud to be a Republican so far.

861
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,162
subject to change.

862
01:12:09,963 --> 01:12:13,564
Part five, agenda 21 for dummies, nine minutes.

863
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:15,345
That's all it is, nine minutes.

864
01:12:15,846 --> 01:12:18,987
Part six, agent 21 and sustainable development.

865
01:12:19,587 --> 01:12:20,288
All these terms.

866
01:12:20,328 --> 01:12:22,188
I've been involved in the Green Line for six years.

867
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:25,970
I've listened to smart growth, open space, sustainable development.

868
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:27,051
I have read books.

869
01:12:27,111 --> 01:12:27,931
I have read pages.

870
01:12:27,971 --> 01:12:29,472
I've read thousands of pages on it.

871
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:31,133
I never saw the link till agenda 21.

872
01:12:32,293 --> 01:12:36,017
Now, knowing with Agenda 21 in my mind, everything has changed.

873
01:12:36,397 --> 01:12:38,960
These are all Agenda 21 terms.

874
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:42,784
Open space, smart growth, sustainable development.

875
01:12:42,824 --> 01:12:43,965
They're all interchangeable.

876
01:12:44,385 --> 01:12:48,730
These are the warm and fuzzy terms that we like, oh yeah, we're going to save the planet.

877
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:51,793
Yeah, we're going to cut down on greenhouse gases.

878
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:52,894
All warm and fuzzy.

879
01:12:52,914 --> 01:12:54,876
They're all designed to deceit us.

880
01:12:57,055 --> 01:13:04,978
Part seven, part seven is a five minute blurb that I copied out of a 68 minute blurb video on education.

881
01:13:05,799 --> 01:13:14,223
Look at it as it pertains to this council in this, in the meeting that the motion that's on the floor tonight, that is pertinent.

882
01:13:14,743 --> 01:13:15,823
Five minutes, watch it.

883
01:13:16,203 --> 01:13:24,827
And if you have 68 minutes, number eight is a video agenda 21 in education that lays it all out clear as day.

884
01:13:25,808 --> 01:13:26,408
Number nine,

885
01:13:28,222 --> 01:13:31,504
is the, number nine is the tech committee report.

886
01:13:32,425 --> 01:13:33,225
They're all right there.

887
01:13:33,245 --> 01:13:37,148
That's the tech committee report that is before you to approve and for us to discuss.

888
01:13:37,568 --> 01:13:38,849
And let me read you something to this.

889
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:45,092
What if I said to you, becoming contributing citizens in a global society, how would you react to that?

890
01:13:45,132 --> 01:13:46,573
Is that what you wanna teach our children?

891
01:13:47,034 --> 01:13:48,635
Let me tell you, that's appendix three.

892
01:13:49,395 --> 01:13:52,617
That is appendix three of the tech report right here.

893
01:13:52,877 --> 01:13:53,858
Let me read you another one.

894
01:13:54,852 --> 01:13:56,333
We want to use collaboration.

895
01:13:56,713 --> 01:13:57,834
That's another agenda.

896
01:13:58,034 --> 01:13:59,135
They're not going to teach one-on-one.

897
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:01,477
They're going to have little groups, constructivism.

898
01:14:01,677 --> 01:14:07,322
This is all happening in our schools today, and our MCAS scores are below normal, and I say the reason is because of that.

899
01:14:08,423 --> 01:14:09,183
Let me read this one.

900
01:14:09,704 --> 01:14:11,245
This is, again, this is online.

901
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:12,246
This is on my website.

902
01:14:12,266 --> 01:14:13,667
This is on the tech committee report.

903
01:14:13,687 --> 01:14:17,570
This is public information, and I'm taking some slack for posting it, and I don't care.

904
01:14:19,218 --> 01:14:24,280
act with integrity, respect, and responsibility towards themselves, others, and the environment.

905
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:27,441
Everything on agenda 21 centers on the environment.

906
01:14:27,481 --> 01:14:29,361
That's how they're gonna transfer our wealth.

907
01:14:30,642 --> 01:14:35,884
Another one, collaborate in diverse groups to share knowledge, to build consensus.

908
01:14:36,464 --> 01:14:38,605
Did you hear Robert talk about a consensus?

909
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:39,625
You know what a consensus is?

910
01:14:39,985 --> 01:14:43,566
It's when they have a meeting and there's a bunch of people, they're all stakeholders.

911
01:14:43,806 --> 01:14:45,487
They have a vested interest in the meeting.

912
01:14:46,427 --> 01:14:49,149
and me and Bill Wood and other ones were the only ones there.

913
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:51,711
Councilman Mayorkas, let me give you an example of a consensus.

914
01:14:52,191 --> 01:14:57,835
In October of six, you and I and Bill Wood went to Somerville for the Magnum meeting at Somerville City Hall.

915
01:14:58,456 --> 01:15:06,382
They had a hundred supporters there, they had colored documents, brochures, and they announced the Green Line to Route 16, the first time we ever heard of it.

916
01:15:07,162 --> 01:15:09,024
You got up and said, come to Medford.

917
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:13,187
That meeting was in Somerville and I was there and I remember you saying that and I respect you for that.

918
01:15:13,907 --> 01:15:15,128
But that's what a consensus is.

919
01:15:15,588 --> 01:15:16,328
And it's happening.

920
01:15:16,368 --> 01:15:17,589
It's been happening in this city.

921
01:15:17,909 --> 01:15:20,870
I've been going to meetings for 15 years and I see it happening every day.

922
01:15:22,891 --> 01:15:26,193
Now, these are some of the key words you want to look for in the IB report.

923
01:15:26,653 --> 01:15:27,854
Project-based learning.

924
01:15:28,314 --> 01:15:30,495
This is from the technology committee report too.

925
01:15:30,615 --> 01:15:31,055
It's there.

926
01:15:31,635 --> 01:15:32,756
Project-based learning.

927
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:34,156
Inquiry-based learning.

928
01:15:34,216 --> 01:15:35,417
Constructivist learning.

929
01:15:36,057 --> 01:15:37,398
Differentiated instruction.

930
01:15:37,418 --> 01:15:38,599
This is all Agenda 21 stuff.

931
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:49,081
Inquiry-based learning, again, inquiry-based learning, project-based learning, 21st century skills and critical thinking.

932
01:15:49,581 --> 01:15:53,182
That's what Agenda 21 is for, 21st century, it's all related.

933
01:15:58,903 --> 01:15:59,423
That's about it.

934
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:08,825
If you have any questions, you can call me at my house, I'll come to your house, I'll visit you, I'll sit down with you, I'll talk with you, and go to my website, the home audience, it's all out there.

935
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:09,385
Thank you.

936
01:16:19,288 --> 01:16:21,609
Dr. William Wood, 25 Bustle Road.

937
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:22,869
I'm proud.

938
01:16:23,349 --> 01:16:24,110
I'm a Democrat.

939
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,050
I'm not a Republican.

940
01:16:27,071 --> 01:16:36,714
But I support what you're saying in essence, not necessarily in truth, because I have no facts, as you've pointed out.

941
01:16:37,274 --> 01:16:40,716
I don't have facts on which this is this or that is that.

942
01:16:41,716 --> 01:16:43,677
But one of the things I do have facts on

943
01:16:44,361 --> 01:16:47,142
And which is, and this may be bothering, is it?

944
01:16:47,682 --> 01:16:50,604
I'll have to, excuse me, I'm using it a different way.

945
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:01,368
And one of the things I do have facts on, freedom of speech.

946
01:17:03,529 --> 01:17:06,210
We all have a right to freedom of speech.

947
01:17:08,367 --> 01:17:18,153
It's something that is probably the only way I ever got to be a doctor is because of the freedom of speech issue.

948
01:17:18,874 --> 01:17:20,275
I don't care if you vote against me.

949
01:17:21,936 --> 01:17:27,419
I hope Councilor Marks and I will have coffee together tomorrow.

950
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:30,861
I hope Councilor Pinto and I have coffee tomorrow.

951
01:17:31,302 --> 01:17:33,643
But you're not gonna stop freedom of speech.

952
01:17:34,444 --> 01:17:37,966
And Joe McCarthyism, from my humble opinion,

953
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:49,083
and I do read history a great deal, was against freedom of speech for members of a party I don't belong to, don't adhere to.

954
01:17:49,984 --> 01:17:59,047
But by God, we in the state of Massachusetts have accepted 10-year planning, 20-year planning.

955
01:17:59,987 --> 01:18:01,387
That's a communist idea.

956
01:18:02,188 --> 01:18:08,870
There are many ideas that come back and forth between communism, socialism, and capitalism.

957
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:13,758
I can say, without a doubt, I am a capitalist.

958
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:15,119
I've owned three businesses.

959
01:18:15,599 --> 01:18:16,900
None of them have gone out of business.

960
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,041
One is still in business.

961
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:20,282
I sold it.

962
01:18:20,902 --> 01:18:23,604
I've sold my businesses for profits.

963
01:18:24,925 --> 01:18:32,350
And I'm retired at a very early age, so I could do what I really wanted to do, hang around and look good.

964
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:34,131
And that was it.

965
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:35,652
And I did it.

966
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:41,602
But while I was doing that, I was also reading and studying.

967
01:18:42,842 --> 01:18:44,102
And it got to me.

968
01:18:45,023 --> 01:19:00,448
The thing that Jimmy and I think the Area 21, all of them, are talking about is they're not having input, that so-called community input we're all talking about in different ways.

969
01:19:01,432 --> 01:19:02,833
I don't know what the answer is.

970
01:19:03,493 --> 01:19:04,834
I've looked at Jimmy's stuff.

971
01:19:05,354 --> 01:19:13,158
I've listened to Mr. Consular Penta, who I have a great deal of respect for, even though we argue a lot.

972
01:19:13,478 --> 01:19:24,765
I listened to him and I said, my God, if there's that much thing, it brought on a very interesting point that maybe many of you in the area, 21 people out here, don't know.

973
01:19:25,445 --> 01:19:30,908
Canada is threatening to leave the Cato

974
01:19:33,221 --> 01:19:35,082
agreement done in Japan.

975
01:19:35,102 --> 01:19:38,264
It was in Boston Globe this morning.

976
01:19:39,345 --> 01:19:48,891
So there are other people out there looking at some of these ideas that has been thrown out there by the UN.

977
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:55,555
I know there are people who, friends of mine, by the way, they're theater people, who will not work for the UNICEF.

978
01:19:56,947 --> 01:19:59,990
I asked them why, and they have their reasons.

979
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:16,043
I'm not going to go through all of them, but one of the most interesting reasons is, why am I working for UNICEF when I have 16 million children in this country going hungry every night?

980
01:20:16,063 --> 01:20:17,804
I can't answer that question.

981
01:20:18,785 --> 01:20:19,806
My heart bleeds.

982
01:20:20,266 --> 01:20:21,768
My heart feels sorry for them.

983
01:20:22,488 --> 01:20:25,491
But my heart also says, we have to be trained some way.

984
01:20:26,528 --> 01:20:28,310
MCAS is not the answer either.

985
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:38,578
And those of you who want to fight me over it, I'll ask you to go back and read how many intelligence we've discovered in the last 30, 40 years.

986
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:41,081
Right now we're up to 13 or 14.

987
01:20:42,121 --> 01:20:46,205
And the MCAS only approaches one of those types of intelligence.

988
01:20:47,131 --> 01:20:56,075
I don't know if this group, as Councilor Penta was talking about, was saying, that they are approaching it a different way.

989
01:20:57,016 --> 01:20:57,916
I really don't know that.

990
01:20:58,396 --> 01:21:00,457
And by the way, I have a master's in education too.

991
01:21:01,938 --> 01:21:04,699
I don't know if that's the right way or the wrong way.

992
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:11,782
I do know we do have to keep the individual freedoms and the right for free speech.

993
01:21:12,263 --> 01:21:13,483
And I thank you for listening.

994
01:21:14,424 --> 01:21:14,644
Thank you.

995
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,271
All right.

996
01:21:18,311 --> 01:21:18,793
What do you want?

997
01:21:18,813 --> 01:21:23,111
What's your, uh, uh, Bob Capucci, 71 Evans street.

998
01:21:24,499 --> 01:21:28,281
I just want to make the point that this isn't a Republican or a Democrat issue.

999
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:29,901
This is an American issue.

1000
01:21:30,341 --> 01:21:37,364
There is a website, Dr. Wood, actually, www.DemocratsAgainstAgenda21.

1001
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:39,285
This isn't a partisan issue.

1002
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:44,927
But for full disclosure, I am a Republican, and I'm a candidate for a Republican State Committee.

1003
01:21:46,048 --> 01:21:49,009
I just thought I'd plug that if that's okay with you.

1004
01:21:49,309 --> 01:21:50,330
Thank you, thank you very much.

1005
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,350
Okay.

1006
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:53,151
Yes, Councilmember.

1007
01:21:54,838 --> 01:21:59,160
There's a gentleman that I alluded, and I really didn't want to allude him, and his name is Thomas Sowell.

1008
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:11,747
Thomas Sowell is a very well-known, renowned, and respected gentleman, especially in the area of ethnic background and issues regarding ethnic backgrounds of certain individuals.

1009
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:23,353
And he wrote a column in the Jewish Review, it's a newspaper, and this is regarding the IB programming, and one of the parents of his students

1010
01:22:24,038 --> 01:22:27,421
basically put it in a very different way for which he accepted.

1011
01:22:27,441 --> 01:22:28,942
And this is what it says.

1012
01:22:28,962 --> 01:22:33,666
It says, one of the parents, critical of the program, put it quite differently for which he supports.

1013
01:22:34,046 --> 01:22:46,456
She said, quote, it promotes socialism, disarmament, racial environmentalism, and moral relativism in attempting to undermine Christian religious values and national sovereignty.

1014
01:22:46,976 --> 01:22:47,777
Now, anyone?

1015
01:22:48,428 --> 01:22:50,749
If you don't know anything about Thomas Sowell, read up on him.

1016
01:22:50,889 --> 01:22:52,570
He's another one, Jim Moss.

1017
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:55,431
He's well known, he's well respected from Stanford University.

1018
01:22:55,831 --> 01:22:57,532
Writes in the column, he's syndicated.

1019
01:22:59,973 --> 01:23:02,514
This is not an attempt to scare anyone.

1020
01:23:02,954 --> 01:23:05,896
As I said, I've spent all week on this.

1021
01:23:06,876 --> 01:23:15,920
Trying to get my head revolved around the fact, if we get ourselves to the middle of the road in this, what is the value of the program if in fact,

1022
01:23:16,782 --> 01:23:18,585
It is operating here in the city of Medford.

1023
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:21,089
Are they paying us for it?

1024
01:23:22,091 --> 01:23:24,916
And what are the programs that are being taught under it?

1025
01:23:25,517 --> 01:23:29,163
And if some of the programs or if any of these programs are being taught under it.

1026
01:23:30,404 --> 01:23:39,311
that take away the individuality, the right of religion, the right of free speech is already in this program, because it's obvious, it's in 500 schools throughout the country, so that's not the point.

1027
01:23:40,051 --> 01:23:56,884
And as a lot of these quotes from a lot of these folks will say in some of these schools, and I went into all 74 of the districts, and all 74 of those districts, the end results from the parents that met, they were sold a bill of goods, they really didn't check into it, they didn't really get into the whole thing, until the subject matter was taught.

1028
01:23:57,244 --> 01:23:58,665
And this is where we're going.

1029
01:23:59,005 --> 01:24:03,687
The subject matter has to be taught in the school system for someone to understand this is what it's all about.

1030
01:24:04,087 --> 01:24:06,048
The philosophy has to be spread.

1031
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:07,328
It has to be taught.

1032
01:24:07,368 --> 01:24:10,129
The kids have to bring it home before the parents finally get to it.

1033
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:20,553
You know, they're hitting, as I told you before, they're hitting the brightest children at their weakest time and age because they just don't really know how and where this government came from before it all started.

1034
01:24:21,074 --> 01:24:24,355
So if they're being indoctrinated or entrenched with this type of philosophy,

1035
01:24:25,628 --> 01:24:37,960
through education, not through politics, smart way to go to education, they're not going to know the true values that we talk about and they're not going to know the real values of why and what our veterans have died for over and through the years.

1036
01:24:38,421 --> 01:24:48,311
You know, if we decide to become a world citizen and become that collaborative, become that collective and not become we as one,

1037
01:24:49,098 --> 01:24:53,719
then we have basically lost this whole idea of why do we send our children to school.

1038
01:24:54,099 --> 01:25:00,341
You know, I'm not a fan of corporate greed, and I think I have stated that on a couple of occasions when I have given my Memorial Day address.

1039
01:25:01,361 --> 01:25:17,885
But the corporate greed that I'm talking about is how it maneuvers itself through Washington through the legislative process, not how it's taking America and making it a third world country, so to speak, by making it become global.

1040
01:25:18,618 --> 01:25:19,959
And that's what's gonna happen.

1041
01:25:19,999 --> 01:25:25,922
So, anyone who might be watching, if you just wanna send me some more information, I'd be happy to.

1042
01:25:26,362 --> 01:25:32,045
What I would like to do, Mr. President and Councilors, I would like to call for a roll call, no, strike that, I want a roll call vote.

1043
01:25:32,065 --> 01:25:34,726
I'd like to call for a joint meeting with our school committee.

1044
01:25:34,866 --> 01:25:46,792
I'd like to announce it to any and all parents throughout the city of Medford that have children in the public school, whatever your concerns might be on any of these issues that have an IB attitude or an overview, to bring it, and let's address it,

1045
01:25:47,365 --> 01:25:51,992
You know, I think even between and amongst ourselves, we're probably not gonna grasp some of these issues.

1046
01:25:54,657 --> 01:25:55,057
What happened?

1047
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:57,021
Tree fell.

1048
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:08,602
We're not going to be able to grasp these issues right away, but then again, you might because some of these social studies issues are very succinct.

1049
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:23,228
But as I alluded to in the beginning, we do participate in a math program for which part of the money has come from the Commonwealth of Mass, part of a grant, and that in and of itself presents a concern because it's part of the national science.

1050
01:26:24,108 --> 01:26:27,870
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move the question.

1051
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,565
Well, let me just stop you right there.

1052
01:26:30,605 --> 01:26:30,785
Sure.

1053
01:26:31,406 --> 01:26:34,528
I'm not going to vote for this until I understand what I'm voting on.

1054
01:26:35,628 --> 01:26:41,332
If someone said it was 40 chapters with this area 51, I think, excuse me, you want agenda 21.

1055
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:50,038
So until I know exactly what I'm voting on and what this entails, I can't support a roll call vote meeting with anybody until I'm educated on it.

1056
01:26:50,058 --> 01:26:50,318
Go ahead.

1057
01:26:50,598 --> 01:26:51,579
Vice president Del Rosso.

1058
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:55,662
And if we could, I think we need, where's Larry?

1059
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,801
You know, the school committee is wonderful.

1060
01:26:58,441 --> 01:27:01,223
I don't even know if they set the curriculum.

1061
01:27:01,343 --> 01:27:03,944
Does the state set the curriculum in our schools?

1062
01:27:04,445 --> 01:27:05,986
We need to talk about the curriculum.

1063
01:27:06,786 --> 01:27:11,749
Because I've had more than one person tell me that they don't teach civics in the schools anymore.

1064
01:27:12,129 --> 01:27:14,130
Kids don't even know our national story.

1065
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:17,012
They don't know our national myths.

1066
01:27:17,152 --> 01:27:21,914
They don't know our basics of how our government works.

1067
01:27:22,435 --> 01:27:23,955
So maybe we ought to be looking at that.

1068
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:52,997
As someone who worked in education and someone who particularly focused on curricula and courses of studies and assessing students for their worthiness for college, I understand some of these concepts and I certainly looked for basics and for students who got the things that build them into

1069
01:27:53,593 --> 01:27:57,255
people capable with the capacity of doing college work.

1070
01:27:57,976 --> 01:28:12,484
So I'm all for having a meeting on that type of thing, but we don't even have a resolution before us other than to discuss Agenda 21 and the baccalaureate program.

1071
01:28:13,805 --> 01:28:18,968
So I don't know if, there's not even an agenda here.

1072
01:28:19,028 --> 01:28:21,449
We need some language if we're gonna take a vote on anything.

1073
01:28:23,557 --> 01:28:37,608
you know, we need to hear, we need to hear from administrators in the school system and what is, I'd like to know what's being taught in the schools if this is so alarming.

1074
01:28:38,529 --> 01:28:49,517
And I'm the last person that, no, maybe, I wanna see what we're about as a nation be taught in the school.

1075
01:28:51,095 --> 01:28:58,319
And I think it's worthy to look at other points of view in the academic process at some point when someone's ready for that.

1076
01:28:59,059 --> 01:29:03,102
But are we doing the best for our students?

1077
01:29:03,182 --> 01:29:20,351
If this is what the issue is about, because we spoke about a lot of things, but if it's all funneling down to what is the curriculum being taught in our schools, and if parents, I'm not aware of parents having a concern about their students

1078
01:29:20,984 --> 01:29:22,425
being turned into socialists.

1079
01:29:23,145 --> 01:29:26,747
Um, but, uh, I think we ought to look at this then.

1080
01:29:26,767 --> 01:29:41,476
Um, obviously, uh, this type of agenda and if, if this is what the UN, I think it's a far cry from what Eleanor Roosevelt had in mind some 70 some odd years ago.

1081
01:29:41,496 --> 01:29:48,180
Uh, if this is what we're getting at, but this is what, if we look at our friends in Europe, uh, and what's happened to them,

1082
01:29:48,915 --> 01:29:57,618
In, uh, their efforts to, uh, have some sort of, uh, elimination of, of uniqueness, uh, to each nation.

1083
01:29:58,318 --> 01:30:02,900
Um, uh, we only have to look at them to see the, uh, the ramifications of this.

1084
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,661
Thank you.

1085
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:07,421
Thank you, Mr. President.

1086
01:30:07,461 --> 01:30:08,862
I'm also not prepared to.

1087
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:16,083
to support any motion tonight other than, because we've been asked to look at a lot of different items tonight.

1088
01:30:16,423 --> 01:30:28,027
You mentioned the 40 chapters, there's various video clips, and I'm wondering if it's appropriate to even ask the superintendent to come up here maybe next Tuesday and give his position on all of this.

1089
01:30:31,609 --> 01:30:33,089
You can request anything.

1090
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:34,650
All right, Councilor Camuso.

1091
01:30:35,218 --> 01:30:36,159
Thank you, Mr. President.

1092
01:30:36,359 --> 01:30:50,770
And I certainly agree with Councilor Arena, but I think that this is something that the people that live in this community put the school committee into office to discuss these very important issues, Mr. President.

1093
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:55,974
And the voters spoke a few weeks ago.

1094
01:30:57,016 --> 01:31:07,288
on the school committee, and I think that they are the people that are tasked, excuse me, with setting the educational standards and curriculum for our children.

1095
01:31:08,292 --> 01:31:29,296
And quite frankly, this issue is way over my head at this point, and Agenda 21, Area 51, I'm not about to take a vote on any of this this evening, because quite frankly, I just, I don't have enough grasp, and it's something that I don't feel comfortable, I don't think it's fair for any councilor to take a vote on anything they don't feel comfortable with at this point.

1096
01:31:30,237 --> 01:31:30,517
Thank you.

1097
01:31:31,397 --> 01:31:31,937
Councilor Marks.

1098
01:31:32,857 --> 01:31:34,057
Thank you, Mr. President.

1099
01:31:34,357 --> 01:31:37,138
From what I understand, Councilor Penter is looking to establish

1100
01:31:37,668 --> 01:31:47,434
a joint meeting with the school committee, which would include the superintendent of schools, and I would assume the head of curriculum and headmasters and so forth.

1101
01:31:47,774 --> 01:31:53,118
And then we can probably get some answers on what the curriculum is, what's being taught, and so forth.

1102
01:31:53,518 --> 01:31:55,539
So I would support having a joint meeting.

1103
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:00,763
We actually have one of the newly elected school committee members in the audience, Aaron DiBenedetto,

1104
01:32:01,603 --> 01:32:08,268
who I don't expect to get up to the podium, but is showing an interest by coming to our meeting tonight on this particular issue.

1105
01:32:08,988 --> 01:32:13,491
And I believe that it would be worthwhile.

1106
01:32:13,891 --> 01:32:15,853
None of us are gonna sit down and read 40 chapters.

1107
01:32:15,893 --> 01:32:16,713
I can speak for myself.

1108
01:32:17,254 --> 01:32:19,235
I'm not gonna sit down and read 40 chapters.

1109
01:32:19,595 --> 01:32:26,780
So if I say let's postpone this until I'm done reading the 40 chapters and viewing the 60 minute video, it's never gonna happen.

1110
01:32:27,673 --> 01:32:42,921
But I'd be more than happy, and I'm interested enough in this particular issue, to sit down with the school committee, listen what administrators have to say, listen what Mr. Belson has to say, the head of curriculum at the public schools, and then make an informed decision on which way.

1111
01:32:43,421 --> 01:32:51,226
But I think to say we don't have enough information, you're correct in one aspect, but the other aspect, when are we gonna have enough?

1112
01:32:51,606 --> 01:32:55,668
When are we all gonna get together and say, you know what, we have enough information, let's move forward on this issue.

1113
01:32:56,211 --> 01:33:03,521
I only think a joint meeting would help us have a better understanding on what's being taught in the public schools.

1114
01:33:04,081 --> 01:33:07,486
Maybe listening to parents that have concerns, as Councilor Penta mentioned.

1115
01:33:08,153 --> 01:33:09,714
about what's being taught and so forth.

1116
01:33:10,134 --> 01:33:15,336
And that's, speak on fact, not what we believe or what might be.

1117
01:33:15,776 --> 01:33:18,857
But, you know, so I'm in favor of a joint meeting.

1118
01:33:19,217 --> 01:33:22,498
We asked several months for a joint meeting regarding the high school pool.

1119
01:33:22,838 --> 01:33:23,658
Has that ever happened?

1120
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:29,120
So, you know, there's a lot of things that we asked, you know, to get together with the school committee.

1121
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:33,061
And this, I think, is a worthy issue to discuss.

1122
01:33:33,141 --> 01:33:37,603
And so I would support having a joint meeting with the administration and the school committee.

1123
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:38,730
Thank you.

1124
01:33:39,891 --> 01:33:40,611
Uh, counsel Penta.

1125
01:33:41,352 --> 01:34:01,964
Well, Mr. President, uh, first of all, before we got to the joint meeting, I would want that joint meeting to be prefaced by the fact of what a report back from the superintendent and his director of curriculum are, is the city of Medford officially or unofficially partaking in any of the UNIB programming and does the city of Medford participate in the receipt of any monies for many of these programs?

1126
01:34:02,704 --> 01:34:06,907
And does in fact the city of Medford participate in a math program,

1127
01:34:07,478 --> 01:34:12,542
That basically is part of the National Science Foundation and the TREC program.

1128
01:34:12,942 --> 01:34:17,685
And if that's the case, Mr. President, you know, these are leading principals that are going to get this.

1129
01:34:18,566 --> 01:34:26,732
So when we have our discussion with the superintendent and the school committee and the directors of curriculum, let me just say this to clear it up.

1130
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:30,913
You say you're not going to have a meeting because you don't have enough information.

1131
01:34:31,093 --> 01:34:31,914
I've heard that before.

1132
01:34:32,615 --> 01:34:34,197
When are you ever going to have enough information?

1133
01:34:34,697 --> 01:34:37,560
The whole idea of bringing the information forward is to go to the next step.

1134
01:34:38,321 --> 01:34:43,386
They'll have enough time to get their act together, whether the programming is taking place or isn't taking place.

1135
01:34:44,398 --> 01:34:46,199
And I hear what you're saying, Councilor Camuso.

1136
01:34:46,259 --> 01:34:49,481
It's a school committee issue if it was a school committee issue, but it's not.

1137
01:34:49,741 --> 01:34:50,822
It's before this council.

1138
01:34:50,902 --> 01:34:54,044
We vote on the entire budget, which also includes the school department.

1139
01:34:54,384 --> 01:35:01,789
And if the school committee is not satisfactorily answering the questions of parents and taxpayers, and they have to broach councils with it,

1140
01:35:02,189 --> 01:35:15,901
I being one of them, that I'm bringing it forward because this revolves not around the education, this revolves around the life of an individual who doesn't have a chance to grow up and understand, understand what and how this country got to where it is.

1141
01:35:16,381 --> 01:35:20,525
He or she is being told that she globally has to become part of a conglomerate, a conglomerate,

1142
01:35:20,725 --> 01:35:21,966
a collective whatever it might be.

1143
01:35:22,267 --> 01:35:28,272
And she's losing that sense, or he's losing that sense of being the individual with a brain that God gave him to use.

1144
01:35:28,692 --> 01:35:37,721
Not to share everything he has with people less fortunate because that's the guilt that this whole programming, if that's what it's all about, is trying to devise.

1145
01:35:37,781 --> 01:35:39,002
It's not gonna take place overnight.

1146
01:35:39,302 --> 01:35:40,943
it's gonna take place over a period of years.

1147
01:35:41,543 --> 01:35:55,208
As I said, you may have spent 100 hours, I'm reading it, I have some concerns, some questions, but my real concern is if in fact we are to any degree, and Mrs. Benedetto, she's on there, and I'm glad she's here, and I compliment her for being here, because that's how serious she is about her job.

1148
01:35:55,748 --> 01:35:59,730
Well then if there's a smidge of it taking place, then that's what's gotta go, the smidge that's in there.

1149
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:04,533
Because it doesn't speak well for the Medford public school system, if in fact it's in there.

1150
01:36:04,913 --> 01:36:16,439
Now if it's not in there, and as Councilor DelaRusso has alluded to, I heard that we don't have civics anymore and this and that, we can get into this whole issue of what is being taught in behalf of the welfare and the education of the kids in our school.

1151
01:36:16,919 --> 01:36:20,061
Why maybe is algebra gonna be taken away out of the eighth grade?

1152
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:23,663
I mean these are all quality courses to make kids become a better person.

1153
01:36:24,203 --> 01:36:26,904
to become a better person in society for his life.

1154
01:36:27,364 --> 01:36:44,529
In this country, in the United States of America, not in a third world nation, not to support some other underprivileged country that can't make it on its own, but the guilt trying to make we in this country pay for everyone else's either mistakes or inability to go forward because they haven't gotten to that point yet.

1155
01:36:45,129 --> 01:36:49,931
And if we relegate ourselves to that position in life and to this world, we might as well hang up 234 years

1156
01:36:51,171 --> 01:36:55,233
43 years of what we were, because we won't even last another 25 years at the rate we're going.

1157
01:36:56,113 --> 01:36:56,413
Thank you.

1158
01:36:56,713 --> 01:36:58,094
Councilwoman, go current.

1159
01:37:03,216 --> 01:37:04,296
Thank you, President Mayeco.

1160
01:37:04,336 --> 01:37:06,317
I mean, I kind of agree with all my colleagues.

1161
01:37:06,397 --> 01:37:15,441
I feel like we don't have enough information to vote for or against getting rid of ICLEI, but I feel like we owe it to the people who are very passionate about the subject.

1162
01:37:15,481 --> 01:37:20,483
People that have, I mean, I've gotten five or six emails without having even really talked about it.

1163
01:37:20,873 --> 01:37:30,100
besides Mr. Cappuccio's presentation on the first of the month, I feel like getting answers, asking questions is what we need to do, and I'd like to get some answers.

1164
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:36,044
I mean, it was mentioned that cities and towns are paid up to $135,000 a year.

1165
01:37:37,265 --> 01:37:38,746
What, if anything, is Medford paid?

1166
01:37:38,766 --> 01:37:41,868
I don't think it's gonna hurt to ask these questions and get the answers.

1167
01:37:42,709 --> 01:37:48,873
I'm sure it's gonna take a while for us to set up a meeting with all administration and school committee members, so in the meantime,

1168
01:37:49,291 --> 01:37:51,053
Let's get some answers, let's figure it out.

1169
01:37:51,393 --> 01:38:03,324
We also have the time to look through whatever of the 40 chapters we want to, watch some videos and try to get educated on the topic because it's also, it's obviously a very passionate issue of so many.

1170
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:04,525
Thank you.

1171
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:07,267
I just wanna make a point.

1172
01:38:07,968 --> 01:38:10,991
Not one person on the school committee was on the technology committee.

1173
01:38:11,451 --> 01:38:14,093
The list of names is there, I'll post it tomorrow.

1174
01:38:14,981 --> 01:38:18,704
These people should be invited to participate in this joint meeting.

1175
01:38:19,084 --> 01:38:21,345
They're the ones who came up with these plans.

1176
01:38:22,246 --> 01:38:25,488
And I said two weeks ago, Council, we were trying to figure this out.

1177
01:38:25,548 --> 01:38:29,671
On page 11 of the technology report, it says it's a done deal.

1178
01:38:29,691 --> 01:38:31,853
There's an approved list of vendors.

1179
01:38:33,034 --> 01:38:37,156
that it's already in place, that they've already been chosen.

1180
01:38:37,937 --> 01:38:40,959
So that's what you want to do is you want to get, I'll tell you who you want to get.

1181
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:42,800
You want to get the city solicitor up here.

1182
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:48,803
I'd like to see Roy Belson on this committee and every person on the technology committee who came up with this plan.

1183
01:38:49,184 --> 01:38:50,545
That's who should be on the committee.

1184
01:38:51,265 --> 01:38:54,327
And remember, the school committee was not, there wasn't one school committee member.

1185
01:38:54,807 --> 01:38:59,630
I think Bill Wood was alluding to the fact like when he was talking to you about, yeah, the commission's great,

1186
01:39:00,203 --> 01:39:06,004
for transportation, but we'd like to see you people appointed, not the administration.

1187
01:39:06,544 --> 01:39:08,785
There's a big difference who gets on that committee.

1188
01:39:10,045 --> 01:39:10,365
Thank you.

1189
01:39:11,225 --> 01:39:11,585
Thank you.

1190
01:39:14,146 --> 01:39:14,826
All right.

1191
01:39:18,086 --> 01:39:19,206
My name's Caroline Rosen.

1192
01:39:19,246 --> 01:39:27,628
I live at 25 Bustle Road in Medford and I actually support the counselors here tonight who would like to research this issue.

1193
01:39:28,278 --> 01:39:30,981
a little bit more before making any kind of decision.

1194
01:39:31,641 --> 01:39:35,425
There was something said here tonight around the McCarthy era.

1195
01:39:35,846 --> 01:39:38,929
I actually grew up as a child during the McCarthy era.

1196
01:39:39,429 --> 01:39:42,733
I grew up in a liberal family with a Jewish father.

1197
01:39:42,753 --> 01:39:48,298
And it wasn't a pleasant time to live in that era as a liberal Jew.

1198
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:50,000
And there were many

1199
01:39:51,124 --> 01:39:56,607
writers and artists in America that were blacklisted at that time.

1200
01:39:57,487 --> 01:40:02,730
And we often like to revisit history in this country, which is an educational issue.

1201
01:40:03,631 --> 01:40:05,532
There were many people hurt during that era.

1202
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:14,423
And I would like to say around this topic, I researched it myself today because I found it very interesting, and I could see both sides' point of view.

1203
01:40:15,303 --> 01:40:20,465
But we're living in a time and an era where people are hurting economically.

1204
01:40:21,305 --> 01:40:27,008
I just come back from my home state in Ohio, and it looks like a city out of the Great Depression.

1205
01:40:28,148 --> 01:40:35,591
We're very lucky here in Massachusetts in many ways, but we have to be very cautious about how we handle these kind of issues.

1206
01:40:36,579 --> 01:40:44,884
And McCarthyism was one of those issues where we should ask ourselves, when did we know we were into a red witch hunt?

1207
01:40:45,504 --> 01:40:51,588
When did we know that we were fighting our very own principles of individualism and free speech?

1208
01:40:52,568 --> 01:40:55,330
And I'm asking you tonight to be very cautious.

1209
01:40:55,970 --> 01:40:57,892
I understand the argument of socialism.

1210
01:40:57,992 --> 01:40:59,773
I understand the argument of communism.

1211
01:40:59,853 --> 01:41:01,954
And I understand the argument of capitalism.

1212
01:41:02,448 --> 01:41:18,602
And I also understand the Occupy Wall Streeters, and I understand the issues of the Tea Party, because a common ground they have is that the individual voice in this country has been suppressed by a government that very rarely listens.

1213
01:41:20,063 --> 01:41:30,172
And that's something you should take note of as you sit here, because that was an issue before the election, as to whether you were actually listening to the citizens of this city.

1214
01:41:32,604 --> 01:41:42,832
Now, I don't want us going off into a witch hunt about socialism, because the issue is really around social equity, disclosure, and transparency in government.

1215
01:41:43,372 --> 01:41:46,555
And that's why I encourage you to research this issue.

1216
01:41:47,055 --> 01:41:49,077
Find out what the real points are.

1217
01:41:49,737 --> 01:41:59,525
Because I saw a program that talked about critical thinking skills and developing essays, but I also saw a program that was focused on science and technology and math.

1218
01:42:00,276 --> 01:42:04,800
but not particularly on interdisciplinary studies around humanistic issues.

1219
01:42:06,141 --> 01:42:14,827
On the other side, I can see that we could set up indoctrination programs, and we have to be aware of those, because McCarthyism was also an indoctrination.

1220
01:42:15,428 --> 01:42:19,991
When did we know it was happening, and when did we decide to stop it?

1221
01:42:21,833 --> 01:42:24,515
There's a balance that we have to weigh in this country.

1222
01:42:25,814 --> 01:42:40,767
and people look to you in this city as elected officials to make sure that balance happens in social equity and justice and that we don't run off on theories that we haven't had time to research.

1223
01:42:41,968 --> 01:42:52,657
So I would say to the young man that came up and talked about that McCarthy was right, well maybe you should have lived during the era of my family who had a brief touch of McCarthyism

1224
01:42:54,127 --> 01:42:55,128
in my own family.

1225
01:42:56,008 --> 01:43:07,497
And the artists like Dalton Trumbo, who wrote a great movie called Spartacus, but couldn't use his real name, talking about individual justice and not economic slavery.

1226
01:43:08,637 --> 01:43:12,940
But he couldn't use his real name because he was blacklisted for a number of years.

1227
01:43:13,621 --> 01:43:16,983
So let's be very cautious as we talk about these issues.

1228
01:43:17,844 --> 01:43:23,268
Because the question is, when do we really realize when we walk into oppression?

1229
01:43:24,691 --> 01:43:28,697
And when do we really realize when we're actually asking critical questions?

1230
01:43:29,419 --> 01:43:31,041
And where do we find that balance?

1231
01:43:31,462 --> 01:43:32,263
Thank you very much.

1232
01:43:40,072 --> 01:43:40,332
What is it?

1233
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:40,893
Go ahead.

1234
01:43:41,053 --> 01:43:42,774
Bob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1235
01:43:43,474 --> 01:43:46,336
Nobody's advocating a witch hunt.

1236
01:43:46,496 --> 01:43:53,782
Nobody's advocating to attack on anybody's infringements of rights of free speech or anything like that.

1237
01:43:54,882 --> 01:44:03,749
I came to this issue based on fact, based on looking at the empirical data and then researching it beyond that.

1238
01:44:05,109 --> 01:44:08,472
The offshoots of McCarthyism, which is

1239
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:12,534
which is, which is, it's, I'm sorry, but it's fear mongering.

1240
01:44:12,794 --> 01:44:15,998
I understand that people suffered and

1241
01:44:16,683 --> 01:44:28,532
The facts of the matter are, though, that the things Joe McCarty was saying were later proven in 1995 by the very people he was saying them against.

1242
01:44:28,733 --> 01:44:32,716
They came out with something called the Venona Papers, V-E-N-O-A-N-A.

1243
01:44:32,796 --> 01:44:34,397
We're not gonna get into this.

1244
01:44:34,797 --> 01:44:36,539
Everybody's made their point, thank you.

1245
01:44:36,659 --> 01:44:37,299
I just don't want.

1246
01:44:37,319 --> 01:44:38,240
Thank you, you made your point.

1247
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,381
Sir, sir.

1248
01:44:39,421 --> 01:44:40,942
No sir, thank you, you made your point.

1249
01:44:41,563 --> 01:44:43,044
All right, on the motion of counsel Penta.

1250
01:44:46,306 --> 01:44:49,227
We've been going, excuse me, I'll preside in the meeting.

1251
01:44:49,887 --> 01:44:50,207
All right?

1252
01:44:53,688 --> 01:44:54,109
You're welcome.

1253
01:44:55,169 --> 01:44:55,429
Go ahead.

1254
01:44:55,569 --> 01:44:56,629
You name an address for the record.

1255
01:44:56,709 --> 01:44:59,310
Marie Masi, 06 Cudworth Street, Medford, Mass.

1256
01:44:59,911 --> 01:45:08,233
I just want to say that I'm just somebody that happened to see Mr. Cappuccio speak that night at the city council when he brought up this 21.

1257
01:45:10,294 --> 01:45:13,155
And just as a resident of the city of Medford,

1258
01:45:14,537 --> 01:45:15,717
It made me concerned.

1259
01:45:16,037 --> 01:45:23,379
I felt like I'm sitting there hearing something that seems so crazy and impossible.

1260
01:45:23,779 --> 01:45:26,720
But he did present pretty good facts.

1261
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:34,762
And I'm sitting here tonight, and I'm listening to Councilman Penter talk about information that he got facts on.

1262
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:40,223
Jim Morse took time to put a lot of information together.

1263
01:45:40,704 --> 01:45:47,346
And I'm very busy, and I really didn't have the time to sit there and watch the 60 minutes and the different things.

1264
01:45:47,746 --> 01:45:49,846
But I did try to read through.

1265
01:45:50,807 --> 01:45:55,068
And like all of you and many other people, it's perplexing.

1266
01:45:56,455 --> 01:46:09,138
But there seems to be something here that I hope each and every one of you take serious and really listen to the people that have put so much time into this, as Ms.

1267
01:46:09,178 --> 01:46:25,423
Dipenta did, trying to find some further information that makes me, a resident of the city of Medford, thanking God I don't have any kids that I even have to worry about in the school system, whether it be public or private.

1268
01:46:26,103 --> 01:46:27,264
Because this is sad.

1269
01:46:27,844 --> 01:46:38,432
And I think that, as Councilman Penter said, we have to think about what everybody has always died for us to have in America.

1270
01:46:39,112 --> 01:46:49,660
And I hope that each and every one of you take what was presented tonight and originally by Mr. Cappuccio seriously and really look into this.

1271
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:53,263
Because if something is happening in the city of Medford,

1272
01:46:54,137 --> 01:47:06,441
then we should do something to stop it from happening and stop it from educating the children in Medfit not the way we want to see them become people of the United States.

1273
01:47:06,621 --> 01:47:07,561
Thank you, Mr. Penter.

1274
01:47:08,201 --> 01:47:08,601
Thank you.

1275
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:12,543
Hi.

1276
01:47:13,723 --> 01:47:14,663
I'm Jean Avalani.

1277
01:47:15,063 --> 01:47:16,684
This is my daughter, Marina Avalani.

1278
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:18,905
We live at 10 Daily Road in Medfit.

1279
01:47:20,576 --> 01:47:40,815
Sorry, we're at 10 Daly Road in Medford, and I was actually watching tonight's meeting, and I wanted to come up here and, you know, with my daughter and basically say that it is a concern of mine, sorry, in the city of Medford, to have the best education for my daughter.

1280
01:47:41,415 --> 01:47:43,758
And I am concerned, sorry, oh my God.

1281
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:49,914
just to make sure that she does have the best education and isn't led into the wrong way.

1282
01:47:50,335 --> 01:47:55,998
So please take your time to make this decision and think of, you know, the kids.

1283
01:47:57,799 --> 01:47:59,139
Sorry, I don't know why I'm crying.

1284
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:11,246
But take your time and make the right decision with keeping, I know you guys do, but keep the kids in mind, because again, I just want the best for my daughter.

1285
01:48:12,106 --> 01:48:12,386
Thank you.

1286
01:48:12,406 --> 01:48:13,087
We will.

1287
01:48:13,147 --> 01:48:13,487
Thank you.

1288
01:48:16,584 --> 01:48:18,805
On the motion, the table, the paper, that is undebatable.

1289
01:48:19,066 --> 01:48:19,826
All those in favor?

1290
01:48:20,486 --> 01:48:20,887
All those?

1291
01:48:22,087 --> 01:48:23,068
Roll call has been requested.

1292
01:48:23,088 --> 01:48:23,828
The table, the paper.

1293
01:48:25,009 --> 01:48:36,336
Yes, on a vote of three in the affirmative, four in the negative, the paper is paper, in the affirmative, the paper is table.

1294
01:48:44,796 --> 01:48:47,237
On the motion, the councilor repent of special rules.

1295
01:48:47,317 --> 01:48:49,298
All those in favor, all those opposed, suspension is granted.

1296
01:48:55,361 --> 01:48:55,641
All right.

1297
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:56,301
Offered by council.

1298
01:48:56,321 --> 01:48:56,582
Come on.

1299
01:48:56,602 --> 01:49:03,645
So be resolved that the electrical department look into replacing the crossing signal in front of five high street in the interest of public safety council.

1300
01:49:03,665 --> 01:49:03,885
Come on.

1301
01:49:03,905 --> 01:49:04,005
So

1302
01:49:04,449 --> 01:49:05,350
Thank you, Mr. President.

1303
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:17,118
In the heart of Medford Square, one of the cross signals that indicate for the elderly and seniors and anyone traversing the square is out and should be fixed, especially where it's the heart of our community.

1304
01:49:17,178 --> 01:49:18,419
So, move approval.

1305
01:49:19,079 --> 01:49:21,981
On the motion of approval, all those in favor, all those opposed, paper is approved.

1306
01:49:23,362 --> 01:49:23,582
All right.

1307
01:49:23,622 --> 01:49:31,187
Also on suspension off by President Mayorko, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Pastor Kevin Toomey of St.

1308
01:49:31,227 --> 01:49:31,928
Rayfield Parish

1309
01:49:32,515 --> 01:49:46,879
and Father Richard Meem of Immaculate Conception Parish on being selected to study in Rome at the North American College Institute's Theological Studies Spring Program beginning January 30th, 2012 and ending April 17th, 2012.

1310
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:55,962
This is a terrific honor for two of our hometown pastors, priests, Father Kevin and Father Meem.

1311
01:49:56,943 --> 01:50:01,584
In the Ashtiosis is a program that offers only two priests in each program

1312
01:50:02,355 --> 01:50:15,242
in the spring semester, a sabbatical for theological studies, and Father Toomey and, Pastor Toomey and Father Meem were selected, and we want to congratulate this outstanding program.

1313
01:50:15,642 --> 01:50:16,642
Vice President De La Russo.

1314
01:50:17,023 --> 01:50:19,824
Yes, I want to add my congratulations to them.

1315
01:50:20,244 --> 01:50:31,310
Not only will they receive wonderful refreshment in the areas of theology and scripture, et cetera, but I'm sure they will not have one bad meal.

1316
01:50:33,097 --> 01:50:35,521
On the motion of Vice President De La Rosa for approval, all those in favor?

1317
01:50:35,541 --> 01:50:36,081
All those opposed?

1318
01:50:36,101 --> 01:50:36,943
The paper is approved.

1319
01:50:37,784 --> 01:50:45,174
Moved by Councilor Penta, be it resolved the Meffitt High School football team and high school band and cheerleaders be congratulated for their teamwork this year.

1320
01:50:45,314 --> 01:50:46,035
Councilor Penta.

1321
01:50:46,236 --> 01:50:49,120
Mr. President, once again, for 58 years, I have the opportunity.

1322
01:50:49,783 --> 01:50:53,547
to go and watch the Meffitt High School game on Thanksgiving Day.

1323
01:50:54,929 --> 01:51:07,283
The boys did a great job, the band did a great job when they were allowed to play, and the cheerleaders did a great job when they were heard, or seen, let's put it that way.

1324
01:51:09,008 --> 01:51:13,070
It's just unfortunate that it's the game of the year that everybody waits for.

1325
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:15,471
The boys had a great year.

1326
01:51:15,531 --> 01:51:16,591
They worked their hearts out.

1327
01:51:17,352 --> 01:51:19,212
Didn't make any difference whether you won or you lost.

1328
01:51:19,653 --> 01:51:20,613
It's Thanksgiving Day.

1329
01:51:21,233 --> 01:51:22,474
It's a teenage game.

1330
01:51:22,834 --> 01:51:23,794
It's a game for kids.

1331
01:51:23,874 --> 01:51:25,135
It's a high school game.

1332
01:51:25,655 --> 01:51:28,036
It's not a game for the Patriots or professional football.

1333
01:51:28,836 --> 01:51:37,040
And the sad part about the whole thing, Mr. President, a band who waits all year long to play a big game of the year, never have the opportunity to play.

1334
01:51:37,992 --> 01:51:43,458
They were drowned out by some crazy music that kept playing over and over and over again during the course of the game.

1335
01:51:43,478 --> 01:51:45,701
And it just really made no sense at all.

1336
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:51,527
And I think it was just a complete insult to the whole football day activity.

1337
01:51:52,128 --> 01:51:55,071
The kids worked their hearts out to play, tried to win.

1338
01:51:55,912 --> 01:51:56,393
The band

1339
01:51:57,795 --> 01:52:05,602
waited for this day to make sure that they have that opportunity to do at least their halftime presentation, completely drowned out.

1340
01:52:06,343 --> 01:52:09,246
The only time you actually heard them was at the end of the fourth quarter.

1341
01:52:09,906 --> 01:52:15,832
And then the cheerleaders, it's unfortunate, Mr. President, everything that you would normally go to see on Thanksgiving Day just didn't make it.

1342
01:52:16,793 --> 01:52:23,835
I don't know who's responsible, who's in charge, but I would hope the message goes back loud and clear that this does not happen next year.

1343
01:52:24,415 --> 01:52:25,415
This is a game for the kids.

1344
01:52:25,455 --> 01:52:31,397
This is not about professional football and acting and playing like it and playing the same music they play in Foxborough.

1345
01:52:31,417 --> 01:52:32,177
Who cares about that?

1346
01:52:32,877 --> 01:52:38,478
This is a kid's game and it's the game of the year that everybody waits to go for and to see and watch.

1347
01:52:39,398 --> 01:52:42,879
But let me underscore all of that by saying they played their hearts out this year.

1348
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:44,300
It's just,

1349
01:52:46,243 --> 01:52:51,248
Maybe it's just a tough business being in football, a lot like it was years ago, but it's neither here or there.

1350
01:52:51,988 --> 01:52:58,074
The coach and the team did a great job, the cheerleaders did a great job, and the band, they did a great job under the circumstances.

1351
01:52:58,675 --> 01:53:06,983
But putting that aside, Mr. President, I would expect that something is done and this does not happen again because it just took away from the whole

1352
01:53:08,101 --> 01:53:15,123
The whole excitement of the day, waiting for the halftime, waiting for the band to play, waiting to see the cheerleaders and do what they do.

1353
01:53:15,203 --> 01:53:18,163
And they were just drowned out by that crazy, stupid music.

1354
01:53:18,684 --> 01:53:21,224
That's no other way to explain it, because that's what it was.

1355
01:53:21,764 --> 01:53:24,705
If I may, from the chair, this is one issue I agree with you 100%.

1356
01:53:25,445 --> 01:53:25,905
I was there.

1357
01:53:26,746 --> 01:53:29,206
I was disappointed that the band did not play, as you mentioned.

1358
01:53:29,846 --> 01:53:30,947
I hope it doesn't happen again.

1359
01:53:32,027 --> 01:53:36,728
And the appropriate action takes place next year that that will not happen.

1360
01:53:37,436 --> 01:53:39,036
On the motion to Councilor Penta for approval.

1361
01:53:39,437 --> 01:53:39,937
On that motion?

1362
01:53:40,617 --> 01:53:40,757
Yes.

1363
01:53:41,117 --> 01:53:41,737
Councilor Camuso.

1364
01:53:41,837 --> 01:53:42,757
Thank you, Mr. President.

1365
01:53:42,837 --> 01:53:46,699
And I want to just echo the sentiments of Councilor Penta.

1366
01:53:46,759 --> 01:53:54,921
I had the opportunity a couple days before Thanksgiving, I was invited to speak to the team, myself and some former players.

1367
01:53:55,001 --> 01:54:00,142
And it really was just a privilege, Mr. President, because it's not just the winning and losing.

1368
01:54:00,262 --> 01:54:02,983
And as I said to the young men that evening,

1369
01:54:04,295 --> 01:54:07,215
When I was in high school, I had the opportunity to play in hockey and football.

1370
01:54:07,256 --> 01:54:12,476
In hockey, we were actually one of the better teams in the GBL and made the tournament every year.

1371
01:54:12,496 --> 01:54:16,437
And in football, we lost just about every game, minus maybe one or two.

1372
01:54:17,857 --> 01:54:28,179
But the camaraderie and the brotherhood and the teamwork, it just developed more on the football field for whatever reason than it did during the winning hockey season, Mr. President.

1373
01:54:28,899 --> 01:54:33,580
And like I said to those young men, the city of Medford is proud of them.

1374
01:54:35,378 --> 01:54:39,399
The city of Medford is proud of the hard work and dedication that they've put into it.

1375
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:42,899
This city is moving forward on a new turf field for them.

1376
01:54:43,239 --> 01:54:56,902
It reminded them that this is the last time they're gonna play a Thanksgiving Day game on grass and moving forward in that basically, Mr. President, they went out there, they left everything they had on the field.

1377
01:54:56,962 --> 01:55:03,303
The 16 seniors are moving on and they have nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. President.

1378
01:55:04,583 --> 01:55:05,704
They worked hard.

1379
01:55:05,824 --> 01:55:06,424
They worked hard.

1380
01:55:06,444 --> 01:55:14,109
As far as the band, that was something I didn't even pick up on, but, uh, Mr, uh, Mr. Counselor is a hundred percent correct.

1381
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:17,732
The band is just as big as part of that day as everything else.

1382
01:55:18,852 --> 01:55:21,614
So, uh, in the future, I would hope that this doesn't happen.

1383
01:55:22,415 --> 01:55:24,236
You know, they have a, they have a band director too.

1384
01:55:24,896 --> 01:55:25,957
And you just jog my memory.

1385
01:55:26,237 --> 01:55:28,899
You go and you have the dinner the night before these kids get all prepped up.

1386
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:30,240
The band gets all excited.

1387
01:55:31,177 --> 01:55:31,837
How does this happen?

1388
01:55:32,357 --> 01:55:38,439
And then when you go to find out and you ask the question as you were there, nobody know who everybody was blaming everyone else for doing whatever it was.

1389
01:55:38,819 --> 01:55:43,360
There was absolutely no coordination on that football game for how the activities were supposed to take place.

1390
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:44,260
It's a shame.

1391
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:45,380
It really is a shame.

1392
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:48,941
The place was packed on the motion of council Penta for approval.

1393
01:55:48,961 --> 01:55:54,322
All those in favor of all those opposed papers approved also on a suspension off by council Penta be resolved.

1394
01:55:54,662 --> 01:55:55,602
Yeah, resolved.

1395
01:55:56,142 --> 01:55:59,603
Then the same spirit of resolving the Winthrop street and George three safety issue

1396
01:56:00,178 --> 01:56:10,034
The same sense of resolution be exerted to resolve the non blinking lights at the Winthrop Street and Boston Avenue intersection that had been non-functional for over a year.

1397
01:56:10,555 --> 01:56:13,340
Mr. President, I had the opportunity this morning to watch

1398
01:56:13,873 --> 01:56:27,686
a Medford policeman on detail for almost two hours, walk every single person with the baby carriage, student, person going to the hillside, hardware, anyone trying to walk across that street, because the blinking lights weren't working.

1399
01:56:27,926 --> 01:56:33,091
The big one wasn't working, the one right there at the corner of Boston Avenue and Winthrop Street.

1400
01:56:33,471 --> 01:56:38,156
A lady came into the store, the policeman brought her over to me, he says, there's the counselor, you tell him.

1401
01:56:38,511 --> 01:56:41,653
She told me she called that guy's office over that hall over a year ago.

1402
01:56:42,033 --> 01:56:43,494
Nobody has ever done anything about it.

1403
01:56:43,574 --> 01:56:45,956
She's just thoroughly disgusted with state government.

1404
01:56:46,296 --> 01:56:47,457
Strike that, with city government.

1405
01:56:47,777 --> 01:56:49,818
And she says, but you know, the policeman was very nice.

1406
01:56:49,858 --> 01:56:50,519
He brought me over.

1407
01:56:50,839 --> 01:56:52,200
And she seemed like a very nice person.

1408
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:53,941
This, again,

1409
01:56:54,857 --> 01:56:57,298
It's an issue, Mr. President, that should be resolved tomorrow morning.

1410
01:56:57,338 --> 01:57:01,661
The same way they took care of Winthrop Street in George Street, they should go right up there.

1411
01:57:01,781 --> 01:57:02,401
You've been up there.

1412
01:57:02,421 --> 01:57:03,422
You've seen it in the past.

1413
01:57:03,842 --> 01:57:05,563
You've got speeding cars up there.

1414
01:57:05,823 --> 01:57:07,924
You have people driving through red lights.

1415
01:57:07,964 --> 01:57:10,685
You have people that don't park eight feet away from the intersection.

1416
01:57:11,026 --> 01:57:12,627
You have traffic lights that don't work.

1417
01:57:12,887 --> 01:57:14,648
You have streets that don't get striped.

1418
01:57:15,588 --> 01:57:19,010
So, Mr. President, if this is just part of this collective activity,

1419
01:57:19,390 --> 01:57:24,192
the council can do, I think tomorrow morning, the mayor should go up there post haste and fix that light.

1420
01:57:24,612 --> 01:57:26,773
Fix those lights, that four-way intersection.

1421
01:57:27,173 --> 01:57:31,575
Because you can't have a policeman there every day directing traffic, he just happened to be there because of a detail.

1422
01:57:31,996 --> 01:57:33,056
And he should be complimented.

1423
01:57:33,276 --> 01:57:34,797
He walked every single person.

1424
01:57:35,097 --> 01:57:38,739
He didn't stop the cars, he walked them from one side of the street to the other.

1425
01:57:39,539 --> 01:57:40,619
Get the name of the police officer?

1426
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:42,920
No, I don't want to embarrass him because he knows who he is.

1427
01:57:43,041 --> 01:57:43,981
I told him I wouldn't do that.

1428
01:57:44,401 --> 01:57:48,263
He should just be complimented, and he was for doing his job, period, that's what he said.

1429
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:50,680
On the motion of council Penta for approval.

1430
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,340
All those in favor.

1431
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,001
All those opposed.

1432
01:57:52,021 --> 01:57:52,821
The paper is approved.

1433
01:57:54,261 --> 01:58:09,004
Next Tuesday evening, whenever committee, the whole meeting, it should have been distributed, but apparently, uh, with Mr. Finn out today, uh, personal reasons, it wasn't, uh, for the, um, tech, uh, fiscal 2012 tax classification hearing, which will be held in the 13th.

1434
01:58:09,644 --> 01:58:16,366
And next week we'll have a committee, the whole with the information, the council can discuss why we're on suspension.

1435
01:58:16,466 --> 01:58:17,126
Would you like to speak?

1436
01:58:20,717 --> 01:58:22,798
John Byers, 25 Brooks Park.

1437
01:58:23,619 --> 01:58:28,281
I just have a commentary I'd like to make regarding the past elections.

1438
01:58:28,781 --> 01:58:33,364
Now, everyone in this auditorium knows that I ran for mayor.

1439
01:58:33,684 --> 01:58:37,846
I've been approached by about three dozen people since the elections.

1440
01:58:38,667 --> 01:58:43,830
Evidently, there was a scurrilous rumor going around that because I decided to run, I crossed the city.

1441
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:48,151
to have a primary election and cost the city $70,000.

1442
01:58:48,571 --> 01:59:02,397
I want to make it public to citizens of Medford and anyone who believes this, that back in August when we had the drawing for ballot positions, I was then approached by Stephanie Muccini-Burke, the mayor's representative, to sign on

1443
01:59:03,677 --> 01:59:14,943
a piece of paper to request that the city of Medford not have a primary and it was going to be signed by the mayor, myself, and hopefully the third member, the third candidate, Tony D'Antonio.

1444
01:59:14,983 --> 01:59:18,985
Now Tony has his reasons to why he did not want to sign on to it.

1445
01:59:19,546 --> 01:59:21,807
I was more than willing to save the city the money.

1446
01:59:22,467 --> 01:59:24,609
I signed on to that, the mayor signed on to that.

1447
01:59:24,649 --> 01:59:29,472
The paper never came to be because Tony refused to sign on it.

1448
01:59:29,692 --> 01:59:33,054
I don't want anyone to think that I'm throwing Mr. D'Antonio under the bus.

1449
01:59:33,195 --> 01:59:39,239
I just feel that the people of Medford need to know that I did not want to have a primary.

1450
01:59:39,379 --> 01:59:41,420
I felt happy with going into the generals.

1451
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:47,064
Anyone who wants to contact me can contact me at my email at TSW94.

1452
01:59:50,246 --> 02:00:00,534
I will be more than happy to talk to you about it, but I just feel that I'm being made to look like the bad guy because we had to have a primary, and that's not the case.

1453
02:00:00,614 --> 02:00:01,354
Thank you very much.

1454
02:00:01,975 --> 02:00:02,315
Thank you.

1455
02:00:03,956 --> 02:00:05,237
Yes, Vice President Del Rosso.

1456
02:00:05,718 --> 02:00:17,346
Just by way of commentary on the last remark, I think, and I hope it's, I was aware of that, and I hope it's well known throughout the community that John Byers always tries to do the right thing.

1457
02:00:18,247 --> 02:00:18,607
Very good.

1458
02:00:19,685 --> 02:00:21,085
Right, yes, Councilor Panto.

1459
02:00:22,466 --> 02:00:36,970
I know you're calling for Committee of the Whole meeting next Tuesday, but I think we really need to have a committee meeting on the school technology part of it because we are a part of that component to give our opinions and to forward them before any finalization comes in that.

1460
02:00:37,050 --> 02:00:40,071
So I would hope that you call it within the next two weeks.

1461
02:00:41,391 --> 02:00:43,052
Yes, yes, Councilor Mox.

1462
02:00:46,219 --> 02:00:55,545
I would just, I certainly wouldn't be opposed to that, but I would like to see the paper that the school committee approved come before us so that we know what they're at least.

1463
02:00:55,565 --> 02:00:56,806
That paper's on the table, by the way.

1464
02:00:57,307 --> 02:01:01,710
But we don't have the official request for a funding mechanism at this point.

1465
02:01:02,150 --> 02:01:02,771
No, no, no.

1466
02:01:03,031 --> 02:01:15,220
I believe if we, you were there at the mayor's press conference, he said he was going to be waiting to get input from the community, from the school committee and the city council, and then once he has all that together, then he would be making his recommendation.

1467
02:01:15,606 --> 02:01:19,889
Yes, but the school, that paper 2011-706 is on the table.

1468
02:01:19,909 --> 02:01:20,770
Well, take it from the table, then.

1469
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:21,891
Move to take it from the table.

1470
02:01:23,092 --> 02:01:25,253
On the motion of Councilor Pentland, take it from the table.

1471
02:01:26,074 --> 02:01:26,975
All those in favor?

1472
02:01:27,035 --> 02:01:30,137
All those opposed?

1473
02:01:30,157 --> 02:01:31,719
2011-706, that's a technology upgrade paper.

1474
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:41,986
So keeping in concert, Mr. President, with the mayor's request that the school committee, the council, the technology committee, and any other citizen, quote, any other citizen who wants to give their input,

1475
02:01:43,289 --> 02:01:44,490
I just think we should.

1476
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:46,131
The mayor's requested this meeting?

1477
02:01:46,832 --> 02:01:59,642
The mayor stated in his press release on a Friday afternoon, the ones that only certain councils were invited to, that he would be making a request for $2 million at some point in time in the future.

1478
02:01:59,902 --> 02:02:08,368
But that would be subject to change upon review by the school committee, the city council, the technology committee, and any citizen or group of citizens who want to give input.

1479
02:02:08,969 --> 02:02:11,851
So I believe the city council has an opportunity to give its input.

1480
02:02:13,133 --> 02:02:15,235
Yes, Councilor, Vice President DelaRusso.

1481
02:02:15,415 --> 02:02:19,639
I want Councilor Pence to give his input, but we don't have, I don't think we have.

1482
02:02:19,659 --> 02:02:21,340
You have the report.

1483
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:29,187
I understood also that in that context that there was further revision to the plan forthcoming.

1484
02:02:29,547 --> 02:02:31,829
So until we have further revision.

1485
02:02:32,209 --> 02:02:33,190
You have the report.

1486
02:02:33,511 --> 02:02:38,715
You have the report that was given to each councilor, and take that report and add a subtract to it.

1487
02:02:39,075 --> 02:02:40,597
That's what the revision's going to be.

1488
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:49,063
All right, then perhaps we ought to put, now that we have that report, perhaps we ought to plan on discussing it at a point.

1489
02:02:49,423 --> 02:02:49,844
In two weeks.

1490
02:02:49,864 --> 02:02:50,624
Mr. President.

1491
02:02:50,924 --> 02:02:52,965
Well then, let's do it in the Committee of the Whole in two weeks.

1492
02:02:53,525 --> 02:02:54,266
That's what I just said.

1493
02:02:54,846 --> 02:02:58,548
If you want to refer the paper to the Committee of the Whole, then it's up to the council.

1494
02:02:58,568 --> 02:03:00,369
Motion to refer it to Committee of the Whole.

1495
02:03:00,809 --> 02:03:05,272
Motion of Vice President Del Rosso, referred to Committee of the Whole, Vice President, yes, Councilor Camuso.

1496
02:03:06,452 --> 02:03:09,634
At this point, at least I'm just one member of this council,

1497
02:03:11,435 --> 02:03:16,297
I am going to my stance is waiting for the school committee to get it.

1498
02:03:16,417 --> 02:03:23,539
At that point, we can go as citizens, if we'd like, put our input in there, and then we'll officially see the request for funding at some point.

1499
02:03:24,139 --> 02:03:31,262
But to try to dictate to the school committee what we feel should be cut out and this and that at this juncture, I just think is going backwards.

1500
02:03:31,302 --> 02:03:36,283
But like I said, I'm just one member, and I look forward to the proposal.

1501
02:03:37,204 --> 02:03:38,084
By the same token,

1502
02:03:38,867 --> 02:03:54,158
Any project that ever came, a bond proposal before, Mr. President, whether it was the new schools, whether it was the roof for the schools, whether it was the improvement to the lockers a few years ago, it's always the school committee requesting it from the council what their priorities are.

1503
02:03:54,378 --> 02:03:58,400
And at that point we can say, hey, we think that the money could be better spent somewhere else.

1504
02:03:59,761 --> 02:04:00,022
Thank you.

1505
02:04:00,802 --> 02:04:01,623
If that was the case.

1506
02:04:01,643 --> 02:04:02,463
On the motion.

1507
02:04:03,004 --> 02:04:03,544
On that motion.

1508
02:04:03,564 --> 02:04:06,766
Mr. President, the motion to send to the committee of the whole.

1509
02:04:07,166 --> 02:04:07,387
Yes.

1510
02:04:09,495 --> 02:04:09,976
in two weeks.

1511
02:04:11,377 --> 02:04:11,737
Two weeks.

1512
02:04:12,178 --> 02:04:12,798
Move the issue.

1513
02:04:13,399 --> 02:04:13,879
Mr. President?

1514
02:04:14,139 --> 02:04:15,000
Yes, on the motion.

1515
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:24,549
Mayor, as quoted from the day the press release took place, Mayor McGlynn said the plan is subject to change based upon public input and the approval of the school committee and the city council.

1516
02:04:24,569 --> 02:04:30,294
The technology upgrade should begin before the school year is over and is considered phase one of the upgrade.

1517
02:04:30,654 --> 02:04:33,076
What we're talking about is what's in this report.

1518
02:04:33,477 --> 02:04:34,578
It's a voluminous report.

1519
02:04:35,176 --> 02:04:35,957
I've read the report.

1520
02:04:36,357 --> 02:04:36,597
Pardon me?

1521
02:04:36,797 --> 02:04:37,698
I've read both reports.

1522
02:04:37,718 --> 02:04:38,658
I've read both reports too.

1523
02:04:38,678 --> 02:04:40,840
The paper to go to the Committee of the Whole is for what purpose?

1524
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:44,602
The purpose to discuss, discuss that which is before us.

1525
02:04:45,002 --> 02:04:51,587
If in fact we are going to accept any part of it to discuss, are we going to, listen, are you going to wait for someone to turn around and say, okay.

1526
02:04:51,607 --> 02:04:52,667
I'm asking you a question.

1527
02:04:52,707 --> 02:04:53,688
I'm giving you an answer.

1528
02:04:53,708 --> 02:04:54,469
Will you wait a minute?

1529
02:04:55,629 --> 02:04:56,570
What is it with you tonight?

1530
02:04:57,377 --> 02:04:58,137
No, it's what's with you.

1531
02:04:58,157 --> 02:04:58,337
Calm down.

1532
02:04:58,357 --> 02:04:59,517
There's nothing wrong with me.

1533
02:04:59,617 --> 02:05:00,378
Just give me an answer.

1534
02:05:00,418 --> 02:05:01,858
Yeah, your answer's very simple.

1535
02:05:01,878 --> 02:05:04,738
Are we gonna discuss refurbished computers or new furthers?

1536
02:05:04,758 --> 02:05:07,539
Are we gonna talk about leasing them or are we gonna talk about buying them?

1537
02:05:07,559 --> 02:05:08,599
That's what's in the report.

1538
02:05:09,119 --> 02:05:17,460
And once the city council gives this recommendation, once the school committee gives this recommendation, once the technology committee gives this recommendation, then the mayor will give his recommendation.

1539
02:05:17,901 --> 02:05:25,662
May we also add to that motion, my motion, that we invite the chair of the technology committee to be present.

1540
02:05:26,582 --> 02:05:27,442
Invite all the members.

1541
02:05:27,622 --> 02:05:27,982
Who's that?

1542
02:05:28,022 --> 02:05:29,002
Let's have all of them then.

1543
02:05:29,062 --> 02:05:31,123
Invite all the members of the technology committee.

1544
02:05:31,403 --> 02:05:32,783
75 people in that little smelly room.

1545
02:05:32,803 --> 02:05:40,044
Mr. President, are we going to be talking about the, I believe it's an $8 million proposal or the $2 million proposal that the mayor talked about phase one?

1546
02:05:40,425 --> 02:05:48,166
I mean, this is where we're getting, we don't want to give the children of Medford false hopes that we're looking at doing 8 million if the school committee is only going to give us a request for two or three.

1547
02:05:49,986 --> 02:05:53,627
So the, as Councilor Penter very eloquently

1548
02:05:54,233 --> 02:05:56,175
alluded to the press release in the mayor's own words.

1549
02:05:56,695 --> 02:06:00,358
It was going to be public input, which I believe was done or is about to be done.

1550
02:06:00,378 --> 02:06:02,881
There was a meeting either scheduled or scheduled to be done.

1551
02:06:03,421 --> 02:06:10,267
And then the mayor went on to say it still needs the approval of the school committee, according to what the councilor just read, and the approval of the city council.

1552
02:06:11,759 --> 02:06:13,641
But you can't give approvals, Councillor.

1553
02:06:14,522 --> 02:06:17,185
This isn't just coming up with money for a bond.

1554
02:06:17,806 --> 02:06:20,849
This is coming up with, number one, you're going to do the infrastructure first.

1555
02:06:20,929 --> 02:06:27,217
And I would assume as a group of level-headed individuals, we'd be looking at the proposal and indicate, well, if we go to

1556
02:06:27,864 --> 02:06:32,665
the infrastructure, we'll do the infrastructure for us, because you have to have that before you go forward.

1557
02:06:33,045 --> 02:06:42,588
And then if the next phase, excuse me, if the next phase is, are we gonna buy new or used, and let's make that decision, and then however you get to that decision, are you gonna have the one-for-one programming?

1558
02:06:42,608 --> 02:06:51,170
And if you're gonna have the one-for-one program, is it gonna be in the lab, or is it gonna be in a cart that takes it away from one class to another the next day that has the same one-for-one programming?

1559
02:06:51,410 --> 02:06:52,611
And we can go on and on and on.

1560
02:06:52,651 --> 02:06:56,952
Are we gonna go out and seek outside vendors, or are we gonna take the ones that are already in the proposal?

1561
02:06:57,857 --> 02:07:01,000
If you read it and you have it all broken down, you'd have your, all your questions ready to go.

1562
02:07:01,241 --> 02:07:04,064
And at least we'd have some kind of uniform way of going.

1563
02:07:04,344 --> 02:07:08,108
Then the mayor can do whatever he wants for 2 million, 3 million, $4 million and plug it in.

1564
02:07:08,128 --> 02:07:08,989
You see where it goes.

1565
02:07:09,650 --> 02:07:11,952
My suggestion is, is there a chairperson of this committee?

1566
02:07:12,293 --> 02:07:12,533
Yes.

1567
02:07:13,074 --> 02:07:13,754
That he'd be in bio.

1568
02:07:13,794 --> 02:07:15,296
She'd be invited to come to the meeting.

1569
02:07:16,097 --> 02:07:18,159
If in fact, we're going to discuss this intelligently.

1570
02:07:18,179 --> 02:07:18,980
Huh?

1571
02:07:20,374 --> 02:07:25,059
And Mr. President, I just have always been a big advocate of the citizens.

1572
02:07:25,179 --> 02:07:26,060
It has spoken.

1573
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:30,124
They elect the school committee that are ready, willing, and able to serve.

1574
02:07:30,785 --> 02:07:33,468
They're the people that are put in the role to make decisions.

1575
02:07:38,445 --> 02:07:43,546
So like I said, I just don't want to step on their toes.

1576
02:07:43,846 --> 02:07:46,267
We also have, Mr. President, another part of this component.

1577
02:07:46,587 --> 02:07:52,168
And the other part of this component, while we're talking about the school department, the resolution entails entirely the entire community.

1578
02:07:52,408 --> 02:07:56,749
It talks about municipal building, the police, and the fire, and the school department.

1579
02:07:57,169 --> 02:07:59,330
So if we're going to do it, we're not going to piecemeal it.

1580
02:07:59,610 --> 02:08:05,291
Let's find out where in this wonderful world of a mind that the mayor has how he figures to put this all together.

1581
02:08:05,951 --> 02:08:06,371
That's all.

1582
02:08:06,531 --> 02:08:11,113
If we're going to talk about it, let's talk about the big picture, not the small little picture.

1583
02:08:11,193 --> 02:08:13,234
Well, so we have a quarterback, if I may.

1584
02:08:13,414 --> 02:08:17,996
If we have a quarterback, the gentleman or the person who's the chairman of this committee.

1585
02:08:18,016 --> 02:08:19,457
There's no chairman listed by name.

1586
02:08:19,517 --> 02:08:20,537
It's just 24 members.

1587
02:08:20,637 --> 02:08:22,258
So no one's identified as a chairperson.

1588
02:08:22,718 --> 02:08:25,419
Then who is the consultant?

1589
02:08:25,499 --> 02:08:26,240
Edge tech, I think.

1590
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:28,000
Well, he's the first name on there.

1591
02:08:29,401 --> 02:08:31,622
Well, the consultant, whoever the person is or people.

1592
02:08:32,201 --> 02:08:32,762
Mr. President?

1593
02:08:32,782 --> 02:08:33,382
Vice President, yes.

1594
02:08:33,462 --> 02:08:34,343
Councilor Longo, current.

1595
02:08:34,823 --> 02:08:37,185
Just briefly, thank you, President Mayako.

1596
02:08:37,305 --> 02:08:47,913
I think it's necessary that we meet, that we all review this and meet on it, give our input, discuss it in its entirety, because ultimately the buck stops here.

1597
02:08:48,073 --> 02:08:52,776
It's been said by many councilors before, and I think we need to get a grasp on it and speak.

1598
02:08:53,817 --> 02:09:00,482
The seven of us need to get together and really review it and go through our concerns and give our recommendations.

1599
02:09:01,238 --> 02:09:04,259
inviting the appropriate parties that certainly can give us the input.

1600
02:09:04,699 --> 02:09:06,420
On that motion, all those in favor?

1601
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:07,780
Yes, Vice President DelaRusso?

1602
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:17,084
May I, with all deference to Madam Clerk, amend my motion to include an invitation to the mayor?

1603
02:09:17,864 --> 02:09:19,505
Sure.

1604
02:09:19,805 --> 02:09:28,648
By the way, Madam Clerk is Madam Dennehy that's taking place of Edward Finn this evening, the assistant clerk.

1605
02:09:29,721 --> 02:09:39,909
On the motion as amended all those in favor all those opposed papers approved as amended Records of the meeting of November 22nd were passed to counsel marks now some marks have you reviewed the minutes?

1606
02:09:40,349 --> 02:09:51,958
