    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=5.535">Hello</a>  and thank you for listening to the Medford Bites podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=8.899">Before</a>  I get into the content for today's episode, I want to give a brief recap of last week's municipal election and thank all the candidates for coming on the podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=17.468">Last</a>  week, the results of the election saw a few changes to city council with the election of Kit Collins and Justin Tseng. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=24.795">adding</a>  to the re-elected members that include Zach Bares, Nicole Morell, Adam Knight, George Scarapelli, and Richard Caraviello. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=31.881">The</a>  school committee also added Sharon Hayes and re-elected incumbents that include Paul Rousseau, Jenny Graham, Melanie Perkins-McLaughlin, Maya Quinn-Mastoni, and Kathleen Krietz. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=42.31">Mayor</a>  Breanna Lungo-Koehn defeated John Falco to win her second term as Mayor of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=48.094">Today's</a>  episode of Medford Bites is the beginning of a new season, and new episodes will be released each Monday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=54.137">This</a>  season hopes to highlight community organizations, businesses, and to profile local citizens. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=60.441">Today's</a>  episode includes an interview with Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability for the City of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=67.226">I'll</a>  also interview Joe and Conrad, two youth from the Medford community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=71.709">Please</a>  check the show notes for links to important information mentioned in the interviews, and I hope you enjoy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=83.518">Hi</a>  Alicia, thanks for joining me today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=85.879">If</a>  you could start just by introducing yourself, name, pronouns, and what you do here at the City.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=90.582">Hi,</a>  I'm Alicia Hunn, she, her. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=94.264">I</a>  am the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=98.726">And</a>  what that really means is that we do <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=102.353">My</a>  expertise has been in climate change and energy issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=106.336">And</a>  when Mayor Brianna was elected, one of the things she wanted to do was make sure that we were including climate into all of the planning that we're doing throughout the city and bring in economic development and housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=120.188">So</a>  I have an economic development director that works here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=122.55">I</a>  have a housing planner. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=124.512">We</a>  have some federal funds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=125.873">So</a>  I have a federal fund manager and then planners and we do land use planning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=131.598">all</a>  kinds of plans plus we've been working on parks and open space renovations for the city and through it all we've just released a climate action and adaptation plan that's out for public comment right now and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=146.153">that</a>  we'd love people to comment on through January. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=149.135">But</a>  truly, it's a living document, so people could comment on it at any time, and we would take that feedback. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=155.62">But</a>  it is helpful to get comments on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=158.322">We</a>  have a website, gogreenmedford.org. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=162.125">It's</a>  the easiest way to get to it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=164.026">And</a>  if you went to gogreenmedford.org slash climate, you would come to the page that's all about the climate work that we're doing in this city.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=172.705">Yeah,</a>  you sent me your newsletter, and it's a lot of stuff you're working on all at once. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=176.608">So</a>  I'll be sure to put some links in our show notes so people can access those websites. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=181.371">So</a>  before we get into talking more about some of the specific projects that you're working on, I've been asking everybody about their favorite place to eat in Medford, what they like to eat there.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=190.41">So</a>  it's hard in Minford, because there are a lot of different places. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=193.991">And</a>  I have kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=195.152">So</a>  it's, am I going to my son's favorite restaurant or someplace that all five of us will be happy? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=201.014">But</a>  when I want to go and just get food for just me, it's usually lunchtime. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=205.815">And</a>  I love to run over to Tanosh and get one of their torta sandwiches. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=210.217">That's</a>  perhaps my favorite go-to lunch food here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=213.638">Delicious.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=214.538">We've</a>  heard of Tanosh, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=215.519">And</a>  other people have talked about that place, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=217.539">Yeah,</a>  they're amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=218.58">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=219.32">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=220.222">So</a>  I think we're particularly interested in hearing about what's going on with the parks and sort of how people can get involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=226.357">It's</a>  important to know about that.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=227.687">Yeah,</a>  thank you for asking, because we're really doing a lot of outreach with the parks right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=234.092">So</a>  Medford has an open space and recreation plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=237.155">We</a>  updated it every five years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=238.896">And</a>  that's actually part of, I would say, it's not exactly the law, but it's a state program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=245.442">And</a>  if you get it updated every five years, you are eligible for particular grants. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=252.228">And</a>  so we do try to work from that, and that directs some of our work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=257.172">But</a>  right now, we have landed on a couple of projects. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=261.076">We're</a>  doing a vision plan for Carr Park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=264.279">And</a>  so the idea there is that we're taking that, we're saying, what if this was a clean slate? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=269.524">We</a>  were starting over, and what do people want there? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=272.886">And</a>  so we've run this process really differently than past years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=276.748">Past</a>  programs with the city, the city would hire a consultant who would come up with a bunch of ideas, hold a session in City Hall to get feedback on them, go change their plan, maybe meet with the staff, and then come back with a final plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=292.918">And</a>  we said, that's not how we want to do parks in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=296.28">So</a>  first we asked the consultant to go out to Carr Park and she and I actually spent several hours, four different times, weekends, evenings, mornings, during the week, at Carr Park talking to people, noticing how people were using the park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=311.829">We</a>  let people know we were there and we put out a survey. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=314.43">What</a>  do people want? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=315.731">And</a>  that was kind of the clean slate. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=318.152">Then</a>  we came back with a couple of different plans and some of those raised some controversy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=322.293">So</a>  they got a lot of buzz and most people in Medford now know that this is going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=328.055">Controversy</a>  is not great, but buzz is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=331.515">So</a>  then we held several more listening sessions in the parks and actually we were at other events too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=337.977">We</a>  were down at the Mystic Arts Celebration and the Harvester Energy Festival. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=342.258">and</a>  got feedback on these plans. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=345.919">And</a>  we're actually meeting with the mayor and a number of staff from different departments today to go over all of that feedback and come together on what we think we want to see in the final iteration of this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=359.444">We're</a>  going to release that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=360.965">We're</a>  going to have an event. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=361.965">Well,</a>  we'll have the plans for display on Saturday, November 13th from 11 to 2 at Carr Park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=370.31">Most</a>  of these have been at the park itself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=372.811">So</a>  Saturday the 13th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=375.092">And</a>  we'll have one version there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=377.013">And</a>  we'll still be taking feedback on it because nothing is set in stone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=381.755">Once</a>  we have what we think that the community wants, the city wants, makes sense, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=387.199">will</a>  take over the winter and start applying for grants. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=390.983">And</a>  some of the grant programs, you apply in the winter, some are actually in the summer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=396.769">We</a>  need to put together a lot of money to do this renovation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=399.933">And</a>  so that's the point where we'll start to figure out what's in and what's out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=405.198">for</a>  certain, and we may have to phase the renovations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=409.579">So</a>  we won't see really any renovations in 2022. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=414.281">If</a>  there are problems that we can fix easily, we'll do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=419.182">People</a>  may have noticed a bunch of bushes disappeared from the park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=423.023">Those</a>  bushes were completely covered in poison ivy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=426.485">That's</a>  the kind of thing, you know, if there are other problems that we can fix easily to make it a more usable park, we'll do that in the short run. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=434.907">So</a>  that's CAR. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=437.009">We</a>  also are doing some smaller projects. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=440.511">One</a>  is at Gillis Park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=442.032">That's</a>  a baseball field only. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=443.573">And</a>  it is completely inaccessible, like legally ADA, but for anybody with any kind of disability. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=451.539">And</a>  so we've hired some consultants to come in, and their first pass at it is, how do we make this an accessible park? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=459.604">And</a>  when they come back with what's possible, then we'll probably be talking to people about, are there choices here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=468.129">It's</a>  unclear if there are going to be choices, just because of the nature of how that park exists and is laid out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=475.033">And</a>  we have no intention of changing the use. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=477.875">It's</a>  really about, you know, if you have somebody in a wheelchair who wants to come in and watch a game, or even on crutches, it's super hard, if not impossible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=488.978">Or</a>  they have to sit up on the street on the sidewalk, and that's not very nice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=492.619">It's</a>  not accessible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=494.139">So</a>  then Morrison Park, we have a plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=497.44">That</a>  park never got any play equipment for kids under five, for toddlers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=504.041">And</a>  toddlers want to use that park, and there's space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=507.302">So</a>  we have some consultants who have been out there talking to families and are going to be doing some tabling sessions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=512.747">The</a>  next one is actually this Thursday, November 11th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=515.47">It's</a>  Veterans Day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=516.951">And</a>  they're going to be out there from 9.30 to 11 to talk to people about the park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=521.936">In</a>  this case, we're really focusing on toddler improvements. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=526.44">within</a>  the fenced area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=528.44">Our</a>  tree warden is actually planning to plant more trees in Morrison Park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=533.522">And</a>  so we're coordinating with her because we want trees to shade the area, but we don't need a tree in the middle of where we're trying to put toddler improvements. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=543.264">We</a>  want to put safety surface in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=545.284">So</a>  we're also planning to replace the wood chips there with a more modern safety surface while we're in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=552.466">And</a>  then at Logan Park, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=554.626">We</a>  have a lot of interest in doing some natural play areas So adding we thought it would be fun to find some of the things that we have around the city That could be used like we actually have a lot of tree stumps and stuff and to turn those into a natural play area so we have done some tabling there and some flyering and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=575.96">And</a>  we are going to be Sunday, November 14th from 1 to 3 at Logan Park to hear what people have to say and are interested in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=585.064">And</a>  for both Morrison and Logan, there are surveys up on our website. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=590.666">So</a>  if you went to gogreenmedford.org slash parks, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=595.008">You</a>  can see more information about these projects, including the names of the consultants we've hired, and you can access the survey and give us feedback. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=605.23">If</a>  you're listening to this later and the surveys aren't still up, you can always send us email. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=609.611">Our</a>  email address is OCD. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=614.132">It</a>  stands for the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=617.193">So</a>  OCD at Medford-MA.gov. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=622.754">And</a>  that is, we'll go to our office and our staff will check it and forward it on to the right project.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=630.177">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=630.457">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=630.757">So</a>  some big things coming for Carr Park and Logan Park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=634.019">And</a>  it's nice to hear about the ADA compliance that you're all thinking of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=637.48">Are</a>  there any other projects that you want to mention?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=639.961">So</a>  we're doing a lot of small parks projects as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=644.623">Staff</a>  for the past year, year and a half, staff have been meeting with the mayor about once a month. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=649.745">to</a>  review a long list. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=651.325">We</a>  actually keep a spreadsheet of about 45 things that we're working on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=656.227">All</a>  of those that I've mentioned are on there, but there are others. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=659.867">We</a>  have consultants working on an underpass under Route 28, over by Stations Landing, so that people, it mirrors the one that goes to Assembly Row, and that, all the consulting engineering work is fully grant funded at this point, and the state has agreed to pay for the construction once it's fully designed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=680.212">So</a>  that one's pretty exciting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=682.814">We</a>  have some others that are in design as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=686.457">And</a>  we also have little things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=688.118">So</a>  we've heard a lot about basketball courts need to be resurfaced and tennis courts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=693.522">And</a>  so as people have probably noticed, we've been just going out there and getting those done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=698.045">We</a>  often apply for CPA grants to help pay for those projects. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=703.048">And</a>  we have a number of locations throughout the city where trees in parks are dying. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=709.112">They've</a>  reached their lifespan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=710.973">And</a>  so the tree warden's been working to identify those, get those removed, and she has funding as well to plant additional trees. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=719.358">You'll</a>  probably see those going in in the spring because it's too late this fall to get trees planted as I understand it so far. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=727.203">I</a>  think we had a freeze last night. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=730.245">We're</a>  doing some other things, ADA improvements at Tufts Pool, at Wrights Pond. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=735.027">We</a>  have federal grant money that we can use for ADA improvements on public facilities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=740.69">And</a>  so we've been using that as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=742.971">And</a>  then I've applied for grants to do a lighting upgrade at La Conte Ice Rink as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=750.454">And</a>  people may have noticed last winter, we actually upgraded all the lights at Tufts Pool to LED.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=756.077">Oh,</a>  wow.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=757.583">Yeah,</a>  it seems like you're very busy with all these projects. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=759.947">And</a>  is there anything that the community can do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=762.17">You're</a>  asking for input on surveys. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=764.193">And</a>  I'm wondering about funding, if there's anything the community could do in terms of helping there.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=771.15">So</a>  usually the type of funding we go after are state and federal grants, and they're on the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=779.514">Sometimes</a>  they ask us about community input and whether we've gotten it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=784.117">When</a>  we announce that we're having public meetings, it's actually really helpful to have people turn out for them, because then we can show that the public is interested. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=791.661">Getting</a>  email about these parks helps too, because we actually keep track of them all in a spreadsheet so that we know when <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=800.245">We're</a>  applying for grants. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=801.386">We</a>  can say like we've heard from people that this is not just somebody in an office making a decision The other thing that sounds funny is sometimes residents do know about private grants that are very helpful if it's small if it's like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=817.999">$2,500,</a>  $5,000, $10,000. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=818.239">It's</a>  probably something that you as a community group could go do, let us know, we'll help you out with it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=826.787">When</a>  we're doing a big renovation, a big project, we're usually looking for numbers that are hundreds of thousands of dollars. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=834.734">I</a>  will tell you that, so the Riverbend Park Dog Park, that was actually done with a private grant that residents found for us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=843.822">They</a>  became aware that there was a foundation that funded dog parks and we got a $250,000 grant from them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=850.829">So</a>  there could be grants like that that we may not just have heard of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=855.694">And</a>  so those are always helpful to hear about as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=859.697">Also</a>  things that fund climate change, we try to keep a pretty close ear to the ground on those because in the parks there's stuff like tree plantings, there's wetlands, there's creating rain gardens, but one of the things that I'm really looking at now is heat impacts of climate change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=878.835">So</a>  we are looking at adding spray features and water features, spray parks, and water fountains into our parks, because those are things that we'll need as part of climate change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=893.49">It</a>  blows my mind, but a commercial grade water fountain in a park that's hooked up to the water system in a way that's, even if there's already irrigation there, you need certain things to keep that water separated from the irrigation water. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=909.903">And</a>  so it's a minimum of $10,000 to install a commercial water fountain at a park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=916.167">So</a>  that's I think just helpful for people to have an idea of the scale of the cost because We would love like if somebody said well, I found this private entity that is funding water fountains at grant at parks if it's at least $10,000 per water fountain and I'm definitely interested and if it's like $500 it's it may not really actually help the project. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=939.089">That's</a>  good to know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3K2XhuDdTJ6KKL3WA7bLM1?t=940.211">Yeah,</a>  and</p>
