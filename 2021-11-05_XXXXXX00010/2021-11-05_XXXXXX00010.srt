[SPEAKER_04]: Hello and thank you for listening to the Medford Bites podcast.

2
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:16,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I get into the content for today's episode, I want to give a brief recap of last week's municipal election and thank all the candidates for coming on the podcast.

3
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:23,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week, the results of the election saw a few changes to city council with the election of Kit Collins and Justin Tseng.

00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:31,081
[SPEAKER_04]: adding to the re-elected members that include Zach Bares, Nicole Morell, Adam Knight, George Scarapelli, and Richard Caraviello.

00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:41,149
[SPEAKER_04]: The school committee also added Sharon Hayes and re-elected incumbents that include Paul Rousseau, Jenny Graham, Melanie Perkins-McLaughlin, Maya Quinn-Mastoni, and Kathleen Krietz.

6
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn defeated John Falco to win her second term as Mayor of Medford.

7
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:53,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's episode of Medford Bites is the beginning of a new season, and new episodes will be released each Monday.

8
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:59,260
[SPEAKER_04]: This season hopes to highlight community organizations, businesses, and to profile local citizens.

9
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:06,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's episode includes an interview with Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability for the City of Medford.

10
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:10,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll also interview Joe and Conrad, two youth from the Medford community.

11
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:17,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Please check the show notes for links to important information mentioned in the interviews, and I hope you enjoy.

12
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:25,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi Alicia, thanks for joining me today.

13
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,222
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could start just by introducing yourself, name, pronouns, and what you do here at the City.

14
00:01:30,582 --> 00:01:33,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Alicia Hunn, she, her.

15
00:01:34,264 --> 00:01:38,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

16
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:41,128
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that really means is that we do

17
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:45,556
[SPEAKER_00]: My expertise has been in climate change and energy issues.

18
00:01:46,336 --> 00:02:00,148
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Mayor Brianna was elected, one of the things she wanted to do was make sure that we were including climate into all of the planning that we're doing throughout the city and bring in economic development and housing.

19
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:02,510
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have an economic development director that works here.

20
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a housing planner.

21
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:05,793
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some federal funds.

22
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:10,357
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a federal fund manager and then planners and we do land use planning.

23
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:25,633
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of plans plus we've been working on parks and open space renovations for the city and through it all we've just released a climate action and adaptation plan that's out for public comment right now and

24
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:28,695
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'd love people to comment on through January.

25
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:34,739
[SPEAKER_00]: But truly, it's a living document, so people could comment on it at any time, and we would take that feedback.

26
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,722
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is helpful to get comments on it.

27
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:41,824
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a website, gogreenmedford.org.

28
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,526
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the easiest way to get to it.

29
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:51,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you went to gogreenmedford.org slash climate, you would come to the page that's all about the climate work that we're doing in this city.

30
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:56,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you sent me your newsletter, and it's a lot of stuff you're working on all at once.

31
00:02:56,608 --> 00:03:00,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be sure to put some links in our show notes so people can access those websites.

32
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:09,838
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we get into talking more about some of the specific projects that you're working on, I've been asking everybody about their favorite place to eat in Medford, what they like to eat there.

33
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,511
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard in Minford, because there are a lot of different places.

34
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:14,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have kids.

35
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:20,373
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, am I going to my son's favorite restaurant or someplace that all five of us will be happy?

36
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:25,715
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I want to go and just get food for just me, it's usually lunchtime.

37
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:30,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to run over to Tanosh and get one of their torta sandwiches.

38
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:33,598
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perhaps my favorite go-to lunch food here.

39
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:34,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious.

40
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:35,459
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard of Tanosh, too.

41
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And other people have talked about that place, too.

42
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're amazing.

43
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

44
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

45
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:46,277
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're particularly interested in hearing about what's going on with the parks and sort of how people can get involved.

46
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:47,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important to know about that.

47
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:52,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you for asking, because we're really doing a lot of outreach with the parks right now.

48
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:56,775
[SPEAKER_00]: So Medford has an open space and recreation plan.

49
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,776
[SPEAKER_00]: We updated it every five years.

50
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:04,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually part of, I would say, it's not exactly the law, but it's a state program.

51
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:11,047
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get it updated every five years, you are eligible for particular grants.

52
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:16,632
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do try to work from that, and that directs some of our work.

53
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:20,536
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, we have landed on a couple of projects.

54
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:23,819
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a vision plan for Carr Park.

55
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:28,663
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea there is that we're taking that, we're saying, what if this was a clean slate?

56
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:32,426
[SPEAKER_00]: We were starting over, and what do people want there?

57
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:35,948
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've run this process really differently than past years.

58
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:52,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Past programs with the city, the city would hire a consultant who would come up with a bunch of ideas, hold a session in City Hall to get feedback on them, go change their plan, maybe meet with the staff, and then come back with a final plan.

59
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,660
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, that's not how we want to do parks in Medford.

60
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:11,168
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we asked the consultant to go out to Carr Park and she and I actually spent several hours, four different times, weekends, evenings, mornings, during the week, at Carr Park talking to people, noticing how people were using the park.

61
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,310
[SPEAKER_00]: We let people know we were there and we put out a survey.

62
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,271
[SPEAKER_00]: What do people want?

63
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of the clean slate.

64
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:22,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we came back with a couple of different plans and some of those raised some controversy.

65
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:27,354
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got a lot of buzz and most people in Medford now know that this is going on.

66
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:30,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Controversy is not great, but buzz is.

67
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:37,937
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we held several more listening sessions in the parks and actually we were at other events too.

68
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:41,438
[SPEAKER_00]: We were down at the Mystic Arts Celebration and the Harvester Energy Festival.

69
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,119
[SPEAKER_00]: and got feedback on these plans.

70
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:58,784
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually meeting with the mayor and a number of staff from different departments today to go over all of that feedback and come together on what we think we want to see in the final iteration of this.

71
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,945
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to release that.

72
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:01,845
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have an event.

73
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:09,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll have the plans for display on Saturday, November 13th from 11 to 2 at Carr Park.

74
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these have been at the park itself.

75
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:14,372
[SPEAKER_00]: So Saturday the 13th.

76
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:16,753
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have one version there.

77
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:20,775
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll still be taking feedback on it because nothing is set in stone.

78
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:26,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have what we think that the community wants, the city wants, makes sense,

79
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,762
[SPEAKER_00]: will take over the winter and start applying for grants.

80
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:36,048
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the grant programs, you apply in the winter, some are actually in the summer.

81
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,913
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to put together a lot of money to do this renovation.

82
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:44,658
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the point where we'll start to figure out what's in and what's out.

83
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:48,799
[SPEAKER_00]: for certain, and we may have to phase the renovations.

84
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,741
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't see really any renovations in 2022.

85
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:59,002
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are problems that we can fix easily, we'll do that.

86
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:02,563
[SPEAKER_00]: People may have noticed a bunch of bushes disappeared from the park.

87
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bushes were completely covered in poison ivy.

88
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:14,467
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of thing, you know, if there are other problems that we can fix easily to make it a more usable park, we'll do that in the short run.

89
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:16,028
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's CAR.

90
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,891
[SPEAKER_00]: We also are doing some smaller projects.

91
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:21,972
[SPEAKER_00]: One is at Gillis Park.

92
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:23,553
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a baseball field only.

93
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:30,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is completely inaccessible, like legally ADA, but for anybody with any kind of disability.

94
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:38,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've hired some consultants to come in, and their first pass at it is, how do we make this an accessible park?

95
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:47,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they come back with what's possible, then we'll probably be talking to people about, are there choices here?

96
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:54,933
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unclear if there are going to be choices, just because of the nature of how that park exists and is laid out.

97
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,215
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have no intention of changing the use.

98
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:07,537
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about, you know, if you have somebody in a wheelchair who wants to come in and watch a game, or even on crutches, it's super hard, if not impossible.

99
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:11,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they have to sit up on the street on the sidewalk, and that's not very nice.

100
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:13,519
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not accessible.

101
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:16,559
[SPEAKER_00]: So then Morrison Park, we have a plan.

102
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,081
[SPEAKER_00]: That park never got any play equipment for kids under five, for toddlers.

103
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,602
[SPEAKER_00]: And toddlers want to use that park, and there's space.

104
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:32,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some consultants who have been out there talking to families and are going to be doing some tabling sessions.

105
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:35,410
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is actually this Thursday, November 11th.

106
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,411
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Veterans Day.

107
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:41,536
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be out there from 9.30 to 11 to talk to people about the park.

108
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:45,599
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're really focusing on toddler improvements.

109
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,680
[SPEAKER_00]: within the fenced area.

110
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,101
[SPEAKER_00]: Our tree warden is actually planning to plant more trees in Morrison Park.

111
00:08:53,522 --> 00:09:02,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're coordinating with her because we want trees to shade the area, but we don't need a tree in the middle of where we're trying to put toddler improvements.

112
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:04,864
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to put safety surface in.

113
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:11,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're also planning to replace the wood chips there with a more modern safety surface while we're in.

114
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,906
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at Logan Park,

115
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:35,260
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of interest in doing some natural play areas So adding we thought it would be fun to find some of the things that we have around the city That could be used like we actually have a lot of tree stumps and stuff and to turn those into a natural play area so we have done some tabling there and some flyering and

116
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:44,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to be Sunday, November 14th from 1 to 3 at Logan Park to hear what people have to say and are interested in.

117
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:50,206
[SPEAKER_00]: And for both Morrison and Logan, there are surveys up on our website.

118
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,828
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you went to gogreenmedford.org slash parks,

119
00:09:55,008 --> 00:10:05,070
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see more information about these projects, including the names of the consultants we've hired, and you can access the survey and give us feedback.

120
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,591
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to this later and the surveys aren't still up, you can always send us email.

121
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:13,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Our email address is OCD.

122
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:16,633
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands for the Office of Community Development.

123
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:19,833
[SPEAKER_00]: So OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

124
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:28,316
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, we'll go to our office and our staff will check it and forward it on to the right project.

125
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:30,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

126
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:30,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

127
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:33,578
[SPEAKER_04]: So some big things coming for Carr Park and Logan Park.

128
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's nice to hear about the ADA compliance that you're all thinking of.

129
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other projects that you want to mention?

130
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:43,623
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing a lot of small parks projects as well.

131
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:49,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Staff for the past year, year and a half, staff have been meeting with the mayor about once a month.

132
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:51,285
[SPEAKER_00]: to review a long list.

133
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:55,566
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually keep a spreadsheet of about 45 things that we're working on.

134
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:59,667
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those that I've mentioned are on there, but there are others.

135
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:19,492
[SPEAKER_00]: We have consultants working on an underpass under Route 28, over by Stations Landing, so that people, it mirrors the one that goes to Assembly Row, and that, all the consulting engineering work is fully grant funded at this point, and the state has agreed to pay for the construction once it's fully designed.

136
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,553
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one's pretty exciting.

137
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:25,716
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some others that are in design as well.

138
00:11:26,457 --> 00:11:27,878
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have little things.

139
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:32,921
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've heard a lot about basketball courts need to be resurfaced and tennis courts.

140
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:37,624
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as people have probably noticed, we've been just going out there and getting those done.

141
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:42,368
[SPEAKER_00]: We often apply for CPA grants to help pay for those projects.

142
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:48,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a number of locations throughout the city where trees in parks are dying.

143
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:50,493
[SPEAKER_00]: They've reached their lifespan.

144
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:58,938
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the tree warden's been working to identify those, get those removed, and she has funding as well to plant additional trees.

145
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:06,663
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably see those going in in the spring because it's too late this fall to get trees planted as I understand it so far.

146
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:08,644
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we had a freeze last night.

147
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:14,947
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some other things, ADA improvements at Tufts Pool, at Wrights Pond.

148
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:20,170
[SPEAKER_00]: We have federal grant money that we can use for ADA improvements on public facilities.

149
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,350
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been using that as well.

150
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:30,354
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've applied for grants to do a lighting upgrade at La Conte Ice Rink as well.

151
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:35,776
[SPEAKER_00]: And people may have noticed last winter, we actually upgraded all the lights at Tufts Pool to LED.

152
00:12:36,077 --> 00:12:36,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

153
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it seems like you're very busy with all these projects.

154
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,850
[SPEAKER_04]: And is there anything that the community can do?

155
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,933
[SPEAKER_04]: You're asking for input on surveys.

156
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:50,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering about funding, if there's anything the community could do in terms of helping there.

157
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:58,074
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually the type of funding we go after are state and federal grants, and they're on the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

158
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:02,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they ask us about community input and whether we've gotten it.

159
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:10,920
[SPEAKER_00]: When we announce that we're having public meetings, it's actually really helpful to have people turn out for them, because then we can show that the public is interested.

160
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:19,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting email about these parks helps too, because we actually keep track of them all in a spreadsheet so that we know when

161
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:21,346
[SPEAKER_00]: We're applying for grants.

162
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:36,298
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say like we've heard from people that this is not just somebody in an office making a decision The other thing that sounds funny is sometimes residents do know about private grants that are very helpful if it's small if it's like

163
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:45,586
[SPEAKER_00]: $2,500, $5,000, $10,000.

164
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:45,586
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably something that you as a community group could go do, let us know, we'll help you out with it.

165
00:13:46,787 --> 00:13:54,034
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're doing a big renovation, a big project, we're usually looking for numbers that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.

166
00:13:54,734 --> 00:14:02,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you that, so the Riverbend Park Dog Park, that was actually done with a private grant that residents found for us.

167
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:10,208
[SPEAKER_00]: They became aware that there was a foundation that funded dog parks and we got a $250,000 grant from them.

168
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,613
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be grants like that that we may not just have heard of.

169
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:18,736
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are always helpful to hear about as well.

170
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:38,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Also things that fund climate change, we try to keep a pretty close ear to the ground on those because in the parks there's stuff like tree plantings, there's wetlands, there's creating rain gardens, but one of the things that I'm really looking at now is heat impacts of climate change.

171
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:51,268
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are looking at adding spray features and water features, spray parks, and water fountains into our parks, because those are things that we'll need as part of climate change.

172
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:09,402
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows my mind, but a commercial grade water fountain in a park that's hooked up to the water system in a way that's, even if there's already irrigation there, you need certain things to keep that water separated from the irrigation water.

173
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:15,126
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a minimum of $10,000 to install a commercial water fountain at a park.

174
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:38,949
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's I think just helpful for people to have an idea of the scale of the cost because We would love like if somebody said well, I found this private entity that is funding water fountains at grant at parks if it's at least $10,000 per water fountain and I'm definitely interested and if it's like $500 it's it may not really actually help the project.

175
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:39,910
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.

176
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:40,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and

177
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:41,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I appreciate it.

178
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:45,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a lot of transparency and community input around the planning of these parks.

179
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:50,821
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope people can get... I know people are excited, I think, about the changes that are coming.

180
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope people can give you lots of input, too.

181
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:54,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's helpful.

182
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you can put in the show notes on our Go Green page.

183
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:58,709
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a contact us.

184
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:04,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And on there, you can sign up for our newsletter, which we try to send out every three to four weeks about what's going on.

185
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:10,099
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.

186
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Our handle on all of those is GoGreenMedford.

187
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:18,626
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's great to have people follow us and comment on what we're doing.

188
00:16:19,226 --> 00:16:20,908
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be working in isolation.

189
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:29,214
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about seven staff up here that are full-time, and I usually have between five and seven interns working with us at any given time.

190
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:35,239
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like the interns because it brings fresh perspective to what we're doing.

191
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:43,505
[SPEAKER_00]: If they turn over every six months or a year type thing, you have new ideas and new thoughts on how we're doing and what we're doing.

192
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:44,326
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

193
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:50,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to hear about all the community input, and thank you for sharing those ways for people to get more consistently involved too.

194
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:51,412
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

195
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:53,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much for your time today.

196
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:53,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

[SPEAKER_00]: Come back and talk to us anytime.

198
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:58,679
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all kinds of interesting things going on in the city.

199
00:16:58,739 --> 00:16:59,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sounds like it.

200
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

201
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:09,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to Alicia for all this exciting and helpful information.

202
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:18,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to make sure to mention that on November 18th at 6 p.m., the Community Development Board will be hosting a public hearing on Medford's zoning recodification.

203
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:24,645
[SPEAKER_04]: The meeting will take place on Zoom, involving a presentation and discussion of the drafted proposed zoning ordinance.

204
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:33,211
[SPEAKER_04]: As Alicia also mentioned, you can sign up for the newsletter for a comprehensive list of events and updates from the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

205
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Now on to the next interview.

206
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:44,222
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, thank you so much for joining me on the podcast today.

00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:19,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So 3rd grade and 5th grade.

222
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:26,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So guys, I've been asking everybody on the podcast to share their favorite place to eat in Medford and what they like to eat there.

223
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:27,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys have a favorite?

224
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, mine is by far Colleen's ice cream.

225
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:35,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a favorite ice cream flavor?

226
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:36,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookie Monster.

227
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,784
[SPEAKER_01]: or I would also like some ice cream from Colleen's cookie dough.

228
00:18:48,824 --> 00:18:49,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

229
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:50,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard you guys are donut fans, too.

230
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:51,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?

231
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:52,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

232
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:52,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Donuts.

233
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:53,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

234
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:54,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

235
00:18:54,728 --> 00:19:01,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to just ask you a couple questions about kind of what you guys like to do in Medford, what you appreciate about it.

236
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:05,934
[SPEAKER_04]: So I also interviewed someone who was talking to me about the park renovations.

237
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:10,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was wondering if you guys have a favorite park in Medford or what you like about the parks.

238
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:16,927
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite park is Carr Park, which is very close to my house.

239
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:21,792
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been going there my whole life.

240
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:23,154
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like about it.

241
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:27,438
[SPEAKER_01]: My history there and all the fun things there.

242
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also renovating it.

243
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:33,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll talk about that in a second, but I want to see Conrad.

244
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:34,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a favorite park in Medford?

245
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say Card Park too, because there's just a lot of rooms to play sports.

246
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:39,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

247
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:42,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I love playing sports.

248
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:43,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Love sports.

249
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:44,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a favorite sport?

250
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:45,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Football.

251
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:46,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Football, awesome.

252
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:51,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And so yeah, Joe, you mentioned that they're planning to do some renovations to Card Park.

253
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:54,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything you guys would be excited to see change about the park?

254
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:59,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I like the park in general.

255
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:05,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I like all the, um, stuff to play on, to climb on.

256
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:13,346
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just like the big field for playing baseball, football, and the courts for basketball and hockey.

257
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:18,009
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would like to see, um, some hiking trails.

258
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:23,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that there's some area behind Carr Park that they do own.

259
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:25,746
[SPEAKER_01]: and that they can't build on.

260
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:33,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a big hiker, so I would like to see some nice hiking trails back there.

261
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:34,654
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.

262
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, kind of make use of some of the natural space that's already back there.

263
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:38,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

264
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:39,518
[SPEAKER_04]: What about you, Conrad?

265
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:41,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything you want to see added or changed?

266
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,443
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not really, but I want the fields to go away.

267
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:48,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I like playing baseball and, like I said, football.

268
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,671
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to save the fields?

269
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

270
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:50,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

271
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:52,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

272
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:55,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And what other stuff do you guys like doing around the city?

273
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:59,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I like going to the library.

274
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:05,941
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely a big part of living in Medford for me.

275
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:10,644
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very excited for the new library as well.

276
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:14,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we just heard it's going to hopefully open in January.

277
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:14,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

278
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:14,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

279
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,607
[SPEAKER_01]: In January.

280
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:17,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

281
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:23,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all the other many parks in Medford.

282
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:29,702
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Victory Park, there's Carr Park, there's Tufts Park, there's a bunch of ours.

283
00:21:29,962 --> 00:21:35,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's Pleistead Park, Hickey Park, a bunch that I can't remember.

284
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:37,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we do have a lot of parks.

285
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:39,070
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still a lot of parks.

286
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

287
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:41,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And you mentioned you like to hike.

288
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:44,515
[SPEAKER_04]: You like to go to some of the fells, trails in the fells and things like that.

289
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:44,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

290
00:21:46,676 --> 00:22:01,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the library too just because they have fun and games there and I actually got a thing to go earlier because I'm not leaving

291
00:22:02,908 --> 00:22:05,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I also like doing bike rides.

292
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:08,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to get to go to the library before it opens?

293
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for Ice Cream Social.

294
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:11,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow!

295
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:16,933
[SPEAKER_01]: So, during the summer, we both entered a Medford reading contest.

296
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:25,476
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, like, five people that had the most minutes read, and five people that were raffled out,

297
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:37,304
[SPEAKER_01]: get to the end of the contest, got to go into the new library before it opens for an ice cream party and a tour.

298
00:22:38,703 --> 00:22:39,163
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so cool.

299
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:41,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys read a ton of books over the summer.

300
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:44,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and not only that, I got laughed out.

301
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:49,369
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, I probably was one of the top ten.

302
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:55,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get the most minutes read, but I was definitely close.

303
00:22:55,652 --> 00:22:55,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

304
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,033
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a cool competition.

305
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:01,255
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys get to go have ice cream in the new library before anybody else, huh?

306
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:01,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

307
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:02,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's exciting.

308
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:03,957
[SPEAKER_04]: What about other stuff?

309
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:07,959
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys like to do on the weekends or after school if you're not at the parks?

310
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:18,287
[SPEAKER_01]: On the weekends, I like hanging out in my yard with our neighbors who have become our family.

311
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:23,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Just playing football or me sitting on the couch playing Minecraft.

312
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:25,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Minecraft, nice.

313
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:30,636
[SPEAKER_01]: On a rainy day, I would play Minecraft too.

314
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:37,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with my brother, I would also go outside and maybe play some football with my friend Brennan.

315
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:38,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

316
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice shout out to your neighbors.

317
00:23:41,026 --> 00:23:47,830
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've been hearing from a lot of people is like, that they feel a sense of community in Medford and like friends are kind of like family, right?

318
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially during COVID when we've been spending a lot of time with a lot of the same people.

319
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:52,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

320
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:54,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you going to add something?

321
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Brian Bollinger.

322
00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:59,495
[SPEAKER_01]: And Cam.

323
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:00,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks guys.

324
00:24:00,556 --> 00:24:04,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else that you, you know, you feel like is important that you want to share with the people that are listening?

325
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:17,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I definitely want to mention my school and all the great kids there that I have made friends with over the past six years.

326
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:31,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the great programs at my school, like the band, which I do, I play a saxophone, and the winter enrichment classes.

327
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:34,817
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the winter enrichment classes?

328
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't heard about that.

329
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,806
[SPEAKER_01]: They are classes that you can take after school.

330
00:24:42,307 --> 00:24:49,878
[SPEAKER_01]: They cover multiple topics like there's one for Legos and there's one for theater and there's

331
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:53,492
[SPEAKER_01]: One for martial arts and yoga and stuff.

332
00:24:53,712 --> 00:24:54,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

333
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:55,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

334
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:59,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've been, so you're in fifth grade, so you've been at the Roberts for your whole school career so far, right?

335
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

336
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you'll go to middle school next year?

337
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:02,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle school, yeah.

338
00:25:02,824 --> 00:25:03,785
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you feeling about that?

339
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:05,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Very excited.

340
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:09,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any advice for Conrad for the rest of his time at the Roberts?

341
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:10,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you'd tell him?

342
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, play the saxophone.

343
00:25:13,075 --> 00:25:14,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Very fun instrument.

344
00:25:16,717 --> 00:25:29,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, take as many classes as you can, like the band classes and the enrichment and anything else that pops up.

345
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:31,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And

346
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:35,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, don't get too excited for middle school right now.

347
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,251
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not time yet.

348
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:42,371
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a wise advice, Joe.

349
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:44,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Take advantage of what's offered to you.

350
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:49,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you guys have a lot of options and things you can be engaged in in school and outside of school.

351
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:51,095
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Conrad?

352
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:52,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything you want to say to your brother?

353
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:53,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Any advice for him?

354
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:55,736
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not really.

355
00:25:57,577 --> 00:25:57,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

356
00:25:58,635 --> 00:25:59,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything I missed?

357
00:25:59,335 --> 00:26:01,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you guys hoped to talk about today?

358
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,957
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good for me.

359
00:26:04,177 --> 00:26:04,517
