    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=46.423s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=47.986s">We</a>  do have a resident that would like a few minutes to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=51.833s">Give</a>  us an update on what's going on in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=57.216s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=58.596s">Yes,</a>  my name is Farina Buller. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=60.077s">I</a>  live at 9 Alfred Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=62.597s">I</a>  was here a couple weeks ago, and I'd just like to personally thank everybody here for getting this ball rolling in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=70.039s">I</a>  had a positive attitude about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=72.8s">We</a>  got a cease and desist order, and I thought we were gonna give this thing a nice nap and have a nice Christmas, but unfortunately, I have some bad news. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=84.863s">First</a>  of all, nothing has stopped, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=89.284s">They</a>  continually work, and I have the documentation, the videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=93.605s">They</a>  have continually worked for every Saturday since I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=98.666s">I</a>  had the Medford Police come by on a Saturday, December 9th, door wide open, grinding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=106.488s">Councilor</a>  Scapelli here drove by. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=109.809s">Luckily,</a>  he just told me and saw them working on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=114.01s">So</a>  it's been very frustrating, and I know things aren't gonna happen in one day, two days, so I didn't wanna come here a week later. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=121.417s">I</a>  figured I'd wait a week or so and see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=124.499s">Well,</a>  things have gotten progressively worse over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=127.562s">They're</a>  still coming in early in the morning, but now what they do is they park their cars around the other side of the building, because thinking that I don't see any cars there, that they're not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=139.712s">Another</a>  problem I have is I went down to the building commissioner's office today, and what I wanted was some clarification on a cease and desist order, which I looked up in the dictionary, it says stop work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=158.343s">I'm</a>  not an attorney, I'm just saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=160.825s">So</a>  Mr. Mowgli wasn't there, but when I went there today, John Bufuso was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=169.109s">And</a>  I asked him a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=171.291s">My</a>  first question was, do you have a copy of the cease and desist order? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=177.554s">I</a>  don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=178.535s">I</a>  said, well, you know who has it? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=180.396s">He</a>  says, Paul has. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=181.737s">Can</a>  I speak to Paul? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=183.098s">Paul</a>  ain't in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=184.959s">And</a>  then I asked him for some clarification, which, you know, really concerns me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=190.202s">And</a>  he said, Paul isn't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=192.383s">So,</a>  I was a little aggravated at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=195.505s">because</a>  I took time off of my work, not that I get paid millions of dollars, but I took time out of my day to go over it just to get something resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=203.272s">I</a>  went up to the mayor's office, unannounced, which I don't blame her. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=208.096s">She</a>  was in a meeting, sorry, but she couldn't speak to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=210.298s">That's</a>  totally understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=211.279s">I</a>  didn't even expect to see her. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=212.56s">I</a>  just wanted to let her know I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=214.461s">She</a>  was nice enough to have called Mr. Moakley, who I just left the office, wasn't in, came right up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=223.108s">I</a>  tried to get some clarification on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=225.849s">He</a>  couldn't give me a straight answer on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=228.209s">Everything's</a>  kind of like a riddle to me on the answers I got back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=232.57s">One</a>  of the things that really, I need a clarification on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=237.251s">I</a>  have this paper here from the Board of Appeals that was written, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=241.552s">And</a>  I highlighted what it says because I keep getting the wording that, oh, this, even though it was written to Steve Nardone, it's transferable to the tenant who's over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=252.957s">Okay,</a>  and. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=256.074s">With</a>  that being said, I just wanna go back a step. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=260.237s">Mr.</a>  Moakley, in his words, agreed that this company, J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=265.22s">White,</a>  is in violation of doing this type of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=269.043s">Those</a>  are his words, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=271.504s">You</a>  know, this place was supposed to be for parking, for storage, not for industrial, heavy-duty pipe manufacturing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=279.61s">But</a>  with that being said, what really bothered me was it says on the paper here, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=285.033s">It</a>  says, the Board of Appeals also calls the attention of the owner of the application that General Laws Chapter 48, Section 11, the last paragraph, provides that no variance or special permits of any extension, modifications, or renewal, therefore, shall take effect <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=304.035s">until</a>  a copy of the decision bearing the certification of the town within 21 days of it being filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=311.838s">So,</a>  I'm not an attorney, but this pretty much sounds like this isn't transferable, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=320.222s">But</a>  what I'm asking you is why, when I come here in front of you guys, you, excuse me, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=329.103s">in</a>  front of everybody, you gave me the cease and desist order. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=333.626s">Now</a>  Mr. Moakley tells me the cease and desist order was given and he couldn't give me a copy of it, but he said it was no work will be allowed before five o'clock, I'm sorry, before eight o'clock in the morning and not after five o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=349.387s">I</a>  mean, does that sound reasonable? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=352.073s">That's</a>  worse than useless. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=354.137s">Having</a>  somebody that's supposed to be a cease and desist would mean stop work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=357.524s">So</a>  you're saying they can only work between eight and five. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=362.918s">I</a>  don't know what to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=364.179s">You</a>  guys helped me out so much and now I'm up against this here and I don't understand the wording or any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=370.382s">But</a>  it doesn't make no sense to me at all and most importantly I just want to say I have 40 people that I'm representing today that are not here because they don't even know I'm coming today because I don't have time today to go there and see all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=384.67s">But</a>  they all support me and we're all together on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=387.552s">And</a>  it's really aggravating that <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=390.093s">A</a>  company, J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=391.814s">White,</a>  can't find a place, and that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=394.495s">I</a>  said, well when are they coming out? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=395.796s">When</a>  are they leaving? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=396.796s">He</a>  says, well they said by the end of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=398.317s">Do</a>  you have a date? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=399.077s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=399.717s">So</a>  again, we're at hearsay. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=402.098s">They're</a>  supposed to be out at the end of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=404.099s">A</a>  company, J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=405.06s">White,</a>  can't find a place to do a commercial business, heavy pipe manufacturing besides a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=413.043s">I'm</a>  not buying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=414.384s">And</a>  I need all of your support, maybe something we can do to get this resolved, because, you know, we have rights in this town, in this city, and our rights in my neighborhood, a residential neighborhood, are being violated on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=432.194s">And</a>  it's disgraceful, disgraceful, that I have to go down there and argue with somebody down in the building department, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=440.473s">John</a>  Bufuso told me they have a right to work on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=444.337s">I</a>  said, did you read the ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=445.558s">He</a>  goes, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=446.559s">Five</a>  minutes later, I see Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=448.021s">He</a>  says, oh no, they can't work on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=450.523s">I</a>  mean, does the left hand know what the right hand's doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=452.645s">This</a>  is the guy that's been out there five times. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=455.688s">Five</a>  times he's been out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=456.849s">He</a>  hasn't seen any work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=458.491s">Hate</a>  to tell ya, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=460.132s">For</a>  the last two weeks, Winchester Street's been closed off. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=463.374s">No</a>  one can go up there, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=465.435s">And</a>  the problem's on Alfred Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=467.696s">Read</a>  the paperwork, Alfred Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=470.057s">Not</a>  Winchester Street, that's where you enter it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=472.478s">All</a>  the noise is coming out of Alfred Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=475.059s">So,</a>  I'm at wit's end here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=477.28s">I</a>  don't know why a company <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=482.286s">is</a>  coming into a town that did this here to make money, do their pipe work, and get out, that they have no respect for the neighbors, no respect for the city, and why is the city allowing something like this to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=494.039s">I</a>  don't get it, I don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=496.342s">And</a>  if you all could help me in some way, I very much appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=501.88s">Through</a>  the Chair, if I could ask a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=503.602s">Council</a>  Member Crenn. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=504.763s">Through</a>  the Chair, thank you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=507.426s">So</a>  they're working six days a week with the door open, are they still doing work outside?</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=511.89s">Yes,</a>  they're still doing work outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=513.792s">I</a>  have video documentation and I'd just like to make it for the record that Mr. Moakley, I saw him up in the Mayor's office, I wanted to show him the video. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=523.261s">I</a>  said, well they're out there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=525.143s">You</a>  wanna see the video today at 1.30? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=527.164s">Here's</a>  some more grinding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=528.164s">I</a>  mean, I don't wanna have to play this for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=529.985s">I</a>  don't wanna see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=530.845s">Of</a>  course you don't wanna see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=533.426s">You</a>  know, I mean, how can you have a cease and desist order and say they can only work from eight to five? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=543.029s">Does</a>  that sound, seriously, I'm asking you all, does that sound fair or reasonable? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=547.071s">That's</a>  a slap in the face to me and all the other people that signed this paper.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=554.986s">Through</a>  the chair, it seems to me our 40 neighbors that are dealing with this have a right to be very frustrated and to get a date of maybe February.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=565.31s">And</a>  if, not even something, if. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=567.37s">I</a>  said, so did they give you anything in stone? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=569.691s">Well,</a>  they said. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=570.411s">I</a>  go, so that's hearsay, you know, hearsay. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=574.012s">I</a>  mean, they're a big contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=575.753s">I</a>  don't even think they're aware of what's going on, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=578.895s">That's</a>  what I think, because I don't think a company that big would want to be embarrassed so much for making fools out of himself in a city, in a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=587.779s">I</a>  just can't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=589.48s">What</a>  I can believe is down at that building department that someone's not doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=594.383s">How</a>  come he comes by and he sees it, and this guy comes by five times when the road's closed on Winchester Street, and he's never seen nothing? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=602.687s">I</a>  live next door, I'm not even home all day, and when I go home, that's all I see and hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=606.992s">So,</a>  you know, I'm not imagining anything, and neither are all the neighbors, you know?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=615.633s">I'd</a>  be happy to meet you here tomorrow at nine o'clock at the building office and go up there with you with the building inspector.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=620.955s">Well,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=622.755s">I</a>  just want to know that you're well respected by me and I find that everything you've done was being very disrespected and I just wanted you guys to acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=632.719s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=633.58s">If</a>  you'd like to meet me here tomorrow morning when the office opens. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=635.54s">I'd</a>  be there at nine o'clock, no problem.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=637.321s">I'll</a>  meet you there the first thing in the morning and we'll go up there together.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=640.162s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=640.883s">Everybody</a>  have a nice Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=642.124s">Thank</a>  you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=643.145s">I</a>  think we need to get some clarification from ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=646.109s">I</a>  know Paul's responded to me in the last week because I've had some of your neighbors actually call and email with additional complaints, like you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=654.097s">It's</a>  work hasn't stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=655.419s">It's</a>  going on at all hours, inside, outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=659.543s">I</a>  did ask a couple questions to the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=664.945s">He</a>  did answer me back, but you're right, if we ask for a cease and desist, why are they allowed to operate?</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=670.487s">More</a>  importantly, what I'm concerned, can anybody get a clarification on if this ordinance was specifically for Nardone Electric, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=681.011s">And</a>  he doesn't operate the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=684.032s">And</a>  it says right in here, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=686.583s">that</a>  this can't be changed by anything unless it's in 21 days of writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=691.128s">How</a>  is this happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=692.97s">I</a>  don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=693.81s">I</a>  don't get that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=695.692s">I'm</a>  not an attorney.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=696.994s">Maybe</a>  we could give that to our messenger and get an opinion from our city solicitor, and if that's the case, if it's non-transferable, then the permit should be pulled, although we voted to cease and desist on this a couple weeks ago.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=709.732s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Dela Russa. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=713.194s">The</a>  conclusion was reached some weeks ago by the building commissioner that it's not transferable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=718.337s">He</a>  made that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=719.277s">Those</a>  are the grounds under which he's issued the cease and desist. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=722.739s">He's</a>  told me otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=723.7s">So</a>  it would be my... <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=726.602s">uh,</a>  recommendation that, uh, we, uh, require the building commissioner to, uh, pursue this, uh, to the greatest extent, uh, the law allows him, uh, to, uh, uh, deal with it.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=738.873s">I</a>  mean, maybe you can work that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=739.814s">Mr.</a>  O'Rourke, tomorrow morning we'll, uh, get the bottom of it tomorrow morning.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=742.317s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=742.817s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=744.238s">Um,</a>  for now.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=749.543s">I</a>  was confirming with my, I mean supporting my colleague when we talked about getting this to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=755.929s">I</a>  think that the message is clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=758.331s">I</a>  think that we've all spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=760.032s">We</a>  support the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=762.014s">Like</a>  I said, we've seen the work and we've mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=764.356s">So</a>  I think that if we can do that, I know it's great that you can come out here tomorrow, but I think we need our legal team to work with our code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=772.583s">to</a>  make sure both of them are doing what's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=775.325s">And</a>  if we need, then you need to get the chief of police involved and do what needs to be done for those residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=782.59s">I</a>  think it's very important that all three entities are contacted.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=788.653s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=790.394s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=792.296s">I</a>  agree with my colleagues, but I'd like to take it one step further. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=795.758s">I</a>  think we need to create an emergency committee of the whole meeting and meet with the city solicitor, as was mentioned, the building department, John Bavuso, and the building commissioner, Paul Moki, either meet on site or here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=809.908s">I</a>  would prefer that we meet on site, Mr. President, and this needs to take place immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=816.232s">So,</a>  I would ask that <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=818.333s">I</a>  would ask that you set up an emergency meeting, Mr. President, to go on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=823.415s">This</a>  is, as Fran mentioned, this has been going on far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=828.477s">I</a>  thought the cease and desist order, in my opinion, how it's always worked in this city, that stops all work.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=834.98s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=836.0s">That's</a>  why I couldn't understand why you would have a cease and desist from 8 to 5.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=840.902s">And</a>  the reason why you do that is to bring all parties to the table, because once you stop work, Jeff White's going to say, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=848.368s">And</a>  they're going to want to be at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=850.009s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=850.629s">If</a>  you allow them to do business as usual between those hours, because in my opinion, the city didn't do you any favors eight to five.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=858.475s">Oh,</a>  you guys did your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=859.716s">I</a>  just want to tell you, I'm very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=861.357s">And</a>  unfortunately, I waited and I knew it wasn't going to happen overnight, but nothing has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=867.161s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=867.581s">That's</a>  why I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=868.502s">I'm</a>  not here to ruin everybody's day.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=871.245s">And</a>  our job is to make sure the residents have a peace of mind and a quality of life that they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=878.412s">So</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that you call for that meeting immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=882.436s">I</a>  will do that first thing in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=883.677s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=885.519s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=886.44s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=887.862s">Brian,</a>  I thank you for coming down again to give us an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=890.246s">It's</a>  my pleasure, Mr. Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=891.848s">You</a>  live in this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=892.73s">You</a>  experience this on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=894.352s">And</a>  this is a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=896.395s">You</a>  shouldn't be impacted like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=897.577s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=897.877s">And</a>  your neighbors shouldn't either. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=900.481s">You</a>  know, I agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=901.861s">I</a>  think an emergency meeting is called for in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=904.522s">I</a>  mean, this is something that needs to stop, and it needs to stop now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=908.343s">The</a>  questions that I have, and that I would like to hear back, is why were there limitations put on the cease and desist order? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=914.165s">Who</a>  actually put limitations saying between these hours and these hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=918.226s">I</a>  agree with my consul colleague here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=920.047s">Stop</a>  work means stop work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=921.988s">That</a>  means shut it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=924.166s">And</a>  that's what people react, and that's what people come to the table to come up with some sort of a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=929.689s">February,</a>  when did you get to February? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=931.571s">They're</a>  gonna say, well, we'll find a new place by March.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=933.652s">We'll</a>  find a new place by May. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=935.033s">Well,</a>  we've almost got a place, but I'm with you 100%.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=938.315s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=938.775s">So</a>  we need to make sure that the feet are held, put to the fire, and make sure that they find a location, but to also make sure that, you know what, they comply with the law, and to make sure that you actually can live a nice quality life in your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=951.303s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=954.045s">Who</a>  actually put limitations on the stop work order, or the cease and desist order? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=960.388s">And</a>  I also want to find out when it was issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=963.089s">I</a>  know you came down and we actually, Councilman Markson.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=965.53s">It</a>  was issued on a Thursday, two days after the meeting, which was the fifth on a Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=969.592s">I</a>  think it was issued on the seventh. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=971.293s">The</a>  seventh? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=971.653s">The</a>  seventh or the eighth.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=972.714s">If</a>  we can just get confirmation on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=975.815s">But</a>  I do agree, I think a <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=978.596s">Okay,</a>  then I do agree that an emergency meeting is warranted and we should be doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=983.678s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=985.179s">Council</a>  Member O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=986.94s">Through</a>  the Chair, when you say our code enforcement officer, he didn't make it to the site because the street was closed, is that what you're trying to say?</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=995.024s">What</a>  happened was, is I was, exactly, I went down to see when he was going, because I read his, first of all, I didn't call the newspaper, the newspaper called me and I was reading some of his comments in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1009.253s">And</a>  one of his comments were, it's a noise issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1012.435s">It</a>  has a lot more to do with noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1014.076s">This</a>  is one of the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1015.497s">But</a>  I've been there on five separate occasions and I haven't seen any of them working. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1019.719s">So</a>  I went down to get some documentation on what days he was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1024.862s">And</a>  I got like, whoa, I went down, I couldn't get a straight answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1028.406s">But</a>  I can tell you that for the last two weeks on Winchester Street, they've had it shut down except for Saturdays because they're doing all the gas lines there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1036.534s">So</a>  where did he go? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1037.815s">He</a>  couldn't get up Winchester Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1039.617s">If</a>  he went down Alfred Street next to my house, he would see a door wide open with guys there grinding away, you know?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1048.602s">Through</a>  the chair, I think we need to maybe take a vote to cease and desist the business, go on record, all hours of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1059.405s">Just</a>  cease and desist. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1061.586s">We'll</a>  reiterate that we're asking our building department to issue another cease and desist for doing any work on the property, at the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1068.868s">I</a>  don't know what we're going to do on a Saturday morning down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1071.829s">I</a>  think it needs to start tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1073.349s">They</a>  need to be issued a cease and desist, bring them to the table sooner than that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1078.491s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1079.852s">Friend,</a>  if you can give your phone number to Larry. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1082.013s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1082.493s">And</a>  actually, if we can meet tomorrow at 8.30, I'll meet you at 8.30.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1084.694s">I'm</a>  on it like a hornet, I'll be there.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1086.315s">I'll</a>  meet you at 8.30 tomorrow morning at the building department.</p>

    <p>[Obola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1089.436s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1090.476s">Thank</a>  you, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1091.237s">Have</a>  a nice Christmas.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1091.897s">Thank</a>  you, friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1096.019s">All</a>  right, motion to revert back to regular business?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1099.06s">So</a>  moved.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1099.541s">We</a>  have a motion to revert back to regular business.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1123.13s">And</a>  then those who ask that the city solicitor look into the question from the council, like Mr. Pence for our proposal.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1133.511s">Yeah,</a>  you have to get a decision on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1139.11s">because</a>  it's not an emergency.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1205.923s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1208.084s">We</a>  did ask for this resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1211.925s">Back</a>  a few months ago when we were discussing, I brought up the issue of dumping snow near Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1218.973s">We</a>  did get a grant to help alleviate some of that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1222.416s">There</a>  was a number of questions that were attached to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1226.08s">One</a>  was, where have we stored snow as a city? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1229.684s">Where</a>  does the DPW store excess snow? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1233.427s">over</a>  the last three years and maybe amend it with regards to where we plan on storing snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1238.83s">Some</a>  people say we may have a bad winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1240.39s">I'd</a>  like to know where we're going to store excess snow this winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1245.252s">Also,</a>  we never got a response and I know the city solicitor was working on it with regards to the issue concerning Wrights Pond and the grant that was received. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1254.555s">So</a>  if I can amend this paper <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1256.236s">to</a>  also get a response on, so that's my second amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1260.897s">First</a>  would be, where do we store snow? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1264.138s">Where</a>  do we plan on storing snow this year if we do have a bad winter? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1269.44s">And</a>  my second amendment would just be with regards to the issue of accepting a grant for Wrights Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1277.607s">allow</a>  us to still limit Wrights Pond to Medford residents only. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1280.969s">We</a>  were waiting on an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1282.15s">I</a>  know the solicitor has been busy and did say he was going to try to wrap that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1286.713s">So</a>  I'd like to see if we could get an answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1289.235s">The</a>  City of Medford received a grant for work to be done on Wrights Pond and the question which a number of residents have is if we accept that grant <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1300.71s">can</a>  we still limit Rights Pond to Medford residents only? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1303.853s">We</a>  had to give back a grant in prior years before I was a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1307.836s">We</a>  had to give back, I believe it was a state grant, because if we accepted that grant, we'd have to open up Rights Pond to non-residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1317.023s">So</a>  we gave back the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1318.264s">We</a>  had the city cover that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1320.565s">So</a>  now a few residents that were around at that point <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1326.95s">spoke</a>  to me with regards to this grant we just received to make sure we can still limit it because that was an issue over the last year or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1334.077s">Medford</a>  residents fought hard to make sure Rice Pond remained Medford residents only and everybody just wants to make sure that still remains the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1343.625s">So</a>  if we could move approval on this resolution as amended, see if we can get our questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1349.568s">This</a>  is the second or third time we've asked, and I'd like to prepare accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1354.27s">Winter</a>  is coming, we've already had snowfall, and it would be nice to get the questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1358.972s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1411.24s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1414.302s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushman Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1420.524s">I</a>  was hoping if one of you Councilors can or will, one or even better, all four of you or better, could please amend this resolution to ask the question, what's up next door to the Andrews Middle School you're talking? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1439.848s">You're</a>  talking about the Andrews Middle School, are you?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1443.189s">Behind</a>  the Andrews Middle School where the soccer fields are.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1446.81s">Actually</a>  the soccer field itself.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1449.494s">Well,</a>  there was the issue with contamination next to the soccer field. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1453.897s">So</a>  then I requested that because it was so close to the Andrews, that's not a playground, but the Andrews soccer fields, that we do some test pourings at the Andrews soccer field as it abuts where the contamination was. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1468.948s">So</a>  I have not got an answer with regards to what the results of that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1475.272s">And</a>  I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1476.673s">Hundreds</a>  and hundreds of kids play soccer back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1479.222s">It's</a>  something this council voted in favor of, I believe seven to nothing, to do some test pourings there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1484.484s">I'd</a>  like to know what's going on.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1486.105s">I</a>  think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1486.865s">I</a>  think you have very common sense and great courage to ask that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1491.467s">I</a>  would like to ask if you could amend this to add next door to that piece of land, which is bordering behind the Doug Randall School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1507.303s">I</a>  believe that section of land is from the, behind the Doug E. Andrews School to the Medford Riverside Yacht Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1517.976s">And</a>  I believe it has, as I say in the real estate business, a dirty 21E, which means contaminated soil with arsenic, possibly, and other chemicals. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1531.367s">And</a>  it's been cordoned off for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1536.271s">So</a>  I'm not sure what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1539.474s">I</a>  would like to know, because that's the area where they're supposed to finish the half-mile bike path. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1546.654s">from</a>  the Dogger Andrews to Route 93, behind the Salton Stall. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1551.677s">It</a>  does not exist, and that's where I had my bicycle injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1554.559s">I</a>  had my concussion and broken hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1558.442s">So</a>  I would like to get this half mile of bike, flipper ship, bike path connector done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1565.327s">It's</a>  only a half mile, it's not completed out of the 10 or 20 miles from West Method Island to all the way to the MBTA station at Assembly Road, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1577.973s">I</a>  would think it should have been done in the center of the square before to West Bedford Island and also towards McDonald Park and towards Assembly Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1588.204s">The</a>  center of the square does not have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1590.346s">This</a>  has a dirty 21-D, I was told. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1594.29s">And</a>  it's just, it's bordering behind the Doug Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1600.056s">So</a>  if you could ask, if you're gonna ask that question again, I would like for you to amend it and also ask about the bordering area where the kids play soccer.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1611.323s">Through</a>  the Chair, I will make that amendment that we get an update with regards to the contaminated area which abuts the soccer fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1618.026s">That</a>  we did put money into already. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1620.847s">I</a>  don't know if we've got an update recently on that, so if we could get an update to that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1627.831s">That</a>  was proven contamination that I know the city is on top of, although obviously it's moving slowly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1634.834s">But</a>  we did appropriate money to do the first stage that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1638.055s">Hunt</a>  wanted to do, and this came as a <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1641.846s">This</a>  came actually as a request or a condition in order for us to award that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1648.81s">So</a>  hopefully we can get an answer on both.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1650.951s">I</a>  hope you could pass the amendment also. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1653.472s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1654.593s">And</a>  if I may, if it's okay, I'd like to say Merry Christmas.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1659.035s">Merry</a>  Christmas.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1694.923s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1696.804s">With</a>  the changing face of the old Meadow Glen Mall, I've gotten a number of phone calls from constituents concerned about having an inability to access Wegmans because of a lack of handicapped parking spots out in front of that facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1709.112s">They'd</a>  say down at Marshalls and down at Coles there's ample amount of parking, but over in the center of the plaza they're having a difficult time finding some spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1716.077s">So</a>  I'm asking the <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1718.398s">Office</a>  of Diversity and Inclusion, the new name of the diversity office, to take a look at this, Mr. President, and see if they're in compliance with the city ordinance and if we can take any steps to work with Wegmans to put some more spots in closer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1728.727s">That</a>  would be New England Developments? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1730.129s">New</a>  England Developments.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1732.671s">You</a>  want to change that to New England Developments?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1735.213s">Well,</a>  I think that actually what I want them to do is take a look at actual Wegmans and spots accessing actual Wegmans.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1742.98s">So</a>  why don't we contact both of them?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1746.137s">All</a>  right, when the development is actually out there, they, well actually all I want right now is for the Office of Diversity to go out there and see whether or not they're in compliance with our ordinances and if they are, they are, if they aren't, they aren't, then we can take the next step.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1798.5s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1799.581s">I</a>  was actually on the way to work this morning and coming on the on-ramp onto 93 and driving by 101, George P. Hassett Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1809.105s">The</a>  address is 101, but you can see it's the building is boarded up, but in the lower half of the building towards the basement, there is a board. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1818.49s">The</a>  boards have fallen off the building and the windows are broken and the whole bottom half of the building is exposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1825.453s">Anyone</a>  can get in there, kids, homeless people, I mean anyone has access to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1829.735s">So</a>  it's a bit of a safety concern that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1832.736s">So</a>  if we could have the administration reach out to the landlord of that building to have that boarded up immediately, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1840.838s">And</a>  if I could further amend the paper to basically get some sort of an update from the landlord as to <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1848.581s">what</a>  they plan to do with the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1849.742s">I</a>  believe it's going to be a hotel, or at one point we were told it was going to be a hotel, but maybe get an update on the timetable.</p>
