Councilor Longo Kern.

21
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:47,645
Thank you, President Carviello.

22
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:51,472
We do have a resident that would like a few minutes to speak.

23
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,696
Give us an update on what's going on in the neighborhood.

24
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:58,336
Name and address of the record, please.

25
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:00,057
Yes, my name is Farina Buller.

26
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:02,277
I live at 9 Alfred Street in Medford.

27
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:09,179
I was here a couple weeks ago, and I'd just like to personally thank everybody here for getting this ball rolling in the right direction.

28
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,920
I had a positive attitude about this.

29
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:23,403
We got a cease and desist order, and I thought we were gonna give this thing a nice nap and have a nice Christmas, but unfortunately, I have some bad news.

30
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:29,144
First of all, nothing has stopped, okay?

31
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:33,225
They continually work, and I have the documentation, the videos.

32
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:37,406
They have continually worked for every Saturday since I've been here.

33
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:44,908
I had the Memphis Police come by on a Saturday, December 9th, door wide open, grinding.

34
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:49,729
Counselor Scapelli here drove by.

35
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,250
Luckily, he just told me and saw them working on a Saturday.

36
00:01:54,010 --> 00:02:01,397
So it's been very frustrating, and I know things aren't gonna happen in one day, two days, so I didn't wanna come here a week later.

37
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:03,699
I figured I'd wait a week or so and see what's going on.

38
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,022
Well, things have gotten progressively worse over there.

39
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:18,331
They're still coming in early in the morning, but now what they do is they park their cars around the other side of the building, because thinking that I don't see any cars there, that they're not working.

40
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:37,603
Another problem I have is I went down to the building commissioner's office today, and what I wanted was some clarification on a cease and desist order, which I looked up in the dictionary, it says stop work.

41
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:40,324
I'm not an attorney, I'm just saying that.

42
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:48,029
So Mr. Mowgli wasn't there, but when I went there today, John Bufuso was there.

43
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:50,510
And I asked him a few questions.

44
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,953
My first question was, do you have a copy of the cease and desist order?

45
00:02:57,554 --> 00:02:58,155
I don't have it.

46
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:00,356
I said, well, you know who has it?

47
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:01,717
He says, Paul has.

48
00:03:01,737 --> 00:03:03,038
Can I speak to Paul?

49
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:04,078
Paul ain't in right now.

50
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,161
And then I asked him for some clarification, which, you know, really concerns me.

51
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:12,243
And he said, Paul isn't here.

52
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:14,705
So, I was a little aggravated at this point.

53
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:22,671
because I took time off of my work, not that I get paid millions of dollars, but I took time out of my day to go over it just to get something resolved.

54
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:28,076
I went up to the mayor's office, unannounced, which I don't blame her.

55
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:30,258
She was in a meeting, sorry, but she couldn't speak to me.

56
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:31,239
That's totally understandable.

57
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,520
I didn't even expect to see her.

58
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,441
I just wanted to let her know I was there.

59
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:41,367
She was nice enough to have called Mr. Moakley, who I just left the office, wasn't in, came right up.

60
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:44,989
I tried to get some clarification on this.

61
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,749
He couldn't give me a straight answer on anything.

62
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,870
Everything's kind of like a riddle to me on the answers I got back.

63
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,491
One of the things that really, I need a clarification on this.

64
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,912
I have this paper here from the Board of Appeals that was written, okay?

65
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:12,095
And I highlighted what it says because I keep getting the wording that, oh, this, even though it was written to Steve Nardone, it's transferable to the tenant who's over there.

66
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:14,402
Okay, and.

67
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:19,716
With that being said, I just wanna go back a step.

68
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:25,160
Mr. Moakley, in his words, agreed that this company, J.F.

69
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,602
White, is in violation of doing this type of work.

70
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:30,844
Those are his words, okay?

71
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:38,809
You know, this place was supposed to be for parking, for storage, not for industrial, heavy-duty pipe manufacturing.

72
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,353
But with that being said, what really bothered me was it says on the paper here,

73
00:04:45,033 --> 00:05:03,094
It says, the Board of Appeals also calls the attention of the owner of the application that General Laws Chapter 48, Section 11, the last paragraph, provides that no variance or special permits of any extension, modifications, or renewal, therefore, shall take effect

74
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:11,178
until a copy of the decision bearing the certification of the town within 21 days of it being filed.

75
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:19,001
So, I'm not an attorney, but this pretty much sounds like this isn't transferable, okay?

76
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:28,045
But what I'm asking you is why, when I come here in front of you guys, you, excuse me,

77
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:33,006
in front of everybody, you gave me the cease and desist order.

78
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:48,097
Now Mr. Moakley tells me the cease and desist order was given and he couldn't give me a copy of it, but he said it was no work will be allowed before five o'clock, I'm sorry, before eight o'clock in the morning and not after five o'clock in the afternoon.

79
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:51,531
I mean, does that sound reasonable?

80
00:05:52,073 --> 00:05:53,696
That's worse than useless.

81
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:57,043
Having somebody that's supposed to be a cease and desist would mean stop work.

82
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,209
So you're saying they can only work between eight and five.

83
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:03,679
I don't know what to say.

84
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:10,002
You guys helped me out so much and now I'm up against this here and I don't understand the wording or any of this.

85
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:24,370
But it doesn't make no sense to me at all and most importantly I just want to say I have 40 people that I'm representing today that are not here because they don't even know I'm coming today because I don't have time today to go there and see all of them.

86
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,071
But they all support me and we're all together on this.

87
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:28,993
And it's really aggravating that

88
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:31,734
A company, J.F.

89
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:34,075
White, can't find a place, and that's another thing.

90
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,696
I said, well when are they coming out?

91
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:36,476
When are they leaving?

92
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,297
He says, well they said by the end of February.

93
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:38,937
Do you have a date?

94
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:39,277
No.

95
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:41,458
So again, we're at hearsay.

96
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:43,739
They're supposed to be out at the end of February.

97
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:44,980
A company, J.F.

98
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:52,043
White, can't find a place to do a commercial business, heavy pipe manufacturing besides a residential neighborhood.

99
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:53,664
I'm not buying it.

100
00:06:54,384 --> 00:07:11,554
And I need all of your support, maybe something we can do to get this resolved, because, you know, we have rights in this town, in this city, and our rights in my neighborhood, a residential neighborhood, are being violated on a daily basis.

101
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:19,038
And it's disgraceful, disgraceful, that I have to go down there and argue with somebody down in the building department,

102
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,037
John Bufuso told me they have a right to work on a Saturday.

103
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:25,538
I said, did you read the ordinance?

104
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:26,119
He goes, yeah.

105
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,981
Five minutes later, I see Paul.

106
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,862
He says, oh no, they can't work on a Saturday.

107
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:32,625
I mean, does the left hand know what the right hand's doing?

108
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:35,107
This is the guy that's been out there five times.

109
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,829
Five times he's been out there.

110
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:37,850
He hasn't seen any work.

111
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,191
Hate to tell ya,

112
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:43,214
For the last two weeks, Winchester Street's been closed off.

113
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,174
No one can go up there, okay?

114
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:47,215
And the problem's on Alfred Street.

115
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:49,717
Read the paperwork, Alfred Street.

116
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:52,058
Not Winchester Street, that's where you enter it.

117
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:54,279
All the noise is coming out of Alfred Street.

118
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,940
So, I'm at wit's end here.

119
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,322
I don't know why a company

120
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:13,238
is coming into a town that did this here to make money, do their pipe work, and get out, that they have no respect for the neighbors, no respect for the city, and why is the city allowing something like this to happen?

121
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,561
I don't get it, I don't get it.

122
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:20,307
And if you all could help me in some way, I very much appreciate it.

123
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,442
Through the Chair, if I could ask a question.

124
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:24,282
Council Member Crenn.

125
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:26,425
Through the Chair, thank you, President Carviello.

126
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:31,510
So they're working six days a week with the door open, are they still doing work outside?

127
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,692
Yes, they're still doing work outside.

128
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:42,781
I have video documentation and I'd just like to make it for the record that Mr. Moakley, I saw him up in the Mayor's office, I wanted to show him the video.

129
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:44,823
I said, well they're out there right now.

130
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:47,104
You wanna see the video today at 1.30?

131
00:08:47,164 --> 00:08:48,104
Here's some more grinding.

132
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:49,364
I mean, I don't wanna have to play this for you.

133
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:50,725
I don't wanna see it.

134
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:51,925
Of course you don't wanna see it.

135
00:08:53,426 --> 00:09:01,749
You know, I mean, how can you have a cease and desist order and say they can only work from eight to five?

136
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,450
Does that sound, seriously, I'm asking you all, does that sound fair or reasonable?

137
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,712
That's a slap in the face to me and all the other people that signed this paper.

138
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:25,029
Through the chair, it seems to me our 40 neighbors that are dealing with this have a right to be very frustrated and to get a date of maybe February.

139
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,190
And if, not even something, if.

140
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,211
I said, so did they give you anything in stone?

141
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:30,371
Well, they said.

142
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:33,672
I go, so that's hearsay, you know, hearsay.

143
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:35,293
I mean, they're a big contractor.

144
00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:38,595
I don't even think they're aware of what's going on, to be honest with you.

145
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:47,079
That's what I think, because I don't think a company that big would want to be embarrassed so much for making fools out of himself in a city, in a residential neighborhood.

146
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,000
I just can't believe it.

147
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,983
What I can believe is down at that building department that someone's not doing their job.

148
00:09:54,383 --> 00:10:02,367
How come he comes by and he sees it, and this guy comes by five times when the road's closed on Winchester Street, and he's never seen nothing?

149
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:06,632
I live next door, I'm not even home all day, and when I go home, that's all I see and hear.

150
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:10,657
So, you know, I'm not imagining anything, and neither are all the neighbors, you know?

151
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:20,715
I'd be happy to meet you here tomorrow at nine o'clock at the building office and go up there with you with the building inspector.

152
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,215
Well, thank you very much.

153
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:32,199
I just want to know that you're well respected by me and I find that everything you've done was being very disrespected and I just wanted you guys to acknowledge that.

154
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,520
Thank you very much.

155
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,500
If you'd like to meet me here tomorrow morning when the office opens.

156
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,221
I'd be there at nine o'clock, no problem.

157
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:39,822
I'll meet you there the first thing in the morning and we'll go up there together.

158
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:40,823
Thank you very much.

159
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,084
Everybody have a nice Christmas.

160
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:42,825
Thank you for your time.

161
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:46,029
I think we need to get some clarification from ourselves.

162
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:53,777
I know Paul's responded to me in the last week because I've had some of your neighbors actually call and email with additional complaints, like you're saying.

163
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:55,359
It's work hasn't stopped.

164
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:58,342
It's going on at all hours, inside, outside.

165
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:04,205
I did ask a couple questions to the building department.

166
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:10,467
He did answer me back, but you're right, if we ask for a cease and desist, why are they allowed to operate?

167
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:20,571
More importantly, what I'm concerned, can anybody get a clarification on if this ordinance was specifically for Nardone Electric, okay?

168
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:23,452
And he doesn't operate the property.

169
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:25,173
And it says right in here,

170
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:30,787
that this can't be changed by anything unless it's in 21 days of writing.

171
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:32,009
How is this happening?

172
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,470
I don't get it.

173
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,632
I don't get that at all.

174
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:36,753
I'm not an attorney.

175
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:47,965
Maybe we could give that to our messenger and get an opinion from our city solicitor, and if that's the case, if it's non-transferable, then the permit should be pulled, although we voted to cease and desist on this a couple weeks ago.

176
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:51,153
Point of information, Councilor Dela Russa.

177
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:57,977
The conclusion was reached some weeks ago by the building commissioner that it's not transferable.

178
00:11:58,337 --> 00:11:59,237
He made that clear.

179
00:11:59,277 --> 00:12:02,699
Those are the grounds under which he's issued the cease and desist.

180
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:03,680
He's told me otherwise.

181
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,520
So it would be my...

182
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:18,273
uh, recommendation that, uh, we, uh, require the building commissioner to, uh, pursue this, uh, to the greatest extent, uh, the law allows him, uh, to, uh, uh, deal with it.

183
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:19,794
I mean, maybe you can work that out.

184
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:22,297
Mr. O'Rourke, tomorrow morning we'll, uh, get the bottom of it tomorrow morning.

185
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:22,797
Thank you.

186
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:23,538
Thank you very much.

187
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:25,359
Um, for now.

188
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:35,909
I was confirming with my, I mean supporting my colleague when we talked about getting this to the city solicitor.

189
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,311
I think that the message is clear.

190
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:39,652
I think that we've all spoken.

191
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:41,093
We support the neighbors.

192
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:44,316
Like I said, we've seen the work and we've mentioned that.

193
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:52,203
So I think that if we can do that, I know it's great that you can come out here tomorrow, but I think we need our legal team to work with our code enforcement.

194
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,265
to make sure both of them are doing what's right.

195
00:12:55,325 --> 00:13:02,389
And if we need, then you need to get the chief of police involved and do what needs to be done for those residents.

196
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,411
I think it's very important that all three entities are contacted.

197
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:09,434
Vice President Mox.

198
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:11,395
Thank you, Mr. President.

199
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,738
I agree with my colleagues, but I'd like to take it one step further.

200
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:29,547
I think we need to create an emergency committee of the whole meeting and meet with the city solicitor, as was mentioned, the building department, John Bavuso, and the building commissioner, Paul Moki, either meet on site or here at City Hall.

201
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:35,652
I would prefer that we meet on site, Mr. President, and this needs to take place immediately.

202
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,293
So, I would ask that

203
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:43,395
I would ask that you set up an emergency meeting, Mr. President, to go on site.

204
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:47,697
This is, as Fran mentioned, this has been going on far too long.

205
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:54,600
I thought the cease and desist order, in my opinion, how it's always worked in this city, that stops all work.

206
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,620
Exactly.

207
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,122
That's why I couldn't understand why you would have a cease and desist from 8 to 5.

208
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:08,348
And the reason why you do that is to bring all parties to the table, because once you stop work, Jeff White's going to say, what's going on?

209
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:09,929
And they're going to want to be at the table.

210
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:10,529
Exactly.

211
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:18,395
If you allow them to do business as usual between those hours, because in my opinion, the city didn't do you any favors eight to five.

212
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:19,615
Oh, you guys did your job.

213
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:21,217
I just want to tell you, I'm very happy.

214
00:14:21,357 --> 00:14:27,021
And unfortunately, I waited and I knew it wasn't going to happen overnight, but nothing has changed.

215
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:27,461
Nothing.

216
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:28,342
That's why I'm here.

217
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,584
I'm not here to ruin everybody's day.

218
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:37,971
And our job is to make sure the residents have a peace of mind and a quality of life that they deserve.

219
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:42,416
So I would ask, Mr. President, that you call for that meeting immediately.

220
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:43,337
I will do that first thing in the morning.

221
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:44,458
Thank you, Mr. President.

222
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,180
Councilor Falco.

223
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,762
Thank you, Mr. President.

224
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:50,186
Brian, I thank you for coming down again to give us an update.

225
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:51,728
It's my pleasure, Mr. Falco.

226
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:52,690
You live in this neighborhood.

227
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,312
You experience this on a daily basis.

228
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,155
And this is a quality of life issue.

229
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,557
You shouldn't be impacted like this.

230
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:57,857
Absolutely.

231
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:58,879
And your neighbors shouldn't either.

232
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:01,801
You know, I agree with my colleagues.

233
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:04,482
I think an emergency meeting is called for in this situation.

234
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:07,943
I mean, this is something that needs to stop, and it needs to stop now.

235
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:14,065
The questions that I have, and that I would like to hear back, is why were there limitations put on the cease and desist order?

236
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:17,766
Who actually put limitations saying between these hours and these hours?

237
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:19,487
I agree with my consul colleague here.

238
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:21,547
Stop work means stop work.

239
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:22,908
That means shut it down.

240
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:28,849
And that's what people react, and that's what people come to the table to come up with some sort of a resolution.

241
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,551
February, when did you get to February?

242
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:33,612
They're gonna say, well, we'll find a new place by March.

243
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:34,953
We'll find a new place by May.

244
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,995
Well, we've almost got a place, but I'm with you 100%.

245
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:38,755
Exactly.

246
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:51,023
So we need to make sure that the feet are held, put to the fire, and make sure that they find a location, but to also make sure that, you know what, they comply with the law, and to make sure that you actually can live a nice quality life in your neighborhood.

247
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:51,643
Thank you.

248
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:59,847
Who actually put limitations on the stop work order, or the cease and desist order?

249
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:02,769
And I also want to find out when it was issued.

250
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:05,510
I know you came down and we actually, Councilman Markson.

251
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,572
It was issued on a Thursday, two days after the meeting, which was the fifth on a Tuesday.

252
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:11,133
I think it was issued on the seventh.

253
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:11,633
The seventh?

254
00:16:11,653 --> 00:16:12,533
The seventh or the eighth.

255
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,654
If we can just get confirmation on that.

256
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:16,996
But I do agree, I think a

257
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:23,158
Okay, then I do agree that an emergency meeting is warranted and we should be doing that.

258
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:24,099
Thank you.

259
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:26,640
Council Member O'Connor.

260
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,943
Through the Chair, when you say our code enforcement officer, he didn't make it to the site because the street was closed, is that what you're trying to say?

261
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:48,572
What happened was, is I was, exactly, I went down to see when he was going, because I read his, first of all, I didn't call the newspaper, the newspaper called me and I was reading some of his comments in there.

262
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:52,295
And one of his comments were, it's a noise issue.

263
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:54,016
It has a lot more to do with noise.

264
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:55,196
This is one of the problems.

265
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:59,699
But I've been there on five separate occasions and I haven't seen any of them working.

266
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:03,762
So I went down to get some documentation on what days he was there.

267
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:08,126
And I got like, whoa, I went down, I couldn't get a straight answer.

268
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:16,154
But I can tell you that for the last two weeks on Winchester Street, they've had it shut down except for Saturdays because they're doing all the gas lines there.

269
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:17,755
So where did he go?

270
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,317
He couldn't get up Winchester Street.

271
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:26,064
If he went down Alfred Street next to my house, he would see a door wide open with guys there grinding away, you know?

272
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:38,165
Through the chair, I think we need to maybe take a vote to cease and desist the business, go on record, all hours of the day.

273
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:40,785
Just cease and desist.

274
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:48,848
We'll reiterate that we're asking our building department to issue another cease and desist for doing any work on the property, at the property.

275
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,769
I don't know what we're going to do on a Saturday morning down there.

276
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,309
I think it needs to start tomorrow.

277
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:56,650
They need to be issued a cease and desist, bring them to the table sooner than that.

278
00:17:58,491 --> 00:17:58,811
Thank you.

279
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:01,672
Friend, if you can give your phone number to Larry.

280
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:02,473
Yes.

281
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:04,654
And actually, if we can meet tomorrow at 8.30, I'll meet you at 8.30.

282
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:06,134
I'm on it like a hornet, I'll be there.

283
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:09,196
I'll meet you at 8.30 tomorrow morning at the building department.

284
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:09,716
Okay.

285
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:11,177
Thank you, everybody.

286
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:11,877
Have a nice Christmas.

287
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:13,058
Thank you, friend.

288
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:17,920
All right, motion to revert back to regular business?

289
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,521
So moved.

290
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:24,283
We have a motion to revert back to regular business.

291
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:24,863
Mr. Clerk.

292
00:18:24,923 --> 00:18:26,484
The main motion,

293
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:34,548
Council Falco is who put on the limitations on the cease and desist and when was it issued?

294
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:41,809
And amended by Councilor Longo-Pereira is to issue a cease and desist for all hours of operation.

295
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:53,491
And then those who ask that the city solicitor look into the question from the council, like Mr. Pence for our proposal.

296
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:56,312
Yeah, you have to get a decision on that.

297
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,134
because it's not an emergency.

298
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:03,295
It's tomorrow.

299
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:06,999
If we get one tomorrow night, it's tomorrow night.

300
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,320
Okay.

301
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,221
We need to post it.

302
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:09,242
We need like 48 hours, right?

303
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:16,599
I will see if I can get up there.

304
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:17,820
I'll see if I can do it for Thursday.

305
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:18,721
Yeah.

306
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:19,101
Okay.

307
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,282
All right.

308
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:26,708
On the motion by Councilor Longo Kern as amended by Councilor Falco.

309
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:29,670
On the motion by Councilor Falco as amended by Councilor Kern and Councilor Mox.

310
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,230
All those in favor.

311
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:30,671
Motion passes.

312
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,159
Motion to be revert back to regular business.

313
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:55,381
Motion orders and resolutions 17-800 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern.

314
00:19:56,041 --> 00:20:04,603
Be it resolved that the administration update the Memphis City Council on what locations snow has been stored over the last three years.

315
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:05,663
Councilor Langel-Kern.

316
00:20:05,923 --> 00:20:07,504
Thank you, President Carviello.

317
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:11,265
We did ask for this resolve.

318
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:18,492
Back a few months ago when we were discussing, I brought up the issue of dumping snow near Wright's Pond.

319
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:22,396
We did get a grant to help alleviate some of that issue.

320
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,840
There was a number of questions that were attached to that question.

321
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,464
One was, where have we stored snow as a city?

322
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:32,027
Where does the DPW store excess snow?

323
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:38,709
over the last three years and maybe amend it with regards to where we plan on storing snow.

324
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,370
Some people say we may have a bad winter.

325
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,392
I'd like to know where we're going to store excess snow this winter.

326
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:54,495
Also, we never got a response and I know the city solicitor was working on it with regards to the issue concerning Wrights Pond and the grant that was received.

327
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:55,736
So if I can amend this paper

328
00:20:56,236 --> 00:21:00,797
to also get a response on, so that's my second amendment.

329
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:04,038
First would be, where do we store snow?

330
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:08,920
Where do we plan on storing snow this year if we do have a bad winter?

331
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,022
And my second amendment would just be with regards to the issue of accepting a grant for Wrights Pond.

332
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:20,649
allow us to still limit Wrights Pond to Medford residents only.

333
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:22,110
We were waiting on an answer.

334
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,273
I know the solicitor has been busy and did say he was going to try to wrap that up.

335
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:29,215
So I'd like to see if we could get an answer on that.

336
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:40,142
The City of Medford received a grant for work to be done on Wrights Pond and the question which a number of residents have is if we accept that grant

337
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,512
can we still limit Rights Pond to Medford residents only?

338
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:47,776
We had to give back a grant in prior years before I was a counselor.

339
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:56,562
We had to give back, I believe it was a state grant, because if we accepted that grant, we'd have to open up Rights Pond to non-residents.

340
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,244
So we gave back the grant.

341
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:00,125
We had the city cover that money.

342
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:05,489
So now a few residents that were around at that point

343
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:13,356
spoke to me with regards to this grant we just received to make sure we can still limit it because that was an issue over the last year or two.

344
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:22,965
Medford residents fought hard to make sure Rice Pond remained Medford residents only and everybody just wants to make sure that still remains the case.

345
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:29,528
So if we could move approval on this resolution as amended, see if we can get our questions answered.

346
00:22:29,568 --> 00:22:33,889
This is the second or third time we've asked, and I'd like to prepare accordingly.

347
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,892
Winter is coming, we've already had snowfall, and it would be nice to get the questions answered.

348
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:39,292
Thank you.

349
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:46,035
On the motion by Councilor Longo-Curran, as amended by Councilor Longo-Curran, seconded by Councilor Falco.

350
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,315
All those in favor?

351
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:47,935
Aye.

352
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:48,956
Motion passes.

353
00:22:50,382 --> 00:23:00,185
17-801 offered by Council Member Kern, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council receive an update with regards to the test borings and results behind the Andrews School.

354
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:01,545
Council Member Kern.

355
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:03,525
Thank you, President Carviello.

356
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:13,268
This is also with regards to some pollution that was going on on the side of the Andrews soccer fields.

357
00:23:14,388 --> 00:23:20,833
The City Council requested that we also do test pourings, pourings behind the Andrews School.

358
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:28,418
I know that was a condition on the paper that we had approved, so I just wanted to get the results of that and move approval.

359
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:31,180
On the motion by Council Member Kern.

360
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,062
Name and address of the record, please.

361
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:37,365
Andrew Castanetti, Cushman Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

362
00:23:40,524 --> 00:23:58,468
I was hoping if one of you counselors can or will, one or even better, all four of you or better, could please amend this resolution to ask the question, what's up next door to the Andrews Middle School you're talking?

363
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:01,529
You're talking about the Andrews Middle School, are you?

364
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:06,049
Behind the Andrews Middle School where the soccer fields are.

365
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,090
Actually the soccer field itself.

366
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:13,797
Well, there was the issue with contamination next to the soccer field.

367
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:28,928
So then I requested that because it was so close to the Andrews, that's not a playground, but the Andrews soccer fields, that we do some test pourings at the Andrews soccer field as it abuts where the contamination was.

368
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:35,152
So I have not got an answer with regards to what the results of that was.

369
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:36,373
And I think it's important.

370
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:38,735
Hundreds and hundreds of kids play soccer back there.

371
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:44,464
It's something this council voted in favor of, I believe seven to nothing, to do some test pourings there.

372
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,885
I'd like to know what's going on.

373
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:46,845
I think that's great.

374
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:50,947
I think you have very common sense and great courage to ask that question.

375
00:24:51,467 --> 00:25:03,372
I would like to ask if you could amend this to add next door to that piece of land, which is bordering behind the Doug Randall School.

376
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:16,358
I believe that section of land is from the, behind the Doug E. Andrews School to the Medford Riverside Yacht Club.

377
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:30,406
And I believe it has, as I say in the real estate business, a dirty 21E, which means contaminated soil with arsenic, possibly, and other chemicals.

378
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:34,510
And it's been cordoned off for over a year.

379
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:39,454
So I'm not sure what's going on.

380
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:45,579
I would like to know, because that's the area where they're supposed to finish the half-mile bike path.

381
00:25:46,654 --> 00:25:51,157
from the Dogger Andrews to Route 93, behind the Salton Stall.

382
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:54,539
It does not exist, and that's where I had my bicycle injury.

383
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,181
I had my concussion and broken hand.

384
00:25:58,442 --> 00:26:04,666
So I would like to get this half mile of bike, flipper ship, bike path connector done.

385
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:15,934
It's only a half mile, it's not completed out of the 10 or 20 miles from West Method Island to all the way to the MBTA station at Assembly Road, mind you.

386
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:27,683
I would think it should have been done in the center of the square before to West Bedford Island and also towards McDonald Park and towards Assembly Road.

387
00:26:28,204 --> 00:26:29,585
The center of the square does not have it.

388
00:26:30,346 --> 00:26:31,247
This has a dirty 21-D, I was told.

389
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:39,296
And it's just, it's bordering behind the Doug Andrews.

390
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:49,947
So if you could ask, if you're gonna ask that question again, I would like for you to amend it and also ask about the bordering area where the kids play soccer.

391
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:57,686
Through the Chair, I will make that amendment that we get an update with regards to the contaminated area which abuts the soccer fields.

392
00:26:58,026 --> 00:27:00,787
That we did put money into already.

393
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:07,671
I don't know if we've got an update recently on that, so if we could get an update to that as well.

394
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:14,134
That was proven contamination that I know the city is on top of, although obviously it's moving slowly.

395
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:18,015
But we did appropriate money to do the first stage that Ms.

396
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:20,617
Hunt wanted to do, and this came as a

397
00:27:21,846 --> 00:27:28,069
This came actually as a request or a condition in order for us to award that money.

398
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,531
So hopefully we can get an answer on both.

399
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:33,152
I hope you could pass the amendment also.

400
00:27:33,472 --> 00:27:34,173
Thank you very much.

401
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:38,315
And if I may, if it's okay, I'd like to say Merry Christmas.

402
00:27:39,035 --> 00:27:39,516
Merry Christmas.

403
00:27:39,536 --> 00:27:40,956
Have a good New Year to everybody else.

404
00:27:41,897 --> 00:27:42,257
Thank you.

405
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:49,621
On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kern, as amended by Councilor Lungo-Kern, seconded by.

406
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:50,402
Second.

407
00:27:51,728 --> 00:27:53,649
Councilor Scott Pelli, all those in favor?

408
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,310
Aye.

409
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,671
Motion passes.

410
00:27:55,691 --> 00:28:13,342
17.802 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Office of Diversity and Inclusion conduct an assessment of the number of the handicapped parking spots accessing Wakeman's and provide the council with its findings.

411
00:28:13,382 --> 00:28:14,143
Councilor Knight.

412
00:28:14,923 --> 00:28:16,284
Mr. President, thank you very much.

413
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:28,412
With the changing face of the old Meadow Glen Mall, I've gotten a number of phone calls from constituents concerned about having an inability to access Wegmans because of a lack of handicapped parking spots out in front of that facility.

414
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:35,356
They'd say down at Marshalls and down at Coles there's ample amount of parking, but over in the center of the plaza they're having a difficult time finding some spots.

415
00:28:36,077 --> 00:28:36,957
So I'm asking the

416
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:48,687
Office of Diversity and Inclusion, the new name of the diversity office, to take a look at this, Mr. President, and see if they're in compliance with the city ordinance and if we can take any steps to work with Wegmans to put some more spots in closer.

417
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,828
That would be New England Developments?

418
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,651
New England Developments.

419
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:54,032
You want to change that to New England Developments?

420
00:28:55,213 --> 00:29:00,538
Well, I think that actually what I want them to do is take a look at actual Wegmans and spots accessing actual Wegmans.

421
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,602
So why don't we contact both of them?

422
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:17,081
All right, when the development is actually out there, they, well actually all I want right now is for the Office of Diversity to go out there and see whether or not they're in compliance with our ordinances and if they are, they are, if they aren't, they aren't, then we can take the next step.

423
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,783
All right, the motion by Councilor Knight.

424
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:24,384
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

425
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:25,185
All those in favor?

426
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:25,605
Aye.

427
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:27,165
Motion passes.

428
00:29:28,646 --> 00:29:29,326
Motion to take.

429
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:36,721
A motion by Councilor Del Rosso to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

430
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:37,561
All those in favor?

431
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:38,282
Aye.

432
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:39,263
Motion passes.

433
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:43,166
Offered by Councilor Falco.

434
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:56,819
Be it resolved that the administration contact the owner of 101 George P. Hassett Drive to have them board up the open windows on the property in the interest of public safety.

435
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:57,880
Councilor Falco.

436
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,420
Thank you, Mr. President.

437
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:07,484
I was actually on the way to work this morning and coming on the on-ramp onto 93 and driving by 101, George P. Hassett Drive.

438
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:18,149
The address is 101, but you can see it's the building is boarded up, but in the lower half of the building towards the basement, there is a board.

439
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:25,093
The boards have fallen off the building and the windows are broken and the whole bottom half of the building is exposed.

440
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:29,715
Anyone can get in there, kids, homeless people, I mean anyone has access to it.

441
00:30:29,735 --> 00:30:32,315
So it's a bit of a safety concern that needs to be addressed.

442
00:30:32,736 --> 00:30:40,718
So if we could have the administration reach out to the landlord of that building to have that boarded up immediately, I'd greatly appreciate it.

443
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:46,881
And if I could further amend the paper to basically get some sort of an update from the landlord as to

444
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:49,722
what they plan to do with the building.

445
00:30:49,742 --> 00:30:55,324
I believe it's going to be a hotel, or at one point we were told it was going to be a hotel, but maybe get an update on the timetable.

446
00:30:55,884 --> 00:30:56,084
Thank you.

447
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:56,465
Thank you.

448
00:30:57,405 --> 00:31:01,747
The motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

449
00:31:01,787 --> 00:31:02,687
Seconded.

450
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:03,988
By Councilor Knight.

451
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:04,648
All those in favor?

452
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:05,088
Aye.

453
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:06,369
Motion passes.

454
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,930
I regret I passed over something on the agenda.

455
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:09,970
17-799.

456
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:24,449
Report of the Committee of the Whole meeting December 12, 2017 to review or discuss fiscal year 2018 real estate tax allocation.

457
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:27,750
Motion to accept the committee report, Mr. President.

458
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:34,811
Motion by Councilor Dela Russo to accept the report, seconded by Councilor Knight.

459
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:35,972
All those in favor?

460
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:36,052
Aye.

461
00:31:36,832 --> 00:31:37,852
Motion passes.

462
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:43,471
I'm sorry?

463
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:50,088
I have one more.

464
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:50,528
Okay.

465
00:31:52,149 --> 00:32:04,832
Offered by the entire council, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Joanne Abbott, who recently lost her battle with cancer.

466
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:12,294
Joan was a longtime City Hall employee and worked for the registrar of voters and later for the building department.

467
00:32:13,054 --> 00:32:17,215
She will be missed in this building and throughout the community.

468
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:21,276
and if we could rise for a moment of silence in her honor.

469
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,929
Councilor Knight.

470
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:43,671
Mr. President, looking at the agenda here, we have paper 17590, 17433, 17606.

471
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:53,214
They're all going to be due for their reviews, whether it be a 60-day or a 180-day or a 90-day review for signage, Mr. President.

472
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:55,215
Our December 26th meeting is canceled.

473
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:58,456
I'd ask that we mark these up for this January 9th meeting.

474
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:06,298
Okay, on the motion, Councilor Knight, that we mark these three papers up for the January 9th meeting.

475
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:10,279
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

476
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:10,639
Second.

477
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:12,739
By Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

478
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:13,399
Aye.

479
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,219
Motion passes.

480
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:19,241
Mr. Clerk, if you could please make that recommendation for the thing.

481
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:21,741
Do you want these individuals to appear?

482
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:23,862
Yeah, yes.

483
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:25,342
No, they don't have to again.

484
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:34,104
I don't want to belabor our time here, Mr. President, and thank you for this indulgence.

485
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:44,827
The mayor had appointed me some months ago, weeks ago, to represent, to be one of the representatives of the community to the ongoing Green Line Extension Project.

486
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:47,729
The project is entering a new phase.

487
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,312
They're due to begin construction in the near future.

488
00:33:52,973 --> 00:34:02,279
This will be a process that I think will unfold over the next two years as far as working on the station, the tracks, the rail beds.

489
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,802
In many ways, construction and pre-construction has already begun.

490
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:20,107
We met with the project manager from the MBTA, the assistant manager and many of the community outreach people, and representatives from Medford, Somerville, Cambridge, and related constituencies.

491
00:34:21,188 --> 00:34:35,173
I'll continue to keep the community up to date, and I'm going to continue to urge the mayor to find resources available on behalf of the administration and the citizens of the community.

492
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:46,319
to have trained representatives and people who are adept at development and planning issues at the table with us.

493
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,920
This is going to be a project.

494
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:58,005
I urge people if they wish to reach out to me by email to do so if they have any concerns about the project as it moves forward.

495
00:34:58,825 --> 00:35:12,870
As far as accessibility, issues around the structures and material of the construction, and also urge people to make their opinion known to the mayor's office as well.

496
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,372
We had representatives also from citizens present.

497
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:42,497
Lal Ruma, who is a citizen, an abider to the tracts, has been active for nearly 10 to 12 years in this process, is a member of the committee, and also present and someone who's been a long-time leader and advocate for the Green Line Extension, and someone who brings expertise and reason to all the processes can

498
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,738
Kraus, also a Medford resident.

499
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:52,762
So it was good to have them there with us, and representing and speaking on behalf of the citizens.

500
00:35:53,142 --> 00:36:00,526
And hopefully as this project moves on, we'll get the best product available for the people of Medford.

501
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:05,249
Thank you, Councilor Del Rosso, for your hard work on that project.

502
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:07,612
So, Mr. President?

503
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:09,193
Vice President Marks.

504
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,394
If I could ask Councilor Del Rosario a question.

505
00:36:12,814 --> 00:36:16,215
There are three representatives on this Green Line extension?

506
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:16,635
Yes.

507
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:20,257
And they are Ken Kraus, yourself, and Laurel Ruma?

508
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:21,217
Nope.

509
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:30,960
Myself, Laurel Ruma, the three appointees from the mayor, myself, Laurel Ruma, and Rocco DiRico of Tufts University.

510
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,742
And that organization is a major stakeholder as the

511
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:42,272
uh, station, the Medford station, uh, is in the midst of their properties.

512
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:42,653
Right.

513
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:53,280
So, so Mr. President, we, we did have, uh, other residents that sat on this committee, uh, the first phase of the Green Line extension, um, of which,

514
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,901
Doug Carr and Jim Silva were not asked to be back on the Greenland Extension Committee.

515
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:11,903
And one was replaced by Rocco Dorico, I've known for a lot of years, and he does tremendous work, but he's representing Tufts University and not representing the city of Method.

516
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:23,225
And I have a concern when you only have three representatives on a committee that are here to represent the city, and of which one represents Tufts University.

517
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:33,908
Doug Carr, who was also on the committee, was a representative and the chairman of all the communities when they had host meetings.

518
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:51,912
Doug Carr was the chairman and a very knowledgeable person, as well as Jim Silva, who represented the South Meffitt area through SMARTO and so forth, and was instrumental, and still is instrumental, in passing information out to residents and neighborhood in this community.

519
00:37:52,552 --> 00:38:02,220
And I think it's a huge loss not to have those two gentlemen reappointed on this committee, Mr. President.

520
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:13,209
And I would ask that the mayor reconsider the members of this committee and look at reappointing Doug Carr and Jim Silva back to the committee.

521
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:13,689
The President.

522
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,790
Expanding the committee?

523
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:17,252
Whatever needs to be done, Mr. President.

524
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,214
But to have one person that doesn't

525
00:38:20,955 --> 00:38:24,178
represent the city on the board of three.

526
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:34,987
To me, there are plenty of other people that have been active for years on this Green Line extension and have taken countless hours out of their schedule to attend these meetings.

527
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:47,029
I know we have Councilor DelaRusso on the committee, and I look forward to, you know, information being dispersed to the Council regarding the Green Line extension.

528
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:59,872
But knowing that Doug Carr and Jim Silva were so instrumental in disseminating information and being involved, I'm extremely disappointed in the Mayor not including them in this second phase, Mr. President.

529
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:02,343
Mr. Vice President.

530
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:16,495
The motion by Vice President Box that Jim Silver and Doug Cobb be added to the Green Line Committee to be sent to the mayor for her consideration.

531
00:39:20,718 --> 00:39:21,259
Councilor Knight.

532
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:25,943
Do you know if these individuals had a willingness to continue to serve in their positions?

533
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:35,654
Both expressed interest in written letters stating that they'd like to serve.

534
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,635
They sent those letters to the mayor?

535
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:38,835
Well in advance, yes.

536
00:39:39,316 --> 00:39:42,377
Do we know if there are any other individuals in the community that have expressed some interest?

537
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:43,718
I would not know that.

538
00:39:44,418 --> 00:39:48,220
If any other individuals are going to make recommendations, maybe we'd want to take a look at everybody.

539
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,301
It's not up to us to take a look at anyone.

540
00:39:51,461 --> 00:40:02,145
I'm just throwing out there the fact that we had two people sitting on this that did yeoman's work on behalf of the residents of this community, and I expressed my disappointment that they weren't reappointed.

541
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:02,765
That's all.

542
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:04,026
Thank you.

543
00:40:04,546 --> 00:40:14,770
I shared my information, and I didn't have this as a resolution, nor did I request a motion, but to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

544
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:17,384
Council Member O'Karyn.

545
00:40:17,904 --> 00:40:18,185
Thank you.

546
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:32,099
Through the Chair, I think we should just request that the Mayor look into expanding the committee and hopefully open up applications to those who are interested and hopefully those that have been working so hard and going to meetings will apply.

547
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,942
On the motion.

548
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:38,801
She should expand the committee.

549
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:40,403
I mean, a bigger committee, the better.

550
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:47,955
More people that can serve in different capacities on a committee that is working on the green line, the better.

551
00:40:48,536 --> 00:40:50,479
You should have somebody, obviously, too, from the neighborhood.

552
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,801
There's so many people that

553
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:57,144
probably want to be on this committee, so I request that we look into expanding this committee.

554
00:40:57,964 --> 00:41:07,207
On the motion by Vice President Box that we request that the Mayor expand the Green Line Committee, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

555
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:07,987
All those in favor?

556
00:41:09,128 --> 00:41:09,988
Motion passes.

557
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:13,743
Do we have any further business this evening before we adjourn?

558
00:41:14,363 --> 00:41:15,724
Happy holidays to everybody.

559
00:41:16,444 --> 00:41:32,070
Hearing and seeing none, I think on behalf of all my city council colleagues and everyone in the building, I wish everybody a merry Christmas, a happy Hanukkah, happy holidays, and a safe new year.

560
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,511
Before the records are called.

561
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:37,954
Will the records are called if I may?

562
00:41:37,974 --> 00:41:42,676
I just want to let the public know that there is a public hearing notice City of Medford Community Development Board for February 7, 2018.

563
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,798
They shall conduct a public hearing on February 7, 2018 at 6 p.m.

564
00:41:44,818 --> 00:41:45,338
in room 201 City Hall.

565
00:41:58,462 --> 00:42:11,993
The hearing is relative to a petition by the Medford City Council to amend Chapter 94 Zoning, Article 2, Division 1, Section 9435E by adding language in the fifth line after the word enumeral Section 2 as follows.

566
00:42:12,593 --> 00:42:23,081
And such notice shall also be given to all owners within 400 feet of the property line of a petitioner, as the same are listed in the most recent tax list as kept by the city assessor of the city.

567
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:41,818
In such notice shall also be given to owners within 400 feet of the property line of the petitioner as the same are listed in the most recent tax list as kept by the chief assessor of the city by way of a telephone call or text message that uses a computerized auto dialer to deliver a pre-recorded message or its equivalent.

568
00:42:42,118 --> 00:42:46,603
A copy of the full text of the amendment is available at the office of the city clerk, city hall.

569
00:42:47,343 --> 00:43:03,613
And I know that Clerk Finn did get the language that our city solicitor helped us draft last week, so our resolve was amended to state that the city council suggest or recommend that a planning board discuss a viable alternative for the applicable ability

570
00:43:04,193 --> 00:43:15,276
of this expanded notification such as applying to any projects that are subject to site plan review or conversion of housing units more than presently exist.

571
00:43:15,797 --> 00:43:20,118
So I thank our city solicitor for his hard work on this and helping us last week.

572
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:27,480
Thank the Community Development Board for holding a meeting on February 7th and hopefully this is posted and advertised.

573
00:43:28,312 --> 00:43:34,137
I'd like to just put a motion out that a reverse 9-1-1 call go out with regards to this meeting if possible.

574
00:43:34,157 --> 00:43:38,420
I think it's an extremely important meeting and the public should be aware of it.

575
00:43:39,928 --> 00:43:47,752
On the motion by Council Member Kern that a 9-1-1 reverse call goes out for the February 7th meeting.

576
00:43:47,832 --> 00:43:48,552
All those in favor?

577
00:43:48,872 --> 00:43:48,952
Aye.

578
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:50,173
Motion passes.

579
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:56,536
Records of the meeting of December 12th, 2017 were passed to Council Member Kern.

580
00:43:56,596 --> 00:43:58,837
Council Member Kern, how did you find those records?

581
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:01,278
I reviewed the records and I find them in order and I move approval.

582
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:02,478
Second.

583
00:44:03,419 --> 00:44:08,301
On the motion by Councilor Crandell that she file the records in order.

584
00:44:08,401 --> 00:44:09,922
Seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

585
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:11,503
Motion passes.

586
00:44:11,763 --> 00:44:13,804
Again, happy holidays to everyone.

587
00:44:13,824 --> 00:44:15,505
Merry Christmas.

588
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:19,446
Merry Christmas to all my councilors and people in the city.

589
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:21,067
Motion to adjourn by Councilor Nye.

590
00:44:21,648 --> 00:44:22,768
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

591
00:44:22,848 --> 00:44:23,849
All those in favor, aye.

592
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:25,890
Motion passes.

593
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,550
Merry Christmas.
