1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:03,054
I'm going to read the Governor's statement and then we'll jump right into the regular meeting.

2
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:12,802
On March 29, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a Supplemental Budget Bill, which, among other things, extends the temporary provisions pertaining to the Open Meeting Law to March 31, 2025.

3
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:22,231
Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at a meeting location.

4
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:26,099
and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

5
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:39,162
The language does not make any substantive changes to the open meeting law other than extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings to March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

6
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:50,064
So for those of you who are following along, if you go to medfordhistoricalcommission.org, you can see in the news section that we posted meeting materials.

7
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:51,125
They should be up online.

8
00:00:53,365 --> 00:01:00,287
If you have any comments, you can certainly email them to us or you can participate in the meeting here or remotely.

9
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,508
It is being broadcast, I believe, on Metro Community Media.

10
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:12,231
So with that being said, we'll go right into the first agenda item, which is the determination of significance for 38 Pearl Street.

11
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:17,352
We received an application for the partial demolition of the rear

12
00:01:17,472 --> 00:01:18,092
of the building.

13
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:26,715
So commissioners, I sent around the MHC Form B and Form A. So we will be determining significance tonight.

14
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:30,436
Just as a reminder for what that is, because we have another determination.

15
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:45,900
Determining significance is any building or portion thereof which is not in a local historic district subject to the regulations of MGL 40C, but which has been listed or is subject to pending listing on the National Register.

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:02:06,555
has been listed on the Massachusetts Register of Historic Places or was built 75 years or older, which is determined by the commission to be significant either because it is importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events or with the broad architectural, cultural, political, economic, or social history of the city or the Commonwealth,

17
00:02:07,636 --> 00:02:19,265
or it is historically or architecturally important in terms of period, style, method of building construction, or its association with an important architect or builder, either by itself or in the context of group of buildings.

18
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:26,831
So commissioners, with that being said, I will be happy to start the dialogue with a motion on significance and then we'll go from there.

19
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,516
I'll make a motion to find for significance.

20
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:35,178
And a second.

21
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:37,325
I'll second.

22
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:39,947
Is that all, Annie?

23
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:40,668
Yes.

24
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:41,909
OK.

25
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:42,990
Second.

26
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,670
Perfect.

27
00:02:44,451 --> 00:02:45,572
Jen, OK, we'll start with you.

28
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:52,914
Um, yeah, so I think on this one, uh, significance is certainly warranted.

29
00:02:52,934 --> 00:03:01,244
It's a pre, uh, 1900 structure, obviously an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Greek revival.

30
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:06,871
Um, and also with the recommendation of it being in a national register.

31
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:15,918
criteria here that the consultant has recommended for two categories, not just one.

32
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:23,183
So I think all of those three things together, I think certainly checks the box for significance.

33
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:24,704
Great.

34
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:25,945
Thank you.

35
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:26,886
Eleni?

36
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:31,979
Yeah, I'm going to agree with Jen.

37
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:41,868
I think the fact that the building still retains much of its architectural character and integrity warrants its significance.

38
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:47,733
And I don't really have much to add beyond that.

39
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:50,895
It's just I support the determination of significance.

40
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:53,638
Great.

41
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:55,119
Kit, I see you next, so we'll go to you.

42
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,673
I agree with Jen and Eleni.

43
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:06,394
I mean, this one seems to me to be sort of a pretty clearly significant.

44
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:10,736
Great.

45
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:12,797
And Peter?

46
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,319
Peter, you're next.

47
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:19,959
Sorry.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,601
I don't have anything further to add to the previous commissioners.

49
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,682
I think it's a well-preserved example.

50
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:30,657
This one's actually kind of a no-brainer for significance for me.

51
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:35,959
And Doug, I know you just signed back on.

52
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:40,040
We talked about significance, if you want to add your thoughts.

53
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,240
I do.

54
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,741
I caught the end of what Peter said, and I kind of agree with him.

55
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:49,103
This won't be as just chock full of stuff that we don't see on most of these houses.

56
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,403
It's not a close call for me.

57
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:55,845
It's got a lot of integrity, and I think it's definitely worth

58
00:04:56,888 --> 00:05:01,995
For the 2nd, look and see if we can see if we can do something with this.

59
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,156
I don't know what the plan is.

60
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:06,861
I haven't looked at the drawings, but this 1 is definitely something we want to take a hard look at.

61
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:16,785
Okay, we can talk about the plan after we've discussed integrity of the building.

62
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,267
I think that's important.

63
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:25,373
So, okay, with that being said, commissioners that I don't, you know, I think you guys have said it all.

64
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:31,178
So, if you want to, if we don't have anything else, I'll go right into the roll call.

65
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,794
And seeing none, I will call you as I see you.

66
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:44,781
So the motion was made to determine significance in favor of significance made by Jen and seconded by Eleni.

67
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:46,603
So I'll start with Kit, because I see you first.

68
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:48,965
Yes, for significance.

69
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:49,545
Yep.

70
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:50,366
And Pierre?

71
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:51,366
Yes.

72
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:52,367
And Eleni?

73
00:05:52,948 --> 00:05:53,228
Yes.

74
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:54,249
And Doug?

75
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,543
Nope, nothing.

76
00:05:58,603 --> 00:05:59,903
I think he's frozen.

77
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,024
Yeah, I think he is frozen.

78
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:02,384
Jen?

79
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:03,104
Yes.

80
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,465
Oh, yeah, I got Doug.

81
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,085
Thank you, Doug.

82
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:07,045
And Jen?

83
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:08,585
Yes, for significance.

84
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:10,746
Okay, five to zero, pass.

85
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:12,066
Pass.

86
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:12,706
I am here.

87
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:15,126
Oh, Ed, I saw you.

88
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:16,187
I missed you there, yes.

89
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,707
And I will vote aye.

90
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,287
Yeah, my camera is acting out.

91
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:20,127
Okay.

92
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,028
And Ed, yes, down there.

93
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:22,828
Sorry, Ed.

94
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,449
Ed, did you have anything else to add for significance?

95
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,309
Sorry, I missed you.

96
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:31,149
No, no, no, I was getting myself rebooted.

97
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:34,352
So I will rest on the architects for now.

98
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:35,072
Okay.

99
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:36,373
Thank you.

100
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:44,439
We will be going into a hearing for this property because the owners wanted to move this process along.

101
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,104
So they went ahead and posted the legal ad for the hearing as well as the sign at the site.

102
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:55,888
So as soon as we finish with 68 to 70 buildings that will return to this and have the hearing.

103
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:05,705
So, um, for 68 to 70 buildings, we received an application for demolition of the building.

104
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:07,466
It's gonna be altered beyond recognition.

105
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:11,669
Um, Jen was kind enough to send out the MHC form B and with the packet.

106
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,073
So as soon as we accept the application, we can move forward with the determination of significance.

107
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:20,977
So commissioners, I'll take a motion to accept the application or not.

108
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:24,840
I'm accepted.

109
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:26,788
Go ahead, sorry.

110
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:27,549
Sorry.

111
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:29,229
Second.

112
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,532
Okay.

113
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:34,752
Peter Miller, second.

114
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:35,352
Okay, thank you.

115
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,494
So I'll go around and do roll call vote.

116
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:38,814
Kit?

117
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:42,356
Yes.

118
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,036
Peter?

119
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:43,976
Yes.

120
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:44,897
Eleni?

121
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:47,798
Yes.

122
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:48,439
Doug?

123
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:49,219
Yes.

124
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:49,879
Ed?

125
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,741
Accept as a form.

126
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:53,281
Yep.

127
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:53,801
And Jen?

128
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:54,982
Yes.

129
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:56,932
60 approved.

130
00:07:58,034 --> 00:08:00,356
OK, now I need a motion for significance.

131
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:04,361
Or not.

132
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,692
I'll make a motion to find for significance.

133
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:15,955
Second.

134
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:21,037
Okay, I'll go around.

135
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:24,739
I will begin by hearing comments.

136
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,280
Jen, you made the motion, so go ahead if you want to start dialogue on significance.

137
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,080
Sure.

138
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:39,784
I'm actually struggling a little bit with this one, because I think we can all agree that, you know, we see

139
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,793
you know, kind of little compact two families like this all over the city.

140
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:48,696
Certainly this is a nice example.

141
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:57,022
So on one hand, I wanna say it's not, you know, so unique that it needs to be saved.

142
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:09,952
On the other hand, I was a little thrown by the recommendation for a national register criteria on this one, but I can understand why, because it is a, you know, really nice example.

143
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:14,936
here and it's in this lovely kind of South Medford location.

144
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:18,899
So I'd be curious to hear what some of the other commissioners think.

145
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:22,422
And also just wanted to point out, this is only a partial demo.

146
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:30,928
They do want to change the roof line, which I think would significantly kind of alter the look of the house.

147
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,551
So I'm just a little on the fence.

148
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:38,234
So I'd love to kind of hear what everybody else has to say on this one.

149
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:42,595
All right, I'll go next.

150
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,116
I think I seconded, so let me jump in here.

151
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:50,617
I actually, even though I said for significance, I don't intend to vote that way.

152
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:56,338
This property, I just don't think it has enough character.

153
00:09:57,018 --> 00:10:06,540
Maybe it did at one time, I'm not sure, but there's been a lot lost, and there's a lot of two families in Medford that I would fight pretty hard for, but this is just not one of them.

154
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,740
I think actually with the addition, if done right,

155
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:15,096
could make this building more interesting and be an interesting re-imagination of this one.

156
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,297
I'm on the other side, at least right now.

157
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:23,899
That's my preference based on what I see based on the form B. I don't see the district's potential here.

158
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,919
I disagree with the form B a little bit.

159
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,641
This part is heading towards Mystic Ave.

160
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,941
It's becoming pretty

161
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:40,167
Pretty, pretty less less neighborhood and more kind of industrial almost.

162
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:43,989
So, I, I think the context is a transition.

163
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:45,970
So, I think let's just.

164
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,792
I don't, I just don't see the, this 1 is something I'm going to plant the flag for.

165
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:56,635
Thanks, I'll go to your next.

166
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:00,709
Yeah, I agree with Doug.

167
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:07,635
I feel like I can point to this house on pretty much every block in the city.

168
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:14,460
But the one thing that's, I mean, I too was tripped up by the recommendation for the national registry.

169
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:24,228
But the one thing that I did wonder about was sort of if altering this alters the neighborhood.

170
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:28,583
in the cityscape of the neighborhood.

171
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:34,205
But it sounds, Doug, from what you're saying is that this is already in a pretty transitional area.

172
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:39,827
I think it depends on, and I haven't looked at the design, so I can't really say.

173
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:47,550
I think a streetscape look at this building would be worthy, because most of the buildings in this neighborhood seem like they're of this scale.

174
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,911
But I haven't walked the street.

175
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:51,572
I haven't really looked at it critically.

176
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:54,273
So I think it's an open question in my mind, Kit.

177
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:00,664
Thanks Peter next.

178
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:05,128
Uh, yeah, I'm I'm of like mind.

179
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:05,968
I think, um.

180
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:14,516
I didn't find anything I feel like most of the detail on this house has been.

181
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:21,782
And also was somewhat surprised that I think it I think it said.

182
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:28,529
eligible for a historical registry only in the case of a district.

183
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,750
It's strictly a district.

184
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:32,291
Yeah.

185
00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:43,956
I agree that the neighborhood is in transition, so yeah, I'm in agreement with the other questioners there.

186
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:47,658
Just going to look at Google Maps here.

187
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:50,279
Thanks, Peter.

188
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:50,759
Anna Lenny?

189
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:56,002
Yeah, I think I'm in agreement with everyone that it's not.

190
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:02,464
I think it's been stripped down and altered so much that a lot of its character is gone.

191
00:13:02,664 --> 00:13:08,486
What would have made it eligible for the listing, an individual listing is gone.

192
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:15,069
And the new proposal is still to keep it as a multifamily.

193
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:20,931
So it's not taking away any housing units, which I think are desperately needed.

194
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:30,343
So yeah, I don't really see the need to determine it as historically significant.

195
00:13:30,403 --> 00:13:31,344
I just don't think it's there.

196
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,645
And yeah, these buildings are all over Medford.

197
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:40,990
And there are some that still maintain some of their architectural original characteristics.

198
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,951
So yeah.

199
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:42,811
Great.

200
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:46,493
Thanks.

201
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:47,034
And Ed?

202
00:13:49,008 --> 00:14:14,234
I guess, again, I understand the district recommendation in the context, again, of the subdivision, even of that area near Mystic, going back to, I presume, around the 20s, structure itself, even reflecting the fact that every block in this area, you can see the houses were built to one model and converted into something else sometime in the last 70 years.

203
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:26,699
is, you know, it doesn't seem like it's worth preserving as such if all we're talking about is a raise the roof and build out the back, build out the back, you know, reno.

204
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,941
So I would say not significant.

205
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:31,622
Okay, great.

206
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:33,623
Thank you.

207
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:44,630
Having heard from all the commissioners, I will, unless there's anything else to add to this particular property, I do just want to add that MHC just did a

208
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:58,446
An analysis slash like light program on what the national what MHC looks for the national register CLGs have the added bonus of being able to do it at the local level.

209
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:00,427
So we, as a CLG can determine.

210
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:10,283
Whether or not buildings are not National Register eligible, potentially, and that MHC just simply has to concur or not concur.

211
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:20,070
And I'll talk about the 2 that we submitted later, but they don't necessarily always have the same standards that we do in terms of.

212
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,333
what we consider and are eligible versus them.

213
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:34,387
So we can talk about the specifics that may help you guys, plus I'll send around the program because it may help you understand what John and Claire, when they do their forms and do these nominations, what they're trying to explain.

214
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:37,366
Okay.

215
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:39,887
So with that being said, I'll send around that information.

216
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:43,528
Um, so, uh, we're going to do a roll call vote.

217
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:47,430
Uh, the motion was made for significance and seconded.

218
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,111
So yes, the significance of no is not significant.

219
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:51,031
So I'll start with kit.

220
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:52,552
No.

221
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:55,273
And Peter?

222
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:56,873
Uh, no.

223
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:57,854
And Eleni?

224
00:15:58,514 --> 00:15:58,734
No.

225
00:15:59,274 --> 00:15:59,574
And Doug?

226
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:00,775
No.

227
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,056
And Ed?

228
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:05,317
No, not significant.

229
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:06,097
And Jen?

230
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,144
I will vote no.

231
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:12,415
OK, so 0 to 6 is not significant.

232
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:15,884
So Jen and I will work on that letter and we'll get that out at the end of the week.

233
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:18,236
Thank you all.

234
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:22,460
Okay, next step, we're gonna hold a public hearing.

235
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,624
So the Medford Historical Commission will have a public hearing at 7 p.m.

236
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:35,433
on Monday, June 10th in accordance with section 48-78 of the revised ordinances, which is the city's demolition delay bylaw.

237
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:39,077
So agenda item, the first one that was up was

238
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:46,961
18 Wedgmere Road failed to post their sign as required by the demo delay packet.

239
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:50,123
So we're gonna table that until next month.

240
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:58,488
We're gonna send a second email reiterating that they need to both pay for that and to the legal ad that is necessary to run.

241
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:00,669
So that's tabled until further notice.

242
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,512
So just so I'm clear, no ad and no sign as of this month.

243
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:10,378
There's, yeah, Peter walked by this weekend and the sign was not up.

244
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:21,106
So, and we did send out the day after last meeting, we sent out the notice to the homeowner that they were significant and that they needed to post the sign and they needed to pay for the legal ad.

245
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:24,488
And they didn't either.

246
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,529
They didn't do either.

247
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,331
Yeah, as of today, there was no sign either.

248
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:29,292
I checked again today.

249
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:44,071
Ryan, we should send an email to the building commissioner and to the inspectors just to give them a heads up of what's been happening here, just so that there's no mistake of issuing a permit.

250
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:44,891
Okay.

251
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:47,333
Yeah, we can do that.

252
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:52,796
Yeah, just keeping the, and they've appreciated that when we've done that in the past, so.

253
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:57,679
Because there's no permit in our system to hold.

254
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,440
Right.

255
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:05,504
All right, maybe we can do that tonight after this meeting that.

256
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:08,132
or tomorrow morning.

257
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:08,952
That's fine.

258
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:15,695
Okay, so then, with that being tabled, we're gonna move right into 38 Pearl Street, the preferably preserved hearing.

259
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:20,816
So commissioners, as I mentioned previously, we had determination of significance.

260
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:23,017
The building is significant, so now we can have the hearing.

261
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:26,938
They did post the requisite sign, was a legal ad posted.

262
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:34,260
We didn't, to date, receive any feedback from the neighbors or anything like that.

263
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,261
But, Doug, I see your hand raised.

264
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:36,781
Do you have a question?

265
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:39,176
Uh, it's a more procedural question.

266
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:44,399
Is this I'd like the fact that we're trying to accelerate the process when we have an owner who's.

267
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,561
Thinking with us and trying to work with, is this the new template we're going to go forward for?

268
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:54,544
If so, if an order wants to get on board, we're going to use this model going forward when they're when they're willing to play.

269
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:10,401
Yeah, I mean, I don't see, I didn't see anything procedurally that says that the, if the owner wants to not wait and spend the money to post the legal ad and the sign preemptively, assuming that the building's significant, there's no reason why they couldn't do that.

270
00:19:11,382 --> 00:19:12,683
So, I mean- No, that makes sense.

271
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:16,326
I just, I guess, do we need to change our website to let them know it's an option?

272
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:21,250
Because I don't think that's the way our procedures are written, I don't think, as an option, unless somebody-

273
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:30,577
Yeah, I mean, it's not it's not written that way, but we can certainly advertise, you know, I is provided that this procedure works out.

274
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:33,138
I don't see any reason why we can't advertise.

275
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:35,339
I mean, it seems to be working for both us and the homeowner.

276
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:36,699
So no, I just.

277
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,742
Maybe we can just change it to say that there's a potential option.

278
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:55,168
I think the other thing, too, is we need to make sure we have enough time to order the form B. And so, you know, it will just depend on when, you know, for this case and attorney Desmond and some of the other.

279
00:19:55,708 --> 00:20:07,472
kind of developers we work with, we sometimes will get a heads up that they're thinking about acquiring a property or asking about something, and we can order a Form B perhaps before they've even submitted their application.

280
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:15,935
So I think anytime, if we can do it, I think if the option is there, if all the chips can kind of fall into place.

281
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:21,680
Yeah, in this case, too, that also works because we have the form B and a form A for this property.

282
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,023
So it may not always be the case, but in this particular instance, you know, we could certainly work it out.

283
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,633
Okay, so commissioners will kickstart the hearing.

284
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:40,237
What we're gonna do is we're gonna have a motion to lay on the table to start discussion.

285
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:41,578
We'll have commissioner comments.

286
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:51,184
We'll hear public comments, any final comments from the commissioners following that, and then we'll finish up the motion with a roll call vote.

287
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:54,026
And depending on which way it goes, we'll determine which way we go.

288
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:56,468
Any questions?

289
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:03,615
Hearing none, I'll take a motion to begin the discussion of the hearing.

290
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:13,659
I'd make a motion to find this property preferably preserved.

291
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:16,120
Thank you, Peter.

292
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,260
38 Pearl Street, that is.

293
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:17,980
Yep.

294
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:20,621
And a second?

295
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:26,004
Second.

296
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:27,024
Thanks, Doug.

297
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:30,974
All right, Peter, you want to start the discussion?

298
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:33,454
Same as before.

299
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:38,556
I just feel like this is a very well-preserved example of a Greek revival.

300
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:41,636
I agree with everything that Jen said before.

301
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:50,639
It has a lot of architectural integrity and a lot of the details intact.

302
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:54,880
I don't have any problem with

303
00:21:57,852 --> 00:22:08,119
an addition or whatever, but this one seems like we should do everything we can to keep the main mass of the house intact.

304
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,580
So that's my feeling on it.

305
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,141
Thanks.

306
00:22:12,422 --> 00:22:14,143
And Doug, you're next.

307
00:22:16,224 --> 00:22:18,385
Yeah, I was just rereading the form.

308
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:24,529
You know, the connection to the Shipra, the Curtis family is, I feel it's very significant.

309
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:25,190
So I think that

310
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:36,128
You know, usually the social side of things is I, I don't sometimes the connection is not that strong, but that's a family that, you know, it's a, it's a milestone family in the city of Medford.

311
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:42,651
I think that that also helps this, but the building itself, even if didn't have that, I think I would still be looking for a perfect because this one is.

312
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,373
It's just it's such a clear.

313
00:22:46,673 --> 00:22:50,615
Quality building, it has a lot of integrity and I think.

314
00:22:51,522 --> 00:23:02,429
There's a way to adapt this to whatever we need to, whatever the architect and the owner wants to do that is sympathetic and respectful and still allows them to make the changes they need to update this building, I think.

315
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,010
Great.

316
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:05,731
Thanks.

317
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:07,732
Kit, you're next.

318
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:12,775
I don't have a whole lot to add.

319
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:17,898
I mean, this one seems to me like a perfect example of why the commission exists.

320
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:20,903
It is historically significant.

321
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:22,884
It's architecturally significant.

322
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:26,046
It's in great shape.

323
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:32,890
And what is the inventory of houses of this era in the city?

324
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,451
Ryan, you with your encyclopedic knowledge of this.

325
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:37,652
Probably less than 1,500.

326
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:44,936
To me, it's clearly preferably preserved.

327
00:23:51,735 --> 00:23:52,436
Eleni, you're next.

328
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:55,538
Yeah, I don't have much else to add.

329
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,419
It is a no-brainer for me.

330
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:04,723
The Form B was pretty thorough in what's original and what changes have been made.

331
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:16,350
It seems like the changes have been minimal and it looks like the house is in excellent condition, so I don't really see a reason to change it significantly or demolish it.

332
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:20,134
I think it's just a beautiful house.

333
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:28,620
Like Kit said, this is the reason why this commission exists, to preserve houses like this.

334
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:28,960
Yeah.

335
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:30,481
Great.

336
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:33,143
Thank you.

337
00:24:33,624 --> 00:24:34,744
Ed, you're next.

338
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:45,252
Again, I think given the intent seems to be to maintain the streetscape, build up a little and build back a little.

339
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,202
You know, again, it's worth preserving, and I think we're really talking about design review to make the preservation work.

340
00:24:53,822 --> 00:25:02,366
So, you know, that's sort of where, you know, I, you know, this is worth preserving, and we can do it with some design tweaks fine.

341
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:04,806
So that's where I am.

342
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:07,047
Great.

343
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:11,329
And Jen, you're last, but not least.

344
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:16,112
Yeah, I mean, I agree with everything, especially what Doug said.

345
00:25:16,152 --> 00:25:33,187
I think there's a way here, and certainly we worked with this property owner in the past, and come with some good resolutions to, you know, preserve the front, let them extend the rear that we need to in a way that will be, you know,

346
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:58,715
uh you know honor the structure that's there but allow them the density and the units that they need to make their project work for them um so i am hopeful that um you know we can uh i think we should it should be preferably preserved and we can come to probably a nice resolution on how we can all move forward and not have them wait out 18 months great thank you

347
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:02,787
Next up is the public comment period.

348
00:26:03,347 --> 00:26:05,267
Nelson, I see you have your hand raised.

349
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:09,108
If you want to speak, name and address for the record and we'll be happy to hear you.

350
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:10,129
Comments.

351
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:12,109
Nelson Rivera.

352
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,070
My office, 264 Salem Street in Medford.

353
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,471
One thing about this property, I know this property is historical.

354
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:23,132
We intend to preserve the entire structure in the front.

355
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:24,872
We're not even going to replace the siding.

356
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:27,973
The existing property, we're just going to paint.

357
00:26:29,305 --> 00:26:30,266
the existing structure.

358
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:33,188
Only thing we're going to do in the existing structure is replace the window.

359
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:36,091
We intend to put a historical window with the grids on.

360
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:42,056
And the addition is going to match the front house as well.

361
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:46,120
We're going to use the wood clapboard on the back as well to match the front clapboard.

362
00:26:51,572 --> 00:26:54,635
Sorry, Nelson, could you repeat the section about the windows?

363
00:26:54,715 --> 00:27:01,020
I didn't, my- The windows, only thing to do over there, we have to replace those windows, the existing windows.

364
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,744
The windows kind of have asbestos on it.

365
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:10,409
And we're going to replace the existing windows of the existing house.

366
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,193
But we're going to remain, everything else is going to remain the same.

367
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,578
We're not changing the siding, we're not changing the trim.

368
00:27:19,018 --> 00:27:21,659
We're just going to paint the existing house.

369
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:30,903
And the addition to the back, we're going to add wood siding, wood clapboard to make the existing house.

370
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:33,264
Thank you.

371
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:35,965
It looks like there's six over six windows.

372
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:40,047
Are you saying that they all have asbestos and they all need to be replaced?

373
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:42,190
They have asbestos on it, yes.

374
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,251
They test positive.

375
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:49,154
That house, all of my time work, that house is the one we found the most asbestos.

376
00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:52,696
All the ceiling walls has asbestos on it.

377
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:59,680
So can you match the aesthetics of the 6x6 with a modern window?

378
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:05,284
Yes, we can get the wood with the same, like, profile, the wood profile.

379
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,206
We can get the same window, the wood profile.

380
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,167
You know, metric existing over there.

381
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,081
Yeah, thank you.

382
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:17,324
We just did a house in Arlington historical home was be able to met the windows close enough.

383
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,568
Great.

384
00:28:22,688 --> 00:28:23,909
Any other public comment?

385
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:29,433
Kathy, I'll just give you the opportunity if you have anything to add.

386
00:28:30,352 --> 00:28:36,156
Sure, I just want to let the board know that we've been through the zoning process on this.

387
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:38,718
The lot's a very large lot.

388
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,059
There was no dimensional relief required.

389
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,462
But what we needed to do was get a use variance.

390
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:50,646
So if the use variance wasn't permitted for the two families, then it wouldn't make sense to come to historical first.

391
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:55,347
do a plan for two family and then find that the use for variance wasn't going to be granted.

392
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:03,109
So in this instance we went to the Board of Appeals, got the use variance and they did some tweaks to the design already.

393
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:12,191
It was going to be an L shape coming out away from the existing building and the Board of Appeals wanted it to at least be consistent with the existing dwelling.

394
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:14,432
So we reduced the size of the

395
00:29:15,432 --> 00:29:21,877
The actual edition I can kind of if you want to share the screen, I can show you the portion that that.

396
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:24,039
That is going to be.

397
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,721
Where the addition is going to set.

398
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:29,163
I can.

399
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:34,468
I have to make you a co-host.

400
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,690
Which I may.

401
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:37,750
Um.

402
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:59,558
Hold on one second.

403
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:00,979
Dennis, are you there?

404
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,943
I think Teresa is there.

405
00:30:05,963 --> 00:30:09,346
Yeah, Teresa is also here, but I don't think Teresa is currently a host.

406
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,358
Yeah, I'm just a co-host right now.

407
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,319
Yeah, we've maxed out on host.

408
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:22,782
So I just want to see if there was a way that he could revoke one of our... Could she email it to you, Ryan?

409
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:23,642
He can put it on the screen.

410
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:25,563
Yeah, can do that if you want to do that.

411
00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:27,636
I have the application.

412
00:30:27,656 --> 00:30:31,939
Dennis just texted that his computer is frozen.

413
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,801
And it's page six of the plans.

414
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:36,142
I believe I submitted those.

415
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:42,226
That will just give you a sense of where the addition is located and what is being added.

416
00:30:42,747 --> 00:30:46,409
Sorry, I was muted there, but I have the plans up on my screen.

417
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:47,650
All right, go ahead, Peter.

418
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,771
You're co-host then.

419
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:54,255
So it's page six of the plans, Peter, that shows the addition.

420
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:56,742
Hold on one second.

421
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:07,948
Okay, can you guys see that?

422
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:08,929
Yep.

423
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:21,416
So that's, those are the renderings, but this shows you page six, the portion that is, here's the original, and this is what the proposed addition is to the rear of the structure.

424
00:31:23,228 --> 00:31:28,750
Not a huge change in terms of massing, but very minor in terms of style that it's all going to match.

425
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:40,776
Here's the before and after massing.

426
00:31:44,718 --> 00:31:46,339
Before and after massing.

427
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,522
I believe the addition extends the property 10 feet to the rear.

428
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:54,180
or roughly approximately 10 feet.

429
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:58,843
Before and after front, no change except for the window.

430
00:31:58,904 --> 00:32:06,489
Well, that's it.

431
00:32:08,871 --> 00:32:10,011
You guys seen enough or?

432
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:10,592
Yeah.

433
00:32:11,092 --> 00:32:11,833
I think I'm happy.

434
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:12,253
Yeah.

435
00:32:13,374 --> 00:32:14,094
I'm curious.

436
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:25,622
From our architects, Peter, Ryan, I know sometimes in the past, you know, we haven't been super excited about like a big box.

437
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:37,106
And I know when, you know, if zoning approves something and we maybe wanna make a change, just have to go back before zoning, I'm not sure how that works.

438
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:41,788
So I'd be curious what the architects think of the design before.

439
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:48,584
Uh, not to sway anybody's vote, but I'll say I don't have anything to add.

440
00:32:48,704 --> 00:32:50,285
I'm satisfied with the vote.

441
00:32:50,325 --> 00:33:00,767
I just would ideally like to monument that we looked at this project and we had a hearing and that that this is the design that they're going with and sticking with.

442
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:04,288
That's somewhat already taken care of because it's been ZBA approved.

443
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:09,509
But I think from our standpoint, that's where that's the only thing left that I think we should do.

444
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:11,250
But everything else to me seems fine.

445
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,990
But I don't speak for Doug and Peter.

446
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,210
So.

447
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:26,074
If I could just add on that point, I'm not so sure, and I'd have to go back and check with Dennis, but there wasn't any dimensional relief requested or we met all the dimensional requirements.

448
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:28,835
It was strictly a use variance that was required in this instance.

449
00:33:29,195 --> 00:33:34,337
So I'm not sure if it was still within the dimensions, if it was tweaked somewhat, that that couldn't happen.

450
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:40,439
But I'm not quite sure, but it was only a use variance and not a dimensional variance that we sought.

451
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,079
We have to go back to the board.

452
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:45,380
It is not something we would want to have to rewrite completely.

453
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:10,695
At least could be discussed.

454
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:11,335
Yep.

455
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:12,496
Yep.

456
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:14,897
Doug Peter comments and then they'll get to Lenny.

457
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,782
I mean, it is sort of an it's kind of an extrusion now, but.

458
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:31,565
I don't know, I mean, I think it's a compatible design.

459
00:34:31,585 --> 00:34:33,186
I don't know what else they could do.

460
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:43,374
I would have liked to see the L-shaped one, but I wouldn't go against zoning because there's some good characters on that.

461
00:34:45,755 --> 00:35:02,642
It does seem like the change in plane from the front to the back is so minor that it now appears to be just one continuous box going from the front facade all the way to the back.

462
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:11,101
And I'm not really liking that, but I do really like everything else that's happening here.

463
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:20,431
So I guess I wish it was a more pronounced transition between the front mass and the back mass, because

464
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:30,196
You know, it doesn't really, it really reads as a single volume, not as, you know, an addition and a main house.

465
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:45,349
To me, that would be my architectural criticism, but I'm not sure how strongly, and I would like to hear from Doug and others anyway.

466
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,831
Peter, could you clarify what that,

467
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:54,297
That notches, it looks like it's inches from the elevations I saw when you were sharing.

468
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:56,121
Yeah, let me look at the plan here.

469
00:35:57,074 --> 00:36:01,356
Usually architects do what I told.

470
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:16,284
I do that not only to break the plane just a little bit, but if the building is not square and they're building a new addition that is square, it allows for the discrepancy in lean of the existing building.

471
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:16,664
Right.

472
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:19,206
On the left side, the setback,

473
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,620
from the new mass to the old is one foot.

474
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:35,143
On the right side, it's currently flush, and it will maintain its flushness but get taller.

475
00:36:37,444 --> 00:36:43,526
So the one foot offset really doesn't do it for me in terms of breaking up the mass.

476
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:48,668
So that's my architectural statement, but, you know, I mean,

477
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:59,812
I mean, I guess we're obviously getting into the weeds a little bit here, but if you're going to make an extrusion, make an extrusion.

478
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:03,135
I think it's so close to being an extrusion, you might as well just do it.

479
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:14,005
I mean, I know that I agree with what Ryan is saying, that this logistical, maybe it's an expansion joint or a little soft joint, so the two parts can move a little bit separately structurally.

480
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:20,427
And, you know, I think as a map, and clearly the zoning board said, basically, they want to see the extrusion.

481
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,152
They didn't want to see the left turn and the dog leg.

482
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:25,175
Right according to Tony Desmond.

483
00:37:26,052 --> 00:37:29,674
I think it had more to do with the square footage of the second unit.

484
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:36,578
They wanted the square footage of the second unit to be within a certain, you know, as a second unit, not as two single.

485
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:44,282
I think the issue the zoning board had was the original drawing appeared to them to be two singles rather than a two family.

486
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:52,847
So we rolled back the square footage so that it was more of a true duplex versus something that looked much larger.

487
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:56,459
And there was a split on the board, but that was the ultimate decision.

488
00:37:56,479 --> 00:38:04,824
My preference would be to see a stronger break of more than one foot and push the addition further into the backyard.

489
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:08,626
But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves here.

490
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:14,169
We still need to vote on preferably preserved and hear from all the commissioners.

491
00:38:14,229 --> 00:38:20,213
So I just feel like we can visit that.

492
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,352
I mean, I do have some issues with the design as presented so.

493
00:38:26,152 --> 00:38:31,175
I'm not satisfied with it so personally, but if I can be overruled, but.

494
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:42,142
So, just a clarification, because I'm just looking at the existing condition site plan the side yard setback in this location is the 7 and a half foot standard.

495
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:44,643
Okay, because that yeah.

496
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:51,723
Yeah, I'm inclined to agree with Peter.

497
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:54,306
I don't think that it's enough of a visual break.

498
00:38:55,126 --> 00:39:06,535
And from a preservation point of view, I usually don't like to see new additions that like mimic the historic building like to the exact letter.

499
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:10,358
I do think that there should be some kind of

500
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:26,635
you know, an addition should be done in, you know, a different architectural style or language, different color material, something, or providing some kind of break in the massing so they do read as, so it does read as an addition instead of just an extrusion of the original building.

501
00:39:27,996 --> 00:39:29,016
So I think that would

502
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:42,674
wouldn't compromise the design of the original building so much if the addition kind of read more clearly as a contemporary addition and not just a continuation of the original building.

503
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:46,234
Okay.

504
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:48,395
Thank you.

505
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:52,316
Who did I miss?

506
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:53,876
I haven't missed anybody.

507
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:56,857
Anybody else for public comments while we have public comments open?

508
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:02,410
Seeing none, I'm going to close the public commentary period.

509
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,411
Thank you all commissioners.

510
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:06,292
Any final comments before we go into.

511
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:15,097
Roll call just that it seems like there's obviously a cross section of opinions here.

512
00:40:15,117 --> 00:40:17,098
We're not speaking as 1, which is okay.

513
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:18,739
I think there's a solution here.

514
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,340
So I think.

515
00:40:21,158 --> 00:40:29,403
You know, if if the vote goes towards, you know, the direction I think it's going in, we're, we're probably looking at 1 quick design meeting to solve this problem.

516
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:32,524
I think we're not looking at a long process at all.

517
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,047
Yeah, I think that's fine.

518
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:38,647
Great.

519
00:40:39,368 --> 00:40:49,452
So with that being said, the motion was made by Peter to find preferably preserved status at 38 Pearl, Doug Carr second.

520
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:50,813
So I'm going to do a roll call vote.

521
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:53,934
Yes is preferably preserved and we'll vote the demo delay.

522
00:40:54,514 --> 00:40:58,536
No will allow the building owner to move forward.

523
00:40:59,237 --> 00:41:01,177
I'll start with Kit because I see you.

524
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:02,098
Yes.

525
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:04,219
And Peter?

526
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:05,559
Yes.

527
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:06,540
And Eleni?

528
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,571
Yes.

529
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:08,251
Doug?

530
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:09,293
Yes.

531
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:10,515
And Ed?

532
00:41:11,957 --> 00:41:12,878
Yes.

533
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:16,743
With the understanding that this is going to go to a design committee pretty quick.

534
00:41:17,404 --> 00:41:17,765
Yes.

535
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:19,127
And Jen?

536
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:22,149
Yes, preferably preserved.

537
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:24,169
OK, 60 approved.

538
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:33,073
So Tony Desmond and Nelson will get the letter out to you and will send this right to subcommittee, which is me, Peter and Doug.

539
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:45,397
If you want to send over what was, I guess I guess it'd be good to see what was done and submitted to the ZBA initially, and then we'll have your plans to start with and see if we can't come up with a solution relatively quickly.

540
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:48,338
And and we'll go from there.

541
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:50,699
you.

542
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,642
Thank you all.

543
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:53,388
All right.

544
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,456
Let's see back to the agenda.

545
00:41:56,856 --> 00:41:57,636
All right, that concludes.

546
00:41:57,676 --> 00:41:59,117
Ryan, Doug has his hand up.

547
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:00,498
Oh, yeah, Doug, go ahead.

548
00:42:00,658 --> 00:42:08,641
Yeah, Ryan, given Eleni's comments, I think she should either replace me or join the subcommittee, since she clearly has a strong opinion about that.

549
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:11,482
I wouldn't want her opinion not to be part of that subcommittee.

550
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:12,843
Sure, OK.

551
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,324
Eleni, we'll switch Doug out.

552
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:19,246
Doug can help out on a couple of the other ones, and we'll switch people out as we need to.

553
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:22,187
That sounds perfect.

554
00:42:24,456 --> 00:42:27,298
Okay, returning back to our regular business meeting.

555
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:32,342
So there's a couple of things on new business.

556
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:41,989
The fire department is going through some design, design iterations, and they're actively soliciting feedback from various departments.

557
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:51,036
The one thing that Jen and I thought of is that it might be good now to ask the city to document the 1960s safety complex that was,

558
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:56,438
built as part of a major urban renewal project.

559
00:42:56,478 --> 00:43:02,541
So they entirely demolished the neighborhood that was there to put that building up and to put the public safety building up.

560
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:05,762
So I think it would be good to have a little bit of information before it comes down.

561
00:43:05,902 --> 00:43:11,164
There's a form that exists because it is a significant Medford modernist building.

562
00:43:11,224 --> 00:43:13,525
It's one of the newer buildings that they built in the

563
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:14,586
60s.

564
00:43:14,686 --> 00:43:16,647
So it is important to Medford.

565
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,188
Do I believe we should save it?

566
00:43:18,348 --> 00:43:19,408
No, absolutely not.

567
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:26,112
But I think that we should ask them to document it as part of the process so that that's done.

568
00:43:26,392 --> 00:43:29,774
Is there any other thoughts on things that we might ask for?

569
00:43:29,794 --> 00:43:35,557
Do people want to be involved further with the new buildings design and comments?

570
00:43:35,777 --> 00:43:36,818
Because we get a lot.

571
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:38,939
We're on their email chain in the city department.

572
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:40,240
Have we seen that?

573
00:43:41,472 --> 00:43:46,095
They sent around, I think, an initial concept just for the site.

574
00:43:46,115 --> 00:43:46,896
They're at site plan.

575
00:43:46,936 --> 00:43:49,018
I don't think they're at full building design yet.

576
00:43:49,278 --> 00:44:05,189
Yeah, it's just a concept for a site plan, and there's been a lot of back and forth, especially with engineering, I think, and Tim's group there about curb cuts and road width and things like that.

577
00:44:06,726 --> 00:44:09,369
It's not overly exciting right now.

578
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:11,571
There's nothing yet other than a site plan?

579
00:44:12,852 --> 00:44:20,519
No, because I think part of it is that they want to, I think they're talking about establishing money for further design and things like that.

580
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,882
Sorry, where's the site?

581
00:44:25,424 --> 00:44:29,908
Union Street, corner of Union Street and Mystic Ave, the existing major fire station.

582
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:31,209
It's going to replace that building.

583
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,050
Got it.

584
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:36,410
One of the most dysfunctional buildings I've ever seen in my life.

585
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:39,492
Nobody ever said it was a good design.

586
00:44:40,332 --> 00:44:41,393
It just didn't age well.

587
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:43,474
It was fine when it was built.

588
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:45,255
It just didn't age well.

589
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:48,377
OK.

590
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:52,259
So we'll make sure we ask for documentation as part of that.

591
00:44:56,921 --> 00:45:01,123
And we'll keep people in the loop as that design process moves forward.

592
00:45:03,877 --> 00:45:05,879
All right, next up 400 Mystic Ave.

593
00:45:05,899 --> 00:45:10,242
400 Mystic Ave is, is or was before the Community Development Board.

594
00:45:10,262 --> 00:45:16,967
They're gonna ask to demolish the older portion of the building as part of their redevelopment of that site.

595
00:45:17,488 --> 00:45:21,891
It is the former Ballaroo skating rink, so I think a lot of people are interested in it.

596
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:27,135
There's a lot of chatter about it on the community board, so I think we should do an MHC form.

597
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:34,401
A, that covers the new and old building, because I think the old building is important, but the new building is also worth documenting, too.

598
00:45:34,461 --> 00:45:36,543
It was former Century Bank headquarters.

599
00:45:37,243 --> 00:45:40,206
Someday it will be historic, maybe, if they don't tear it down beforehand.

600
00:45:40,266 --> 00:45:47,092
So, you know, I think we should appropriate maybe $1,000 to have that site documented.

601
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:52,716
Any Ed West moves?

602
00:45:52,796 --> 00:45:53,317
And a second?

603
00:45:53,657 --> 00:45:54,318
Yeah, second.

604
00:45:56,068 --> 00:46:01,033
And this is the little gray building that they want to take out.

605
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:02,295
Didn't we already review this?

606
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:05,638
Yeah, we'll have to review it because it is 75 years or older.

607
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:16,190
Supposedly, the people that bought that building moved it to the site from somewhere in West Medford.

608
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:23,372
Supposedly, it was a MTA bus building that was no longer needed, so they cut it into sections and relocated it.

609
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:32,134
I have no idea where that information, I know where the information came from, but I have no idea where the bus building may have possibly been, having looked at aerials and whatnot.

610
00:46:32,274 --> 00:46:38,116
So I'll be interested to see what the consultants come up with, if anything.

611
00:46:39,516 --> 00:46:44,799
And in terms of on the inside, I know that Century has gutted that building multiple times.

612
00:46:44,919 --> 00:46:48,741
So obviously, I don't think anything remains from the Ballaroo period.

613
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:51,942
But it is the shell is old enough to review.

614
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:54,524
So it should at least get a review.

615
00:46:55,444 --> 00:46:56,545
Who was the second on that?

616
00:46:58,846 --> 00:46:59,106
Me.

617
00:46:59,346 --> 00:46:59,586
Jen.

618
00:46:59,706 --> 00:47:00,267
OK, sorry.

619
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:01,147
I made the motion.

620
00:47:01,307 --> 00:47:01,968
Jen seconded.

621
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:05,970
I think at the very least, we're going to need

622
00:47:07,675 --> 00:47:16,405
either documentation or a plaque may make some sense, but I acknowledge I'm ahead of myself.

623
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:30,454
I also want to point out, because I think it's an important landmark, the river, it was the building before it was built for the bow lover was actually built as a boathouse.

624
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:34,438
So the river was quite literally right at that location.

625
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:43,567
So, you know, it's hard to imagine now with the river being behind the highway, but it's kind of cool, cool landmark to kind of pinpoint where the river once was.

626
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:52,272
Okay, so we have a motion to spend $1,000 on an MHC form A, motion made by Ed, seconded by Jen, so I'll take a roll call vote, okay?

627
00:47:56,914 --> 00:47:57,135
Yes.

628
00:47:57,735 --> 00:47:58,115
And Peter?

629
00:47:58,675 --> 00:47:58,915
Yes.

630
00:47:59,496 --> 00:47:59,936
And Lenny?

631
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:01,257
Yes.

632
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:01,957
And Doug?

633
00:48:02,737 --> 00:48:02,998
Yes.

634
00:48:03,678 --> 00:48:03,798
And Ed?

635
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:05,690
Yes, let's roll.

636
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:06,651
And Jen?

637
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:07,692
Yes.

638
00:48:08,072 --> 00:48:09,873
All right, 6-0, motion passes.

639
00:48:10,274 --> 00:48:13,637
Hey, Ryan, can I just bring this back to the fire station real quick?

640
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,438
Yeah, go for it.

641
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:17,240
I was just going back through those emails.

642
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,364
There's actually going to be a design meeting on June 21st.

643
00:48:23,305 --> 00:48:29,991
I can't go to that, but if anybody from our commission would like to go and sit in, I don't know.

644
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,342
I don't know that there's a time, or maybe it's on Zoom.

645
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:35,982
I can ask.

646
00:48:37,043 --> 00:48:38,424
Teresa, do you know by any chance?

647
00:48:38,444 --> 00:48:43,987
I believe that it will be on Zoom, and I can certainly get that information and share it back with this group.

648
00:48:44,827 --> 00:48:45,127
Okay.

649
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:49,049
If somebody wants to sit in and just be there and listen.

650
00:48:49,069 --> 00:48:50,510
Somebody from this group should be there.

651
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:56,413
I'm actually going to be traveling for work that day, so I don't think it will be me, but it'd be great if somebody could just be eyes and ears on that one.

652
00:48:56,433 --> 00:49:00,455
Yeah, I can try.

653
00:49:02,612 --> 00:49:07,555
That would be great, Peter, because I'm actually leaving the next day for vacation myself.

654
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:08,916
So I'm going to be slammed that day.

655
00:49:08,936 --> 00:49:13,379
All right.

656
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:15,180
Thanks, Teresa.

657
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,182
I'll circulate that Zoom meeting around once we get it.

658
00:49:18,282 --> 00:49:21,564
And if anybody wants to, Peter and anybody else wants to sit in, that would be great.

659
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:24,386
Great.

660
00:49:24,926 --> 00:49:25,126
Thank you.

661
00:49:27,496 --> 00:49:30,940
Continuation of appropriations 179 Main Street.

662
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:35,747
The owners asked they want to put a significant addition on the rear of the building.

663
00:49:35,787 --> 00:49:42,496
They want to maintain the front very similar to Pearl Street, but we haven't really seen much in terms of.

664
00:49:43,117 --> 00:49:44,158
an application from them.

665
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:49,662
They were just out there in the planning stages, so we figured it'd be good to have a form be done for that building.

666
00:49:49,702 --> 00:49:58,549
It is a mid-19th century, pre-1875 structure, so I think a $500 appropriation should round out the last of our spending for the year.

667
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,815
Motion to spend $500 on a form B for 179 Main Street.

668
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:07,175
Second.

669
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:07,355
Yeah.

670
00:50:12,946 --> 00:50:13,626
Agreed it.

671
00:50:15,987 --> 00:50:20,368
I had seen something to the effect or that was under at this point was under contract.

672
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:25,889
Um, that's a good question on whether or not they own it.

673
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:28,750
I mean, they haven't submitted anything formally to us yet.

674
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:33,271
Um, so they just were asking if they could put on a large edition.

675
00:50:34,012 --> 00:50:39,113
Um, I don't I don't know if they had actually physically acquired the building yet at this point.

676
00:50:40,022 --> 00:50:46,944
I've seen the listing and the listing sort of, I think, you know, if you believe the Internet, the listing said was reaching the under contract point.

677
00:50:48,404 --> 00:50:50,044
It's too close to me not to look at.

678
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:58,006
I see 51324 listed for sale, so I don't know if, Jen, you can look it up by any chance, but.

679
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:01,087
To see if it's under contract.

680
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:04,788
It is under contract.

681
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:13,425
Scheduled to close on June 28th.

682
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:25,255
Okay, so I think that I think we should still, you know, I would think we should assume that they're going to apply for a permit once they get close on the property.

683
00:51:25,295 --> 00:51:30,760
They'll start the design and we would probably want to influence that design before they get too deep into it.

684
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:38,929
There is a rear L on this building already, but I think they probably just want to do what the other ones do, which is extrude.

685
00:51:38,989 --> 00:51:45,413
So if we can get influence on the design before they spend too much money and time, that would be good.

686
00:51:46,314 --> 00:51:48,075
It's an 8000 square foot lot.

687
00:51:48,936 --> 00:51:49,757
Yeah, so.

688
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:51,218
It's pretty big.

689
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:56,301
Uh, OK, motions been made and seconded.

690
00:51:57,262 --> 00:51:59,464
I'll take a roll call vote to spend $500 on the MHC Form B kit.

691
00:52:02,918 --> 00:52:03,178
Yes.

692
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:04,600
And Peter?

693
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:05,881
Yes.

694
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:07,662
And Delaney?

695
00:52:09,524 --> 00:52:09,924
Yes.

696
00:52:10,285 --> 00:52:10,505
Doug?

697
00:52:11,306 --> 00:52:11,626
Yes.

698
00:52:12,246 --> 00:52:12,387
Ed?

699
00:52:13,448 --> 00:52:13,748
Yep.

700
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:14,729
And Jen?

701
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:15,630
Yes.

702
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,972
All right, 6-0 approved.

703
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:21,190
All right, don't forget about the church.

704
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,531
Yeah, I'm going to do that right now.

705
00:52:23,752 --> 00:52:26,455
So, just a quick update before we dive into the church.

706
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:37,265
So, 2 things about the national register nominations that we put forth for the church and for the Oak Grove service building.

707
00:52:37,325 --> 00:52:38,607
So, for the church.

708
00:52:40,568 --> 00:52:45,033
I'm going to send out the NR program that MHC put together.

709
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:50,779
The church is not significant because it's a church.

710
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:56,905
In fact, being a church automatically disqualifies it as being in the National Register program.

711
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:58,046
What makes it significant

712
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:02,230
is its association with the community and its architecture.

713
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:08,575
It has to be both significant for the above and beyond just simply being a church itself.

714
00:53:08,975 --> 00:53:18,262
And in the case of Shiloh Baptist Church, MHC concurred with us that it is important to that community and it is an important work of architecture.

715
00:53:18,322 --> 00:53:21,585
So MHC found that the building is National Register eligible.

716
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:29,634
So that should help any of the people there who are working on grants because that puts it at a higher level than other buildings.

717
00:53:30,735 --> 00:53:40,424
In terms of the Oak Grove service buildings, MHC did not concur with us that those buildings are significant because they are much later than the initial Oak Grove Cemetery.

718
00:53:41,025 --> 00:53:57,074
they are suggesting that we do is document the entirety of development at Oak Grove Cemetery and if we so choose we could make a stronger case because they don't relate to the original cemetery and the original cemetery buildings that were there that they replaced are gone.

719
00:53:57,494 --> 00:54:03,077
So we would have to make a stronger case that the later sections that relate to those buildings

720
00:54:03,617 --> 00:54:06,478
are just as important as the earlier cemetery.

721
00:54:06,658 --> 00:54:14,581
So I think at this point they did not concur, but more work could be necessary to get them to rise to the occasion of the NR.

722
00:54:14,601 --> 00:54:18,282
Okay, so they didn't tell us any of this.

723
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:23,943
I had to find it all out on the inventory form, so I'll send those around so people have them for their records.

724
00:54:24,544 --> 00:54:24,704
So

725
00:54:27,149 --> 00:54:32,839
And then the biggest one that I disagree with is, you know, which may help some of you guys.

726
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:42,503
Artificial siding of any kind automatically dismisses a project or a building or a site from being considered for NR eligibility.

727
00:54:43,303 --> 00:54:55,307
I and many architectural historians do not concur with that status because many of the buildings use it as a covering, but also its architectural language is often still legible underneath the siding.

728
00:54:55,447 --> 00:55:02,190
So that's where MHC and most architectural historians differ, but that's what the NR says at this point.

729
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,150
This is a reminder.

730
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:14,685
All right, so we have a consideration for an architectural easement for Shiloh Baptist Church.

731
00:55:14,805 --> 00:55:17,308
Teresa and Roberta Cameron are here to talk about it.

732
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,693
Jen, did we send that around?

733
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,931
Um, I don't think so.

734
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:28,491
Sorry.

735
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,511
I sent it to well, I sent it.

736
00:55:30,811 --> 00:55:32,311
I read it and I sent it to Doug.

737
00:55:32,331 --> 00:55:33,012
I know that.

738
00:55:33,652 --> 00:55:44,174
Um, but Teresa, if you want and Roberta, if you guys want to summarize the general, I think this is an important moment because it sets the precedent for what we decide to do for the rest of.

739
00:55:45,434 --> 00:55:49,395
The other buildings that this would potentially be working on, so.

740
00:55:50,835 --> 00:55:54,920
I think it's important to understand what it is and where we're going and how we.

741
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,024
How we, uh, how we implement them.

742
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:02,129
Certainly, and if you want to.

743
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:06,575
Sure, yeah, so I'll summarize why we're here.

744
00:56:06,595 --> 00:56:07,056
Why we're.

745
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:17,995
asking the property owners to put a preservation restriction on the property and asking for the city to be the holder of that preservation restriction.

746
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:27,179
So the Community Preservation Committee has given a grant of initially $150,000 and then an additional $150,000 to the Shiloh Baptist Church for preservation of this building.

747
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:52,364
The grant was initially for a preservation architect to do a needs assessment to identify the highest priorities for improvements that are needed to preserve the building.

748
00:56:53,564 --> 00:57:04,807
It's understood that the windows, really remarkable stained glass windows throughout the building, are a very high priority for restoration.

749
00:57:05,668 --> 00:57:06,728
to keep those windows.

750
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:24,683
But in the meantime, it was determined that making the building handicap accessible would enable them to continue providing services to the community as the church building was originally built for that purpose.

751
00:57:25,523 --> 00:57:33,590
And so the city's CPA funds are being used for the installation of an elevator initially

752
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:55,323
And we hope to support the church as they continue to raise more funding, perhaps from the city in the future or from other sources, national or state grants or nonprofit organizations that have grants for historic preservation to try to preserve the windows and the rest of the building.

753
00:57:55,943 --> 00:57:59,765
So with the CPA funding, in order to ensure

754
00:58:02,466 --> 00:58:05,707
the investment that we've made in the building.

755
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:18,070
To protect that investment, we want to have an assurance that the building is going to be preserved in its historical condition for the foreseeable future.

756
00:58:18,651 --> 00:58:23,632
As is a best practice commonly used in many CPA communities,

757
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:37,732
For a significant grant, the committee made a condition that the owner of the building put the building into a preservation restriction.

758
00:58:39,512 --> 00:58:43,313
And the preservation restriction requires a third party to hold it.

759
00:58:43,994 --> 00:58:53,797
And what many communities do is that the community, through the historical commission, is the holder of the preservation restriction.

760
00:58:54,709 --> 00:59:04,283
And that still has to be approved by MHC, but the city actually holds the responsibility for

761
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,645
Tracking the building to ensure that the conditions of the preservation restriction are met.

762
00:59:12,245 --> 00:59:26,638
So what we would like from the historical commission is to have a discussion about the historical commission fulfilling the responsibility in the future of holding the preservation restrictions.

763
00:59:27,351 --> 00:59:51,562
for buildings that the CPA has funded, and also to look specifically at the criteria that have been included in this draft preservation restriction to determine that these are the criteria that you would want to apply to that building to ensure its preservation going forward.

764
00:59:53,478 --> 01:00:06,409
And I would add that this is something that we're looking to implement on all non-city entity awardees that hold physical space that is of a historic nature, just to clarify that.

765
01:00:06,429 --> 01:00:09,892
The city can't hold its own restrictions, unfortunately.

766
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:14,255
That would be great, but that is why we are in this application.

767
01:00:14,275 --> 01:00:15,296
Just wanted to add that.

768
01:00:15,657 --> 01:00:16,898
And I would just add one more thing.

769
01:00:16,938 --> 01:00:20,621
The reason why this is coming up for the first time, even though there have been several other

770
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:33,776
grants given for preservation for historic preservation in the past is that in all of those cases, the buildings already either had a preservation restriction or they were local historic districts.

771
01:00:34,496 --> 01:00:44,764
Or in one case, it was a very small grant and we decided that the small grant wasn't commensurate to the value of the preservation restrictions.

772
01:00:44,905 --> 01:00:46,606
So it wasn't worthwhile in that case.

773
01:00:50,915 --> 01:01:12,059
One question I would have would be, given this is church property, is there any issue that a city body rather than a body not part of the government holds the easement over the use of a church building or potential changes to a church building?

774
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:20,160
So the way that this has worked in the city of Somerville, where I work,

775
01:01:21,116 --> 01:01:44,382
and have facilitated preservation restrictions between church organizations, other nonprofit organizations in the city, is that the criteria are actually very similar and the process, the procedure of the city managing its preservation restrictions is very similar to the procedure of a local historic district.

776
01:01:44,902 --> 01:01:50,043
So basically, from the city's perspective and from the grantees' perspective,

777
01:01:51,103 --> 01:02:02,385
It is the same process and it's treated the same way as a local historic district, except that this is in perpetuity and not by ordinance.

778
01:02:05,606 --> 01:02:17,508
But, you know, if, for whatever reason, it was decided the religious use had come to a natural end, doesn't that, you know, will that create a conflict?

779
01:02:19,817 --> 01:02:23,539
insofar as the city is now trying to judge whether or not they can do so.

780
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:26,320
I see what you mean.

781
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,781
Just a clarification, Roberta, before I do that.

782
01:02:28,902 --> 01:02:33,824
I did send out to everybody just so you guys can look through it on the fly, unfortunately.

783
01:02:33,864 --> 01:02:44,709
But yes, the draft preservation easement, but then also on to build on Ed's note, if they're going to be putting an elevator, I believe one of the things was that we would be excluding

784
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,951
maybe some review of the interior.

785
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:56,939
So does the preservation or could the preservation easement extend also into the interior so that we could maintain those character-defining spaces?

786
01:02:56,999 --> 01:03:05,085
Like, for example, Shiloh Baptist Church was found to be architecturally significant for not just the exterior but the floor plan and arrangement of interior spaces.

787
01:03:05,145 --> 01:03:09,549
That was a unique characteristic of church buildings and the floor plan at the time.

788
01:03:09,649 --> 01:03:09,789
So

789
01:03:11,262 --> 01:03:23,206
I'm not sure how interested the easement holders going to be, whether it's us or some others on the interior, or if we just care about the exterior look and feel of the building, but I'll let you guys.

790
01:03:26,147 --> 01:03:31,529
From my, from my personal perspective, and I think that this is.

791
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:48,696
This is generally applicable the the city's interest in the building is preserving the exterior and ensuring that this space any improvements to the interior are.

792
01:03:49,877 --> 01:03:55,279
are based on the functionality of the space, not on the religious use.

793
01:03:55,859 --> 01:03:58,399
So the religious use may change in the future.

794
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:09,523
In fact, the city will not pay for religious iconography or any preservation related to specifically the religious use of the building.

795
01:04:09,963 --> 01:04:17,345
The preservation is to the exterior envelope and to the building's functionality as a public community space.

796
01:04:23,085 --> 01:04:25,106
Okay, Doug, your comments?

797
01:04:26,427 --> 01:04:27,747
Just a couple.

798
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,829
Obviously, a restriction needs to happen.

799
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:32,590
The need is clear.

800
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:33,951
I don't think anyone's doubting that.

801
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:44,416
But as you were speaking, Roberta, I did think that, you know, I thought objectively the Historic District Commission is a better candidate for this because they deal with these issues on a day-to-day basis.

802
01:04:44,476 --> 01:04:49,919
We kind of go, you know, kind of more global, more of the city across the whole city, individual buildings.

803
01:04:51,132 --> 01:04:58,174
We actually don't have a lot of, at least I don't, hands-on experience on enforcing restrictions.

804
01:04:58,934 --> 01:05:08,877
We could learn, I think, but I think they may not be the right body for another reason, for functionality or capacity or whatever.

805
01:05:08,897 --> 01:05:16,199
I'm just saying we should think about it and think about everything because it's obviously this group.

806
01:05:16,299 --> 01:05:17,200
I don't know what it entails.

807
01:05:19,529 --> 01:05:25,472
Is it only when their renovation we get involved and we review plans?

808
01:05:26,433 --> 01:05:29,874
I've been on it the other side, because the Brooks estate has had it, but we just submit our plans.

809
01:05:29,894 --> 01:05:32,056
I don't actually know what they do with our plans.

810
01:05:32,556 --> 01:05:33,456
It's kind of a mystery.

811
01:05:33,536 --> 01:05:40,060
So there's a bit of a learning curve here, unless anyone on this commission has experience enforcing it.

812
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,661
Go ahead, Ryan.

813
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:45,122
Yeah, so I think that there are

814
01:05:47,717 --> 01:05:52,223
proactive and reactive easement holders, so depends on what you are.

815
01:05:53,244 --> 01:06:02,694
The government tends to be reactive, so you approach them, and Mass Historical is the big one, you approach them with the work, they have a certain timeline and deadline to

816
01:06:03,295 --> 01:06:03,936
react to it.

817
01:06:04,376 --> 01:06:06,197
If they don't, it gets automatically approved.

818
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:10,521
If they do, there's some back and forth until you come to a resolution and then you go forward.

819
01:06:10,821 --> 01:06:20,929
And then there are the proactive easement holders, which I find are probably infinitely more successful than the reactive ones because work never goes under the radar for those easement holders.

820
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:26,554
So that's Historic New England and the National Trust for Historic Preservation are probably the two A-list ones.

821
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:36,659
They both require some form of endowment to go along with the easement holder because they actively administer them.

822
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:45,184
Every year they go out and they send somebody out to inspect them, they check whether work has been done, and they also hold themselves to reacting on a

823
01:06:46,184 --> 01:06:56,074
quick and timely manner to get, you know, approvals and they serve as a resource to help the easement people that own these properties.

824
01:06:56,154 --> 01:07:04,061
So I guess in some way I see an easement going hand in hand here with some sort of funding source, right?

825
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:10,708
So I guess a big question for me is, you know, if we're going to be administering these types of properties

826
01:07:10,988 --> 01:07:15,352
can we use CPC funding at an administrative level to administer them?

827
01:07:15,972 --> 01:07:28,503
Or can CPC, if CPC holds a preservation easement for properties that they've awarded funding, can you guys use your own funding for administration of your own easements, right?

828
01:07:28,603 --> 01:07:35,448
So if you guys are holding them, for example, and you have the funding, rather than pass it along to us necessarily, you can just

829
01:07:36,269 --> 01:07:39,372
approve your own administrative funding and administer the easement yourselves.

830
01:07:40,512 --> 01:07:50,660
I'm not opposed to holding the easements at the historical commission provided there's the resources necessary to back them up but I don't know if the city currently has them so

831
01:07:52,015 --> 01:08:07,869
I feel that as of right now, unless there's some sort of permanent and perpetual funding source for it to back up both staff and administration beyond city budget, then I think another easement holder would be the way to go at this point.

832
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:09,170
Jen?

833
01:08:11,272 --> 01:08:14,135
This is probably the dumbest comment on the planet, but my

834
01:08:15,772 --> 01:08:18,254
I don't know how we can be considered a third party.

835
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:26,863
We're all the city, and so I don't know how a city can police the city in that respect if it's supposed to be held by a third party.

836
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:28,945
Right.

837
01:08:29,165 --> 01:08:32,148
We're theoretically city employees, right?

838
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:32,808
Yeah.

839
01:08:32,968 --> 01:08:33,949
No, not theoretically.

840
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:35,971
We are city employees.

841
01:08:36,031 --> 01:08:39,755
That was going to be my same exact question, because we are the city.

842
01:08:40,938 --> 01:08:50,588
Right, so this is for this reason, we cannot put preservation restrictions on city owned property, but this is a privately owned property.

843
01:08:51,389 --> 01:08:55,813
So, we would be the 3rd party for the privately owned.

844
01:08:56,654 --> 01:08:57,135
Properties.

845
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:02,202
Right, so we couldn't do it for any city.

846
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:04,763
Correct properties, right?

847
01:09:04,783 --> 01:09:14,589
But if we were if we had a working relationship, say with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, who has the preservation easement on the Pinkham octagonal house, they could hold the easement.

848
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:16,130
Say we give funding to.

849
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:27,676
The city fire station and that there are normal go to they could hold the preservation easement on the city fire station because they are a separate entirely separate organization.

850
01:09:27,736 --> 01:09:29,858
They really are a third party in that instance.

851
01:09:30,778 --> 01:09:34,000
So I guess that's how I see it.

852
01:09:36,418 --> 01:10:04,138
I have not personally done this research, or maybe I have and it's been a long time, but it's my understanding that they are not only require a large endowment to consider holding a preservation restriction, but they're also very selective because they don't have the capacity to hold restrictions on as many properties as would like to offer them.

853
01:10:19,624 --> 01:10:28,009
I guess it comes down to, I guess the important question is funding, if we can use CPC funding to administer, because that will help.

854
01:10:29,089 --> 01:10:44,678
We could earmark a certain dollar amount every year to fund either a secondary staff position that has the added bonus of doing other CPC work, but could help with administration of this and other grants, but also being the,

855
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:53,005
person who helped shepherd the project through when it needs approval before whoever holds it, whether it's us or some other board.

856
01:10:54,006 --> 01:11:05,094
That's actually a very reasonable request, and I'd be interested in discussing how we might be able to arrange that.

857
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:06,215
Teresa?

858
01:11:06,235 --> 01:11:09,317
Yeah, I was just going to share that that would be something we could

859
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:17,453
easily budget in because it's a known amount and presumably we'd go to the same consultant every time.

860
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:22,635
That would be something that we could be very open to discussing and I think we could find a solution there.

861
01:11:27,477 --> 01:11:29,038
Other thoughts from the commissioners?

862
01:11:29,098 --> 01:11:35,081
Do we need additional time to approach this idea and review the easement?

863
01:11:38,876 --> 01:11:40,877
Yeah, I mean, I'd like some time to review the document.

864
01:11:40,917 --> 01:11:41,678
And I apologize.

865
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:43,099
I didn't look at that before tonight.

866
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:50,363
But can we is it for a Roberta and Teresa, if we put this back on our agenda for next month?

867
01:11:51,064 --> 01:11:52,745
Is that too long for you guys?

868
01:11:52,965 --> 01:11:56,167
Or the that would be completely fine.

869
01:11:56,267 --> 01:11:57,287
And very agreeable.

870
01:11:57,327 --> 01:12:01,370
You know, as you know, this is getting this from start to finish recorded.

871
01:12:02,222 --> 01:12:04,704
MHD approval, it takes some time, so.

872
01:12:05,124 --> 01:12:05,765
Okay.

873
01:12:05,785 --> 01:12:11,148
So then we can come back next month with comments on the language of the easement.

874
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,149
Perfect, that works for me.

875
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,730
Okay.

876
01:12:14,916 --> 01:12:33,868
Maybe I can just give a brief summary of the process of obtaining the preservation restriction is that we first prepared this rough draft, which will get your input on that, where we've gotten the input of our legal

877
01:12:34,849 --> 01:12:53,213
services on the draft preservation restriction, then we will be sending it to MHP for their input, and they'll most likely send back feedback that we'll use to create a final preservation restriction.

878
01:12:53,793 --> 01:13:00,535
Once they've pre-approved that final, then we begin circulating it to be executed.

879
01:13:00,555 --> 01:13:02,175
We would then ask for

880
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:12,222
the body, whether it's the Historical Commission or the Historic District Commission, would vote to accept it.

881
01:13:12,342 --> 01:13:14,403
City Council would have to vote to accept it.

882
01:13:14,884 --> 01:13:29,035
The property owner would have to sign it, and then we would have to have signatures from everybody across the city, and then send it to MHP to sign it, and then

883
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:32,112
It can be recorded at the registry.

884
01:13:32,632 --> 01:13:34,354
The process can take years.

885
01:13:34,815 --> 01:13:36,977
So we're at the beginning.

886
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:43,183
And hopefully, we'll get something on the books sooner than later.

887
01:13:47,734 --> 01:14:04,904
Yeah, I guess just to Doug's earlier point, I mean, in addition to a little bit of time to review the proposed easement, I think it would be helpful if we could get a little more understanding of what it would entail for the Historical Commission to hold easements generally.

888
01:14:04,984 --> 01:14:13,889
And is there somebody that we can talk to at one of the organizations that you referenced that could just give us an overview of like, what is the responsibility?

889
01:14:14,729 --> 01:14:17,491
Because I don't think anybody wants to take on something that we can't do well.

890
01:14:18,231 --> 01:14:28,157
I can, I can ask if Carissa Demore is still with Historic New England, I can ask if she'll come talk with us.

891
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:40,965
Maybe that will be a good reason to have a special meeting with both us and the city departments that are involved with this to review what they do and what sort of

892
01:14:43,107 --> 01:14:46,610
time that they invest in these easements that they currently have.

893
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:48,591
And she's a Medford resident, I believe.

894
01:14:49,932 --> 01:14:53,675
So I think getting her here will not be a problem.

895
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:55,736
So if we can just find a convenient time.

896
01:14:59,019 --> 01:15:00,560
So I'll try to reach out to her.

897
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,721
That sounds great.

898
01:15:01,741 --> 01:15:04,863
And I'll help coordinate that, Ryan.

899
01:15:05,284 --> 01:15:06,084
That would be great.

900
01:15:09,967 --> 01:15:10,828
Any other questions?

901
01:15:12,187 --> 01:15:20,470
This is probably a stupid question too, but what's the point of the easement just to make sure that the building's integrity is maintained?

902
01:15:21,151 --> 01:15:27,333
Or is it a vehicle by which other funding can be obtained or something like that?

903
01:15:27,373 --> 01:15:29,054
Or what's the purpose of it?

904
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:38,318
It gives us the legal mechanism to enforce rules and review over the building.

905
01:15:38,937 --> 01:15:40,017
permanent in perpetuity.

906
01:15:40,037 --> 01:15:42,278
It runs with the land as opposed to with the building.

907
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:44,820
So it's a perpetual review.

908
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:51,823
And in addition to that, I think, yes, it does make certain funding types easier.

909
01:15:51,903 --> 01:16:01,707
For example, if they decided to approach Mass Historical Commission for preservation funding, there is a requirement for an easement on there.

910
01:16:01,747 --> 01:16:05,909
But usually, if it's a modern easement, they don't put an easement on top of an easement.

911
01:16:07,168 --> 01:16:20,144
But from a CPC perspective, it's also a way for them to ensure that the funding that they're being given by CPC is used for historic preservation, which is what they've applied for.

912
01:16:22,548 --> 01:16:24,509
Did I get that correct, Teresa and Roberta?

913
01:16:24,689 --> 01:16:24,849
Yeah.

914
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:25,310
Yeah.

915
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,770
Oh, yeah, there is a there is a recap.

916
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:27,611
I guess that's important.

917
01:16:27,651 --> 01:16:37,615
There is a recap mechanism in there that recaptures the funding if they choose not to do that over a certain time or if they because they have to hold the property for a certain period of time to as well, right?

918
01:16:38,836 --> 01:16:39,016
Correct.

919
01:16:41,172 --> 01:16:49,542
And I would just note that the preservation restriction that we've drafted only covers the exterior.

920
01:16:49,702 --> 01:16:52,065
It doesn't extend to the interior of the building.

921
01:16:55,052 --> 01:17:22,675
And is this for this property specifically or, okay, so if there was another one in the future that like say a private homeowner was getting CPC funding for historic preservation of their own home that we've all deemed worthy of that, then a brand new document would be created for that specific property with that preservation easement or restriction, excuse me.

922
01:17:24,344 --> 01:17:31,488
Correct, but just to clarify, CPC funding isn't available for privately owned residential homes.

923
01:17:32,267 --> 01:17:33,328
Not yet anyway.

924
01:17:34,429 --> 01:17:35,369
Yeah, but I guess.

925
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:35,690
Yeah.

926
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:36,130
Okay.

927
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:39,172
But it's specific to this particular project and not.

928
01:17:39,553 --> 01:17:41,974
This is not a blanket easement that we will have.

929
01:17:42,635 --> 01:17:46,578
That you guys could decide to apply to other projects in the future.

930
01:17:46,598 --> 01:17:52,983
It would be a 1 off that and then anytime in the future, something else would need to have an easement.

931
01:17:53,283 --> 01:17:54,944
That would be a separate thing.

932
01:17:54,964 --> 01:17:58,146
Yes, we'll approach it on a project by project.

933
01:17:58,507 --> 01:17:58,687
Yeah.

934
01:17:59,995 --> 01:18:01,377
We use a similar template.

935
01:18:01,477 --> 01:18:06,602
In fact, we have 1 that we're working on close behind this 1 for the Isaac Hall house.

936
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:16,272
Okay, great anything else.

937
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,676
All right, no, this is a good start.

938
01:18:20,716 --> 01:18:20,997
I think.

939
01:18:21,395 --> 01:18:32,280
Yeah, we'll review and provide comments and feedback and we'll regroup next month and see if we can't come to a resolution for any tweaks and go from there.

940
01:18:33,481 --> 01:18:34,741
Great, thanks.

941
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:35,582
Thank you all so much.

942
01:18:35,602 --> 01:18:38,163
Thank you, Teresa and Roberto, as always.

943
01:18:38,983 --> 01:18:39,424
Thank you.

944
01:18:42,565 --> 01:18:43,145
Okay, great.

945
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:43,766
Thank you all.

946
01:18:44,406 --> 01:18:48,248
Any other new business before I move right down to old business?

947
01:18:50,595 --> 01:18:52,055
I already heard none.

948
01:18:52,115 --> 01:18:54,976
Site plan review, 40B for 280 Misty Gav.

949
01:18:55,056 --> 01:18:56,796
I haven't heard anything on that.

950
01:18:56,856 --> 01:18:59,177
I don't think that's moving forward yet.

951
01:19:00,257 --> 01:19:03,378
They might be in the process, but that's going to take a while.

952
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:09,019
For properties under demo delay.

953
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:19,782
Hey, Ryan, on that 40B, I could be wrong about this, but it seemed like the plans

954
01:19:23,144 --> 01:19:31,687
were the exact same as some plans that we looked at years ago, except for the date.

955
01:19:34,087 --> 01:19:36,208
Yeah, Dennis, yeah, I see your hand raised.

956
01:19:36,268 --> 01:19:40,769
I believe we sent around the revised set after the fact.

957
01:19:40,829 --> 01:19:49,752
Well, when I looked at the revised set, it didn't look any, I had the old set and I couldn't see any distinguishing difference.

958
01:19:50,954 --> 01:19:55,616
So if we had comments from the old set, they would still apply.

959
01:19:55,636 --> 01:19:57,257
That's all I'm saying.

960
01:19:58,378 --> 01:19:58,758
Yeah.

961
01:19:59,298 --> 01:20:18,948
I don't know if I. There was a link and then I followed the link and I looked at the drawings and they were identical to the as far as I could tell the old drawings of a couple of years ago, so I don't know if they just if it was a mistake in the link or if.

962
01:20:20,308 --> 01:20:30,012
It looked like the same exact, you know, 10-story canyon courtyard building that was in the, I remember seeing these exact same plans.

963
01:20:31,812 --> 01:20:34,113
Yeah, Dennis, I see your hand raised.

964
01:20:34,133 --> 01:20:35,574
Did you want to chime in?

965
01:20:36,794 --> 01:20:37,875
Well, there's actually two parts.

966
01:20:38,415 --> 01:20:40,896
One, that is the exact same plan that was submitted for you.

967
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:42,036
They changed absolutely nothing.

968
01:20:42,736 --> 01:20:46,898
And second, they're actually going to be withdrawing the 4DB, so it's,

969
01:20:48,265 --> 01:20:48,845
It's good.

970
01:20:48,865 --> 01:20:52,087
We just have to actually wait to actually have a hearing to do it in.

971
01:20:53,028 --> 01:20:54,229
So we got it.

972
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:55,790
We received it after our last hearing.

973
01:20:56,210 --> 01:21:01,853
So hearing the end of this month where we received the letter to withdraw and we'll vote to withdraw.

974
01:21:03,094 --> 01:21:03,394
Okay.

975
01:21:03,815 --> 01:21:04,095
All right.

976
01:21:04,115 --> 01:21:11,179
So just the, so no project or just the, just the exact same project that they were originally planning without the 40 B portion.

977
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,320
No project at all there.

978
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,002
They're going to cause they own a bunch of land there.

979
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:17,603
So they're probably going to look at trying to do something,

980
01:21:19,189 --> 01:21:23,972
More, but nothing the 40 be there on a mystic is is done.

981
01:21:23,992 --> 01:21:24,553
Okay.

982
01:21:24,573 --> 01:21:25,193
All right.

983
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,135
Not officially because we haven't voted on it yet, but.

984
01:21:27,935 --> 01:21:29,296
Unofficially, okay.

985
01:21:29,316 --> 01:21:30,337
All right.

986
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:31,838
So we'll, we'll wait.

987
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:37,502
Basically, the commission will wait until a new project comes out and then we'll provide comments accordingly when that comes out.

988
01:21:37,522 --> 01:21:40,664
Okay.

989
01:21:45,018 --> 01:21:47,259
Okay, project under demo delay.

990
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:50,919
I haven't heard anything from the Carriage House.

991
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,220
56 Wareham Street, they sent over plans.

992
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:57,381
Peter, I'll read your comments after this meeting.

993
01:21:58,281 --> 01:22:04,643
And if we want, we can see what else we can do to those and maybe bring them to the commission.

994
01:22:04,663 --> 01:22:13,825
I think, you know, if we have enough business, maybe we can have a small meeting between now and next month

995
01:22:15,277 --> 01:22:22,298
you know, if we feel that we've 56 Wareham is ready to go before the commission, then we can bring it to the commission halfway through rather than have it at the next meeting.

996
01:22:23,839 --> 01:22:25,879
So, I don't know, it's still pretty schematic.

997
01:22:25,959 --> 01:22:29,880
I felt like Doug, you looked at it, right?

998
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:37,621
I thought it was, I mean, I kind of liked the design direction, but I felt like it wasn't like refined at all.

999
01:22:37,962 --> 01:22:45,143
It was just kind of, it was still fairly block block Massey, but I don't know.

1000
01:22:46,897 --> 01:22:53,740
I think you're right, Peter, but I think we want to let them know if they're on the right path.

1001
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,302
I think that's worth having a conversation for a few minutes, but I think everyone should take a look at it.

1002
01:23:01,552 --> 01:23:02,752
Yeah, we can certainly do that.

1003
01:23:02,933 --> 01:23:23,119
Then for 27 Allmont, I believe the consensus there, we got a loose sketch and we didn't like the idea of the sketch, so we're sending them back to come up with something a little bit more creative that saves more of the property, which I'm partially inclined to do for 56 Wareham.

1004
01:23:23,139 --> 01:23:31,002
I thought that was part of saving the more forward half, but I like the rest of the building, so I think that that just needs a little bit of work.

1005
01:23:31,402 --> 01:23:33,243
And then we can send it around.

1006
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:37,164
I think probably both projects will end up being very similar in approach.

1007
01:23:37,564 --> 01:23:46,726
And those approaches should serve as good precedents for the rest of the city on how and what type of development does we want to encourage for densification.

1008
01:23:46,826 --> 01:23:52,828
So the commissioners will have it there once we settle on the design.

1009
01:23:52,848 --> 01:23:56,589
All right.

1010
01:23:57,948 --> 01:24:19,981
uh cross street cemetery project so i've been told that uh the funding is all in place for the headstone project so i just have to meet with teresa um and get that off the ground and get that off my plate so that that can finally go forward um there is

1011
01:24:21,282 --> 01:24:25,784
actively coming together the RFP for the archaeological dig.

1012
01:24:25,824 --> 01:24:32,927
I know I said I'd do it last month, but I've just been waiting for the other headstone project because that has grant funding that's timely.

1013
01:24:33,047 --> 01:24:34,568
So that one had to get done first.

1014
01:24:35,508 --> 01:24:37,649
So that one's up in the air, but in the works.

1015
01:24:40,172 --> 01:24:45,275
For CPA projects, we did get phase two Thomas Brooks Park funding.

1016
01:24:46,276 --> 01:24:50,639
So that is going to go out the door as soon as those other two projects get off of our plate.

1017
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:56,923
For Peter Headland's project, that's kind of been in limbo.

1018
01:24:57,243 --> 01:24:59,665
I have to work with Dennis.

1019
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:03,467
I'm going to reach out to either you or Teresa to send it to all the department heads.

1020
01:25:05,512 --> 01:25:06,293
to get that out.

1021
01:25:06,373 --> 01:25:11,279
So for commentary, but I need to provide a little summary of what we're looking for for comments.

1022
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:21,070
And it's just the archaeological protection project with a note that face more comments on the work going plan for phase two will be coming along soon.

1023
01:25:24,329 --> 01:25:29,532
And then survey projects, the consultants are working on final edits for the survey project for Fulton Heights.

1024
01:25:29,612 --> 01:25:31,814
So that should wrap up by the end of the fiscal year.

1025
01:25:32,254 --> 01:25:33,535
So that project will be done.

1026
01:25:33,615 --> 01:25:37,358
So a lot of stuff is trying to end and begin at the same time.

1027
01:25:37,418 --> 01:25:40,460
So it's been a little bit of a juggle, but it should be good.

1028
01:25:41,381 --> 01:25:44,743
And that's all that I have for the projects that are ongoing.

1029
01:25:44,903 --> 01:25:46,544
Any other old business that I missed?

1030
01:25:51,808 --> 01:25:53,109
Doug, you look like you want to say something.

1031
01:25:55,023 --> 01:25:59,865
Well, as of last Thursday night, Enbelth has a new president.

1032
01:26:02,546 --> 01:26:14,312
Tom Lincoln retired, and Jen and myself and other board members spent the last half year finding a new appropriate candidate.

1033
01:26:14,332 --> 01:26:17,273
Her name is Carly Nesson, and she lives in South Medford.

1034
01:26:17,453 --> 01:26:24,296
And she's the next generation who will take on the Brooks Estate Challenge, just so everyone knows.

1035
01:26:25,587 --> 01:26:27,269
Great.

1036
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:49,190
And if everybody comes to the picnic on July 13th, is that that Saturday, whatever that day is, July 13th, please come to the picnic, meet Carly, meet, you know, hoping to get some fresh blood up there this year and some new faces.

1037
01:26:52,283 --> 01:26:57,709
Yeah, it'd be good to, you know, Doug, I'm always willing to look for updates and publish updates.

1038
01:26:57,769 --> 01:27:04,857
It'd be good to publish that information that you guys have a new president and maybe speak about the.

1039
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:08,801
Where you guys are in the road design work and.

1040
01:27:09,462 --> 01:27:13,767
You know, where other projects are, it would be good to know what's up with the.

1041
01:27:14,983 --> 01:27:19,587
You know, I know the cemetery trustees are looking at their parcel and the expansion of the cemetery in that area.

1042
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:26,852
So just be good to know what they're up to, you know, so that the whole community is on the up and up with what's going on there.

1043
01:27:27,853 --> 01:27:28,573
Yeah, makes sense.

1044
01:27:28,593 --> 01:27:30,295
We have a CPC meeting tomorrow night.

1045
01:27:30,355 --> 01:27:33,177
Teresa is going to be coming to two nights in a row.

1046
01:27:33,217 --> 01:27:34,778
Teresa, it's a big week for you.

1047
01:27:40,127 --> 01:27:48,754
Yeah, and if, you know, if there are other things that people want to bring to our attention, like I don't, you know, the Royal House, you know, if this program is going out of the Royal House, Historical Society, we always look for stuff.

1048
01:27:48,834 --> 01:27:54,159
I know Abby is still in the background and still will occasionally ping stuff on our Facebook.

1049
01:27:54,179 --> 01:27:58,823
So always happy to take cool history programs that are in our community and share them.

1050
01:28:00,384 --> 01:28:02,426
So, okay, anything else?

1051
01:28:03,867 --> 01:28:05,588
Hearing none, I have meeting minutes.

1052
01:28:05,729 --> 01:28:07,010
Peter sent out meeting minutes.

1053
01:28:08,601 --> 01:28:10,122
Any questions, comments, concerns?

1054
01:28:11,663 --> 01:28:13,144
Hearing none, I'll take a motion to approve.

1055
01:28:18,607 --> 01:28:21,249
Motion to accept the meeting minutes as distributed.

1056
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:23,370
And a second?

1057
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:23,991
I'll second.

1058
01:28:24,031 --> 01:28:25,252
Thank you.

1059
01:28:26,633 --> 01:28:28,033
OK, I'll take a roll call vote.

1060
01:28:28,254 --> 01:28:30,255
As I see you, Kit,

1061
01:28:31,761 --> 01:28:36,142
Did we decide that if you weren't here at the previous meeting you could approve?

1062
01:28:37,523 --> 01:28:38,483
You can approve it.

1063
01:28:39,103 --> 01:28:41,504
If you just want to vote present, that's fine.

1064
01:28:41,884 --> 01:28:43,205
That's understandable.

1065
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:44,165
I'll vote present.

1066
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:46,946
Okay.

1067
01:28:47,746 --> 01:28:48,026
Peter?

1068
01:28:48,767 --> 01:28:49,027
Yes.

1069
01:28:50,027 --> 01:28:50,507
And Ed?

1070
01:28:52,388 --> 01:28:52,728
Yeah.

1071
01:28:53,488 --> 01:28:53,968
And Eleni?

1072
01:28:54,548 --> 01:28:54,809
Yes.

1073
01:28:55,489 --> 01:28:55,949
And Doug?

1074
01:28:56,389 --> 01:28:56,669
Yes.

1075
01:28:57,349 --> 01:28:57,750
And Jen?

1076
01:28:58,530 --> 01:28:58,990
Present.

1077
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:04,702
And Ryan votes yes for five and two present, no opposed.

1078
01:29:07,964 --> 01:29:09,305
So you're good to go, Peter, thank you.

1079
01:29:11,107 --> 01:29:13,328
I'll take a motion to adjourn, unless we have any other business.

1080
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,429
I don't think we do.

1081
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:18,351
Will we conclude our business by adjourning?

1082
01:29:19,372 --> 01:29:19,592
Yes.

1083
01:29:20,393 --> 01:29:20,753
Second.

1084
01:29:23,575 --> 01:29:26,257
Okay, Ed moves to adjourn, Doug seconds.

1085
01:29:27,785 --> 01:29:29,289
Okay, roll call vote.

1086
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:30,453
Debate.

1087
01:29:31,535 --> 01:29:31,776
Yes.

1088
01:29:32,237 --> 01:29:32,558
Peter.

1089
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:33,380
Yes.

1090
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:33,942
Ed.

1091
01:29:34,824 --> 01:29:35,225
Yeah.

1092
01:29:35,586 --> 01:29:35,907
Lenny.

1093
01:29:36,469 --> 01:29:36,850
Yes.

1094
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:37,431
Doug.

1095
01:29:37,933 --> 01:29:38,294
Yes.

1096
01:29:38,695 --> 01:29:39,116
And Jen.

1097
01:29:39,858 --> 01:29:40,239
Yes.

1098
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:40,981
All right.

1099
01:29:41,382 --> 01:29:43,167
Motion to adjourn approved.

1100
01:29:43,247 --> 01:29:43,728
Thank you all.

1101
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:44,831
Have a good night.

1102
01:29:44,871 --> 01:29:46,215
Thank you everyone.

1103
01:29:46,235 --> 01:29:46,315
Bye.
