    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=0.091s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Boa noite a todos.
 Kathleen não toca em nossos escritórios.
 Estou aqui esta noite.
 Parece que acabou para Julian, CEO de uma empresa residencial da aliança na Nova Inglaterra.
 e Matthew Harrity, gerente de desenvolvimento de alianças residenciais.
 Em primeiro lugar, gostaríamos de agradecer a todos pela participação nesta reunião comunitária sobre a possível remodelação das propriedades localizadas em 5.73 Bells Way, que é a Cappies Liquor Store em 20 Revere Beach Park Way Monroe Muffler Break.
 O objetivo deste encontro é apresentar o projeto que está em fase preliminar 19 comentários de vocês, moradores do bairro.
 Antecipamos a apresentação.
 Aproximadamente 15 a 20 minutos após a apresentação haverá oportunidade para perguntas e comentários. Alocamos aproximadamente uma hora para esta reunião.
 Em termos de regras básicas gerais.
 Peço-lhe que permaneça em silêncio até ser chamado a falar.
 Além de fazer perguntas ao grupo.
 Você também pode tirar suas dúvidas e comentários no chat, e iremos discuti-los nos últimos cinco a 10 minutos da reunião.
 Peço-lhe que evite enviar mensagens privadas diretas, apenas porque é difícil coordenar o chat e monitorizar uma mensagem privada.
 Então, se você tiver alguma dúvida, pode colocá-la no chat em grupo e nós iremos analisá-la.
 E com isso, passarei a apresentação a Mike Bajulian, CEO da Alliance Residential.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=90.257s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 一切都好。
 谢谢你，凯西。
 大家晚安。
 正如凯西提到的，我的名字是迈克·贝朱利安。
 I am the regional partner for Alliance Residential Company in New England.
 We are a nationwide multifamily construction company.
 However, we manage each region virtually as if it were its own operation.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=112.722s">[Unidentified]</a>: 现在就放手吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=113.903s">[Maria D'Orsi]</a>: 录音正在进行中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=117.704s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 对不起。
 Either way, we run our company in each division.
 So while we are a national group headquartered in Phoenix, our offices are at 184 High Street in Boston.
 I was born, raised and still live in Arlington.
 And our entire team is located here in Boston.
 So if you don't mind, keep the microphone muted so we can get some interference.
 Tonight we are here to talk about a possible redevelopment of 2 lots in Medford.
 I want to emphasize that we not only have the land currently contracted and we are in a study period in which we are evaluating the feasibility of a possible requalification of these lands.
 Honestly, this is a little earlier than we would normally hold a neighborhood meeting of this type.
 Normally we would have gone a little further in the process.
 and has slightly better details.
 I think we have some good answers and some good talking points to talk about with you tonight.
 But to be clear, this material is not part of a formal application, and we are not yet formally before any city council or city council to consider this project.
 So again, I just ask for your patience.
 This is preliminary material.
 We may not have all the answers to your questions.
 We can probably talk to them in a lot of detail.
 And that's why we're excited to do a Q&A with you.
 Over the next month or so, we will complete our study period for the project.
 So it's probably no surprise that the world and its economy are in a bit of flux right now.
 We are treading carefully to ensure we do not make mistakes as we navigate these turbulent times.
 Can I prepare the presentation for you?
 In a few moments I will share my screen and show some of the concepts we developed, the location and context of the site and other things.
 As Kathy mentioned, feel free to prepare any questions you have about the project in the Zoom chat.
 我们正在记录这一点。
 We will look into this at the end and try to answer all the questions to the best of our ability.
 With that, I will try to share my screen.
 请耐心听我说。
 我不太用 Zoom。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=265.599s">[Unidentified]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=280.245s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  So these first slides we're going to start with are really just to get you acclimated with the neighborhood.
 I know that sounds silly because many of you live in the immediate area.
 However, we want to just make sure we all get started on the same page and talk about a little bit about the context for where we started our studies and conceptual program for the site.
 So the first one here is, of course, this is East Medford.
 Route 16 runs right across the page left to right.
 And the Fellsway and Middlesex Avenue run north to south.
 The taped site in yellow is the assembled parcels.
 Cappy's is the larger sort of hexagonal building.
 And Monroe Muffler is here on the east side on the property line.
 So the combined site,
 which again are 573 Fellsway, which is Cappy's Liquors, and 20 Revere Beach Parkway just to the east is the Monroe Muffler Shop.
 You'll see to the south here, Station Landing, the Mystic River Reservation off to the southwest, and the shopping centers up to the northwest.
 Of course, Wellington Station is at about 430 on your page.
 We've got a few axios here to show the immediate neighborhood.
 Again, these are really just to kind of show context of how the site fits in with the larger areas.
 We've turned the camera a bit on you.
 So, Route 16 or Revere Beach Parkway is running off to the east towards the top of Page and the Fellsway down to the right and Middlesex Avenue and the Fellsway up to the left.
 Cappy's there is just left of center.
 So obviously the neighborhood really is, you know, primarily seven and eight-story mixed-use buildings, quite a bit of housing in high-rise format.
 And you'll see Wellington just off top right of page.
 We'll flip the camera a bit here and looking southeast now, Cappies again just left of center, Route 16 traveling up and to the left of your screen, and station landing off across, southerly across Route 16 there.
 So looking at these photos, we like this site in the city for a lot of reasons.
 Medford's a great city.
 It features anything a modern resident would want, which is, of course, our business.
 The city is close to Boston, which in itself is always attractive.
 But really, it already has its own deep bench of employment of retail of walkability open space and history so all of those things stitched together to where, where, where our customers would want to live, they want to be close to home, they want to be able to walk to amenities, you know, nobody really wants to be in their car.
 And we've spent some time studying this intersection.
 Growing up in Arlington, I know this intersection well.
 So getting out of your car in this neighborhood is certainly an attractive thing, and Medford offers the ability to do that.
 And this site is really a microcosm more broadly of Medford, having all of those things I just mentioned within sometimes less than 1,000 feet of walking.
 Macro as a Bostonian, this is the type of modern housing I think greater Boston needs and regionally we need in eastern Massachusetts, where people even in cold weather aren't required to get into their vehicle to get a coffee to travel to work to pick up a prescription or to go get a classic roast beef at Kelly's across the street.
 So
 I'm going to move into some site photographs.
 I'm sure you guys are all relatively familiar with this, but I feel like we just want to be thorough.
 So this is a shot looking north of Cappy's, somewhat northeast, with 9th Street just in the back.
 You'll see a blue double two-story home on the left side of the screen with a garage.
 That is the 9th Street area.
 Monroe is just off to the right of your screen.
 This is a shot from Revere Beach Parkway on one of the many curb cuts on these two parcels.
 So we're looking straight north across the property line between Monroe and the Cappy site.
 This is a shot from 9th Street looking south.
 So Station Landing is in the background.
 Monroe is on just left of center and Cappy's, the back of Cappy's is just right of center.
 So you're looking at the intersection basically concealed only by the Cappy's.
 And then this is also a 9th Street shot looking the other direction.
 So you can see Boston Tattoo here in the background and the 9th Street intersection, current intersection and curb cut with Cappy's.
 So this last is an obvious satellite image of the site.
 We've oriented this North and South so we can stop getting you guys dizzy.
 9th Street runs East and West across the top of the site.
 This is Middlesex Avenue on the left, and again, Route 16 on the bottom.
 The property isn't taped, but it is this L-shaped combination of these two parcels, not including the Boston Tattoo Company.
 This is a good start to show where the site planning begins for us, apart from the macro context of the area and the uses that are here and the amenities.
 This is really where we start trying to integrate and stitch those things together into a program.
 On the left and on the south of the site, we're bound by these two roads or parkways.
 These were
 These are actually very interesting if you don't know the history, but these were formerly, like many parkways in greater Boston, were run by the MDC, now DCR.
 The spirit of these roads was effectively, as we were becoming an automobile-focused society, to have a pleasure-driving avenue to explore the area's benefits.
 So you, I'm sure, are all familiar with the Middlesex Bells.
 and the Mystic River reservations.
 These are really just spectacular green spaces, and the former MDC knew that, and they knew that they wanted people to experience those in a pleasurable way.
 So on the south side of the site, you'll see there's a pretty deep, for an urban zone like this, a pretty deep setback with mature trees and paths.
 Believe it or not, there's actually a deed restriction on these sites that allows the parkways to remain what their original intent was.
 So while we might not be putting around in a 57 Chevrolet enjoying the Mystic River Reservation here today,
 I drive on at least three parkways on the way to work every day.
 These are commuter roads now.
 But there's still an opportunity here, we think, to maintain the spirit of what these parkways were initially for.
 And one thing we found interesting was that on the west side of this site, along the Middlesex Avenue, it's paved right to the sidewalk.
 and there so those setbacks and deed notes actually exist there as well and so one of the things we thought might be attractive and seems to mate with some of the intersection plans being discussed is is an ability to use that even though it is on this property rather than leave it as asphalt is to try and continue that parkway um parkway spirit the paths put mature trees and native plantings there and the like um so
 We think restoring that buffer could be a real opportunity.
 So I'm going to move to the next shot.
 This is an actual concept we're working with.
 And it's roughly centered on the page as this is.
 So again, you'll see the, well, mislabeled Fellsway.
 That's technically Middlesex, of course, but Revere Beach Parkway on the bottom.
 And you'll see how we're looking at really adding back into those buffer zones, as I mentioned before, some of the green spaces.
 A number of other things worth highlighting as we get into this we're going to show you some more details on on how we program space conceptually.
 This community's proposed at 265 units of rental housing, we do not build condominiums in an eight story format with 100% of the resident parking enclosed within the building so.
 A lot of the surface parking areas that are on the perimeter of the area and nearby sites, we're going to instead work to green those up and bring the parking inside the envelope completely.
 We'll talk a little more about the rest of the program.
 But to get you started, effectively, we craft these communities so that they are a completely enclosed community.
 And so by that I mean, while this looks like a pretty normal building,
 from the outside, all of our building systems are located internally.
 So, trash, refuse collection and recycling, separation, emergency services and access, all of our amenities, or most of the amenities, I should say, that are internal to the site.
 Everything is neatly encapsulated within the envelope of the building we propose here.
 So, you'll see on the site, there's donut shape is primarily the mass of the building.
 However, there is a hole in the middle and we'll use that courtyard to have some outdoor private space for residents.
 That's a little more private than perhaps walking across the street to the mystic river.
 But typically, and we'll show you some photos of how we treat these spaces.
 But these spaces typically have a large pool deck, sort of resort styled.
 We'll have outdoor cooking areas, lounges and cabanas and that sort of thing.
 A space where, you know, to kind of center the entire community around.
 On the upper left of the page, you'll note we've got a curb cut proposed here off of Middlesex.
 And in fact, to expand on that, the site currently features five curb cuts.
 And I'm sure we'll spend a lot of time talking about traffic and parking here.
 But the big story here is we're going to try and eliminate all of those curb cuts but one.
 We have not engaged a traffic engineer at this time.
 However, we've done enough of these to know that on a busy intersection like this, particularly one that's in flux for its future, that the less interruption and the less curb cuts that you're delivering traffic onto, the better.
 Excuse me.
 So our goal here would be to eliminate as many of those curb cuts in this planet, four of the five would be would be removed from the site.
 Inside the garage, so residents will drive into the building here, just above where it says loading, and there'll be three levels of parking.
 So the first three levels of the program would all be structured parking and other building services, and then all of the housing, but for a very few units, would be located on floors four and above.
 So we're gonna dig into the building here a little bit.
 This would be the first level if you were to just shave everything on floors two through eight off.
 And so as you arrive, you'll see the only surface parking we're proposing is just at the amenity area.
 That's also where we would have our 24-hour leasing and staff located.
 So future residents might use these spaces if they were to come look at a home or to check out the community.
 So that that sort of area all on the west side labeled as amenity would be a two story volume focused on the leasing and then a number of different amenities, which we'll talk a little bit about later.
 but primarily work from home type spaces, screening rooms, flex spaces.
 And we'll show you some of the other examples of what we do for fun in those spaces.
 So those would be separated from the garage element.
 The next two levels above this would also be parking served by internal ramps.
 So invisible to the outside.
 This would be an upper garage.
 parking floor like two or three you'll note that now above the common program area will add some homes and there'll be some again on the south side until we get to the upper residential floors, such as this where it'll be all housing on force for and above.
 So we'll also in these upper floors probably have some amenities.
 We're finding that most surprising amount of people are not going back to the office.
 And so the flex time and work from home spaces are becoming an important part of our business.
 So while some people may go to work, the typical customer here is working in a high tech or an R&D type
 And those have, you know, non traditional non nine to five types of hours.
 So we're now building our amenities to make those spaces more pleasurable and make your sort of to help you separate work from home, even when you are near home, as you would be in this.
 So we've added some, these shots are what we call axiometrics.
 These shots were created with the intent to kind of stitch what we're proposing into the neighborhood.
 So you'll notice, like most of the buildings around here, this is also eight stories.
 I think one of the station landing buildings up front is seven.
 but you'll see we're looking to pull things back off of the parkways and contribute back to what that sort of original mission was for those roadways and also just give this a little bit of a softer edge on what is a very hard-edged zone.
 So this we've also picked these spaces to
 try to relate to the aerial views we showed you earlier.
 So where we were showing you a photo very similar to this of the Cappies and Monroe site to show you how this would stitch into those with the massing around it.
 Now, this is a shot looking south, excuse me, southeast.
 So Ninth Street would be just in front of the building here in your view and the Middlesex Avenue and the Fells Way coming basically straight up the page on the right side.
 station landings here in the back.
 We're proposing a lot of verticality.
 This is what we'd call a Vitruvian style building.
 It's very classic.
 We're not sure this is the space based on what's around it.
 There's a lot of brick.
 There's a lot of sort of traditional materials.
 Station landing is a relatively classic and timeless architecture.
 So we didn't feel it was appropriate to use some of the real contemporary modern looks.
 for this space.
 So we stuck with some pretty classic verticality and spacing and dimensions to the building.
 To help you stay oriented, this was the small little future resident parking area, and the garage entry would be right here.
 And again, these first three levels, despite the fact that they look traditional with windows and the like, would actually be just the same cladding, just enclosing the parking structure.
 So this is a similar angle to the one we just showed you just brought down from from the seagull residents of Medford's viewpoint to get you down to a more pedestrian scale.
 Again this is where those future resident spots in the curb cut on the middle section might be and a garage parking entrance here if you can see my cursor moving.
 So
 This is, again, this is an early concept, so this may look developed, and we have looked at a couple of other options, but this is sort of the path we've been going stylistically with the concept.
 Next, we're gonna show you some photos of other projects we've done in Greater Boston that have things that we think at least conceptually belong in a project like this.
 This is a community we built called The Val that we've just finished, or just finishing leasing up.
 And so some of the things you'll note here is a big two-story volume at the arrival.
 I mentioned that there was that amenity labeled space was also amenities, but also our leasing and management staff.
 So this is a good example of how we integrate some of these things.
 On the right side of this feature wall is actually the back of house where at all times you can find somebody on our team working there.
 But there's also this sort of hotel-styled arrival here, which is some of the way
 apartment home communities are going.
 So there's someone here at all times kind of giving you a more full service feeling during the
 well, during regular hours, more full service feeling to the building.
 And then you'll see these two stories and a feature stair.
 This is something we'd like to integrate in this project as well, where we really are stitching together some of these assembly spaces, work from home spaces, or maybe you're just scrolling and rolling with your earbuds in and your music on, but places where this is a little more activated and a little more public.
 This actually, this wall was, we had a local artist custom paint it for us in sort of a thematic nod to the name.
 This is a project we built two years ago called The Cove.
 This is another idea of just some of those sort of flex spaces where this is really,
 more recreational space, obviously a pool table, there's actually a beer tap back there and wine, excuse me, and a wine cooler.
 But this is a space that would also be, we would propose something like stylistically different, of course, right near those amenity and leasing spaces, a little more open concept.
 This is one of our fitness centers we just completed.
 This one's actually done on two levels.
 We had a lot of fun with this one.
 We're utilizing private mirror rooms for online workouts and then of course all the traditional cardio.
 So this one has actually up top of this spiral staircase has a cardio deck and then the rest of your workout is all below here.
 So you can get an idea of how we really want to create an enclosed, fully encapsulated community, but in a very first class way.
 This is a pool deck shot.
 So this is an important one because this is a good analogy for how we would treat that center of the donut type space you saw.
 This is also a green roof on deck.
 These trees, while brand new, will grow to be full 40 foot sugar maples and red maples.
 So we have a team that understands how to put
 full-sized real vegetation on top of a deck.
 Under this is a parking level, not unlike we would propose on this site.
 Then a full, of course, heated pool and resort style, three, four months of the year, great place to hang out with your iPad or just get some sun.
 This is a good example of how we would treat that.
 This is in the same project at the Val I mentioned earlier, similar green roof.
 You know, you'll see something.
 We had some taller trees at the inception here, but, and some lawn back there, which is hard to see, but we fully green up hard and soft scape.
 This one has a cool sun deck where you can throw your chaise lounge right in the water.
 It's heated and, and hang out, you know, we'll have fire, we have a large fire pit.
 And then this one, you can actually see the grilling stations, private grilling areas where you and your friends can kind of hang out.
 and have dinner.
 And then this is just, we just wanted to give you an idea of what some of our apartment homes look like.
 Alliance is a little different than some of our more cookie cutter national competitors.
 I'm not here to throw shade at any of them.
 There's a lot of great groups out there.
 We just really kind of treat each project with a little bit more of a customized approach.
 And so, you know, in our Hingham asset, you know, that was more appropriate to have a little bit more of a coastal New England style and a little bit more classic sort of features.
 You know, at workforce spaces, you might want to be a little cooler, have a little bit more fun with some of the design, a little less safe.
 And then, of course, the unit mix and the lighting and all that changes.
 So this is a good example.
 We actually did two different types of backsplash tile with a custom featured backsplash tile behind the range.
 and sort of things like that.
 But we build, you know, the goal is to build, you know, first class modern housing from connectivity to finishes and the like.
 And so that is that.
 Let's see if I can understand how to put this off.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1583.975s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 我们现在可以开放提问，我认为无论如何我们都必须这样做，如果你愿意的话可以举双手。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1607.608s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 我们可以问一下吗？我不确定我们是否可以开始询问。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1613.152s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 继续吧，你没有沉默。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1615.393s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 是的。
 好的，完美。
 谢谢。
 嗯，谢谢你展示这一点，我想。
 首先，我认识你。
 好吧，首先，路边切割是如此具体，以至于我猜你喜欢这个属性的流程。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1630.277s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，路缘切割就是路缘切割，你会失望的，这不是一个伟大的艺术术语，仅仅在私人土地上有路缘切割、车道、基本上能够成为公共道路的很大一部分的能力。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1645.285s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 嗯，我知道你提到过这一点，你知道，很多想法是人们不一定必须使用他们的汽车，也许他们愿意在家工作。
 You also mentioned that there are a lot of R&D type people you know who could move here.
 Boston, you know, is a big center for the biotechnology industry, and a lot of people, you know, seem to be driving around.
 他们必须去实验室。
 好的。
 我知道你提到我们仍处于早期阶段，但我认为问题在于正确的交通路线。
 How do you take into account who can get in, right?
 It's not like you're only renting to people who might be working from home.
 我认为有很多理由相信，你知道，包括我自己，我在生物技术行业工作。
 人们离开这里前往剑桥和伯灵顿。
 而且，你知道，我看到这个行业仍然有很多人需要呆在科学家办公室里，这代表了该行业的绝大多数。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1710.315s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，这是一个好问题。
 其中有一些，请确保正确解压它们。
 我的意思是，第一个是，你知道，这些是估计，我可以告诉你我们的典型目标市场是谁，我可以告诉你谁通常租房。
 但当然，我们正在为每个人建造家园。
 我们尝试调整我们的产品，以了解谁对居住在一个空间中最感兴趣。
 但你是绝对正确的。
 我的意思是，我的意思是，
 汽车是不可避免的，正如在十字路口的任何一点都可以看到的那样。
 当然，有些人仍然开车上班，无论你是在生物技术领域还是其他领域。
 我有朋友在国防部、研发公司工作，时间可能是凌晨 2 点。
 当某个流程或测试完成时，每个人都上 Slack 或 Teams 说，好吧，我们走吧，然后每个人都动员起来然后离开。
 所以我的观点是，我们当然不会专门针对或迎合我们出租的对象，我们欢迎任何人。
 但这就是通常来这里的人，你知道，某人，某人可能更有兴趣去我们在入口处的辛厄姆资产，如果他们愿意多开车的话，你知道，我认为这里的想法是，你知道，你不必上车去喝咖啡，或去沃尔格林，否则他们会给你买烤牛肉或类似的东西。
 但是先生，从专业的角度来看，您可能完全符合我们的目标市场。
 他是一位年轻的专业人​​士，受过良好的教育，你知道，这正是我们在大波士顿地区建造房屋的目的。
 凯西，我要请你帮我将举手静音和取消静音，因为我什至不确定我是否有权这样做。
 所以我相信你会帮助我解决这个问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1832.817s">[Unidentified]</a>: 我们可以直接跳下去吗？
 瑞奇，这能持续多久？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1843.122s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 我想我们应该先在这里讨论一下。
 我想我们收到了惠灵顿圈居民的问题。
 如果仍处于连接状态，是否要取消静音？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1861.02s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 我就是一切。

 继续吧。
 你这么说真有趣。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1872.247s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 那里有一位先生正要询问。
 继续吧，先生。
 你并没有沉默。
 在太平洋大道上。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1879.312s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 太平洋大道。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1884.157s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 看来我们不再有惠灵顿圆环邻居了。
 我想我们将从屏幕顶部按顺序执行此操作。
 劳伦，看起来你已经把手举起来了。
 如果您愿意，我可以将您取消静音，然后问您的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1899.089s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 我们会将聊天保存到最后，以便我们知道谁举手并从那里继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1907.962s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 是的，我唯一的问题是一个非常简短的问题：您愿意在十字路口建立一座人行天桥以方便通行吗？因为我觉得那里有很多额外的人，所以能够访问 T 可能会有所帮助，因为目前无法非常有效地使用它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1933.541s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我会诚实地告诉你，该州允许你在我们的高速公路上穿过 DC 去建造一座桥梁。
 换句话说，我们可能需要一个更大的程序包才能执行此操作。
 只需插入障碍坡道和曲线即可保持合规。我在剑桥查看了类似的申请。
 穿过郊区火车，所以我想说我们会看到一切并做到这一点，但不幸的是我有一个很好的经历。
 是的，这可能是我们不能包含在内的东西，桥梁建成后可能就没有任何住房了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1977.11s">[Unidentified]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1980.232s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: 我不知道如何举手。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1984.054s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 琳达，来吧，我们已经为你准备好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1986.19s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: 我是惠灵顿，是惠灵顿公寓的董事会成员。
 第九街无法容纳比现有更多的汽车，特别是因为该标志已放置在受人尊敬的西行海滩大道上，并为该品牌提供了喘息的机会。
 我的单位每天早上都面向第九街。
 每天下午有三四趟校车。
 我看到了城市公交车。
 这是我们非常关心的问题。
 我知道这一点是因为我的一些邻居写信给我。
 我问的问题也与我有关。
 我们尽最大努力照顾我们的家，每两个月进行一次害虫防治。我们有诱饵站，您可以挖掘多少层楼的深度。
 对于停车来说，我认为这个社区可能会变得非常不受欢迎。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2053.406s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 我也不知道如何举手，但我和琳达在一起。
 我住在百汇广场南。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2062.814s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 黛博拉，如果我们能在这些人之后联系您，我会将您保留在名单上，并在我们知道谁已被列入名单后立即将您包括在内。
 但我有你的电话号码，这样你就可以在我们审查举手的人后参加。
 我们前面有三个人，我在看着。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2079.292s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 琳达，这些都是很好的问题，您会在概念规划中注意到，我们故意不包括人行道切口，实际上我们消除了这些地块和第 9 街之间的一些人行道切口。
 所以，你知道，我们怀疑情况会是这样。
 一个热门话题。
 镇上的其他人告诉我们，第九街在这方面遇到了麻烦。
 我认为我们故意做了一些事情，我们试图尊重并让我们的赛车远离第九名。
 但我认为有些事情我们并不是故意做的，但也应该有所帮助。
 沿里维尔海滩大道西行的三个路缘石，
 此时，您可以轻松右转并穿过 Monroe 停车场，或经过 Cappies 停车场并进入第 9 街，穿过十字路口，基本上消除十字路口的任何红绿灯，然后沿 Fellsway 或 Middlesex 向北行驶。
 所以我认为我们故意做的事情肯定不会增加任何新的痛苦。
 但我认为，根据我们提出的开发计划，现在基本上可以阻止所有人穿过路缘石进入第九街。
 我想说这应该会减少一些。
 我很抱歉不知道花岗岩街和你提到的标志在哪里，让我们找到它。
 但那些正在经历这些包裹的人肯定无法再这样做了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2185.727s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: 我想他们打断了我。
 我仍然能听到你的声音，哦，我很好，我把第 9 街尽头的品牌标志弄丢了，这条街从 Review Beach Park 一直延伸到 Keys，好吧，当然，惠灵顿公寓拥有从第 9 街到 Key Factory 的品牌，自从我来到这里以来，除此之外它还有很多不同的东西。
 城市拥有另一半。
 好吧，我有平行，和外面中间的6平行。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2221.06s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 因此，我们在这方面无能为力，但同样，这肯定会消除人们现在在红绿灯处跳跃的交通堵塞。
 我们也不建议今晚添加汽车。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2236.131s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: 是的，因为我实际上想说它增加了。我在这里已经快 30 年了，我不敢相信它已经增长了这么多。
 在那段时间里。
 这令人担忧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2249.175s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我可以告诉你，琳达，我们在该地区的交通方面做了一些非常有创意的事情。
 不知道能不能给你一个完美的解决方案。我知道我们不能。
 但我肯定会成为一个好的倾听者，并聘请最好的专家来确保我们融入这个十字路口，新的十字路口；不过，这可能会触及第九街民众的担忧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2273.261s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: 有一天我们会举行一次面对面的会议，比如在市政厅或其他地方，你知道我的意思吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2280.587s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，没错，我想我在聊天弹出窗口中看到了一些问题，我们将更详细地介绍这些问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2287.492s">[Unidentified]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2288.593s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 答案是我不确定。
 我们现在正在计划、正在做的一部分就是学习。
 这就是我们所说的生存期。
 我们正在研究一切，从所有权和契约到环境条件，如何获得许可证等等，与邻居交谈，我们不知道什么。我们今天的主要目标是成为周围人的好倾听者，以便我们能够向前迈进并进入公开进程，在那里将举行公开和更正式的会议。
 介绍，老实说，可能有更好的答案。
 我们是根据今天从你们和市政府官员那里听到的消息来通知我们的，因此我们希望牢记这一点，而不是仅仅抛出关于我们根本没有尽可能多地研究或了解的新应用程序的想法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2341.722s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 这是凯尔西。我想你现在可以自己做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2350.097s">[Scalise]</a>: 谢谢。
 你好，我叫克里斯汀，是百汇广场西店的老板。
 我是赞成这种发展方式的。
 我觉得靠近公共交通的地区应该有更密集的住房。
 但我对建设有两个担忧。
 其中之一是其他人所说的。
 在第九街，琳达是对的，即使你消除了这些路缘切割，人们也不会倾向于经过停车场，因为坦率地说，那里是灾区，但他们会进入布雷纳德，然后进入第九街。
 它位于第九街，非常小，所以我的第一个问题是：这是你的公司还是你过去有过这样的公司？
 他与他建立的社区一起做了一些事情来改善街道，也许是出于善意，因为不幸的是第九街是一条私人道路。
 事情就是这样，需要改进，人行道、路缘石、街道。
 我认为如果有，你知道，也许有一种方法，那就更好了。
 所以我的第一个问题是：你有吗？
 贵公司是否有兴趣或有帮助改善街道的历史？
 因为即使没有路缘削减，居民也会开始沿着布雷纳德行驶到第九街以避免十字路口。
 我的第二个问题是关于缓解啮齿动物的问题，因为我刚刚读到人们在开始大规模建设时遇到啮齿动物问题的噩梦，
 我今天读了一篇关于萨默维尔和布鲁克莱恩开始使用称为智能盒的下一代系统的文章。
 贵公司在当前的工作中是否执行基本的啮齿动物缓解措施，或者您是否计划投资更高级别的缓解技术？
 呃，因为我们在一个非常小的一个街区半径内有很多单位业主，我认为如果这造成了很大的啮齿动物问题，那就真的很烦人了。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2493.5s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 好吧，让我们做第一个和最后一个，因为我想我今天早上读了那篇文章，我从未听说过这项技术。
 你还记得它叫什么吗？
 这是他们收到的盒子。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2505.07s">[Scalise]</a>: 防 Cymex 智能盒。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2507.612s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 就这样。
 是的，我从来没有听说过。
 我很着迷。
 事实上，我今天早上已经用谷歌搜索过了。
 因此，第一个阶段包括啮齿动物问题的三个阶段。
 第一，在建设过程中，法律要求我们付出巨大的努力。
 我可以说它们非常有效。
 事实上，根据法律，我们必须聘请啮齿动物专家。
 在整个施工过程中，这个人必须是我们团队的一员。
 我知道这不是一切，但这是第一步。
 我不知道这项技术是否可行，或者我们合作的害虫防治公司是否使用它。
 我当然愿意要求他们这样做，因为这听起来是一项非常酷的技术。
 第二件事是，你知道，
 我们建造房屋，并试图告诉每个人我们建造非常漂亮的房子。
 所以我最不想看到的就是我的社区内或周围有老鼠出没。
 因此，我需要在这里了解更多信息，假设我们可以在这里继续，马特和格雷格将通过电话成为该地区啮齿动物的专家。
 老实说，我不会因此而获得任何荣誉。
 这将是一种自私的努力，因为我们也不希望这样。
 所以，我们的运营预算中有害虫防治，你可以想象，它有 150 条线，这是其中的项目之一，这是我们将在施工后持续进行的事情。
 是的，就是这样。
 这是第一件。
 第二个是关于第九街的改进以及我们在其他地方所做的事情。
 对这两个问题的简短回答都是肯定的，几乎总是如此，我们知道其中一些是自私的，所以我不会为此承担太多功劳，但我们希望有一个好的社区，而且我不会在绿地上建造。
 我们建造的所有地方都是旧工业建筑或破旧的办公楼，并且没有损害Cappy's的声誉，他们的设施非常好，我在那里购物。
 但我们的目标不是去破坏新的地方。
 它涉及通过继承的房地产改进来改善继承的地块。
 因此，让第九街更具吸引力对我们有利。
 这绝对是我们想和您讨论的事情。
 我们已经对第 9 街一侧进行了规划。
 您知道人行道是什么样子，也知道沥青上的这些切口如何完美地结合在一起。
 你知道我们将拥有一些与之相关的新平台，当然，假设我们继续升级和重建公园大道边境缓冲区，所以你知道它们也必须与之集成。
 所以简短的回答是绝对的：我们想和您谈谈我们可以做些什么来改善第九街。
 我感觉你还有第三个问题。我忘记了一些东西并且错过了一些东西。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2696.694s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 我想你就是下一个。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2700.316s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_30]</a>: 非常感谢您抽出时间。
 你说你是本地人，所以我相信你知道凯西在感恩节和圣诞节期间会非常忙碌。
 是否有人谈论过使用 Cappy 或州或当地警察的销售数据，因为他们总是让人们把车停在人行道上，只是为了观察该区域的车流，以帮助您确定这种规模的建筑物会造成什么样的交通中断？
 因为 Cappy 的大小可能是
 我的意思是，买家可能相当于居住在该建筑物中并驾驶该建筑物的居民。这两件事可以作为数据，包括有多少人，还有多少辆车来来去去，以及它们会引起什么样的骚动，特别是在
 人流量大的时候。
 那么，是否有关于下周尝试收集一些数据的讨论？
 因为今天是感恩节，这意味着与 Cappy's 的交叉路口开放，人们再次聚集，所以将会非常繁忙。
 也许这些数据可以用来确定这种建筑会导致什么类型的交通流或问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2785.256s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 当然，有些只是为了确保我理解这个问题。
 老实说，我们聘请交通顾问的过程还为时过早。通常情况下，当我知道我们能够放心地承担继续下去所必须承担的风险时，我就会开始花这笔钱。
 我会打电话。
 但是但是我会告诉你这个
 他们称之为 ITE。
 当我们雇用这些专业人士时，他们不喜欢使用轶事数据。
 所以我要打个电话，看看是否有办法纳入这一点，因为在我们的时间范围内，你知道，实际上，我们不会，假设我们继续，那将是明年初，你知道，在新年之前我们有很多方框要检查，看看我们是否要继续这样做。
 不幸的是，这意味着当我们进行这些需要几个月的正式研究时，我们已经过了感恩节。
 所以我要问的是：你如何考虑或适应这一点？
 因为如果这对你来说是一个独特的影响时刻，而且这是完全有道理的，我猜你在圣诞节期间可能也会有类似的情况。
 是的。
 你知道他们是如何体现这一点的。
 不幸的是，简短的回答是您可能不会获得真正的流量。
 因此，当我们开始这项工作时，我们会去田野，他们会架起你在路另一边看到的那些小橡胶绳。有时他们实际上会进行物理计数并有一个
 我有一些分析师在团队中工作，他们也在检查它是否运行良好，所以我们诚实地了解这个过程。我怀疑下周我是否能够动员任何人。
 即使我用这样的美元冒了更多的风险。
 但我会找到他们如何解释的答案，因为一年中有一些非常艰难的日子。
 我们将学习如何做到这一点。
 我要说的是，正如我所说，我们还没有聘请一些完成适合应用程序的工作所需的专家。
 但我们雇用真正的螺柱。
 我们不会干扰次要群体。
 所以这些都是真正的科学家，而且实际上是定量的。
 他们是注重计算的人。
 所以我们不要忽视这一点。
 我认为其中一部分是好消息：我们的使用将产生比今天有人可以创建的其他用途更少的流量。
 如果你看一下正确的分区，我面前没有精确的数字，但有人可以带着四层实验室大楼来到这里，接近 300,000 英尺，并且不会有公开听证程序。
 他们只需将计划留在建筑检查员的办公桌上，然后等待 30 天。
 因此，与这里的一些替代用途相比，我们相当温和。
 我不知道我们与 Cappy 的所作所为有什么关系。
 我怀疑可能还多一点。
 但是，是的，我可以说，如果是零售办公室或就业实验室，这些空间通常每 1,000 英尺有四到五辆汽车，而我们每 1,000 英尺大约有一辆汽车，所以我不会说。
 我不会告诉你，这里永远不会有一辆汽车会让你生气，或者会挡住你的路，或者任何可能发生的事情。
 但仅从数量角度来看。
 尤其是在这些假期，会少一些。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3004.034s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 只是在保持诚实方面。
 将会举行公开听证会、场地规划审查和任何类似性质的活动，但如果你是对的，那么这就是合理使用，而且只是一次场地审查。
 也抄吧，虽然我想下一个就是你了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3018.156s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 我想是的，我很欣赏这样做的演示，如果我理解你是对的。
 前三层将是停车场，接下来的四层将是专用的生活空间。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3031.4s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 接下来的5个。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3033.241s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 接下来的 5 个将是住宅空间，共有 250 个单元。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3037.502s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我想现在是 265，它仍然是，你知道，显然我们还没有预测到，它没有那么高，大约是的，你知道，总共可能会有多少个口袋？
 我认为我们建议每个单元多于一个空间。
 我们正在研究该地区的一些其他分区元素，看来该城市允许每个单元有 0.85 或更多的空间。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3061.287s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 所以我们认为...我认为我们的分区范围是从 0.75 到 1.5。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3065.248s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我们认为多一点是合适的，尽管我们同意这是一个过境区。
 因此，答案是每个单元大约有一个空间。
 Micah，这里会有多少个经济适用房？
 我们建议遵循贝德福德的包容性住房规则和条例，所以我认为是 15%。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3084.169s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 您认为这些产品的价格范围是多少？
 不。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3091.353s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 我只是这么说，你知道，我只是对你这么说。
 我无法告诉你它会是什么，因为这已经是多年的工作了。
 但这与你在街对面看到的以及距我们一英里范围内的其他一些新社区的情况是巧合的，我们认为这些社区可以与他们很好地竞争。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3109.89s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 你知道这一点，你知道这一点，我听到企业家想要进来做这件事。
 担忧之一是我们是否有足够的住房来养活自己。
 我想搬到的城市的就业增长潜力。
 现在的问题和答案是，不，我们不这样做。
 所以我认为克里斯汀已经明确表达了这一点。
 但缺点是，您可能是在梅德福市最繁忙的路段、可能是梅德福市最繁忙的角落建造一座建筑。
 DCI 的一些天才认为在所有这些单元的背面开一个切口是个好主意。
 这是当时的一个大错误。我不知道谁想到了这个，但他们所做的只是引导所有这些公寓和公寓的交通和资金，我说，我只是看不出这对国家来说去了哪里。
 但这是个好主意，所以在这种情况下这不是你的错。
 你知道积极的一面。
 你知道，把卡比和门罗消音器带出该地区显然会减少很多交通。
 这是一只猫，你知道，出租车司机每周工作 7 天。
 你知道企业的朝九晚十，而且正如很多人所说，你知道周末有假期。
 你抓不到海龟，不是那么多。
 为了让这些孩子离开那里，你会尽一份力。
 这将阻止一些交通，但在州政府决定承认他们在第九街绕道上犯了一个错误之前，我不知道这些邻居会采取什么措施。
 我希望你能考虑缓解措施，你知道，也许这会帮助他们，你知道，铺平道路。
 我的意思是，我知道这超出了你的能力范围，但这是你的一个很好的姿态。
 我的下一个问题是，您现在是否会屏蔽我所听到的担忧的其他一些人的一些观点？
 我们该如何解决这个问题？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3254.415s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 关于视力，我没有一个好的答案给你。
 你知道，这只是一个有这样的建筑物的区域的功能。
 所以，你知道，我猜有些人不会有那么好的愿景。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3268.188s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 嗯，不，不在你的财产上，但你知道，就像我说的，这是一个非常繁忙的地区。
 现在你知道了，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3276.015s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 这是一个公平的问题。
 这是一个公平的问题。
 我的意思是，我认为从某些人的角度来看，坦白说，我的目标是建造一座足够有吸引力的建筑。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3283.804s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 大楼很好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3285.786s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 重点是，看卡比的屁股不太好。
 我们希望改进一些观点并确保屏蔽。
 我确信有些人可能有意见。
 你知道我们在西南部，你可以看到神秘的河流保护区，我还没见过它们，但我怀疑它们存在，我希望我们的视野至少比门罗的卡皮斯好，但你知道那里肯定会有一些补偿。对此我没有完美的答案。
 是杯子吗？是我说的吗？他们说得对：都是曲线美的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3316.688s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 是的，这是穿过现在的第 9 街的岔道，或者是我们都知道的那条辅助道路，这就是他们所说的，所以你一过桥就沿着 16 号公路走。
 这就是人们大脑中所需要的。
 嗯，就像居民说的那样，这实际上是一条私人道路，销售是城市私人的，我说当他们提出这一点时，我不能，我不敢相信有人付钱去做这件事，这是从该地区最繁忙的道路之一 16 号公路上移除交通的愚蠢行为。
 继续在这些和这个街区后面。
 再说一次，这次事故不是他或其他任何人的错，这完全是 DCR 的错。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3359.618s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 好吧，我会这样说：我们可能无法解决所有这些问题，但是我们可以，我们的专家非常好。
 所以也许我们可以做一些至少是积极的事情。
 我的意思是，在韦斯特伍德，我在交通稳定和非常微妙的事情、急弯和环岛方面做了很多工作。
 有些人讨厌所有这些词语和技巧，但有时我们可以礼貌地温和地阻止一些有效的词语和技巧阻止交通堵塞。
 我们在那里有工具，我们将部署我们的团队来尽可能地管理它们。
 第九街是私人的，这有好有坏。
 我认为从技术上讲，这个包或这些包应该属于中线的中间。
 因此，需要进行一些私人权利管理，我们需要与邻居合作，确保每个人都参与其中，无论沿途发生什么，无论每个人想要发生什么。
 所以这里面有一个很好的民主过程。
 但对此可能有解决方案。
 老实说，我们用来帮助​​创建大部分图像的建筑师是麻省交通部重建该十字路口的指导委员会成员。
 因此，存在很多对称性，如果我们有能力接受其中的一些反馈，以及我们将得到的一些反馈以及我们将要考虑的问题，我们也许能够
 你可能无法修复它，但它会产生比你想象的更积极的影响。
 我们会让我们的团队致力于此。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3445.637s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 迈克，你会考虑在高峰营业时间安排某种班车去火车站吗？也许是 7 点到 10 点、4 点到 6 点之类的？
 或者也许连接
 因为我们谈论的是未来的一些发展。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3473.179s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 我们肯定会看看这个。
 老实说，我想如果在高峰时段巴士离开我们的位置去惠灵顿。
 距离我们住的地方大约有六分钟的步行路程，我不再是一个非常快的绅士。
 所以，你知道，你可以很快到达那条人行道，这还不包括十字路口的人行横道。
 所以，但我们拭目以待。
 我不会说不，但我怀疑其中一件事。
 我很抱歉。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3501.709s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 我只想插话一下。
 步行不到六分钟。
 大约15分钟。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3506.753s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 迈克，穿过 16 号公路，你就失去了一切。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3511.616s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，卡梅洛先生，我现在不会拒绝。
 我想我们得看看这个。
 如果该地区有 TMA，我们经常会被要求加入 TMA 并为其做出贡献。
 所以我们肯定会关注他们的表现。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3523.705s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 但据您所知，您说您可能正在梅德福市最繁忙的角落建造建筑。
 所以他们说，你知道，积极的一面是你通过 cappies 和 Monroe 获得了相当多的流量，尤其是 cappies，它每天 24 小时开放。
 我认为与现在相比，居民们会看到一些，也许是一些缓解和交通。
 所以，

 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3561.56s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 凯西，我觉得你沉默了。
 我沉默了。
 黛布拉·卡兰特（Debra Carante），您之前有一个问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3568.025s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 是的。
 基本上，我在这里利用了其他评论。
 主要担心的是我住在 Parkway Plaza South 公寓，面向 16 号公路。
 这里非常拥挤。
 现在想要离开 9 号公路是非常困难的。
 如果您尝试在路上出行，16 号公路和惠灵顿环岛的交通状况非常糟糕。
 在我看来，我担心建造这样一个大型综合体会导致令人难以置信的拥堵。
 这是我主要关心的问题。
 另外，我认为是琳达提出了啮齿动物问题，她已经谈过了。
 但我认为挖掘和建设过程中将会发生一场灾难。
 最后，这个新的综合体会影响我们的房产价值吗？
 我的意思是，我认为人们不想住在如此拥挤、拥挤的地区。
 而正如里克刚才所说，这个区域是梅德福最拥堵的区域。
 我的意思是，这会降低我们的财产价值吗？
 因为我们都在这里拥有公寓。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3646.851s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 迈克，我不是房地产评估专家。
 但我怀疑他是在一家酒类商店后面使用汽车的幕后黑手，这并没有抹黑卡皮的优秀机构。
 这对你来说是一个更好的邻居。
 所以麻省理工学院有研究。
 我想，这是 15 年前完成的，他们非常投入，而且是两令厚纸，不幸的是我读了它。
 他们发现，混合收入社区几乎单方面提高了邻居的价值观。
 所以我只想说，我不是一个评估师，但我必须想象，有一个像这样友好的一流邻居，除了那里的用途之外，还会帮助你，或者肯定不会损害你的价值观。
 你们用老鼠变得有点紧张来吓唬我。
 让我们来分析一下这个相当困难的承诺。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3704.461s">[Maria D'Orsi]</a>: 谢谢。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3738.621s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 所以，凯西，我可能需要你教我如何打开这里的聊天室来查看它。
 我看到他们出现了。
 出色地。
 我们有一个棘手的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3749.926s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 如果你愿意，我们可以
 口头提问。
 嗨，迈克，感谢您的介绍。
 我们在西百汇广场。
 我们只是另一个邻居。
 很高兴认识你。
 感谢您组织这次活动。
 所以我们有一些简单的问题。
 首先，您认为这样的构建需要多长时间？
 你提到，我知道这还为时过早，但你认为什么时候可以开始？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3785.098s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的。
 因此，此类项目的建设可能需要 2,024 个月。
 我想说的是大部分。
 大楼已经搭建完毕，我们的孩子们会在里面忙碌。
 所以，但是，是的，我想说的是，从开放和拆除来看，有两个；无论哪种方式，在当前市场上大约需要两年的时间。
 至于何时开始建设，我不敢告诉市政府他们的审批流程需要多长时间，但通常需要一年左右的许可时间，然后再需要六到九个月的设计和工程时间。
 因此，只要我们能够继续下去，这就是一个很好的出路。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3836.325s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 谢谢。
 对附近建筑物的干扰怎么办？
 就像我们一样，在施工期间，或者，你知道，施工完成后。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3849.11s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 当然。
 我们会开始，我们会做，我们会做，你知道，测试我们周围的所有建筑物，并确保它们在我们做任何事情之前都结构健全且完好无损。
 这当然是一项艰苦的工作。
 但如今，所有这些建筑物都是使用中央起重机建造的。
 因此，总的来说，一切都是从内到外构建的。
 然后
 就对我们周围建筑物的影响而言，我们在许多城市地区、像这样的非常小的地方、通常靠近住宅用途的地方都致力于研究这一问题。
 所以我们的想法是，我们用不透明的网格搭建一个漂亮的高围栏，这样你就不必看到我们在幕后所做的很多事情。
 幸运的是，这种类型的施工并不是一个非常嘈杂的施工过程。
 我们当然会在公开听证会上与市政府和像您这样的人合作，讨论什么是适当的工作时间，以及诸如此类的事情。
 我们不打扰你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3917.32s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 谢谢。
 我们非常感谢有机会进行交谈，因为这确实很有帮助。
 最后一个简单的问题是，五层楼有超过 260 个单位，只是出于好奇，平均单位面积是多少？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3931.2s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 920左右吐就可以了。
 第945章 是的。
 所以我们认为统一在概念上是混淆的，这就是我们如何从那些大的橙色方框中得到统一的大致含义。
 我们认为这里最重要的是对一系列产品进行编程。
 梅德福在收入水平、教育、就业类型和交通方式等多个方面都非常多样化。
 因此，我们认为适合单间公寓和小型床位的单位数量较少。
 这些人往往是我们最入门的租房者，他们还没有与女孩或男孩结婚，正在走向职业生涯的第二站。
 因此，这是一个非常强劲的季度市场。
 听起来你是单身，在你的职业生涯中更进步，或者可能稍稍落后，你仍在从事你的第一份或第二份职业工作，但你已经结婚并且有女朋友或男朋友。
 你喜欢它。
 因此，在我们最近的研究中，我们认为肯定有空间容纳两间卧室和更大的单元类型，但随着我们继续研究，比我们想象的要少一些。
 所以谢谢你。
 你知道，我们必须不断努力找出为梅德福服务的正确市场组合。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4018.142s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 谢谢。
 我想问我们董事会主席一个问题。
 她要我问她，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4024.407s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，我想知道您是否可以在施工开始之前对建筑物进行结构审查。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4030.666s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 你能听到这个吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4032.069s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我们在研究、研究过程中还没有取得那么大的进展。
 你知道，我认为我们不需要，你知道，例如，我们不会开车，我认为我们不需要打桩或类似的东西。
 但通常情况下，如果现场出现一些重大干扰，如果我们正在挖洞或打桩，或者如果我们正在所有区域进行地震分析，我们都会聘请一些专门从事这方面工作的公司。
 尤其是当你靠近另一座建筑物时
 我们正在沃尔瑟姆开展一个项目，距离一些邻居大约 12 英尺。
 所以，你知道，我们使用地震监测仪和各种高科技设备来确保我们不会对邻居做任何坏事。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4078.827s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 谢谢。
 还有人想确认一切都是统一的，并且不会对企业进行分区。
 像星巴克这样的零售店，或者你知道的等等。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4089.758s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我们有一个很好的问题。
 你知道，我们当时正在考虑街对面的车站着陆点，并认为可能需要考虑在一楼增加商业用途。
 但你知道，今晚提出的交通问题是我们真诚期待的。
 我亲自看到了与 MassDOT 的一些会议以及他们如何重新安排这个路口。
 你知道，额外的流量会影响对
 我们认为，涉及零售业带来的额外流量和时间影响的事情将会非常负面，以至于它可能会给我们带来负面的影响。
 我们正在努力解决的另一件事情的需求量很大。
 你知道，如果有一个好的零售场所，我只想说，希望在这个区域开设的零售店更像是街对面车站着陆处的零售店。
 例如，像现在这样，如果不是自助服务，你就不能向星巴克租用空间。
 还有许多零售商，包括其他咖啡店，也在走这条路。
 某种咖啡馆或咖啡店似乎是这里的正确用途。
 当我们考虑到所有这些以及对交通的影响时，我们决定消除这部分概念。
 因此，值得进一步讨论，但老实说，从交通和影响的角度来看，这对社区和位置来说都会更糟糕。
 最后一件事是，如果你做得不完美，那么生意就不会出租。
 即使你知道，即使更少，我们还是决定以远低于市场的价格销售它。
 从城市规划的角度来看，空置和退化的空间是一个真正的问题，会带来各种负面结果，所以我很高兴你问这个问题，因为我们花了很多时间研究和讨论它，这就是为什么我们只讨论住房和相关用途。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4209.242s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 你好，我叫吉恩。
 我还有一个问题。
 您说过将为每个单位提供一辆车的停车位。
 现在许多单位或大多数单位都有两辆车，因此该地区没有地方可以停车。
 你会怎么做呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4227.406s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 两件事。
 一是我不同意你的观点。
 我们的大多数居民不在家里使用汽车，甚至在我们的住宅区也不使用汽车，因为我们的住宅单元更大，而且人口年龄更大、专业性较差。
 我们没有达到每单位平均拥有 2 辆车的水平。
 但即使我错了，我也会告诉你一件事，我会把我的钱押在我嘴上所说的、我们在哪里做这个项目和其他项目上。
 我们当然是
 我们担心有人可能将车停在受影响区域的街道上，尤其是在本例中的第 9 街。
 我们可以制定一个简单的条款，将居民在场外停车定为非法，并通过合同强制他们这样做。
 我以前也这样做过。
 这是很容易做到的事情。
 如果这是社区或城市认为重要的事情，我们可以用同样严厉的措施来限制它。
 不，我不认为会是这样，我认为 O 有点舒服。
 我认为我们的竞争对手可以将每辆汽车的数量减少到 0.75 辆或一辆车，或者每辆汽车 0.85 辆。
 老实说，我认为梅德福的分区在这方面相当进步。
 他们不能，显然他们做了一些研究，因为我们经常这样做，这种分析不可能是巧合。
 他们确切地知道这个客户在做什么。
 所以，哦，哦，
 在像剑桥这样的城市，我被迫减少停车。
 他们鼓励我多去其他地方。
 我们对此有很多研究。
 从商业角度来看，我们知道我们需要什么。
 如果我们没有足够的停车位供客户使用，他们就不会向我们租赁。
 因此，我最不想做的就是不必要地限制停车，因为这会损害我们的业务。
 但如果你不相信我的话，我会用我的钱来限制你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4346.218s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 抱歉，我只有最后一个问题。
 这是让.
 车库和大楼的入口位于米德尔塞克斯大道，而不是第九街。
 这是正确的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4358.503s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 从这个概念来看，这是正确的。
 我们有一种感觉，你们不希望我们把新车放在第九街上。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4363.785s">[Unidentified]</a>: 谢谢。
 卡拉维耶洛参赞。
 谢谢，凯茜。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4374.114s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 如果您正在谈论购买那个小角落单元，那么我可能会为您提供一两件事，该单元功能如此强大，以至于为了使其成为这样，我们的房产必须使其更加统一。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4387.761s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 辅导员，您建议我如何回答这个问题？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4392.414s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 我不知道。
 我的意思是，它显然会改善你的财产并使其看起来更好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4402.718s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 因为你拥有一切，你知道，我要说这个，我要说这个，我嫁给了一位城市规划师，她很坚强。
 这已经成为一些讨论的主题。
 我不会错过它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4413.563s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 我不想离开这处房产。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4416.425s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 简而言之，我拍摄了几次但没有成功。
 不，我只是好奇。
 我宁愿这样。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4423.15s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 但没关系。
 你还提到了停车问题。
 如果你去Rivers Edge, Moderna或者Rivers Edge, Moderna公寓，停车场不会满的。
 带汽车的 Rivers Edge 单位也没有。
 我认为双车停车日是指两辆车都在外面。
 可能有些人拥有两辆车，但基本上都是年轻人，所有的 Uber 都在那里，有些人甚至不再拥有汽车了。
 看看那里的新公寓楼 Moderna 和 Rivers Edge。
 他们会告诉您，他们都有停车场，并且有足够的空间可以停车。
 拥有汽车的人已经不够了。
 谢谢你，让我们这样做吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4469.202s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 最后一个问题，玛丽·哈里斯，然后我们将去飞机垃圾箱。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4475.105s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 是的，我很欣赏我关于停车或汽车的问题，这是非常有效的，我担心我的问题会有点不同。
 所以我怀念你的开始
 迈克，你的演讲和我还没有确切地听到你计划构建多少个故事。
 我的问题是：那些会影响我们游泳池等地方的阴影呢？
 你知道，在夏天，当我们坐在一起试图找点乐子时，这会产生什么影响？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4511.768s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，第一个是我们提出了八层的订阅，我们在这里看到一个八层的社区。
 就像16号公路南北侧附近的情况一样，我们当然认为再往上走就不合适了。
 因此，从平行研究的角度来看，坦率地说，我们还没有做到这一点。
 这在许可过程中并不罕见。
 我怀疑我们会在这里这样做。
 所以我道歉。
 我不知道你的游泳池到底在哪里，但我们可以调查一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4546.449s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 它面向第九街。
 他就在凯西后面。
 当我不在的时候，我可以看到凯西的屋顶。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4554.171s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 出色地。
 是的。
 我的意思是，简短的答案是我们肯定会研究和分析的。
 很抱歉，我没有一个好的、准确的答案给你，这将是许可过程的一部分。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4566.864s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 随着你的进步。
 谢谢。
 我认为我们在聊天中的大部分内容已经得到解答，但让我们回顾一下提出的问题：为什么是出租而不是公寓？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4587.23s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 有一些很好的答案，但简短的答案是联盟住宅公司根本不建造公寓。
 我们是一家私营公司。
 这是我们与一些竞争对手的区别所在。
 你知道，我们不是一个由投资银行支持的团体。
 我们每年建造很多房子，有些年份比其他年份都多，但我们实际上是四个主要合作伙伴。
 我们是完全私有的。
 这是我们总部所在地菲尼克斯的员工竭尽全力阻止投资者参与的事情。
 因此，在建造公寓时有一个事后的想法，这是他们只是决定不想做的事情。
 所以这是一个结构性和程序性的事情，我们只是不这样做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4638.742s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 我想我们回答了问题并讨论了第 9 街以及房间的数量，1、2 和 3。我认为你做对了，迈克。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4650.185s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 我认为是的，从概念上讲，我们仍然处于某种变化之中，所以我们一直在谈论我们的单位类型，但你知道，这是一个有趣且不断变化的市场。
 因此，这种组合一直在变化，但我们想到的主要是一居室和两居室社区。
 当然也会有一些更大和更小的单位。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4670.697s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 接下来的问题是基础设施会发生什么变化。
 嗯，新建筑的水压有所下降。
 你知道，有人可能会回答说，制造的所有东西都必须经过工程和检查。
 通过工程确保基础设施能够支持新增建筑。
 我不知道你是否想对此添加任何内容。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4693.424s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 我可以补充一点。
 我可以告诉你，答案几乎肯定是否定的。
 我们已经对水进行了测试。
 我们测试一下我们需要的所有实用程序是否都可用。
 当然是所有电信和通讯。
 那里有很多水，水压也很好。
 此外，我们的建筑很高，可能和你们的一样，需要自己的水泵。
 如果这是一座五层或以下的建筑，那就不会了。
 如果我们能提出的话，这座建筑是一个非常可靠的建议。
 我认为你不会有那样的影响。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4731.129s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 其他问题之一是：是否会有工会或非工会工作？
 我知道这也是该项目的早期阶段。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4739.397s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我只想说这通常是一个很棒的组合。
 这取决于。
 卡车司机和混凝土工几乎都是工会的起重工和木匠。
 然后是一些业务，但我们在所有方面都提供有竞争力的报价。
 但非常非常简短的答案是我们还不知道。
 在到达那里之前我们还有很多工作要做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4759.341s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 您是否询问是否要为现有居民添加公共区域、长凳、遮荫树以及现有居民可以使用的任何东西？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4771.045s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的。
 我的意思是，我认为这符合我们一开始所讨论的精神，我们考虑归还西侧和南侧的一些沥青，这些沥青原本打算成为通往神秘岛的道路。
 费尔斯威 (Fellsway) 的预订。
 当然，我的意思是，我认为从技术上讲它将是私有财产，但你知道，它将连接到该地区的所有人行道和人行横道以及一切。
 所以简短的回答是肯定的。
 在这些领域，我们相信我们可以为这些空间带来许多改进。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4805.474s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 我认为大多数其他验证问题都已经得到解答，除了一个关于通过电子邮件发送会议视频的问题，当然我的电子邮件在发送的信中，我可以尝试这样做。我知道由于会议规模的原因，我在上次会议上遇到了一些困难。
 将此信息传达给人们，但通常会发布在梅德福会议网站上并且会在那里。
 如果人们想看一下，你当然可以给我发电子邮件，我会尽力获得一个链接来提供它。
 我想聊天就到此为止。
 还有问题。
 所以我要感谢大家的到来，迈克，你是说。
 我就问几句吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4856.578s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我只想说这是一个令人难以置信的投票率。
 我很感谢你们所有人。
 你带来了非常高级的问题。
 你们是一个经过充分研究的群体。
 所以，感谢您的参与。
 这是我们，你知道，我所做的，我提到过我住在当地。
 这是我真正热衷的事情：在大波士顿地区建造房屋。
 这些都是好问题。
 这些是我们在所有企业中管理的事情。
 我想我，
 我将保留我过去所做的道具工作。
 我们和其他人一样擅长解决所有这些问题，所以我们想成为好邻居，我们建造房屋，你知道，这不是一个建造零售店的实验室，也不是说我们建造一个我们想要确保人们真正愿意留下来并享受你们所喜欢的地方的地方有什么问题。
 因此，感谢您邀请我们并让我们知道是否还有其他问题被遗漏，也许我们将有最后一次机会回顾它们</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4912.428s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 人们对施工、施工期间施工车辆停放在哪里以及消防栓是否因安置而失去第 9 街的停车位等问题都存在疑问。
 消防器材等</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4928.465s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 我想说可能不会。
 这实际上取决于消防部门，但在像这样的建筑物中，我们会在建筑物内有一些软管连接。
 所以，我的意思是，如果消防队长想要一个消防栓，他肯定会这样做，但我不认为如果是这样的话，它不会影响任何停车。
 因此，第一个问题，即之前关于停车施工车辆的问题，这是一个大问题，特别是在场外，这就是简短的答案。
 你知道，当我们，
 对不起，当我们进入施工阶段时，我们需要进行全面的后勤研究、劳工研究，我认为我们现在在施工中拥有的所有工作，我们的承包商都在使用大量的场外停车场，所以我们关闭了所有人。
 因此，如果担心他们会开始封锁第九街，答案是否定的，让我们的孩子们远离吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4982.985s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 还有一个问题，你知道，邻居们怎么知道你是否要继续进行？我认为这些将是公开听证会。
 如果这能实现的话。
 你知道，我认为下一步是确定它是什么。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4998.898s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我只想说，如果我们继续的话，可能不会在假期之前。
 我们在本次会议中使用了相同的通知结构来通知相邻各方，我们将在任何其他公开会议或听证会过程中使用该通知结构。
 所以简短的回答是：我认为它们可能看起来很像这样。
 如果我们继续前进，我们会在您的收件箱中看到一些内容。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=5023.622s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 会议到此结束，祝大家感恩节快乐、平安，节日期间照顾好自己，感谢大家的聆听。
 谢谢。</p>
