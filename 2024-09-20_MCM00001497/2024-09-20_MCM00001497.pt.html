    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=0.091s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Boa noite a todos.
 Kathleen não toca em nossos escritórios.
 Estou aqui esta noite.
 Parece que acabou para Julian, CEO de uma empresa residencial da aliança na Nova Inglaterra.
 e Matthew Harrity, gerente de desenvolvimento de alianças residenciais.
 Em primeiro lugar, gostaríamos de agradecer a todos pela participação nesta reunião comunitária sobre a possível remodelação das propriedades localizadas em 5.73 Bells Way, que é a Cappies Liquor Store em 20 Revere Beach Park Way Monroe Muffler Break.
 O objetivo deste encontro é apresentar o projeto que está em fase preliminar 19 comentários de vocês, moradores do bairro.
 Antecipamos a apresentação.
 Aproximadamente 15 a 20 minutos após a apresentação haverá oportunidade para perguntas e comentários. Alocamos aproximadamente uma hora para esta reunião.
 Em termos de regras básicas gerais.
 Peço-lhe que permaneça em silêncio até ser chamado a falar.
 Além de fazer perguntas ao grupo.
 Você também pode tirar suas dúvidas e comentários no chat, e iremos discuti-los nos últimos cinco a 10 minutos da reunião.
 Peço-lhe que evite enviar mensagens privadas diretas, apenas porque é difícil coordenar o chat e monitorizar uma mensagem privada.
 Então, se você tiver alguma dúvida, pode colocá-la no chat em grupo e nós iremos analisá-la.
 E com isso, passarei a apresentação a Mike Bajulian, CEO da Alliance Residential.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=90.257s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Tudo bem.
 Obrigado, Kathy.
 Boa noite a todos.
 Como Kathy mencionou, meu nome é Mike Bejulian.
 Sou o parceiro regional da Alliance Residential Company na Nova Inglaterra.
 Somos uma construtora multifamiliar de âmbito nacional.
 Porém, administramos cada região virtualmente como se fosse uma operação própria.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=112.722s">[Unidentified]</a>: E deixe para lá agora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=113.903s">[Maria D'Orsi]</a>: Gravação em andamento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=117.704s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Desculpe.
 De qualquer forma, administramos nossa empresa em cada divisão.
 Portanto, embora sejamos um grupo nacional com sede em Phoenix, nossos escritórios ficam em 184 High Street, em Boston.
 Nasci, cresci e ainda moro em Arlington.
 E toda a nossa equipe está localizada aqui em Boston.
 Então, se você não se importa, mantenha o microfone mudo para que possamos ter alguma interferência.
 Esta noite estamos aqui para falar sobre uma possível remodelação de 2 lotes em Medford.
 Quero ressaltar que não temos apenas os terrenos atualmente contratados e estamos em um período de estudos em que estamos avaliando um pouco a viabilidade de uma possível requalificação desses terrenos.
 Honestamente, isto é um pouco mais cedo do que normalmente realizaríamos uma reunião de bairro deste tipo.
 Normalmente teríamos ido um pouco mais longe no processo.
 e tem detalhes um pouco melhores.
 Acho que temos algumas boas respostas e alguns bons pontos de discussão para conversar com vocês esta noite.
 Mas, para ser claro, este material não faz parte de uma candidatura formal, e ainda não estamos formalmente perante qualquer conselho municipal ou conselho municipal para analisar este projeto.
 Então, novamente, peço apenas sua paciência.
 Este é um material preliminar.
 Talvez não tenhamos todas as respostas para suas perguntas.
 Provavelmente podemos conversar com eles com bastante detalhes.
 E é por isso que estamos entusiasmados em fazer perguntas e respostas com você.
 Ao longo do próximo mês ou depois, completaremos nosso período de estudo para o projeto.
 Portanto, provavelmente não é surpresa que o mundo e a sua economia estejam num certo fluxo neste momento.
 Estamos agindo com cuidado para garantir que não cometeremos erros enquanto navegamos nestes tempos turbulentos.
 Posso preparar a apresentação para você?
 Em alguns momentos compartilharei minha tela e mostrarei alguns dos conceitos que desenvolvemos, a localização e o contexto do site e outras coisas.
 Como Kathy mencionou, fique à vontade para preparar qualquer dúvida que você tenha sobre o projeto no chat do Zoom.
 Estamos gravando isso.
 Examinaremos isso no final e tentaremos responder a todas as questões da melhor maneira possível.
 Com isso, tentarei compartilhar minha tela.
 E por favor, tenha paciência comigo.
 Eu não uso muito o Zoom.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=265.599s">[Unidentified]</a>: Bem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=280.245s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  So these first slides we're going to start with are really just to get you acclimated with the neighborhood.
 I know that sounds silly because many of you live in the immediate area.
 However, we want to just make sure we all get started on the same page and talk about a little bit about the context for where we started our studies and conceptual program for the site.
 So the first one here is, of course, this is East Medford.
 Route 16 runs right across the page left to right.
 And the Fellsway and Middlesex Avenue run north to south.
 The taped site in yellow is the assembled parcels.
 Cappy's is the larger sort of hexagonal building.
 And Monroe Muffler is here on the east side on the property line.
 So the combined site,
 which again are 573 Fellsway, which is Cappy's Liquors, and 20 Revere Beach Parkway just to the east is the Monroe Muffler Shop.
 You'll see to the south here, Station Landing, the Mystic River Reservation off to the southwest, and the shopping centers up to the northwest.
 Of course, Wellington Station is at about 430 on your page.
 We've got a few axios here to show the immediate neighborhood.
 Again, these are really just to kind of show context of how the site fits in with the larger areas.
 We've turned the camera a bit on you.
 So, Route 16 or Revere Beach Parkway is running off to the east towards the top of Page and the Fellsway down to the right and Middlesex Avenue and the Fellsway up to the left.
 Cappy's there is just left of center.
 So obviously the neighborhood really is, you know, primarily seven and eight-story mixed-use buildings, quite a bit of housing in high-rise format.
 And you'll see Wellington just off top right of page.
 We'll flip the camera a bit here and looking southeast now, Cappies again just left of center, Route 16 traveling up and to the left of your screen, and station landing off across, southerly across Route 16 there.
 So looking at these photos, we like this site in the city for a lot of reasons.
 Medford's a great city.
 It features anything a modern resident would want, which is, of course, our business.
 The city is close to Boston, which in itself is always attractive.
 But really, it already has its own deep bench of employment of retail of walkability open space and history so all of those things stitched together to where, where, where our customers would want to live, they want to be close to home, they want to be able to walk to amenities, you know, nobody really wants to be in their car.
 And we've spent some time studying this intersection.
 Growing up in Arlington, I know this intersection well.
 So getting out of your car in this neighborhood is certainly an attractive thing, and Medford offers the ability to do that.
 And this site is really a microcosm more broadly of Medford, having all of those things I just mentioned within sometimes less than 1,000 feet of walking.
 Macro as a Bostonian, this is the type of modern housing I think greater Boston needs and regionally we need in eastern Massachusetts, where people even in cold weather aren't required to get into their vehicle to get a coffee to travel to work to pick up a prescription or to go get a classic roast beef at Kelly's across the street.
 So
 I'm going to move into some site photographs.
 I'm sure you guys are all relatively familiar with this, but I feel like we just want to be thorough.
 So this is a shot looking north of Cappy's, somewhat northeast, with 9th Street just in the back.
 You'll see a blue double two-story home on the left side of the screen with a garage.
 That is the 9th Street area.
 Monroe is just off to the right of your screen.
 This is a shot from Revere Beach Parkway on one of the many curb cuts on these two parcels.
 So we're looking straight north across the property line between Monroe and the Cappy site.
 This is a shot from 9th Street looking south.
 So Station Landing is in the background.
 Monroe is on just left of center and Cappy's, the back of Cappy's is just right of center.
 So you're looking at the intersection basically concealed only by the Cappy's.
 And then this is also a 9th Street shot looking the other direction.
 So you can see Boston Tattoo here in the background and the 9th Street intersection, current intersection and curb cut with Cappy's.
 So this last is an obvious satellite image of the site.
 We've oriented this North and South so we can stop getting you guys dizzy.
 9th Street runs East and West across the top of the site.
 This is Middlesex Avenue on the left, and again, Route 16 on the bottom.
 The property isn't taped, but it is this L-shaped combination of these two parcels, not including the Boston Tattoo Company.
 This is a good start to show where the site planning begins for us, apart from the macro context of the area and the uses that are here and the amenities.
 This is really where we start trying to integrate and stitch those things together into a program.
 On the left and on the south of the site, we're bound by these two roads or parkways.
 These were
 These are actually very interesting if you don't know the history, but these were formerly, like many parkways in greater Boston, were run by the MDC, now DCR.
 The spirit of these roads was effectively, as we were becoming an automobile-focused society, to have a pleasure-driving avenue to explore the area's benefits.
 So you, I'm sure, are all familiar with the Middlesex Bells.
 and the Mystic River reservations.
 These are really just spectacular green spaces, and the former MDC knew that, and they knew that they wanted people to experience those in a pleasurable way.
 So on the south side of the site, you'll see there's a pretty deep, for an urban zone like this, a pretty deep setback with mature trees and paths.
 Believe it or not, there's actually a deed restriction on these sites that allows the parkways to remain what their original intent was.
 So while we might not be putting around in a 57 Chevrolet enjoying the Mystic River Reservation here today,
 I drive on at least three parkways on the way to work every day.
 These are commuter roads now.
 But there's still an opportunity here, we think, to maintain the spirit of what these parkways were initially for.
 And one thing we found interesting was that on the west side of this site, along the Middlesex Avenue, it's paved right to the sidewalk.
 and there so those setbacks and deed notes actually exist there as well and so one of the things we thought might be attractive and seems to mate with some of the intersection plans being discussed is is an ability to use that even though it is on this property rather than leave it as asphalt is to try and continue that parkway um parkway spirit the paths put mature trees and native plantings there and the like um so
 We think restoring that buffer could be a real opportunity.
 So I'm going to move to the next shot.
 This is an actual concept we're working with.
 And it's roughly centered on the page as this is.
 So again, you'll see the, well, mislabeled Fellsway.
 That's technically Middlesex, of course, but Revere Beach Parkway on the bottom.
 And you'll see how we're looking at really adding back into those buffer zones, as I mentioned before, some of the green spaces.
 A number of other things worth highlighting as we get into this we're going to show you some more details on on how we program space conceptually.
 This community's proposed at 265 units of rental housing, we do not build condominiums in an eight story format with 100% of the resident parking enclosed within the building so.
 A lot of the surface parking areas that are on the perimeter of the area and nearby sites, we're going to instead work to green those up and bring the parking inside the envelope completely.
 We'll talk a little more about the rest of the program.
 But to get you started, effectively, we craft these communities so that they are a completely enclosed community.
 And so by that I mean, while this looks like a pretty normal building,
 from the outside, all of our building systems are located internally.
 So, trash, refuse collection and recycling, separation, emergency services and access, all of our amenities, or most of the amenities, I should say, that are internal to the site.
 Everything is neatly encapsulated within the envelope of the building we propose here.
 So, you'll see on the site, there's donut shape is primarily the mass of the building.
 However, there is a hole in the middle and we'll use that courtyard to have some outdoor private space for residents.
 That's a little more private than perhaps walking across the street to the mystic river.
 But typically, and we'll show you some photos of how we treat these spaces.
 But these spaces typically have a large pool deck, sort of resort styled.
 We'll have outdoor cooking areas, lounges and cabanas and that sort of thing.
 A space where, you know, to kind of center the entire community around.
 On the upper left of the page, you'll note we've got a curb cut proposed here off of Middlesex.
 And in fact, to expand on that, the site currently features five curb cuts.
 And I'm sure we'll spend a lot of time talking about traffic and parking here.
 But the big story here is we're going to try and eliminate all of those curb cuts but one.
 We have not engaged a traffic engineer at this time.
 However, we've done enough of these to know that on a busy intersection like this, particularly one that's in flux for its future, that the less interruption and the less curb cuts that you're delivering traffic onto, the better.
 Excuse me.
 So our goal here would be to eliminate as many of those curb cuts in this planet, four of the five would be would be removed from the site.
 Inside the garage, so residents will drive into the building here, just above where it says loading, and there'll be three levels of parking.
 So the first three levels of the program would all be structured parking and other building services, and then all of the housing, but for a very few units, would be located on floors four and above.
 So we're gonna dig into the building here a little bit.
 This would be the first level if you were to just shave everything on floors two through eight off.
 And so as you arrive, you'll see the only surface parking we're proposing is just at the amenity area.
 That's also where we would have our 24-hour leasing and staff located.
 So future residents might use these spaces if they were to come look at a home or to check out the community.
 So that that sort of area all on the west side labeled as amenity would be a two story volume focused on the leasing and then a number of different amenities, which we'll talk a little bit about later.
 but primarily work from home type spaces, screening rooms, flex spaces.
 And we'll show you some of the other examples of what we do for fun in those spaces.
 So those would be separated from the garage element.
 The next two levels above this would also be parking served by internal ramps.
 So invisible to the outside.
 This would be an upper garage.
 parking floor like two or three you'll note that now above the common program area will add some homes and there'll be some again on the south side until we get to the upper residential floors, such as this where it'll be all housing on force for and above.
 So we'll also in these upper floors probably have some amenities.
 We're finding that most surprising amount of people are not going back to the office.
 And so the flex time and work from home spaces are becoming an important part of our business.
 So while some people may go to work, the typical customer here is working in a high tech or an R&D type
 And those have, you know, non traditional non nine to five types of hours.
 So we're now building our amenities to make those spaces more pleasurable and make your sort of to help you separate work from home, even when you are near home, as you would be in this.
 So we've added some, these shots are what we call axiometrics.
 These shots were created with the intent to kind of stitch what we're proposing into the neighborhood.
 So you'll notice, like most of the buildings around here, this is also eight stories.
 I think one of the station landing buildings up front is seven.
 but you'll see we're looking to pull things back off of the parkways and contribute back to what that sort of original mission was for those roadways and also just give this a little bit of a softer edge on what is a very hard-edged zone.
 So this we've also picked these spaces to
 try to relate to the aerial views we showed you earlier.
 So where we were showing you a photo very similar to this of the Cappies and Monroe site to show you how this would stitch into those with the massing around it.
 Now, this is a shot looking south, excuse me, southeast.
 So Ninth Street would be just in front of the building here in your view and the Middlesex Avenue and the Fells Way coming basically straight up the page on the right side.
 station landings here in the back.
 We're proposing a lot of verticality.
 This is what we'd call a Vitruvian style building.
 It's very classic.
 We're not sure this is the space based on what's around it.
 There's a lot of brick.
 There's a lot of sort of traditional materials.
 Station landing is a relatively classic and timeless architecture.
 So we didn't feel it was appropriate to use some of the real contemporary modern looks.
 for this space.
 So we stuck with some pretty classic verticality and spacing and dimensions to the building.
 To help you stay oriented, this was the small little future resident parking area, and the garage entry would be right here.
 And again, these first three levels, despite the fact that they look traditional with windows and the like, would actually be just the same cladding, just enclosing the parking structure.
 So this is a similar angle to the one we just showed you just brought down from from the seagull residents of Medford's viewpoint to get you down to a more pedestrian scale.
 Again this is where those future resident spots in the curb cut on the middle section might be and a garage parking entrance here if you can see my cursor moving.
 So
 This is, again, this is an early concept, so this may look developed, and we have looked at a couple of other options, but this is sort of the path we've been going stylistically with the concept.
 Next, we're gonna show you some photos of other projects we've done in Greater Boston that have things that we think at least conceptually belong in a project like this.
 This is a community we built called The Val that we've just finished, or just finishing leasing up.
 And so some of the things you'll note here is a big two-story volume at the arrival.
 I mentioned that there was that amenity labeled space was also amenities, but also our leasing and management staff.
 So this is a good example of how we integrate some of these things.
 On the right side of this feature wall is actually the back of house where at all times you can find somebody on our team working there.
 But there's also this sort of hotel-styled arrival here, which is some of the way
 apartment home communities are going.
 So there's someone here at all times kind of giving you a more full service feeling during the
 well, during regular hours, more full service feeling to the building.
 And then you'll see these two stories and a feature stair.
 This is something we'd like to integrate in this project as well, where we really are stitching together some of these assembly spaces, work from home spaces, or maybe you're just scrolling and rolling with your earbuds in and your music on, but places where this is a little more activated and a little more public.
 This actually, this wall was, we had a local artist custom paint it for us in sort of a thematic nod to the name.
 This is a project we built two years ago called The Cove.
 This is another idea of just some of those sort of flex spaces where this is really,
 more recreational space, obviously a pool table, there's actually a beer tap back there and wine, excuse me, and a wine cooler.
 But this is a space that would also be, we would propose something like stylistically different, of course, right near those amenity and leasing spaces, a little more open concept.
 This is one of our fitness centers we just completed.
 This one's actually done on two levels.
 We had a lot of fun with this one.
 We're utilizing private mirror rooms for online workouts and then of course all the traditional cardio.
 So this one has actually up top of this spiral staircase has a cardio deck and then the rest of your workout is all below here.
 So you can get an idea of how we really want to create an enclosed, fully encapsulated community, but in a very first class way.
 This is a pool deck shot.
 So this is an important one because this is a good analogy for how we would treat that center of the donut type space you saw.
 This is also a green roof on deck.
 These trees, while brand new, will grow to be full 40 foot sugar maples and red maples.
 So we have a team that understands how to put
 full-sized real vegetation on top of a deck.
 Under this is a parking level, not unlike we would propose on this site.
 Then a full, of course, heated pool and resort style, three, four months of the year, great place to hang out with your iPad or just get some sun.
 This is a good example of how we would treat that.
 This is in the same project at the Val I mentioned earlier, similar green roof.
 You know, you'll see something.
 We had some taller trees at the inception here, but, and some lawn back there, which is hard to see, but we fully green up hard and soft scape.
 This one has a cool sun deck where you can throw your chaise lounge right in the water.
 It's heated and, and hang out, you know, we'll have fire, we have a large fire pit.
 And then this one, you can actually see the grilling stations, private grilling areas where you and your friends can kind of hang out.
 and have dinner.
 And then this is just, we just wanted to give you an idea of what some of our apartment homes look like.
 Alliance is a little different than some of our more cookie cutter national competitors.
 I'm not here to throw shade at any of them.
 There's a lot of great groups out there.
 We just really kind of treat each project with a little bit more of a customized approach.
 And so, you know, in our Hingham asset, you know, that was more appropriate to have a little bit more of a coastal New England style and a little bit more classic sort of features.
 You know, at workforce spaces, you might want to be a little cooler, have a little bit more fun with some of the design, a little less safe.
 And then, of course, the unit mix and the lighting and all that changes.
 So this is a good example.
 We actually did two different types of backsplash tile with a custom featured backsplash tile behind the range.
 and sort of things like that.
 But we build, you know, the goal is to build, you know, first class modern housing from connectivity to finishes and the like.
 And so that is that.
 Let's see if I can understand how to put this off.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1583.975s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Podemos abrir para perguntas neste momento e acho que temos que fazer isso de qualquer maneira, se vocês levantarem as duas mãos, se quiserem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1607.608s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Podemos perguntar? Eu não tinha certeza se poderíamos começar a perguntar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1613.152s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Vá em frente, você não está silenciado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1615.393s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sim.
 Ok, perfeito.
 Obrigado.
 Hum, obrigado por mostrar isso, eu acho.
 Primeiro, eu conheço você.
 Bem, primeiro, o que é um corte de meio-fio é tão específico que você gosta do fluxo, eu acho, desta propriedade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1630.277s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, corte de meio-fio é um corte nas calçadas, você ficará desapontado, não é um grande termo artístico simplesmente onde um terreno privado tem um corte nas calçadas, uma entrada de automóveis, basicamente a capacidade de ser uma grande parte da via pública.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1645.285s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bem, e eu sei que você mencionou isso, você sabe, muitas ideias de que as pessoas não necessariamente teriam que usar seus carros e talvez gostariam de trabalhar em casa.
 Você também mencionou que há muitas pessoas do tipo P&D que você conhece que poderiam se mudar para cá.
 Boston, você sabe, é um grande centro para a indústria de biotecnologia, e muitas pessoas, você sabe, parecem estar dirigindo por aí.
 Eles têm que ir ao laboratório.
 Bom.
 E eu sei que você mencionou que ainda estamos nos estágios iniciais, mas acho que a questão é o trecho de tráfego certo.
 Como você leva em conta quem pode entrar, certo?
 Não é como se você estivesse alugando apenas para pessoas que podem estar trabalhando em casa.
 E acho que há muitos motivos para acreditar, você sabe, inclusive eu, que trabalho na indústria de biotecnologia.
 As pessoas saem daqui para Cambridge e Burlington.
 E, você sabe, eu vejo um mundo onde ainda há muitas pessoas nesta indústria que precisam estar no escritório de seus cientistas, o que representa a grande maioria da indústria.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1710.315s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, é uma boa pergunta.
 Há alguns lá, certifique-se de descompactar corretamente.
 Quer dizer, a primeira é, você sabe, essas são estimativas, posso dizer quem são nossos mercados-alvo típicos, posso dizer quem normalmente aluga.
 Mas é claro que estamos construindo casas para todos.
 Tentamos adaptar o nosso produto para perceber quem tem mais interesse em viver num espaço.
 Mas você está absolutamente certo.
 Quero dizer, quero dizer, o
 Os carros são inevitáveis, como se pode verificar em qualquer ponto daquele cruzamento.
 Certamente, algumas pessoas ainda dirigem para o trabalho, quer você esteja na área de biotecnologia ou em uma área mais
 Tenho amigos no Departamento de Defesa, empresas de P&D, e podem ser 2 da manhã.
 quando um determinado processo ou teste é concluído, e todos entram no Slack ou Teams e dizem, ok, vamos lá, e todos se mobilizam e vão embora.
 Portanto, meu argumento é que certamente não iremos direcionar ou atender especificamente a quem alugamos, e receberíamos qualquer pessoa.
 Mas esse é o tipo de pessoa que normalmente vem aqui, você sabe, alguém, alguém pode estar mais interessado em ir para nosso ativo de Hingham na enseada se estiver bem em dirigir muito mais, você sabe, acho que a ideia aqui é que, você sabe, você não precisa entrar no carro para tomar um café, ou ir ao Walgreens ou eles comprarão um rosbife ou algo assim.
 Mas senhor, você provavelmente está diretamente em nosso mercado-alvo do ponto de vista profissional.
 Ele é um jovem profissional, bem educado, você sabe, é exatamente para isso que estamos construindo casas na área metropolitana de Boston.
 Kathy, vou pedir que você me ajude a ativar e desativar o mudo para mãos levantadas, porque nem tenho certeza se tenho autoridade para fazer isso.
 Então confio em você para me ajudar com isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1832.817s">[Unidentified]</a>: Podemos simplesmente pular?
 Ricky, quanto tempo dura?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1843.122s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Acho que devemos abordar o bate-papo aqui primeiro.
 Acho que recebemos uma pergunta dos residentes de Wellington Circle.
 Deseja ativar o som se ainda estiver conectado?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1861.02s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Eu sou tudo.
 Sim, gostaria de lhe perguntar sobre 93.
 Vá em frente.
 É engraçado você dizer isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1872.247s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Havia um senhor lá que estava prestes a perguntar.
 Vá em frente, senhor.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1907.962s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Sim, minha única pergunta foi muito rápida: você estaria disposto a estabelecer uma ponte para pedestres no cruzamento para torná-lo mais fácil de percorrer? Como sinto vontade de ter tantas pessoas adicionais lá, pode ser benéfico ter esse acesso ao T porque atualmente não é viável usá-lo de forma muito eficiente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1933.541s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, quero dizer, vou ser honesto com você, o estado permite cruzar um DC em nossa rodovia para obter uma ponte.
 Ou seja, provavelmente é uma operação para a qual precisaríamos de um pacote substancialmente maior.
 Basta inserir rampas e curvas para deficientes físicos para permanecer em conformidade. Eu olhei para um aplicativo semelhante em Cambridge.
 atravessar o trem suburbano, então adoraria dizer que vamos ver tudo e fazer, mas infelizmente tenho uma boa experiência.
 Sim, isso provavelmente é algo que não poderíamos incluir como parte disso, provavelmente não sobraria nenhuma moradia para depois que a ponte fosse construída.</p>

 A 9th Street não aguenta mais um carro do que já tem, especialmente porque a placa foi colocada na reverenciada Beach Parkway no sentido oeste e oferece uma pausa para a marca.
 Minha unidade fica de frente para a 9th Street todas as manhãs.
 3 ou 4 ônibus escolares todas as tardes.
 Eu vi ônibus urbanos.
 Esta é uma grande preocupação para nós.
 Sei disso porque alguns de meus vizinhos me escreveram.
 As perguntas que estou fazendo e também me preocupam.
 Cuidamos da nossa casa o melhor que podemos com controle de pragas a cada 2 meses. Temos estações de iscas que você está desenterrando com quantas histórias de profundidade.
 para estacionar carros, esse bairro pode se tornar muito indesejável na minha opinião.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2053.406s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: Também não sei como levantar a mão, mas estou ali com Linda.

 Mas tenho o seu número para que você possa participar depois de analisarmos aqueles com as mãos levantadas.
 Temos três na sua frente e estou observando.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2079.292s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Linda, essas são boas preocupações que você notará no plano conceitual, intencionalmente não incluímos um corte na calçada, na verdade eliminamos uma série de cortes na calçada entre esses lotes e a 9th Street.
 Então, você sabe, suspeitávamos que esse seria o caso.
 um tema quente.
 Outras pessoas na cidade nos disseram que a 9th Street estava tendo problemas com isso.
 Acho que há algumas coisas que fizemos de propósito e que tentamos respeitar e manter nossos carros fora do nono lugar.
 Mas acho que há algumas coisas que não fizemos de propósito e que também deveriam ajudar.
 Os três cortes de meio-fio ao longo da Revere Beach Parkway no sentido oeste,
 Neste ponto, você poderia facilmente virar à direita e passar pelo estacionamento de Monroe ou passar pelos estacionamentos de Cappies e entrar na 9th Street para cortar o cruzamento e basicamente eliminar quaisquer semáforos no cruzamento para seguir para o norte na Fellsway ou Middlesex.
 Portanto, acho que as coisas que fizemos de propósito certamente não acrescentarão nenhuma dor nova.
 Mas penso que apenas com o programa de desenvolvimento que estamos a propor, isso basicamente impedirá que todas as pessoas atravessem os cortes do meio-fio para a 9th Street agora.
 Eu diria que isso deveria reduzir um pouco disso.
 Peço desculpas por não saber onde fica a Rua Granite e a placa que você mencionou, vamos encontrar.
 Mas certamente quem estiver passando por esses pacotes não conseguirá mais fazê-lo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2185.727s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Acho que eles me cortaram.
 Ainda posso ouvir você e, ah, estou bem, perdi a placa com a marca no final da 9th Street, que vai do Review Beach Park até as chaves, ok, claro, e o Condomínio Wellington é dono da marca da 9th Street até a Key Factory, além da qual teve várias coisas diferentes desde que estou aqui.
 e a cidade é dona da outra metade.
 Okay, I have parallel, it's parallel to the middle 6 outside.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2221.06s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Portanto, não há muito que possamos fazer nesse lado, mas, novamente, isso certamente eliminaria o corte de tráfego que as pessoas saltam nos semáforos agora.
 E também não estamos propondo adicionar carros esta noite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2236.131s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Sim, porque na verdade quero dizer que aumentou. Estou aqui há quase 30 anos e não acredito o quanto aumentou.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2249.175s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, posso te dizer, Linda, fizemos algumas coisas bem criativas no trânsito da região.

 apresentações e, honestamente, provavelmente respostas melhores.

 Olá, meu nome é Kristen e sou proprietária do Parkway Plaza West.
 Sou a favor deste tipo de desenvolvimento.
 Sinto que as áreas próximas ao transporte público deveriam ter habitações mais densas.
 Mas tenho duas preocupações sobre a construção.
 Um deles é o que outras pessoas disseram.
 na 9th Street, e Linda estava certa, que mesmo se você eliminar esses cortes no meio-fio, as pessoas não tendem a passar pelos estacionamentos porque, francamente, são zonas de desastre, mas elas entram na Brainerd e depois na 9th Street.
 E é uma rua 9, é bem pequena, então uma das minhas primeiras perguntas é: a sua empresa é ou já teve alguma no passado?
 Ele fez algo com as comunidades que construiu para melhorar a rua, talvez como um gesto de boa vontade, porque infelizmente a Ninth Street é uma estrada privada.
 Seria assim, e precisa de melhorias, calçadas, meio-fio, ruas.
 Acho que seria melhor se houvesse, você sabe, talvez uma maneira ou.
 Então minha primeira pergunta é: você teria alguma?
 Sua empresa teria algum interesse ou histórico de ajudar a melhorar a rua?
 Porque mesmo sem os cortes no meio-fio, os moradores começarão a descer Brainerd e entrar na 9th para evitar o cruzamento.
 E a minha segunda pergunta é sobre a mitigação de roedores porque acabei de ler sobre pesadelos com pessoas que têm problemas com roedores quando começam construções em grande escala e
 Li um artigo hoje sobre Somerville e Brookline começando a usar esse sistema de próxima geração chamado caixas inteligentes.
 E sua empresa realiza mitigação básica de roedores em seus trabalhos atuais ou você planeja investir em técnicas de mitigação de nível superior?
 Uh, porque temos muitos proprietários de unidades em um raio muito pequeno de um quarteirão, e acho que seria muito chato se isso criasse um grande problema em relação aos roedores.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2493.5s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Tudo bem, vamos fazer o primeiro e o último porque acho que li aquele artigo esta manhã, onde nunca tinha ouvido falar dessa tecnologia.
 E você se lembra como era chamado?
 Foram as caixas que receberam.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2505.07s">[Scalise]</a>: Caixas inteligentes anti-Cymex.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2507.612s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Isso é tudo.
 Sim, nunca ouvi falar disso.
 Estou fascinado.
 Na verdade, já pesquisei no Google esta manhã.
 Portanto, o primeiro consiste em três estágios na questão dos roedores.
 A primeira é que durante a construção, a lei exige que façamos esforços enormes.
 E posso dizer que eles são tremendamente eficazes.
 Na verdade, por lei temos que contratar um especialista em roedores.
 E essa pessoa tem que fazer parte da nossa equipe durante toda a construção.
 Eu sei que não é tudo, mas é o primeiro passo.
 Não sei se esta tecnologia é viável ou se é utilizada pelas empresas de controlo de pragas com as quais colaboraríamos.
 Certamente estou disposto a pedir-lhes que façam isso porque parece uma tecnologia muito legal.
 A segunda coisa é, você sabe,
 Construímos casas e tentamos dizer a todos que construímos casas muito bonitas.
 Portanto, a última coisa que quero são infestações de ratos dentro ou ao redor da minha comunidade.
 Portanto, preciso aprender um pouco mais aqui, e Matt e Greg, por telefone, se tornarão especialistas em roedores da área, presumindo que possamos continuar aqui.
 E isso é algo pelo qual eu honestamente não aceitaria nenhum crédito.
 Seria um esforço egoísta, porque nós também não iríamos querer isso.
 Então, e a gente tem controle de pragas no nosso orçamento operacional, que tem 150 linhas como vocês podem imaginar, esse é um dos itens aí, é uma coisa que a gente vai fazer depois da construção e de forma contínua.
 Então sim, é isso.
 Essa é a primeira peça.
 A segunda é sobre as melhorias da Ninth Street e o que fizemos em outros lugares.
 A resposta curta para ambas é sim, quase sempre, sabemos novamente que parte disso é egoísta, então não vou levar muito crédito por isso, mas queremos ter um bairro agradável e não construo em terrenos verdes.
 Todos os lugares onde construímos são antigos edifícios industriais ou velhos edifícios de escritórios decrépitos, e sem desacreditar a Cappy's, as suas excelentes instalações, e eu fiz compras lá.
 Mas nosso objetivo não é ir e perturbar algum lugar novo.
 Trata-se de melhorar uma parcela herdada com benfeitorias imobiliárias herdadas.
 Portanto, tornar a 9th Street mais atraente nos beneficia.
 Isso é absolutamente algo sobre o qual queremos conversar com você.
 Já temos planos para o nosso lado da 9th Street.
 Você sabe como são as calçadas e como esses cortes no asfalto se encaixam perfeitamente.
 E você sabe que teremos algumas novas plataformas associadas a ele, presumindo, é claro, que continuemos a atualizar e reconstruir os buffers de fronteira da Parkway, então você sabe que eles terão que se integrar a isso também.
 Portanto, a resposta curta é absolutamente: queremos conversar com você sobre o que podemos fazer para melhorar a 9th Street.
 Eu sinto que você tem uma terceira pergunta. Estou esquecendo alguma coisa e faltando alguma coisa.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2696.694s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: E acho que você é o próximo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2700.316s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_30]</a>: Muito obrigado pelo seu tempo.
 Você disse que é local, então tenho certeza que sabe que o Kathy's fica extremamente ocupado durante o Dia de Ação de Graças e o Natal.
 Houve alguma conversa sobre o uso de dados de vendas da Cappy ou da polícia estadual ou local, porque eles sempre têm pessoas estacionadas nas calçadas apenas para observar o fluxo de carros naquela área para ajudá-lo a determinar que tipo de agitação no trânsito um prédio desse tamanho causará?
 Porque Cappy é provavelmente do tamanho de
 Quer dizer, comprador equivale talvez ao morador que estará naquele prédio e que dirigirá. Essas duas coisas poderiam servir como dados em termos de quantas pessoas, quantos carros a mais entrariam e sairiam e que tipo de comoção causariam, especialmente durante
 Tempos de alto tráfego.
 E com isso, há alguma conversa para tentar reunir alguns dados na próxima semana?
 Porque é Dia de Ação de Graças, o que significa que este cruzamento com o Cappy's está aberto e as pessoas estão se reunindo novamente, será extremamente movimentado.
 Talvez esses dados pudessem servir para determinar que tipo de fluxo de tráfego ou problemas uma construção desse porte causaria.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2785.256s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Claro, alguns e apenas para ter certeza de que entendi a pergunta.
 Volte com um pouco de franqueza, estamos um pouco adiantados no processo de contratação de um consultor de tráfego; Normalmente, eu começaria a gastar esse dinheiro quando soubesse que nos sentimos confortáveis ​​o suficiente para assumir os riscos que temos que correr para continuar.
 Vou fazer uma ligação.
 Mas mas eu vou te dizer isso
 Eles chamam isso de ITE.
 Quando contratamos esses profissionais, eles não gostam de usar dados anedóticos.
 Então, vou fazer um telefonema e ver se há uma maneira de incorporar isso, porque em nosso período de tempo, você sabe, realisticamente, não faríamos, supondo que prossigamos, isso seria no início do próximo ano, você sabe, temos muitas caixas para verificar antes do ano novo para ver se vamos continuar com isso.
 Infelizmente, isso significaria que, quando fizermos esses estudos formais, que levam meses, já teríamos passado do Dia de Ação de Graças.
 Então o que vou perguntar é: como você leva isso em consideração ou adapta?
 Porque se esse é um momento único de impacto para você, e faz todo o sentido que seja, suponho que você provavelmente será semelhante na época do Natal.
 Sim.
 Você sabe como eles incorporam isso.
 Infelizmente, a resposta curta é que provavelmente você não obterá tráfego real.
 Então o que aconteceria é que quando começássemos isso iríamos para o campo e eles colocariam aquelas cordinhas de borracha que você vê do outro lado da estrada. Às vezes eles realmente fazem contagens físicas e têm uma
 Tenho alguns analistas que estão trabalhando na equipe e também estão verificando se funciona muito bem, então conhecemos esse processo com franqueza. Duvido que consiga mobilizar alguém para a próxima semana.
 Mesmo se eu corresse um pouco mais de risco com dólares como esse.
 Mas vou encontrar a resposta para como eles explicam isso, porque há alguns dias realmente difíceis no ano.
 Aprenderemos como fazer isso.
 Direi que, como disse, não contratamos alguns dos especialistas que serão necessários para fazer o trabalho adequado a uma aplicação.
 Mas contratamos garanhões de verdade.
 Não mexemos com grupos secundários.
 Portanto, estes são cientistas reais e, na verdade, quantitativos.
 Eles são pessoas orientadas para o cálculo.
 Portanto, não vamos economizar nisso.
 E acho que parte disso é a boa notícia: nosso uso gerará menos tráfego do que outros usos que alguém poderia criar aqui hoje.
 Se você observar o zoneamento correto, não tenho os números precisos diante de mim, mas alguém poderia entrar aqui com um prédio de laboratório de quatro andares, aproximando-se de 300.000 pés, e não haveria processo de audiência pública.
 Eles simplesmente deixariam as plantas na mesa do inspetor de construção e esperariam 30 dias.
 Portanto, em comparação com alguns dos usos alternativos aqui, somos bastante moderados.
 Não sei como nos relacionamos com o que Cappy faz.
 Eu suspeito que provavelmente seja um pouco mais.
 Mas sim, eu poderia dizer que esse tipo de uso neste lote é um dos usos reduzidos se fossem escritórios de varejo ou laboratórios de empregos, esse tipo de coisa, esses espaços são normalmente quatro ou cinco carros por 1.000 pés e teremos cerca de um carro por 1.000 pés, então não vou dizer.
 Não vou lhe dizer que nunca haverá um carro aqui que o deixará bravo ou que irá interrompê-lo ou qualquer coisa que provavelmente vá acontecer.
 Mas apenas do ponto de vista do volume.
 Principalmente nesses feriados será um pouco menos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3004.034s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Apenas em termos de mantê-lo honesto.
 Haveria uma audiência pública, uma revisão do plano do local e qualquer coisa dessa natureza, mas se você estiver certo, é um uso justo e seria simplesmente uma revisão do local.
 Copie também, embora eu ache que você é o próximo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3018.156s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Acho que sim e agradeço a apresentação para fazê-lo e se entendi você está certo.
 Os primeiros 3 pisos serão de estacionamento e os 4 pisos seguintes serão espaços de habitação próprios.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3031.4s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Los próximos 5.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3033.241s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Os próximos 5 serão espaços residenciais e serão 250 unidades.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3037.502s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, acho que agora é 265, ainda está, você sabe, obviamente ainda não projetamos isso, não é tão alto, aproximadamente sim, você sabe, e quantos bolsos totais possivelmente haverá?
 Acho que estamos propondo pouco mais que um espaço por unidade.
 Estávamos analisando alguns dos outros elementos de zoneamento da área e parece que a cidade permite 0,85 ou mais vagas por unidade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3061.287s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Então a gente achou que era... Acho que o nosso zoneamento vai de 0,75 para 1,5.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3065.248s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, pensamos que seria apropriado um pouco mais disso, embora concordemos que esta é uma zona de trânsito.
 Portanto, cerca de um espaço por unidade é a resposta.
 Micah, quantas unidades acessíveis haverá aqui?
 Propomos seguir as regras e regulamentos de habitação inclusiva de Bedford, por isso penso em 15%.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3084.169s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: E você tem uma faixa de preço para quanto você acha que essas unidades custarão?
 Não.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3091.353s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Eu apenas diria isso, você sabe, eu apenas diria isso a você.
 Não posso te dizer o que será porque foram anos de trabalho.
 Mas seria uma coincidência com o que você vê do outro lado da rua e com algumas dessas outras comunidades mais novas a um quilômetro de nós, que achamos que competiriam muito bem com elas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3109.89s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Você sabe disso, você sabe disso, ouço empresários querendo entrar e fazer isso.
 Uma das preocupações é se temos habitação suficiente para nos sustentar.
 O potencial de crescimento de empregos na cidade das pessoas para onde quero me mudar.
 E a questão, e a resposta neste momento, é que não, não temos.
 Então acho que Kristen deixou esse ponto claro.
 Mas a desvantagem é que você está construindo um prédio provavelmente no trecho de estrada mais movimentado, provavelmente nas esquinas mais movimentadas da cidade de Medford.
 E algum gênio da DCI decidiu que era uma boa ideia colocar um recorte na parte traseira de todas essas unidades.
 O que foi um grande erro do dia. Não sei quem pensou nisso, mas tudo o que eles estão fazendo é direcionar o trânsito e os fundos de todos esses apartamentos e condomínios, o que eu digo, simplesmente não consigo ver para onde isso foi com o estado.
 Mas foi uma boa ideia, então neste estado a culpa não é sua.
 Você conhece o lado positivo.
 Você sabe, tirar os cappies da área e o silenciador Monroe obviamente reduzirá muito o tráfego.
 Este é um gato que você conhece, os taxistas trabalham 7 dias por semana.
 Você sabe das 9 às 11 às 11 horas em uma empresa e, como muitas pessoas disseram, você sabe que os feriados chegam nos finais de semana.
 Você não pode pegar os cappies, nem tanto.
 É uma boa parte que você fará para tirar essas crianças de lá.
 Isso interromperá parte do trânsito, mas até que o estado decida admitir que cometeu um erro no desvio da Rua 9, não sei o que esses vizinhos farão a respeito.
 Espero que você considere a mitigação, você sabe, talvez os ajude, você sabe, a pavimentar a rua.
 Quer dizer, eu sei que isso está fora do seu poder, mas é um gesto simpático da sua parte.
 Minha próxima pergunta é: vocês agora bloquearão parte da visão de algumas dessas outras pessoas, sobre as quais ouvi preocupações?
 Como podemos resolver isso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3254.415s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Não tenho uma boa resposta para você sobre visão.
 É só uma função de quando você tem uma área com prédios como esse, sabe.
 Então, você sabe, algumas pessoas não terão uma visão tão boa, você sabe, eu acho.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3268.188s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Bem, não e não na sua propriedade, mas você sabe, como eu disse, é uma área muito movimentada.
 E agora você sabe,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3276.015s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: É uma pergunta justa.
 É uma pergunta justa.
 Quer dizer, acho que do ponto de vista de algumas pessoas, francamente, meu objetivo é construir um edifício suficientemente atraente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3283.804s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: O prédio está bem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3285.786s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: O que quero dizer é que olhar para o traseiro do Cappy não é muito bom.
 Esperamos melhorar algumas visualizações e garantir o bloqueio.
 Tenho certeza de que há algumas pessoas que provavelmente têm uma opinião.
 Você nos conhece no sudoeste e pode ver a reserva mística do rio e eu ainda não os vi, mas suspeito que existam, espero que nossa visão seja pelo menos melhor do que a dos cappies em Monroe, mas você sabe que haverá algumas compensações lá, com certeza. Não tenho uma resposta perfeita para isso.
 É a xícara? É isso que eu digo? Eles dizem isso corretamente: todos cheios de curvas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3316.688s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Sim, é o corte que passa pela atual Rua 9 ou é aquela estrada de serviço que todos conhecemos, é o que falam, então você desce a Rota 16 assim que atravessa a ponte.
 É o que as pessoas precisam em seus cérebros.
 Bom, é como o que o morador disse que é mesmo uma estrada particular e as vendas são particulares da cidade e eu digo que quando colocaram isso eu não pude, não acredito que alguém foi pago para fazer isso, essa é a estupidez de tirar o trânsito da Rota 16, uma das estradas mais movimentadas da região.
 e continue atrás destes e deste bairro.
 E, novamente, a queda não é culpa dele nem de ninguém, é estritamente culpa do DCR.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3359.618s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Bem, vou dizer o seguinte: podemos não conseguir resolver todos esses problemas, mas conseguimos, nossos especialistas são muito bons.
 Então talvez possamos fazer algo que seja pelo menos positivo.
 Quero dizer, em Westwood eu trabalhei muito na acalmia do trânsito e em coisas muito sutis, chicanas e rotatórias.
 Algumas pessoas odeiam todas essas palavras e técnicas, mas às vezes há algumas eficazes que podemos, digamos, educadamente, desencorajar gentilmente de cortar o tráfego.
 Temos ferramentas lá e implantaremos nossas equipes para gerenciá-las da melhor maneira possível e da melhor maneira que pudermos.
 A 9th Street é privada, o que é bom e ruim.
 Acho que tecnicamente este pacote ou esses pacotes pertenceriam ao meio da linha intermediária.
 Portanto, há um pouco de gestão de direitos privados, precisaríamos de trabalhar com os vizinhos e garantir que todos estão a bordo, aconteça o que acontecer nesse caminho, seja o que for que todos queiram que aconteça.
 Portanto, há um bom processo democrático nisso.
 Mas pode haver soluções para isso.
 Honestamente, o arquiteto que usamos para ajudar a criar a maioria dessas imagens está no comitê diretor da reconstrução deste cruzamento do MassDOT.
 Portanto, há muita simetria de que, se tivermos a capacidade de aproveitar parte disso e parte do feedback que receberemos e das preocupações que analisaremos com isso, poderemos ser capazes de
 Você pode não consertar, mas terá um impacto positivo mais do que pensa.
 E colocaríamos nossas equipes para trabalhar nisso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3445.637s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Mike, você consideraria colocar algum tipo de transporte para a estação de trem durante o horário comercial de pico, talvez das 7h às 10h, das 4h às 6h, algo assim?
 Ou talvez conecte-se com
 Porque falamos sobre algum desenvolvimento no futuro.
 Perguntamos sobre a possibilidade de fazer um serviço combinado de transporte para levar as pessoas até a estação de trem e voltar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3473.179s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Nós definitivamente daríamos uma olhada nisso.
 Sinceramente, acho que se na hora do rush o ônibus saísse do nosso local para ir para Wellington.
 Fica a cerca de seis minutos a pé do nosso local e não sou mais um cavalheiro muito rápido ou veloz.
 Então, você sabe, você pode chegar àquela passarela bem rápido, sem contar a faixa de pedestres no cruzamento ali.
 Então, mas veremos.
 Eu não diria não, mas suspeito de uma das coisas.
 Peço desculpas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3501.709s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Eu só quero intervir por um segundo.
 Não é uma caminhada de seis minutos.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3506.753s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: E Mike, você está tirando isso de suas mãos ao cruzar a Rota 16.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3511.616s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, eu não diria não neste momento, Sr. Carmelo.
 Acho que teremos que dar uma olhada nisso.
 Se existe uma TMA na área, muitas vezes nos pediram para aderir à TMA e contribuir para ela.
 Então certamente iremos observá-los nisso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3523.705s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Mas até onde você sabe, você diz que provavelmente está construindo na esquina mais movimentada da cidade de Medford.
 Então eles dizem, você sabe, o positivo é que você está tirando uma quantidade razoável de tráfego com cappies e Monroe, especialmente cappies, que funciona 24 horas por dia.
 E acho que os moradores verão algum, talvez algum alívio e trânsito com isso em comparação com o que existe agora.
 Então,
 Agradeço sua apresentação.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3561.56s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Kathy, acho que você está em silêncio.
 Eu me silenciei.
 Debra Carante, você tinha uma pergunta antes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3568.025s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: Sim.
 Basicamente, estou aproveitando outros comentários aqui.
 A principal preocupação é que moro aqui no condomínio Parkway Plaza South, que fica de frente para a Rota 16.
 Está muito congestionado aqui.
 Tentar sair da Route 9th Street agora é muito difícil.
 Se você tentar sair pela estrada, o trânsito na Rota 16 e no Wellington Circle é muito ruim.
 E temo que a construção de um grande complexo como este cause, na minha opinião, um congestionamento incrível.
 Essa foi a minha principal preocupação.
 Além disso, acho que foi Linda quem levantou a questão dos roedores, da qual ela já falou.
 Mas acho que vai haver um desastre esperando para acontecer com a escavação e a construção.
 E, finalmente, este novo complexo afetará o valor da nossa propriedade?
 Quer dizer, não acho que as pessoas queiram viver em uma área tão lotada e congestionada.
 E como Rick acabou de dizer, esta área é a mais congestionada de Medford.
 Quero dizer, isso vai diminuir o valor da nossa propriedade?
 Porque todos nós possuímos condomínios aqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3646.851s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mike, não sou um especialista em avaliação imobiliária.
 Mas suspeito que ele esteja por trás do uso de um carro nos fundos de uma loja de bebidas, mais uma vez, sem descrédito para a excelente instituição de Cappy.
 Este é um vizinho muito melhor para você.
 Portanto, existem estudos no MIT.
 isso foi feito, você sabe, há 15 anos, eu acho, e eles estavam muito envolvidos, e eram duas resmas de papel grosso, e infelizmente eu li.
 E descobriram que as comunidades de rendimentos mistos aumentaram quase unilateralmente os valores dos seus vizinhos.
 Então vou apenas dizer que não sou um avaliador, mas tenho que imaginar que ter um vizinho simpático de primeira linha como esse, diferente dos usos aí, vai te ajudar, ou certamente não vai prejudicar seus valores.
 Onde vocês estão me assustando com os ratos ficando um pouco nervosos.
 Vamos analisar essa promessa bastante difícil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3704.461s">[Maria D'Orsi]</a>: Obrigado.
 Acho que você teve um com você mesmo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3716.871s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: É uma unidade nova.
 Bem, vocês podem começar.
 Bem, neste ponto, há alguma outra mão levantada?
 Acho que não veremos nenhum.
 Acho que neste ponto provavelmente poderemos terminar o bate-papo.
 Muitas das perguntas são as mesmas, mas podemos examiná-las.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3738.621s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Então, Kathy, posso precisar que você me ensine como abrir o chat aqui para revisá-lo.
 Eu os vejo aparecer.
 Bem.
 Temos uma pergunta difícil aí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3749.926s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Se você quiser, podemos simplesmente
 faça a pergunta verbalmente.
 Olá Mike, obrigado pela apresentação.
 Estamos aqui no Parkway Plaza West.
 Somos apenas mais um vizinho.
 Prazer em conhecê-lo.
 Obrigado por organizar isso.
 Então, tivemos algumas perguntas rápidas.
 Primeiro, quanto tempo você acha que uma construção como essa levará?
 E eu sei que isso é muito cedo, você mencionou, mas quando você acha que pode começar?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3785.098s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim.
 Então a construção de um projeto como esse provavelmente durará 2.024 meses.
 Eu diria a maior parte disso.
 O prédio já está estruturado e construído e nossos meninos estariam ocupados lá dentro.
 Então, mas sim, eu diria que são dois desde a inauguração e a demolição; De qualquer forma, seriam aproximadamente dois anos no mercado atual.
 E quanto a quando a construção começaria, eu não ousaria dizer à cidade quanto tempo eles precisariam para seus processos de aprovação, mas normalmente um ano ou mais para licenças e depois outros seis a nove meses para projeto e engenharia.
 Portanto, esta é uma ótima saída, desde que possamos prosseguir.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3836.325s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Obrigado.
 E quanto à perturbação nos edifícios próximos?
 como nós, durante a sua construção ou, você sabe, quando a construção estiver concluída.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3849.11s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Claro.
 Começaremos, faremos, faremos, você sabe, testes em todos os edifícios ao nosso redor e nos certificaremos de que todos eles estejam, você sabe, estruturalmente sólidos e intactos antes de fazermos qualquer coisa.
 E certamente é um trabalho árduo.
 Mas hoje, todos estes edifícios são construídos com recurso a uma grua central.
 E assim, em geral, tudo é construído de dentro para fora.
 e então
 Em termos de impactos nos edifícios que nos rodeiam, é algo em que trabalhamos em muitas áreas urbanas, em locais muito pequenos como este e muitas vezes próximos de utilizações residenciais.
 Então a ideia seria colocarmos uma bela cerca alta com malha opaca, e você não teria que ver muito do que estamos fazendo nos bastidores.
 Felizmente, este tipo de construção não é um processo de construção muito barulhento.
 Certamente trabalharíamos com a cidade e pessoas como você em audiências públicas para conversar sobre quais são os horários de trabalho apropriados e, você sabe, esse tipo de coisa.
 Não estamos incomodando.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3917.32s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Obrigado.
 E nós definitivamente apreciamos a oportunidade de conversar porque tem sido muito útil.
 E uma última pergunta rápida é, mais de 260 unidades em cinco andares, só por curiosidade, qual é o tamanho médio das unidades?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3931.2s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Cerca de 920 cuspe está bem.
 945 sim.
 Então pensamos que a unidade está conceitualmente misturada aqui, e é assim que passamos daquelas grandes caixas laranja para o que unidade significa aproximadamente.
 Achamos que a peça importante aqui é programar uma gama de produtos.
 Medford é muito diversificada em múltiplas frentes, em níveis de renda, em educação, em tipos de emprego e em estilos de transporte.
 Portanto acreditamos que existe um pequeno número de unidades adequadas para estúdios e camas júnior.
 Esses tendem a ser nossos locatários mais iniciantes, que ainda não são casados ​​com uma garota ou um rapaz e estão a caminho de sua segunda parada em suas carreiras.
 E então este é um mercado de um quarto muito forte.
 Parece que você está solteiro e mais avançado na carreira ou talvez um pouco menos avançado, ainda está no primeiro ou segundo emprego profissional, mas é casado e tem namorada ou namorado.
 e você gosta disso.
 Portanto, em nossos estudos recentes, pensamos que certamente há espaço para dois quartos e tipos de unidades maiores, mas à medida que continuamos a estudar um pouco menos do que pensávamos.
 Então, obrigado.
 Você sabe, temos que continuar tentando descobrir qual é o mix de mercado certo para atender Medford.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4018.142s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Obrigado.
 E eu queria passar aqui uma pergunta do presidente do nosso conselho de administração.
 Ela queria que eu perguntasse a ela,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4024.407s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sim, queria saber se você pode dizer que faria uma revisão estrutural dos edifícios antes do início da construção.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4030.666s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Você pode ouvir isso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4032.069s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, ainda não avançamos tanto no estudo, no processo de estudo.
 Sabe, acho que não vamos precisar, sabe, por exemplo, não vamos cravar, não acho que vamos precisar cravar estacas ou algo assim.
 Mas normalmente, se houver alguma grande perturbação no local, se estivermos cavando um buraco ou cravando estacas, ou se estivermos fazendo análises sísmicas em todas as nossas áreas, há empresas especializadas nisso que trazemos a bordo.
 E especialmente quando você está perto de outro prédio,
 Estamos a cerca de 3,6 metros de alguns vizinhos de um projeto em Waltham em que estamos trabalhando.
 Então, você sabe, usamos monitores sísmicos e todo tipo de material de alta tecnologia para garantir que não faremos nada de ruim aos nossos vizinhos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4078.827s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Obrigado.
 E outra pessoa queria confirmar que tudo seria unitário e não haveria zoneamento para empresas.
 Lojas de varejo como Starbucks ou, você sabe, etc.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4089.758s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, temos uma boa pergunta.
 Você sabe, estávamos olhando para o patamar da estação do outro lado da rua e pensamos que poderia ser algo a considerar adicionar uso comercial no primeiro andar.
 Mas você sabe, as preocupações de trânsito levantadas esta noite eram algo que esperávamos sinceramente.
 Eu pessoalmente vi algumas reuniões com o MassDOT e como eles estão reprogramando esse cruzamento.
 E você sabe, o tráfego adicional afeta a necessidade de
 Achamos que as coisas que envolviam o impacto adicional de tráfego e tempo que o varejo traria aqui seriam tão negativas que poderiam nos apresentar todo o projeto de uma forma negativa.
 E a outra peça com a qual estamos lutando é muito solicitada.
 Você sabe, se existe um bom lugar para o varejo, eu diria apenas que o varejo que gostaria de estar nesta área é mais parecido com aquele do outro lado da rua, no patamar da estação.
 E como agora, por exemplo, você não pode alugar um espaço para a Starbucks se não for um serviço de autoatendimento.
 E há muitos varejistas, incluindo outras cafeterias, que também estão seguindo esse caminho.
 E algum tipo de café, ou cafeteria, parecia o uso correto para isso aqui.
 E quando levamos tudo isso em conta, os impactos no trânsito, decidimos eliminar essa parte do nosso conceito.
 Portanto, vale a pena discutir mais, mas sinceramente acho que seria pior para a vizinhança e pior para o local do ponto de vista do tráfego e do impacto.
 E a última coisa é se você não fizer isso com perfeição e esse negócio não alugar.
 Mesmo que você saiba, mesmo que menos, decidimos comercializá-lo bem abaixo do mercado.
 Um espaço vazio e degradado é, do ponto de vista do planeamento urbano, um problema real que traz todo o tipo de resultados negativos, por isso fico feliz que tenha perguntado que passámos muito tempo a estudá-lo e a falar sobre ele e por isso só chegámos à habitação e usos associados.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4209.242s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Olá, meu nome é Jean.
 Só tenho outra pergunta.
 Você disse que forneceria estacionamento para um carro por unidade.
 Agora, muitas unidades ou a maioria das unidades têm dois carros, portanto não há lugar para estacionar na área.
 O que você faria sobre isso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4227.406s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: As 2 coisas.
 Uma é que eu gostaria de discordar de você.
 A maioria dos nossos moradores não usa carro em suas casas, nem mesmo em nosso patrimônio, que eram unidades muito maiores e um grupo demográfico mais antigo e menos profissional.
 Não atingimos uma média de 2 carros por unidade.
 Mas mesmo que eu esteja errado, vou te dizer uma coisa, aposto meu dinheiro no que minha boca diz, onde fizemos esse e outros projetos.
 nós certamente estamos
 Estamos preocupados com as pessoas que podem estacionar fora do local, nas ruas da área de impacto, e particularmente na 9th Street, neste caso.
 E podemos ter uma cláusula simples e tornar ilegal que os nossos residentes estacionem fora do local e forçá-los contratualmente a fazê-lo.
 E eu já fiz isso antes.
 É algo fácil de fazer.
 Se for algo que o bairro ou a cidade considera importante, podemos restringir com algo tão duro.
 Não, não acho que vai ser assim, acho que um O é um pouco confortável.
 Acho que nossos concorrentes estão bem em reduzir para 0,75 ou um carro por unidade ou 0,85 carros por unidade.
 Sinceramente, acho que o zoneamento de Medford é bastante progressivo nesse sentido.
 Não podem, obviamente fizeram alguns estudos porque a gente faz muito isso, essa análise e não pode ser coincidência.
 Eles sabem exatamente o que esse cliente faz.
 Então, ah, ah,
 Fui pressionado a estacionar menos em cidades como Cambridge.
 Eles me incentivaram a ir mais para outros lugares.
 Temos muitos estudos sobre isso.
 Sabemos o que precisamos do ponto de vista comercial.
 Se não tivermos estacionamento suficiente para nossos clientes, eles não alugarão conosco.
 Portanto, a última coisa que quero fazer é limitar desnecessariamente o estacionamento, se isso prejudicar nossos negócios.
 Mas se você não precisa acreditar apenas na minha palavra, colocarei meu dinheiro onde está minha boca e iremos restringi-lo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4346.218s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Desculpe, só tenho uma última pergunta.
 Este é Jean.
 A entrada da garagem e do prédio fica na Middlesex Avenue, não na Ninth Street.
 Isso está correto?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4358.503s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Neste conceito, isso está correto.
 Tínhamos a sensação de que vocês não iriam querer que colocássemos carros novos na Ninth Street.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4363.785s">[Unidentified]</a>: Obrigado.
 Conselheiro Caraviello.
 Obrigado, Cathy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4374.114s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Posso ter uma ou duas coisas para você se você estiver falando em comprar aquela pequena unidade de canto que é tão poderosa que só para deixá-la assim, nossa propriedade tem que torná-la um pouco mais uniforme.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4387.761s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Conselheiro, como me aconselharia a responder a esta pergunta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4392.414s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Não sei.
 Quero dizer, obviamente melhoraria sua propriedade e a faria parecer muito melhor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4402.718s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Porque você tem tudo, sabe, vou falar, vou falar isso, casei com uma urbanista e ela é durona.
 E isso tem sido objeto de alguma discussão.
 Eu não sinto falta disso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4413.563s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Não quero sair da propriedade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4416.425s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: A resposta curta é que filmei algumas vezes sem sucesso.
 Não, eu só estava curioso.
 Eu prefiro ter isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4423.15s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Mas está tudo bem.
 E você mencionou a questão do estacionamento.
 Se você for aos apartamentos Rivers Edge, Moderna ou Rivers Edge, Moderna, o estacionamento não estará lotado.
 E nem as unidades Rivers Edge com carros.
 Acho que o dia de estacionamento para dois carros é, quer dizer, os dois carros estão lá fora.
 Pode haver algumas pessoas com dois carros, mas são basicamente os mais jovens, todos os Ubers que existem, e alguns deles nem têm mais carro.
 Confira Moderna e Rivers Edge, os novos prédios de apartamentos de lá.
 Eles dirão que ambos têm estacionamento e que têm muito espaço para estacionar lá.
 Simplesmente não há mais pessoas suficientes que possuem carros.
 Obrigado por isso, vamos fazer isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4469.202s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: E depois uma última pergunta, Mary Harris, e depois iremos para o lixo do avião.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4475.105s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Sim, agradeço a minha pergunta sobre estacionamento ou carros, que são muito válidas e estou preocupado que as minhas perguntas sejam um pouco diferentes.
 Então eu sinto falta do começo do seu de
 Sua apresentação, Mike, e não ouvi exatamente quantas histórias você planeja construir.
 E a minha pergunta é: e as sombras que afetariam, digamos, a nossa piscina?
 Você sabe, no verão, quando estamos sentados tentando nos divertir um pouco, como isso afetaria isso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4511.768s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, a primeira é que propomos uma assinatura de oito andares e olhamos aqui para uma comunidade de oito andares.
 Muito parecido com as coisas na vizinhança no lado norte e sul da Rota 16, certamente não achamos apropriado subir mais.
 E então, do ponto de vista dos estudos paralelos, quero dizer, francamente, ainda não chegamos lá.
 Não é uma parte incomum do processo de licenciamento.
 Suspeito que estaríamos fazendo isso aqui.
 Então peço desculpas.
 Não sei exatamente onde fica sua piscina, mas isso é algo que podemos investigar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4546.449s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Ele fica de frente para a Nona Rua.
 Ele está logo atrás de Kathy.
 Quando não estou lá, posso ver o telhado de Kathy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4554.171s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Bem.
 Sim.
 Quero dizer, a resposta curta é algo que certamente estudaríamos e analisaríamos.
 E peço desculpas, não tenho uma resposta boa e precisa para você que faria parte do processo de licenciamento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4566.864s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Conforme você avança.
 Obrigado.
 Acho que a maior parte do que temos no chat já foi respondido, mas vamos repassar uma pergunta que foi feita: por que aluguéis em vez de condomínios?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4587.23s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Existem algumas boas respostas, mas a resposta curta é que a Alliance Residential simplesmente não constrói condomínios.
 Somos uma empresa privada.
 Isso é algo que nos diferencia de alguns de nossos concorrentes.
 Você sabe, não somos um tipo de grupo apoiado por bancos de investimento.
 Construímos muitas casas todos os anos, alguns anos mais do que todos os outros, mas na verdade somos quatro parceiros principais.
 Somos propriedade totalmente privada.
 E isso é algo que nosso pessoal em Phoenix, onde estamos baseados, tem lutado muito para manter os investidores afastados.
 Portanto, há uma responsabilidade posterior na construção de condomínios que é algo que eles simplesmente decidiram que não querem fazer.
 E então é uma coisa estrutural e programática, simplesmente não fazemos isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4638.742s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Acho que respondemos às perguntas e discutimos sobre a Rua 9 e também o número de quartos, 1, 2 e 3. Acho que você fez a coisa certa, Mike.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4650.185s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Acho que sim, em conceito, você sabe, novamente, ainda estamos em algum tipo de fluxo, então continuamos falando sobre nossos tipos de unidades, mas você sabe, este é um mercado interessante e em mudança.
 Então essa mistura tem mudado, mas o que pensamos é principalmente uma comunidade de um e dois quartos.
 E certamente haverá algumas unidades maiores e menores também.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4670.697s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: E então surge a questão do que acontece com a infraestrutura.
 Bem, a pressão da água diminuiu com o novo prédio.
 Você sabe, alguém pode responder que tudo que é feito tem que passar pela engenharia e ser examinado.
 através da engenharia para garantir que a infraestrutura possa suportar o edifício adicionado.
 Não sei se você deseja acrescentar algo a isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4693.424s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Eu poderia acrescentar um pouco.
 Posso lhe dizer que a resposta quase certamente é não.
 Já testamos a água como parte.
 Testamos para ver se todos os utilitários de que precisamos estão disponíveis.
 certamente todas as telecomunicações e comunicações.
 Tem muita água lá e boa pressão.
 Além disso, nosso prédio, sendo alto, provavelmente como o seu, precisaria de bombas próprias.
 Se este fosse um prédio de cinco andares ou menos, não seria.
 Este edifício é uma proposta bastante sólida se conseguirmos apresentá-la.
 Eu não acho que você terá qualquer impacto como esse.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4731.129s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Uma das outras questões é: haverá trabalho sindicalizado ou não sindicalizado?
 Eu sei que também é uma fase inicial do projeto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4739.397s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, direi apenas que geralmente é uma ótima mistura.
 Depende.
 Caminhoneiros e caras do concreto são quase sempre levantadores de sindicatos e carpinteiros.
 E depois algumas operações, mas oferecemos ofertas competitivas em tudo.
 Mas a resposta muito, muito curta é que ainda não sabemos.
 Temos muito trabalho a fazer antes de chegarmos lá.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4759.341s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Você está perguntando se vai adicionar áreas comuns para os moradores existentes, bancos, árvores de sombra, alguma dessas coisas que estarão disponíveis para os moradores existentes?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4771.045s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim.
 Quer dizer, acho que isso faz parte do espírito do que estávamos falando no início, que pensamos em devolver um pouco daquele asfalto no lado oeste e no lado sul que originalmente pretendiam ser uma conexão da estrada para Mystic.
 reserva em Fellsway.
 Certamente, quero dizer, acho que tecnicamente será propriedade privada, mas você sabe, estará conectada a todas as calçadas e faixas de pedestres da região e tudo mais.
 Portanto, a resposta curta é sim.
 Nessas áreas, acreditamos que há muitas melhorias que podemos trazer para esses espaços.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4805.474s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: E acho que a maioria das outras questões de verificação foram respondidas, com exceção de uma pergunta sobre o envio do vídeo da reunião por e-mail e certamente meu e-mail está na carta que foi enviada e posso tentar fazer isso. Sei que tive algumas dificuldades na última reunião por causa do tamanho.
 para divulgar isso às pessoas, mas geralmente é postado no site do Medford Meetings e estará lá.
 Se as pessoas quiserem dar uma olhada e você certamente puder me enviar um e-mail, farei o possível para conseguir um link para fornecê-lo.
 Acho que é isso para o bate-papo.
 E as perguntas.
 Então, eu gostaria de agradecer a todos por terem vindo, Mike, você quer dizer.
 Vou perguntar algumas palavras.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4856.578s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, direi apenas que foi uma participação incrível.
 E eu aprecio todos vocês.
 Você trouxe perguntas muito avançadas.
 Você é um grupo bem estudado.
 Então, obrigado por participar.
 Isso é algo que nós, você sabe, eu faço, mencionei que moro localmente.
 Isso é algo que me apaixona muito: construir casas na área metropolitana de Boston.
 E todas essas são boas perguntas.
 São coisas que gerenciamos em todos os nossos empreendimentos.
 E eu acho que eu,
 Vou manter o trabalho de adereço que fiz no passado.
 Somos tão habilidosos quanto qualquer um em resolver todas essas questões, então queremos ser bons vizinhos, construímos casas, você sabe, isso não é um laboratório construindo uma loja de varejo, não que haja algo de errado em construirmos um lugar onde queremos ter certeza de que as pessoas realmente querem ficar e aproveitar o que todos vocês gostam por aqui.
 Então, obrigado por nos convidar e nos informar se houve alguma outra pergunta que perdemos, talvez tenhamos uma última chance de revisá-la antes</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4912.428s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Houve uma dúvida sobre a construção e onde os veículos de construção ficarão estacionados durante a construção, e também sobre os hidrantes caso percam vagas de estacionamento na Rua 9 em decorrência da colocação.
 aparelhos de fogo, etc.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4928.465s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Eu diria que provavelmente não.
 Isso realmente depende do corpo de bombeiros, mas num edifício como este, teríamos algumas ligações de mangueiras no edifício.
 Então, quero dizer, certamente, se o chefe dos bombeiros quisesse um hidrante, ele faria isso, mas não acho que se fosse o caso isso afetaria qualquer estacionamento.
 E então a primeira, a pergunta anterior sobre estacionamento de veículos de construção, é uma grande questão, principalmente fora do local e é a resposta curta.
 Você sabe, quando nós,
 Com licença, quando entrarmos na fase de construção, precisamos de um estudo logístico completo, estudos de mão de obra, e acho que todos os trabalhos que temos na construção agora, nossos empreiteiros estão usando um estacionamento externo considerável, e então fechamos todas as pessoas.
 Então, se a preocupação é que eles comecem a bloquear a 9th Street, a resposta é não, vamos manter nossos rapazes afastados.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4982.985s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: E uma pergunta, você sabe, como os vizinhos saberão se você vai prosseguir? Presumo que serão audiências públicas.
 Se isso se concretizar.
 Você sabe, acho que o próximo passo é determinar o que é.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4998.898s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, quero dizer, eu diria apenas que se continuarmos, provavelmente não será antes das férias.
 E usamos a mesma estrutura de notificação para esta reunião para notificar as partes adjacentes que teríamos usado para qualquer outra reunião pública ou processo de audiência.
 Portanto, a resposta curta é: acho que eles provavelmente se parecem muito com isso.
 Se avançarmos, veremos algo em sua caixa de entrada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=5023.622s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Então vamos encerrar a reunião e gostaríamos de desejar a todos um feliz e seguro Dia de Ação de Graças, cuidem-se durante as férias e obrigado pela atenção.
 Obrigado.</p>
