1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:01,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:03,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathleen does not touch on our offices.

3
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:04,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here this evening.

4
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:09,955
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like over Julian managing director of alliance residential company in New England.

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,446
[SPEAKER_02]: and Matthew Harrity development manager with residential alliance.

6
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:27,329
[SPEAKER_02]: First we would like to thank everyone for attending this community meeting relating to the potential redevelopment of the properties located at 5.73 bells way which is the cappies liquor store in 20 revere Beach Park way Monroe muffler break.

7
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:35,051
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of this meeting is to introduce the project which is in its very preliminary stages 19 feedback from you the neighborhood.

8
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:37,593
[SPEAKER_02]: We anticipate the presentation.

9
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:48,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So for an impact approximately 15 to 20 minutes following the presentation there will be an opportunity for questions and comment we've allocated about an hour so for this meeting.

10
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,107
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of general ground rules.

11
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:54,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ask that you keep yourself muted until you're called on to speak.

12
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,815
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to asking questions to the group.

13
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:05,580
[SPEAKER_02]: you can also put your questions and comments in the chat, and we'll run through those in the last five to 10 minutes of the meeting.

14
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:16,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ask that you refrain from direct private messaging, only because it's difficult to coordinate the chat and monitor a private message.

15
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:20,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have any questions, you can put them in the group chat, and we'll run through those.

16
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:28,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I will turn the presentation over to Mike Bajulian, Managing Director of Alliance Residential.

17
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,977
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

18
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:33,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Kathy.

19
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:36,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, everybody.

20
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:39,439
[SPEAKER_08]: As Kathy mentioned, my name is Mike Bejulian.

21
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:43,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I am the regional partner for Alliance Residential Company in New England.

22
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:47,321
[SPEAKER_08]: We are a national multifamily home builder.

23
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:52,102
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we manage each region pretty much as its own operation.

24
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:53,863
[SPEAKER_05]: And let that go now.

25
00:01:53,903 --> 00:01:55,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Recording in progress.

26
00:01:57,704 --> 00:01:58,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.

27
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, we manage our company really from each division up.

28
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:11,378
[SPEAKER_08]: So while we're a national group based in Phoenix, our offices are on 184 High Street in Boston.

29
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I was born, raised, and I still live in Arlington.

30
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,444
[SPEAKER_08]: And our entire staff is located here in Boston.

31
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:24,411
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you wouldn't mind, please just keep your mic muted so we can come getting some interference.

32
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:30,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight we're here to talk about a potential redevelopment of 2 parcels in Medford.

33
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:42,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to emphasize we do not only sites currently have them under contract and we are in a study period where we are a bit evaluating the feasibility of a potential redevelopment for these parcels.

34
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:49,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So candidly this is a bit earlier than we typically would have a neighborhood meeting of this kind.

35
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:53,223
[SPEAKER_08]: We would typically have be a little further along the process.

36
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,388
[SPEAKER_08]: and have a little bit better detail.

37
00:02:55,808 --> 00:03:00,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have some good answers and some good discussion points to talk with you on tonight.

38
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:11,979
[SPEAKER_08]: But to be clear, this material is not a part of a formal application, and we are not formally in front of any city boards or the city council to review this project yet.

39
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I just ask for your patience.

40
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:17,063
[SPEAKER_08]: This is some preliminary material.

41
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:20,064
[SPEAKER_08]: We may not have all the answers to your questions.

42
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:22,404
[SPEAKER_08]: We can probably speak to them in pretty good detail.

43
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:26,605
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why we're excited to have a question and answer session with you guys.

44
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:32,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Over the course of the next month or so, we'll be completing our study period for the project.

45
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:39,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it'll probably come as no surprise that the world and its economy right now is in a bit of fluctuation.

46
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:46,490
[SPEAKER_08]: We're proceeding carefully here to make sure that we don't make any mistakes as we go through these turbulent times.

47
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:54,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I prepare the presentation for you?

48
00:03:54,404 --> 00:04:02,791
[SPEAKER_08]: In a few moments, I'll share my screen and walk you through some of the concepts we've developed, the site locus and context and other things.

49
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:09,156
[SPEAKER_08]: As Kathy mentioned, please feel free to prepare any questions you have in the project on the Zoom chat.

50
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,796
[SPEAKER_08]: We are recording that.

51
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:16,697
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be going back through that at the end and try to touch on all of the questions to the best of our abilities.

52
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,598
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, I'm going to try and share my screen.

53
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:21,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And please bear with me.

54
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't do Zoom that much.

55
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:25,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

56
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:46,571
[SPEAKER_08]: So these first slides we're going to start with are really just to get you acclimated with the neighborhood.

57
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:49,794
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that sounds silly because many of you live in the immediate area.

58
00:04:50,134 --> 00:05:01,285
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we want to just make sure we all get started on the same page and talk about a little bit about the context for where we started our studies and conceptual program for the site.

59
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:06,287
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first one here is, of course, this is East Medford.

60
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:09,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Route 16 runs right across the page left to right.

61
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:14,408
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Felsway and Middlesex Avenue run north to south.

62
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:19,629
[SPEAKER_08]: The taped site in yellow is the assembled parcels.

63
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:23,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Cappy's is the larger sort of hexagonal building.

64
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,650
[SPEAKER_08]: And Monroe Muffler is here on the east side on the property line.

65
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So the combined site,

66
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:39,854
[SPEAKER_08]: which again are 573 Felsway, which is Cappy's Liquors, and 20 Revere Beach Parkway just to the east is the Monroe Muffler Shop.

67
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:50,917
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see to the south here, Station Landing, the Mystic River Reservation off to the southwest, and the shopping centers up to the northwest.

68
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:54,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, Wellington Station is at about 430 on your page.

69
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:00,857
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a few axios here to show the immediate neighborhood.

70
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:06,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, these are really just to kind of show context of how the site fits in with the larger areas.

71
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,084
[SPEAKER_08]: We've turned the camera a bit on you.

72
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:20,514
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Route 16 or Revere Beach Parkway is running off to the east towards the top of Page and the Felsway down to the right and Middlesex Avenue and the Felsway up to the left.

73
00:06:20,674 --> 00:06:22,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Cappy's there is just left of center.

74
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:31,761
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously the neighborhood really is, you know, primarily seven and eight-story mixed-use buildings, quite a bit of housing in high-rise format.

75
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:35,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll see Wellington just off top right of page.

76
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:52,171
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll flip the camera a bit here and looking southeast now, Cappies again just left of center, Route 16 traveling up and to the left of your screen, and station landing off across, southerly across Route 16 there.

77
00:06:54,817 --> 00:07:00,344
[SPEAKER_08]: So looking at these photos, we like this site in the city for a lot of reasons.

78
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:01,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford's a great city.

79
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:06,912
[SPEAKER_08]: It features anything a modern resident would want, which is, of course, our business.

80
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:10,757
[SPEAKER_08]: The city is close to Boston, which in itself is always attractive.

81
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:30,613
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, it already has its own deep bench of employment of retail of walkability open space and history so all of those things stitched together to where, where, where our customers would want to live, they want to be close to home, they want to be able to walk to amenities, you know, nobody really wants to be in their car.

82
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:34,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've spent some time studying this intersection.

83
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:36,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Growing up in Arlington, I know this intersection well.

84
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:43,396
[SPEAKER_08]: So getting out of your car in this neighborhood is certainly an attractive thing, and Medford offers the ability to do that.

85
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:52,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And this site is really a microcosm more broadly of Medford, having all of those things I just mentioned within sometimes less than 1,000 feet of walking.

86
00:07:57,505 --> 00:08:18,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Macro as a Bostonian, this is the type of modern housing I think greater Boston needs and regionally we need in eastern Massachusetts, where people even in cold weather aren't required to get into their vehicle to get a coffee to travel to work to pick up a prescription or to go get a classic roast beef at Kelly's across the street.

87
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:19,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So

88
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:26,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to move into some site photographs.

89
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:30,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you guys are all relatively familiar with this, but I feel like we just want to be thorough.

90
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:39,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a shot looking north of Cappy's, somewhat northeast, with 9th Street just in the back.

91
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:45,647
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see a blue double two-story home on the left side of the screen with a garage.

92
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:47,548
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the 9th Street area.

93
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:50,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Monroe is just off to the right of your screen.

94
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:58,635
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a shot from Revere Beach Parkway on one of the many curb cuts on these two parcels.

95
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:05,703
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're looking straight north across the property line between Monroe and the Cappy site.

96
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:12,419
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a shot from 9th Street looking south.

97
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,280
[SPEAKER_08]: So Station Landing is in the background.

98
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:19,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Monroe is on just left of center and Cappy's, the back of Cappy's is just right of center.

99
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:24,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're looking at the intersection basically concealed only by the Cappy's.

100
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:29,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this is also a 9th Street shot looking the other direction.

101
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:37,491
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see Boston Tattoo here in the background and the 9th Street intersection, current intersection and curb cut with Cappy's.

102
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:44,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So this last is an obvious satellite image of the site.

103
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:48,016
[SPEAKER_08]: We've oriented this North and South so we can stop getting you guys dizzy.

104
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:52,337
[SPEAKER_08]: 9th Street runs East and West across the top of the site.

105
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:57,258
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Middlesex Avenue on the left, and again, Route 16 on the bottom.

106
00:09:58,218 --> 00:10:05,640
[SPEAKER_08]: The property isn't taped, but it is this L-shaped combination of these two parcels, not including the Boston Tattoo Company.

107
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:19,401
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a good start to show where the site planning begins for us, apart from the macro context of the area and the uses that are here and the amenities.

108
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:25,182
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really where we start trying to integrate and stitch those things together into a program.

109
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:30,924
[SPEAKER_08]: On the left and on the south of the site, we're bound by these two roads or parkways.

110
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:31,924
[SPEAKER_08]: These were

111
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:42,973
[SPEAKER_08]: These are actually very interesting if you don't know the history, but these were formerly, like many parkways in greater Boston, were run by the MDC, now DCR.

112
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:53,281
[SPEAKER_08]: The spirit of these roads was effectively, as we were becoming an automobile-focused society, to have a pleasure-driving avenue to explore the area's benefits.

113
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:56,584
[SPEAKER_08]: So you, I'm sure, are all familiar with the Middlesex Bells.

114
00:10:56,984 --> 00:10:58,766
[SPEAKER_08]: and the Mystic River reservations.

115
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:09,656
[SPEAKER_08]: These are really just spectacular green spaces, and the former MDC knew that, and they knew that they wanted people to experience those in a pleasurable way.

116
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:18,965
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the south side of the site, you'll see there's a pretty deep, for an urban zone like this, a pretty deep setback with mature trees and paths.

117
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:28,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Believe it or not, there's actually a deed restriction on these sites that allows the parkways to remain what their original intent was.

118
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:35,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So while we might not be putting around in a 57 Chevrolet enjoying the Mystic River Reservation here today,

119
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:38,455
[SPEAKER_08]: I drive on at least three parkways on the way to work every day.

120
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:39,676
[SPEAKER_08]: These are commuter roads now.

121
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:45,763
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's still an opportunity here, we think, to maintain the spirit of what these parkways were initially for.

122
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:56,073
[SPEAKER_08]: And one thing we found interesting was that on the west side of this site, along the Middlesex Avenue, it's paved right to the sidewalk.

123
00:11:56,734 --> 00:12:23,899
[SPEAKER_08]: and there so those setbacks and deed notes actually exist there as well and so one of the things we thought might be attractive and seems to mate with some of the intersection plans being discussed is is an ability to use that even though it is on this property rather than leave it as asphalt is to try and continue that parkway um parkway spirit the paths put mature trees and native plantings there and the like um so

124
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,840
[SPEAKER_08]: We think restoring that buffer could be a real opportunity.

125
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,241
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to move to the next shot.

126
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:33,983
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an actual concept we're working with.

127
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's roughly centered on the page as this is.

128
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:41,686
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, you'll see the, well, mislabeled Felsway.

129
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:44,787
[SPEAKER_08]: That's technically Middlesex, of course, but Revere Beach Parkway on the bottom.

130
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:51,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll see how we're looking at really adding back into those buffer zones, as I mentioned before, some of the green spaces.

131
00:12:53,626 --> 00:13:00,352
[SPEAKER_08]: A number of other things worth highlighting as we get into this we're going to show you some more details on on how we program space conceptually.

132
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:15,105
[SPEAKER_08]: This community's proposed at 265 units of rental housing, we do not build condominiums in an eight story format with 100% of the resident parking enclosed within the building so.

133
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:28,854
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the surface parking areas that are on the perimeter of the area and nearby sites, we're going to instead work to green those up and bring the parking inside the envelope completely.

134
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:31,877
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk a little more about the rest of the program.

135
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:43,033
[SPEAKER_08]: But to get you started, effectively, we craft these communities so that they are a completely enclosed community.

136
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:46,557
[SPEAKER_08]: And so by that I mean, while this looks like a pretty normal building,

137
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:52,201
[SPEAKER_08]: from the outside, all of our building systems are located internally.

138
00:13:52,721 --> 00:14:03,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So, trash, refuse collection and recycling, separation, emergency services and access, all of our amenities, or most of the amenities, I should say, that are internal to the site.

139
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:08,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is neatly encapsulated within the envelope of the building we propose here.

140
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:16,504
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you'll see on the site, there's donut shape is primarily the mass of the building.

141
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:22,651
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there is a hole in the middle and we'll use that courtyard to have some outdoor private space for residents.

142
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:27,216
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little more private than perhaps walking across the street to the mystic river.

143
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:32,560
[SPEAKER_08]: But typically, and we'll show you some photos of how we treat these spaces.

144
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,704
[SPEAKER_08]: But these spaces typically have a large pool deck, sort of resort styled.

145
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:44,027
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have outdoor cooking areas, lounges and cabanas and that sort of thing.

146
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,729
[SPEAKER_08]: A space where, you know, to kind of center the entire community around.

147
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:54,835
[SPEAKER_08]: On the upper left of the page, you'll note we've got a curb cut proposed here off of Middlesex.

148
00:14:56,597 --> 00:15:00,982
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, to expand on that, the site currently features five curb cuts.

149
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:07,410
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure we'll spend a lot of time talking about traffic and parking here.

150
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:13,353
[SPEAKER_08]: But the big story here is we're going to try and eliminate all of those curb cuts but one.

151
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:16,674
[SPEAKER_08]: We have not engaged a traffic engineer at this time.

152
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:31,241
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we've done enough of these to know that on a busy intersection like this, particularly one that's in flux for its future, that the less interruption and the less curb cuts that you're delivering traffic onto, the better.

153
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:32,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

154
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:40,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So our goal here would be to eliminate as many of those curb cuts in this planet, four of the five would be would be removed from the site.

155
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:54,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Inside the garage, so residents will drive into the building here, just above where it says loading, and there'll be three levels of parking.

156
00:15:55,037 --> 00:16:05,963
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first three levels of the program would all be structured parking and other building services, and then all of the housing, but for a very few units, would be located on floors four and above.

157
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,105
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're gonna dig into the building here a little bit.

158
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:15,288
[SPEAKER_08]: This would be the first level if you were to just shave everything on floors two through eight off.

159
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:21,199
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as you arrive, you'll see the only surface parking we're proposing is just at the amenity area.

160
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,205
[SPEAKER_08]: That's also where we would have our 24-hour leasing and staff located.

161
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:32,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So future residents might use these spaces if they were to come look at a home or to check out the community.

162
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:47,224
[SPEAKER_08]: So that that sort of area all on the west side labeled as amenity would be a two story volume focused on the leasing and then a number of different amenities, which we'll talk a little bit about later.

163
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:53,674
[SPEAKER_08]: but primarily work from home type spaces, screening rooms, flex spaces.

164
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:57,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll show you some of the other examples of what we do for fun in those spaces.

165
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:00,877
[SPEAKER_08]: So those would be separated from the garage element.

166
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:05,899
[SPEAKER_08]: The next two levels above this would also be parking served by internal ramps.

167
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:07,920
[SPEAKER_08]: So invisible to the outside.

168
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:13,202
[SPEAKER_08]: This would be an upper garage.

169
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:29,399
[SPEAKER_08]: parking floor like two or three you'll note that now above the common program area will add some homes and there'll be some again on the south side until we get to the upper residential floors, such as this where it'll be all housing on force for and above.

170
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:36,618
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll also in these upper floors probably have some amenities.

171
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:41,841
[SPEAKER_08]: We're finding that most surprising amount of people are not going back to the office.

172
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:46,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the flex time and work from home spaces are becoming an important part of our business.

173
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:54,489
[SPEAKER_08]: So while some people may go to work, the typical customer here is working in a high tech or an R&D type

174
00:17:56,959 --> 00:18:01,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And those have, you know, non traditional non nine to five types of hours.

175
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:12,351
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're now building our amenities to make those spaces more pleasurable and make your sort of to help you separate work from home, even when you are near home, as you would be in this.

176
00:18:22,323 --> 00:18:26,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've added some, these shots are what we call axiometrics.

177
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:32,134
[SPEAKER_08]: These shots were created with the intent to kind of stitch what we're proposing into the neighborhood.

178
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:36,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll notice, like most of the buildings around here, this is also eight stories.

179
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I think one of the station landing buildings up front is seven.

180
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:55,537
[SPEAKER_08]: but you'll see we're looking to pull things back off of the parkways and contribute back to what that sort of original mission was for those roadways and also just give this a little bit of a softer edge on what is a very hard-edged zone.

181
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:00,341
[SPEAKER_08]: So this we've also picked these spaces to

182
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:06,359
[SPEAKER_08]: try to relate to the aerial views we showed you earlier.

183
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:15,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So where we were showing you a photo very similar to this of the Cappies and Monroe site to show you how this would stitch into those with the massing around it.

184
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:21,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this is a shot looking south, excuse me, southeast.

185
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:32,795
[SPEAKER_08]: So Ninth Street would be just in front of the building here in your view and the Middlesex Avenue and the Fells Way coming basically straight up the page on the right side.

186
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:35,003
[SPEAKER_08]: station landings here in the back.

187
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:37,924
[SPEAKER_08]: We're proposing a lot of verticality.

188
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:40,485
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what we'd call a Vitruvian style building.

189
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:41,426
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very classic.

190
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:47,888
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not sure this is the space based on what's around it.

191
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:48,688
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of brick.

192
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,749
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of sort of traditional materials.

193
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:54,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Station landing is a relatively classic and timeless architecture.

194
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So we didn't feel it was appropriate to use some of the real contemporary modern looks.

195
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:02,393
[SPEAKER_08]: for this space.

196
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:09,115
[SPEAKER_08]: So we stuck with some pretty classic verticality and spacing and dimensions to the building.

197
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:17,939
[SPEAKER_08]: To help you stay oriented, this was the small little future resident parking area, and the garage entry would be right here.

198
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:29,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, these first three levels, despite the fact that they look traditional with windows and the like, would actually be just the same cladding, just enclosing the parking structure.

199
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:44,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a similar angle to the one we just showed you just brought down from from the seagull residents of Medford's viewpoint to get you down to a more pedestrian scale.

200
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:53,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Again this is where those future resident spots in the curb cut on the middle section might be and a garage parking entrance here if you can see my cursor moving.

201
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:56,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So

202
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:09,122
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, again, this is an early concept, so this may look developed, and we have looked at a couple of other options, but this is sort of the path we've been going stylistically with the concept.

203
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:20,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, we're gonna show you some photos of other projects we've done in Greater Boston that have things that we think at least conceptually belong in a project like this.

204
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:26,426
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a community we built called The Val that we've just finished, or just finishing leasing up.

205
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:30,828
[SPEAKER_08]: And so some of the things you'll note here is a big two-story volume at the arrival.

206
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:38,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I mentioned that there was that amenity labeled space was also amenities, but also our leasing and management staff.

207
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:41,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a good example of how we integrate some of these things.

208
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:48,699
[SPEAKER_08]: On the right side of this feature wall is actually the back of house where at all times you can find somebody on our team working there.

209
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,102
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's also this sort of hotel-styled arrival here, which is some of the way

210
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:56,628
[SPEAKER_08]: apartment home communities are going.

211
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:02,645
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's someone here at all times kind of giving you a more full service feeling during the

212
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:07,259
[SPEAKER_08]: well, during regular hours, more full service feeling to the building.

213
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,881
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you'll see these two stories and a feature stair.

214
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:28,232
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something we'd like to integrate in this project as well, where we really are stitching together some of these assembly spaces, work from home spaces, or maybe you're just scrolling and rolling with your earbuds in and your music on, but places where this is a little more activated and a little more public.

215
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:38,542
[SPEAKER_08]: This actually, this wall was, we had a local artist custom paint it for us in sort of a thematic nod to the name.

216
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:46,008
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a project we built two years ago called The Cove.

217
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:50,752
[SPEAKER_08]: This is another idea of just some of those sort of flex spaces where this is really,

218
00:22:53,173 --> 00:23:00,715
[SPEAKER_08]: more recreational space, obviously a pool table, there's actually a beer tap back there and wine, excuse me, and a wine cooler.

219
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:12,319
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is a space that would also be, we would propose something like stylistically different, of course, right near those amenity and leasing spaces, a little more open concept.

220
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:17,319
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of our fitness centers we just completed.

221
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,221
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's actually done on two levels.

222
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:20,542
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a lot of fun with this one.

223
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:28,108
[SPEAKER_08]: We're utilizing private mirror rooms for online workouts and then of course all the traditional cardio.

224
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:35,475
[SPEAKER_08]: So this one has actually up top of this spiral staircase has a cardio deck and then the rest of your workout is all below here.

225
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:45,114
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can get an idea of how we really want to create an enclosed, fully encapsulated community, but in a very first class way.

226
00:23:46,623 --> 00:23:48,224
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a pool deck shot.

227
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:55,008
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an important one because this is a good analogy for how we would treat that center of the donut type space you saw.

228
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:58,450
[SPEAKER_08]: This is also a green roof on deck.

229
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,313
[SPEAKER_08]: These trees, while brand new, will grow to be full 40 foot sugar maples and red maples.

230
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:08,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a team that understands how to put

231
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:11,916
[SPEAKER_08]: full-sized real vegetation on top of a deck.

232
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:16,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Under this is a parking level, not unlike we would propose on this site.

233
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:28,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Then a full, of course, heated pool and resort style, three, four months of the year, great place to hang out with your iPad or just get some sun.

234
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:31,103
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a good example of how we would treat that.

235
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:37,531
[SPEAKER_08]: This is in the same project at the Val I mentioned earlier, similar green roof.

236
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,192
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you'll see something.

237
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:46,836
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some taller trees at the inception here, but, and some lawn back there, which is hard to see, but we fully green up hard and soft scape.

238
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:51,878
[SPEAKER_08]: This one has a cool sun deck where you can throw your chaise lounge right in the water.

239
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:56,241
[SPEAKER_08]: It's heated and, and hang out, you know, we'll have fire, we have a large fire pit.

240
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:00,743
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this one, you can actually see the grilling stations, private grilling areas where you and your friends can kind of hang out.

241
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,581
[SPEAKER_08]: and have dinner.

242
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:09,387
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this is just, we just wanted to give you an idea of what some of our apartment homes look like.

243
00:25:09,627 --> 00:25:14,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Alliance is a little different than some of our more cookie cutter national competitors.

244
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:17,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not here to throw shade at any of them.

245
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:19,236
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of great groups out there.

246
00:25:20,056 --> 00:25:24,741
[SPEAKER_08]: We just really kind of treat each project with a little bit more of a customized approach.

247
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:35,405
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, in our Hingham asset, you know, that was more appropriate to have a little bit more of a coastal New England style and a little bit more classic sort of features.

248
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:41,727
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, at workforce spaces, you might want to be a little cooler, have a little bit more fun with some of the design, a little less safe.

249
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:45,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, the unit mix and the lighting and all that changes.

250
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:46,629
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a good example.

251
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:52,891
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually did two different types of backsplash tile with a custom featured backsplash tile behind the range.

252
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:55,880
[SPEAKER_08]: and sort of things like that.

253
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:03,628
[SPEAKER_08]: But we build, you know, the goal is to build, you know, first class modern housing from connectivity to finishes and the like.

254
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that is that.

255
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:15,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if I can understand how to put this off.

256
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:36,462
[SPEAKER_02]: We can open it up to questions at this point and I believe we have to anyway 2 hands raised you want to.

257
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:50,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we can we ask I wasn't sure we can start asking.

258
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, you're unmuted so.

259
00:26:55,393 --> 00:26:55,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

260
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:56,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.

261
00:26:56,393 --> 00:26:56,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

262
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:59,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, thanks for showing this, I guess.

263
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,155
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I know you.

264
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:08,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, what's a curb cut out is that specific to just like the flow, I guess from this property.

265
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:24,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah curb cut is a it's it's you're going to be disappointed it's not much of a term of art simply just where a private parcel has a cut in the curbs, a driveway, basically, an ability to be a lot of the public way.

266
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:34,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and I know you mentioned that, you know, a lot of the ideas that people wouldn't necessarily have to use their cars and maybe like the work from home aspect.

267
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:40,759
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd also mentioned there's like a lot of R&D type of folks who you know might potentially move here.

268
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:49,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Boston, you know, serves as a big hub for the biotech industry, and a lot of folks are, you know, like they're driving.

269
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:52,115
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to go to the lab.

270
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:52,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

271
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:58,864
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you had mentioned it's still early stages but that traffic piece right I guess the question is.

272
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:05,206
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you account for who might come in, right?

273
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:08,388
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you're only renting out to people who might be working from home.

274
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:13,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's a lot of reason to believe, you know, myself included, I work in the biotech industry.

275
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:18,055
[SPEAKER_00]: People are leaving for driving from here to Cambridge and over Burlington.

276
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:29,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I see a world where there's a ton of people still in this industry having to be in the office of their scientists, which is a large majority of the industry.

277
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:31,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a good question.

278
00:28:31,195 --> 00:28:33,916
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple there, make sure I unpack this properly.

279
00:28:33,936 --> 00:28:43,079
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, the first is, you know, these are estimates, I can tell you who our typical target markets are, I can tell you who typically rents.

280
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,360
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, we're, we're building homes for everybody.

281
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:52,582
[SPEAKER_08]: We try to tailor our product to meet who is most interested in living in a space.

282
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:54,523
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're absolutely correct.

283
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:55,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I mean, the

284
00:28:56,019 --> 00:29:00,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Cars are an inevitability, as you can tell at any given point at that intersection.

285
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:06,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people certainly are still driving to work, you know, whether you're in biotech or in a more

286
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I have friends in the Department of Defense, R&D firms, and it can be 2 a.m.

287
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:22,217
[SPEAKER_08]: when a certain process or test is completed, and everybody gets on Slack or gets on Teams and says, all right, let's go, and they all mobilize and go.

288
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:29,420
[SPEAKER_08]: So my point there was more that we certainly are not going to specifically target or cater who we lease to, and we would welcome anybody

289
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:49,820
[SPEAKER_08]: But those are the types of folks that typically come here is, you know, someone, someone might be more interested in going to our Hingham asset at the cove if they're okay with a lot more driving, you know, I think the idea here is that, you know, you don't need to get in your car for a coffee, or to go to Walgreens or they'll get a roast beef or anything like that.

290
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:57,155
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, you're probably, sir, directly in our target market from a professional standpoint.

291
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:04,041
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a young professional, well-educated, you know, that's exactly who we're building homes for in greater Boston.

292
00:30:08,985 --> 00:30:15,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Kathy, I'm going to ask you to help work the unmuting and muting for raised hands, because I'm not sure I even have the authority to do it.

293
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm relying on you to help me there.

294
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:39,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we just jump in?

295
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:41,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Ricky, how long is it?

296
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:46,244
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess should we first address the chat here?

297
00:30:46,264 --> 00:30:50,586
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we had a question from Wellington Circle neighbors.

298
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:53,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you guys want to unmute if you're still on?

299
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm all.

300
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:04,582
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'd like to ask you about 93.

301
00:31:04,803 --> 00:31:05,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.

302
00:31:10,926 --> 00:31:12,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Funny you should say that.

303
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,149
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a gentleman there that was just about to ask.

304
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:14,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, sir.

305
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:15,169
[SPEAKER_08]: You're unmuted.

306
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,071
[SPEAKER_08]: On Pacific Avenue.

307
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:18,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Where?

308
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:20,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Pacific Avenue.

309
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:27,120
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like we don't have the Wellington Circle neighbors on anymore.

310
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,622
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll just, I guess, from the top of the screen in order.

311
00:31:31,243 --> 00:31:33,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Lauren, it looks like you have your hand raised there.

312
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:38,909
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to, I can unmute you and then I want to ask your question.

313
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:45,675
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll save the chat to the end so that we can get through who's got their hands raised and then move from there.

314
00:31:47,962 --> 00:32:12,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, my only question was just really quick would you be amenable to maybe establishing a footbridge across the the intersection there to make it more walkable because I feel like with having so many extra people there it's it might be you know beneficial to have that access to the T because currently it's it's really not feasible to to use it very efficiently.

315
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:21,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean I'll be I'll be frank with you, the state permits across a DC our road for a bridge.

316
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:28,113
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, that's probably an operation that we would need a substantially larger parcel to to accommodate.

317
00:32:29,273 --> 00:32:35,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Just get in the handicap ramps and switchbacks so that it's at a compliant I looked at a similar request in Cambridge.

318
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:44,223
[SPEAKER_08]: to cross over the commuter rail and so I'd love to say we'll look at everything and we would but that one unfortunately I have some good experience.

319
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:54,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah that that's probably something that we wouldn't be able to include as a part of this could probably be no housing left for the after that bridge were built and constructed so.

320
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

321
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:02,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know how to raise my hand.

322
00:33:04,054 --> 00:33:05,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead Linda we're ready for you.

323
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Wellington on the board of trustees of the Wellington condominium.

324
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:28,419
[SPEAKER_06]: 9th Street cannot possibly handle one more car than it already is especially since the sign was put on revere Beach Parkway Westbound offering branded have as a cut off.

325
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:32,761
[SPEAKER_06]: My unit faces 9th Street every morning.

326
00:33:33,572 --> 00:33:36,314
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 or 4 school buses every afternoon.

327
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:37,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen city buses.

328
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:41,298
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a big concern to us.

329
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:45,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I know because a couple of my neighbors have written.

330
00:33:46,582 --> 00:33:50,145
[SPEAKER_06]: The questions that I'm saying and I'm also concerned.

331
00:33:50,745 --> 00:34:02,654
[SPEAKER_06]: We take care of our place as best we can with pest control every 2 months we have bait stations you're digging up how many floors down.

332
00:34:04,238 --> 00:34:11,845
[SPEAKER_06]: to park cars, this neighborhood could become something very undesirable in my opinion.

333
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:17,790
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to raise my hand either, but I'm right there with Linda.

334
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:21,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at the Parkway Plaza South.

335
00:34:22,814 --> 00:34:30,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Deborah, if we could get to you after those who have, I'll keep you on the list and I'll put you on as soon as we get through who's already in.

336
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:35,468
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've got your number so you can jump in after we go through those with their hands raised.

337
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:38,631
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got three in front of you and I'm watching that.

338
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:52,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So Linda, those are good concerns that you'll note on the concept plan, we intentionally did not include a curb cut, we actually eliminated a number of curb cuts between these parcels and ninth street.

339
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we suspected that that was going to be.

340
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,250
[SPEAKER_08]: a hot button issue.

341
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,911
[SPEAKER_08]: We had heard from some other folks in the city that 9th Street's having some issues with that.

342
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:13,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a couple of things that we did on purpose there that we were trying to respect that and keep our cars off of 9th.

343
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:21,095
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I think there's some things we didn't do on purpose that should add some help as well.

344
00:35:21,655 --> 00:35:25,176
[SPEAKER_08]: The three curb cuts along Revere Beach Parkway going westbound,

345
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:45,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, you could easily just take a right and drive through the Monroe parking lot or drive through the Cappies parking lots and get onto 9th Street to cut off the intersection and basically eliminate any lights at the intersection to go north up the Felsway or up Middlesex.

346
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:53,045
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the stuff we did on purpose will certainly not add any new pain there.

347
00:35:54,085 --> 00:36:07,748
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think just by the development program we're proposing, this is going to basically stop all of the people cutting through those curb cuts to 9th Street now.

348
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that this ought to reduce some of that.

349
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:16,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize that I don't know where Granite Street and the sign you mentioned are, we'll find it.

350
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:22,252
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly anybody that is cutting through these parcels will not be able to do that any longer.

351
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I've got cut off.

352
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:53,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I can still hear you and oh I'm okay I lost the screen branded have is at the end of 9th Street that runs from the review Beach Park way all the way over to be on keys okay sure and wellington condominium owns branded have from 9th Street to the beyond keys factory that's had several different things since I've been here.

353
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:55,856
[SPEAKER_06]: and the city owns the other half.

354
00:36:57,157 --> 00:37:00,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I got parallel it's parallel to middle 6 out.

355
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:10,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're not not a whole lot we can do on that side but again certainly the cut through traffic that people go jump in the intersections signals now would be would be eliminated.

356
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:15,030
[SPEAKER_08]: And then again we would not propose to add cars to tonight.

357
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:22,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah because really I mean it's it's increased I'm here almost 30 years and I can't believe how much it's increased.

358
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,412
[SPEAKER_06]: during that time.

359
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a it's worrisome.

360
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:33,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can tell you on that Linda we've done some pretty creative stuff on an area traffic.

361
00:37:34,278 --> 00:37:36,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that I have a perfect solution for you I know we cannot.

362
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:52,447
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would certainly certainly going to be good listeners and bring the best specialists out there to make sure we're integrating with that intersection the new intersection, however, it may land in and the concerns of the folks on 9th Street.

363
00:37:53,261 --> 00:37:59,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there ever gonna be an in-person meeting like at City Hall or someplace that we, you know what I mean?

364
00:38:00,587 --> 00:38:07,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so this is, and I think there were a few questions I saw in the chat pop up that we'll get to in more detail.

365
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:07,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

366
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:09,714
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer is I'm not sure.

367
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:14,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of what we're planning right now, what we're doing right now is studying.

368
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:16,920
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what we call a feasibility period.

369
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:40,293
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at everything like title and the deeds to environmental conditions to how the permits would need to be obtained and then things like this talking with neighbors what what do we not know our main goal today is to be good listeners to the people that are around this so that if we're able to proceed and and get into a public process where they would be public meetings and more formal.

370
00:38:40,793 --> 00:38:43,274
[SPEAKER_08]: presentations and candidly probably better answers.

371
00:38:44,975 --> 00:39:00,662
[SPEAKER_08]: We do that informed by what we hear from from you folks today and from city officials so we like to kind of keep our corner square with that and not just drop an idea into a new application that we just hadn't vetted or learned everything that we could learn.

372
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:02,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

373
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:07,245
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Kelsey I believe you can on you yourself at this point.

374
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:10,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

375
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:16,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, my name is Kristen and I'm an owner at Parkway Plaza West.

376
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:20,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I am in favor of this type of development.

377
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:29,367
[SPEAKER_15]: I do feel that areas near public transit need to be, need to have denser housing.

378
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:33,729
[SPEAKER_15]: But I have two concerns about the construction.

379
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:35,810
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them is what other people have said.

380
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:53,754
[SPEAKER_15]: about 9th Street, and Linda was correct, that even if you eliminate those curb cuts, people don't tend to cut through the parking lots because, frankly, they are disaster zones, but they do come in on Brainerd and then down 9th Street.

381
00:39:54,654 --> 00:40:05,278
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is a, 9th Street is very small, so one of my first question is, would your company or have you in the past

382
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:20,071
[SPEAKER_15]: done anything with the communities that you build in to improve the street, maybe as like a, you know, goodwill gesture, because Ninth Street is unfortunately a private way.

383
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:26,473
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would, and it needs improvements, sidewalks, curbs, street.

384
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:31,574
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it would be better if there was, you know, maybe one way or.

385
00:40:31,594 --> 00:40:35,255
[SPEAKER_15]: So my first question is, would you have any

386
00:40:36,075 --> 00:40:40,737
[SPEAKER_15]: would your company have any interest or does it have any history of helping to improve the street?

387
00:40:41,257 --> 00:40:49,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Because even without the curb cuts, residents will start coming down Brainerd and into 9th to avoid the intersection.

388
00:40:49,801 --> 00:41:02,386
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my second question is about rodent mitigation, because I've just read about nightmares with people having rodent issues when large-scale construction starts and

389
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:11,095
[SPEAKER_15]: I read an article today about, uh, Somerville and Brookline have started to use this next generation, uh, system called smart boxes.

390
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:21,259
[SPEAKER_15]: And does your company do basic rodent mitigation on its current jobs or do, are you planning on investing in higher level mitigation techniques?

391
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:32,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, cause we have a lot of unit owners in a very small one block radius, and I think it would be very upsetting if a huge problem was created with regards to rodents.

392
00:41:32,504 --> 00:41:32,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

393
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:39,505
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's do first last because I think I read that article this morning, which I had never heard of that tech.

394
00:41:39,786 --> 00:41:41,727
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you remember what it was called?

395
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:44,450
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the boxes that they get.

396
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,212
[SPEAKER_15]: Anti-Cymex smart boxes.

397
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:47,973
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

398
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:49,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I've never heard of that.

399
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:50,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fascinated.

400
00:41:50,538 --> 00:41:54,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually already Googled it this morning.

401
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:59,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first is sort of three stages to the rodent question.

402
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,282
[SPEAKER_08]: The first is during construction, we're required by law to do some pretty outsized efforts.

403
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:08,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can tell you that those are wildly effective.

404
00:42:08,543 --> 00:42:12,284
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, we have to, by law, hire a rodent specialist

405
00:42:13,104 --> 00:42:18,669
[SPEAKER_08]: And that person has to be a part of our team through the entirety of construction.

406
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:21,872
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that's not the whole thing, but that's sort of step one.

407
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:30,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether this tech is viable or being used by the pest management companies we would engage with, I don't know.

408
00:42:30,118 --> 00:42:34,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm certainly willing to ask them to do it because it looks like pretty good technology.

409
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,865
[SPEAKER_08]: The second thing is, you know,

410
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:44,242
[SPEAKER_08]: We build homes, and we try to tell everybody we build really nice homes.

411
00:42:44,843 --> 00:42:49,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So the last thing I want is rat infestations in or around my community.

412
00:42:49,504 --> 00:42:58,347
[SPEAKER_08]: So I need to do a little bit more learning here, and Matt and Greg on the phone here are gonna become area rodent specialists, assuming we get to proceed here.

413
00:42:59,047 --> 00:43:03,569
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something that, candidly, I wouldn't take any credit for.

414
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:07,730
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a selfish endeavor, because we would not want that either.

415
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:21,422
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and we do carry pest management in our operating budgets, which are 150 lines long as you can imagine, that is one of the items in there it's something that we will do after construction and on an ongoing way so.

416
00:43:23,064 --> 00:43:23,624
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah that's.

417
00:43:25,078 --> 00:43:26,039
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the first piece.

418
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,326
[SPEAKER_08]: The second is on ninth street improvements, and what we've done elsewhere.

419
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:46,501
[SPEAKER_08]: The short answer to both is yes, almost always, we you know we again some of this is selfish so I'm not going to take too much credit for it, but we want to have a, we want to be in a nice neighborhood and I don't build on Greenfield sites.

420
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:58,771
[SPEAKER_08]: All of the sites we build on are old industrial buildings, or old decrepit office buildings, and no discredit to Cappy's, very fine facility, and I've shopped there.

421
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:02,834
[SPEAKER_08]: But our goal is not to go and disturb some greenfield site.

422
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:08,139
[SPEAKER_08]: It's to improve a legacy parcel with legacy real estate improvements on it.

423
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:12,322
[SPEAKER_08]: So having 9th Street be more attractive benefits us.

424
00:44:12,342 --> 00:44:14,384
[SPEAKER_08]: That's absolutely something we want to talk with you about.

425
00:44:15,024 --> 00:44:18,086
[SPEAKER_08]: We have plans for for our side of 9th Street already.

426
00:44:18,106 --> 00:44:23,888
[SPEAKER_08]: You know we the sidewalks and how those curb cuts in the asphalt integrated terrible.

427
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:37,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know this that we're going to have some new pads associated assuming we proceed of course with with enhancing and rebuilding those Parkway border buffers and so you know those are going to need to integrate with that too.

428
00:44:38,736 --> 00:44:43,218
[SPEAKER_08]: So the short answer is absolutely we want to talk to you about what we can do on 9th Street improve it.

429
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:48,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like you have a 3rd question I'm forgetting something that I miss anything.

430
00:44:52,451 --> 00:44:52,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

431
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe you're next up.

432
00:45:00,316 --> 00:45:01,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much for your time.

433
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:10,221
[SPEAKER_14]: You said you're local so you're sure that know that Kathy's gets incredibly busy around Thanksgiving and Christmas.

434
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:34,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Has there been any conversation about using data from Cappy's sales or the state police or the local police, because they always have, you know, people stationed on entrances just to see the influx of cars in that area to help you maybe determine just what kind of traffic commotion a building of that size will cause?

435
00:45:35,362 --> 00:45:40,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Cappy's with probably the size of

436
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:56,836
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say shopper is equivalent to maybe the resident that will be in that building that will be driving those two things could serve as data in terms of just how many people, how many more cars would be coming in and out and what kind of commotion that cause especially during

437
00:45:57,537 --> 00:45:58,538
[SPEAKER_14]: heavy traffic times.

438
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:04,200
[SPEAKER_14]: And with that, is there any conversation to try and maybe gather some data next week?

439
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:12,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it is Thanksgiving, which means that this intersection and Cappy's is open and people are gathering again, it's going to be incredibly busy.

440
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:24,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that data could serve as, you know, something to determine just what kind of traffic flow or issues building of that size would cause.

441
00:46:25,256 --> 00:46:29,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure so a couple and just to make sure I understand the question.

442
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:42,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Back up a little bit candidly were a little early in the process to hire a traffic consultant you would typically start spending those dollars once you know we feel comfortable enough taking the risks we have to take to proceed.

443
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:48,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to make a call.

444
00:46:49,414 --> 00:46:50,835
[SPEAKER_08]: But but I'll tell you that

445
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:53,687
[SPEAKER_08]: they call it ITE.

446
00:46:54,027 --> 00:46:58,550
[SPEAKER_08]: When we hire these professionals, they don't like to use anecdotal data.

447
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:14,339
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to make a phone call and see if there's some way we can incorporate that because on our time frame, you know, realistically, we wouldn't be, assuming we proceed, this would be early next year, you know, we've got a lot of boxes to check before the new year to see if we're going to proceed with this.

448
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:24,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So unfortunately, that would mean when we do those formal studies, which take months, we would be past Thanksgiving.

449
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:29,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what I guess I'm going to ask is, how do they account for that or accommodate that?

450
00:47:29,622 --> 00:47:40,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if that's a uniquely impactful time for you guys, and that makes a lot of sense that it would be, those probably similar around Christmas, I'm guessing.

451
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:40,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

452
00:47:42,094 --> 00:47:44,255
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how they how they incorporate that.

453
00:47:44,276 --> 00:47:53,301
[SPEAKER_08]: So the short answer is unfortunately probably not getting real traffic.

454
00:47:53,342 --> 00:48:02,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So what would happen is when we start this would go out into the field and they put down those little rubber ropes you see across the road sometimes they actually do physical counts and they have a

455
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:11,789
[SPEAKER_08]: have some analysts out there that's working the equipment that's also verifying that it works very well so we you know that process candidly I doubt I could mobilize someone for next week.

456
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if I was going to take a little extra risk on dollars like that.

457
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:23,018
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll find out the answer on how they account for that because if there's a couple of really uniquely tough days of the year.

458
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:24,700
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll learn how to do it.

459
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:32,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that we have like I said we have not engaged some of those specialists that will need in order to do the appropriate work for an application.

460
00:48:33,523 --> 00:48:36,885
[SPEAKER_08]: But we hire real studs.

461
00:48:37,105 --> 00:48:40,326
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not screw around with secondary groups.

462
00:48:40,386 --> 00:48:44,248
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are real scientists, and they are really quants.

463
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:46,309
[SPEAKER_08]: They are calculus-oriented folks.

464
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:49,170
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're not going to cut any corners there.

465
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:58,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think part of it is the good news is our use is going to create less traffic than other uses that someone could build here today.

466
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:10,680
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at the as of right zoning, I don't have the precise numbers in front of me, but someone could come in here with a four-story laboratory building approaching 300,000 feet, and there would be no public hearing process.

467
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,742
[SPEAKER_08]: They would just drop the plans on the building inspector's desk and wait for 30 days to go.

468
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:21,004
[SPEAKER_08]: So compared to some of the alternative uses here, we're a pretty mild one.

469
00:49:22,765 --> 00:49:25,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how we relate to what Cappy's does.

470
00:49:25,346 --> 00:49:26,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I suspect it's probably a little more.

471
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:49,337
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I could tell you that this type of use on this parcel is one of the reducing uses if this were retail or or or employment space lab offices that sort of thing it's those spaces are typically four or five cars per 1000 feet and we're going to be about one car per 1000 feet so i'm not going to say.

472
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:56,091
[SPEAKER_08]: not going to tell you it's not going to ever be a car here that you're angry at or cut you off or something that that's going to happen probably.

473
00:49:56,692 --> 00:49:58,712
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just from a sheer volume standpoint.

474
00:50:00,153 --> 00:50:02,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Particularly on those holidays will be quite a bit less.

475
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I just in terms of keeping it honest.

476
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:14,336
[SPEAKER_02]: There would be a public hearing a site plan review and anything of that nature but if you're correct that it's as a right use and and that it would just be review of the site.

477
00:50:14,836 --> 00:50:17,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Also copy although I believe you're next.

478
00:50:18,156 --> 00:50:22,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you can and I thank you for the presentation to make it by and if I understood you're right.

479
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:30,580
[SPEAKER_09]: The first 3 floors are going to be parking and then the next 4 floors are going to be the living spaces correct.

480
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:31,700
[SPEAKER_08]: The next 5.

481
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:36,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Next 5 to be living spaces and that will be what 250 units.

482
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:46,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think right now it's 265 it's still in you know obviously we haven't designed this yet it's it's not up that roughly yes, you know, and how many total pockets possible to be.

483
00:50:47,902 --> 00:50:50,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're proposing just over one space per unit.

484
00:50:50,843 --> 00:51:01,247
[SPEAKER_08]: We were looking at some of the other zoning elements in the area, and it seems like the city allows somewhere between 0.85 or more and spaces per unit.

485
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:05,128
[SPEAKER_09]: So we thought that was- I think our zoning goes from 0.75 to 1.5.

486
00:51:05,248 --> 00:51:11,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so we thought a little bit more than that would be appropriate, although we agree this is a transit zone.

487
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,611
[SPEAKER_08]: So about one space per unit is the answer.

488
00:51:14,591 --> 00:51:16,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Micah, how many affordable units will be in here?

489
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:23,349
[SPEAKER_08]: We're proposing to follow Bedford's inclusionary housing rules and regulations, so I think 15%.

490
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:23,349
15%?

491
00:51:24,169 --> 00:51:29,912
[SPEAKER_09]: And do you have a price range of what you think these units will be going for?

492
00:51:29,932 --> 00:51:30,972
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't.

493
00:51:31,353 --> 00:51:35,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just say that, you know, I would just tell you that

494
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:40,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't tell you what it will be because it was years of work.

495
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:48,970
[SPEAKER_08]: But it would be coincident with what you see in across the street and some of these other newer communities within a mile of us you know we think would would compete pretty well with those.

496
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:54,092
[SPEAKER_09]: You know so I you know I I hear from commercial people looking to come in to make it.

497
00:51:54,892 --> 00:51:59,753
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the concerns is do we have enough housing to sustain.

498
00:52:01,094 --> 00:52:04,655
[SPEAKER_09]: The potential job growth in the city of method people I want to move in.

499
00:52:05,128 --> 00:52:07,608
[SPEAKER_09]: And the question is, and the answer is at the moment, no, we don't.

500
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:11,889
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think Kristen made that point.

501
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:24,111
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the negative side here is you're putting a building on probably the busiest stretch of road, probably the busiest corners in the city of Medford.

502
00:52:24,912 --> 00:52:32,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And some genius from DCI decided it was a good idea to put a cut-through in back of all these units.

503
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:49,453
[SPEAKER_09]: which was a as a giant mistake of the day I don't I don't know who thought of that but all they're doing is directing the traffic and back of all these all these apartments and condos which is I say I just I can't see where these with the state ever got.

504
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:54,198
[SPEAKER_09]: But that that was a good idea so I mean in this state that's not your fault.

505
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:56,160
[SPEAKER_09]: You know on the positive side.

506
00:52:56,955 --> 00:53:04,701
[SPEAKER_09]: you know taking cappies out of the area and the Monroe muffler is going to obviously reducing a great amount of traffic.

507
00:53:05,722 --> 00:53:09,324
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a cat you know cabbies is a 7 day a week.

508
00:53:09,444 --> 00:53:16,710
[SPEAKER_09]: You know 9 to 11 to 11 o'clock in a business and like many people said you know you get to the holiday time in the weekends.

509
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:21,394
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't get the cappies not not so much about.

510
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:25,917
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a good part that you you'll be making you'll be taking those kids out of there.

511
00:53:26,513 --> 00:53:44,915
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll stop some of the cut through traffic, but until the state decides to admit they made a mistake on that 9th Street turnoff, I don't know what these neighbors are going to do as far as that goes.

512
00:53:46,862 --> 00:53:51,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I would hope that you would consider mitigation, you know, maybe helping them with, you know, pave the street.

513
00:53:51,403 --> 00:53:59,285
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know that's not in your scope, but as a good gesture in your part.

514
00:53:59,465 --> 00:54:10,208
[SPEAKER_09]: My next question is, you're gonna be blocking some of the view now of some of these other people, which I've heard concerns about.

515
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,008
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we address that?

516
00:54:14,415 --> 00:54:16,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a great answer for you on the view.

517
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:22,142
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just sort of a function of when you get a zone with with buildings like this, you know.

518
00:54:24,124 --> 00:54:28,028
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, some some folks won't have as good a view, you know, I guess.

519
00:54:28,188 --> 00:54:32,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not and not on your property, but you know, like I said, that is that's a crowded area as it is.

520
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:34,614
[SPEAKER_09]: And now, you know,

521
00:54:36,015 --> 00:54:36,876
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fair question.

522
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:38,458
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fair question.

523
00:54:38,598 --> 00:54:42,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think some people's view candidly, my goal is to build an attractive enough building.

524
00:54:43,804 --> 00:54:45,085
[SPEAKER_09]: The building is fine.

525
00:54:45,786 --> 00:54:49,470
[SPEAKER_08]: My point being looking at the back of Cappy's isn't a great.

526
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:53,695
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hopefully going to improve some views and ensure we're going to block.

527
00:54:53,795 --> 00:54:55,697
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there's some folks that probably have a view.

528
00:54:56,538 --> 00:55:11,585
[SPEAKER_08]: You know us Southwest and can see like the mystic River reservation and I haven't seen them that yet, but I suspect there are I hope our view is at least with is better than the cappies in Monroe, but you know they'll be some tradeoffs there for sure I don't have a perfect answer for that.

529
00:55:12,886 --> 00:55:16,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the is the cup is it do I say they say this correctly curvy all.

530
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:25,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is the cut through the actual 9th Street or is it that service road that comes that we all know it's what they talk about so you coming down Route 16 as soon as you come over the bridge.

531
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:28,203
[SPEAKER_09]: It's it take it takes the people on the brain.

532
00:55:28,823 --> 00:55:50,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, which is like like what the resident said that it really is a private way and and sales have city have private and I say I I what when they put that in I couldn't I can't believe someone actually got paid to do that that the take of that the stupidity that to take traffic off of Route 16 one of the busiest roads in the area.

533
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:53,514
[SPEAKER_09]: and follow the behind these that and to this neighborhood.

534
00:55:53,895 --> 00:55:59,077
[SPEAKER_09]: And again it's not your fault and it's not anyone in the fall, that's strictly the fault of the DCR.

535
00:55:59,618 --> 00:56:06,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'll say this, we may not be able to fix all of those problems, but we have, our specialists are pretty darn good.

536
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:10,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So we may be able to do something that's at least positive.

537
00:56:10,724 --> 00:56:16,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, in Westwood, I've done a lot of work with traffic calming and really subtle things, chicanes and roundabouts.

538
00:56:17,388 --> 00:56:26,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people hate all these words and these techniques, but sometimes there are effective ones we can, let's just say, politely, gently discourage cut through traffic.

539
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:33,705
[SPEAKER_08]: We have tools there and we'll deploy our teams to managing that the best we can and what we're able to do.

540
00:56:34,405 --> 00:56:37,268
[SPEAKER_08]: 9th Street is private, which is good and bad.

541
00:56:37,288 --> 00:56:42,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I think technically this parcel or these parcels would own halfway to the midline.

542
00:56:42,974 --> 00:56:51,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a little bit of private rights management we would need to work with the abutters and make sure everybody's in agreement whatever happens to that road, what everybody wants to happen.

543
00:56:51,984 --> 00:56:54,686
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a nice democratic process to that.

544
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:57,988
[SPEAKER_08]: But there could be solutions with that.

545
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:07,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Candidly, the architect that we used to help create most of these images is on the steering committee for the MassDOT reconstruction of this intersection.

546
00:57:07,711 --> 00:57:17,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a great symmetry there where if we have the ability to leverage some of that and some of the comments we'll get and concerns we'll vet with this, we may be able to

547
00:57:18,892 --> 00:57:22,575
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe not fix it, but positively impact it more than you think.

548
00:57:22,995 --> 00:57:24,896
[SPEAKER_08]: And we would put our teams to work on that.

549
00:57:25,637 --> 00:57:39,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, would there be a consideration of possibly putting some type of shuttle over to the train station during peak work hours, maybe like 7 to 10, 4 to 6, something like that?

550
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:40,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe hooking up with

551
00:57:41,178 --> 00:57:44,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we've talked about some development going further down the road.

552
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:52,089
[SPEAKER_09]: We asked them about maybe doing a combined shuttle service to get people over to the train station and back.

553
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:54,439
[SPEAKER_08]: We would certainly look at it.

554
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:58,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Candidly, I think if during rush hour shuttle bus left our site to go to Wellington.

555
00:57:59,821 --> 00:58:05,362
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about a six minute walk from our site and I'm not a very fast or fleet of foot gentlemen any longer.

556
00:58:06,242 --> 00:58:14,064
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, you can get to that aerial bridge pretty darn quick, not counting for the crosswalk at the intersection there.

557
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:17,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So but we'll look at it.

558
00:58:17,566 --> 00:58:21,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't say no, but I suspect one of the things.

559
00:58:21,069 --> 00:58:21,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

560
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:22,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to butt in for a second.

561
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,311
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a six minute walk.

562
00:58:24,331 --> 00:58:25,392
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like 15 minutes.

563
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:30,616
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mike, you're kind of taking it away from your hands, walking across Route 16.

564
00:58:31,616 --> 00:58:34,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I wouldn't say no to you at this point, Mr. Carmelo.

565
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:35,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll have to look at it.

566
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,903
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's a TMA in the area, we've oftentimes been asked to join the TMA and contribute to that.

567
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:43,045
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll certainly peer you guys out on that.

568
00:58:43,705 --> 00:58:50,346
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as the, you know, you say you are building probably on the busiest corner in the city of Medford.

569
00:58:51,506 --> 00:59:00,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So they say, you know, on the positive, you are taking away a decent amount of traffic with cappies and Monroe, especially cappies, which operates 24 hours.

570
00:59:00,948 --> 00:59:09,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the residents will see some, maybe some relief and traffic with this versus what's there now.

571
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:10,570
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

572
00:59:11,683 --> 00:59:13,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank you for your presentation.

573
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:13,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

574
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathy, I think you're on mute.

575
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:23,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I muted myself.

576
00:59:24,242 --> 00:59:27,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Debra Carante, you had a question before.

577
00:59:28,025 --> 00:59:28,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

578
00:59:28,525 --> 00:59:32,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just basically piggybacking on other comments here.

579
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:39,613
[SPEAKER_01]: The major concern, I live here at the Parkway Plaza South condominium, which faces Route 16.

580
00:59:41,174 --> 00:59:45,056
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so congested here.

581
00:59:45,116 --> 00:59:50,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to get out of Route 9th Street right now is very difficult.

582
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:57,533
[SPEAKER_01]: If you try to exit onto the parkway, the traffic on Route 16 and Wellington Circle is just really bad.

583
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:07,061
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just afraid with a large complex like this going up, it's, in my opinion, it's just going to cause unbelievable traffic congestion.

584
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:08,822
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my main concern.

585
01:00:09,283 --> 01:00:14,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I think it was Linda who addressed the rodent issue, which you already spoke about.

586
01:00:14,825 --> 01:00:19,368
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just think that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen with the digging and construction.

587
01:00:19,969 --> 01:00:29,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, will this new complex, how will this affect the value of our property?

588
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:35,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't think people are going to want to live in such a crowded, congested area.

589
01:00:36,101 --> 01:00:40,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Rick just said, this area is the most congested in Medford.

590
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:44,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is this going to decrease the value of our property?

591
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:46,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we all own condos here.

592
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:50,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, I'm not a real estate appraisal specialist.

593
01:00:50,873 --> 01:01:00,498
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would suspect being behind an automotive use in the back of a liquor store, again, no discredit to Cappy's fine institution.

594
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:04,139
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a much better neighbor for you guys.

595
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:07,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are studies at MIT.

596
01:01:10,997 --> 01:01:17,840
[SPEAKER_08]: that were done, you know, 15 years ago, I think, and they were very involved, and it was two reams of paper thick, and I unfortunately read it.

597
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:24,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And they found that mixed-income communities almost unilaterally increased values next door.

598
01:01:24,442 --> 01:01:35,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll just say I'm not an appraiser, but I got to imagine having a nice first-class neighbor like this, as opposed to the uses there, are going to help you, or they're certainly not going to hurt your values.

599
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:40,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you guys are scaring me with the rats getting a little nervous.

600
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:43,140
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to look into that pretty hard promise.

601
01:01:44,461 --> 01:01:44,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

602
01:01:50,526 --> 01:01:52,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe you had one on yourself.

603
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:57,872
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new unit.

604
01:02:01,413 --> 01:02:02,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you guys can start.

605
01:02:02,734 --> 01:02:05,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if at this point, are there any other hands raised?

606
01:02:05,995 --> 01:02:07,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe we see any.

607
01:02:08,536 --> 01:02:12,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at this point, we can probably go through the chat.

608
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:15,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of the questions are the same, but we can run through it.

609
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:23,443
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Kathy, I might need you to educate me on how to bring the chat up here to go through it.

610
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:24,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I see them popping up.

611
01:02:24,484 --> 01:02:24,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

612
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:29,886
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a tough question on there.

613
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:30,807
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want, we can just

614
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,153
[SPEAKER_11]: ask you the question verbally.

615
01:02:33,813 --> 01:02:38,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Mike, thanks for the presentation.

616
01:02:38,635 --> 01:02:40,855
[SPEAKER_11]: We are here at Parkway Plaza West.

617
01:02:40,935 --> 01:02:42,896
[SPEAKER_11]: We are another neighbor.

618
01:02:42,996 --> 01:02:44,337
[SPEAKER_11]: So great to meet you.

619
01:02:44,397 --> 01:02:45,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for organizing this.

620
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:51,979
[SPEAKER_11]: So we had a couple of quick questions.

621
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:56,281
[SPEAKER_11]: One, how long do you think a construction like this will take?

622
01:02:57,335 --> 01:03:02,837
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know this is very early, you mentioned, but when do you think potentially it might start?

623
01:03:05,098 --> 01:03:05,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

624
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:12,280
[SPEAKER_08]: So the construction on a project like this is probably all of 2024 months.

625
01:03:14,301 --> 01:03:16,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say the majority of that.

626
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:24,303
[SPEAKER_08]: The building is already sort of framed and constructed and our guys would be busy inside.

627
01:03:25,064 --> 01:03:33,570
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but yeah, I would say it's a two from groundbreaking and demolition out it would be it would be two years roughly in today's market anyway.

628
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:52,523
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as when would it start construction, I wouldn't presume to tell the city how long they'd need to take for their approval processes, but typically a year or more for permitting, and then another good six to nine months for design and engineering.

629
01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:56,305
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is quite a ways out, assuming we're able to proceed.

630
01:03:56,325 --> 01:03:58,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

631
01:03:58,447 --> 01:04:02,690
[SPEAKER_11]: And what about disturbance to the near buildings?

632
01:04:03,904 --> 01:04:07,558
[SPEAKER_11]: like us, during your construction or, you know, when you finish construction.

633
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:10,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

634
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:21,056
[SPEAKER_08]: We get started, we'll do, we'll do, you know, testing on all the buildings around us and make sure everybody's, you know, structurally sound and intact before we would do anything.

635
01:04:21,897 --> 01:04:23,517
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's certainly any heavy work.

636
01:04:24,538 --> 01:04:27,780
[SPEAKER_08]: But these days, these buildings are all being built by a central crane.

637
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And so generally everything kind of is erected from the inside out.

638
01:04:32,642 --> 01:04:33,202
[SPEAKER_08]: And so

639
01:04:35,763 --> 01:04:46,574
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as impacts to buildings around us, that's something we work in a lot of urban zones on very tight sites like this, and oftentimes next to residential uses.

640
01:04:47,494 --> 01:04:59,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So the idea would be we put up a nice tall fence with a scrim that's opaque, and you don't have to see a whole lot of what we're doing behind the scenes.

641
01:05:01,011 --> 01:05:04,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Fortunately, this type of construction isn't a terribly noisy construction process.

642
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:15,339
[SPEAKER_08]: We certainly would be working with the city and folks like you at public hearings to talk about what are appropriate hours for work and, you know, those sort of things.

643
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:16,660
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not being a nuisance.

644
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:17,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

645
01:05:17,701 --> 01:05:21,763
[SPEAKER_11]: And we definitely appreciate the opportunity to discuss because this has been very helpful.

646
01:05:22,243 --> 01:05:30,488
[SPEAKER_11]: And a final quick one is that, so 260 plus units in five floors, just curious, what's the average unit size?

647
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,042
[SPEAKER_08]: About 920 spitball it's okay.

648
01:05:34,062 --> 01:05:34,243
[SPEAKER_08]: 945 yeah.

649
01:05:41,436 --> 01:05:49,078
[SPEAKER_08]: So we think that the unit mix conceptually here, and this is how we get from those big orange boxes to what it roughly means unit wise.

650
01:05:50,038 --> 01:05:53,359
[SPEAKER_08]: We think the important piece here is programming a range of product.

651
01:05:53,619 --> 01:06:00,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford's very diverse on multiple fronts, on income levels, on education, on employment types, on transit styles.

652
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:08,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we think there's a small amount of units that are suitable for studios and junior one beds.

653
01:06:09,563 --> 01:06:19,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Those tend to be our more entry-level renter that are not yet hitched up with a girl or a guy and on their way to maybe on their second stop on their career.

654
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:23,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this is a very strong one-bedroom market.

655
01:06:24,107 --> 01:06:37,390
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like whether you're single and more advanced in your career or maybe slightly less advanced, you're still in your first or second job professionally, but you have been hitched up and you've got a girlfriend or a boyfriend.

656
01:06:38,811 --> 01:06:40,331
[SPEAKER_08]: and you like those.

657
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:49,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So then in our recent studies, we think, you know, there's certainly room for two bedrooms and larger unit types, but as we continue to study a little bit less than we thought.

658
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

659
01:06:52,899 --> 01:06:57,621
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we got to continue to try to flush out what's the right market mix here to serve Medford.

660
01:06:58,142 --> 01:06:58,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

661
01:06:58,502 --> 01:07:02,144
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanted to relay a question from the chair of our board of trustees here.

662
01:07:02,964 --> 01:07:03,765
[SPEAKER_11]: She wanted me to ask,

663
01:07:04,407 --> 01:07:09,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wanted to know, can he say that he would structurally check the buildings before the construction started?

664
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:11,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear that?

665
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:17,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we haven't gotten this far down the study, the study process yet.

666
01:07:17,994 --> 01:07:23,099
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't think we need, you know, for example, we're not driving, I don't think we're going to need to drive piles or anything.

667
01:07:23,659 --> 01:07:36,890
[SPEAKER_08]: But typically, if there's any major site disturbance process, if we're digging a hole or putting in sheet piles, or we would do seismic analysis on all of our area butters, there are companies that specialize in this that we bring on board.

668
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:40,053
[SPEAKER_08]: And particularly when you're close to another building,

669
01:07:40,581 --> 01:07:44,282
[SPEAKER_08]: We're about 12 feet from some neighbors on a project in Waltham we're working on.

670
01:07:44,362 --> 01:07:52,345
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we use seismic monitors and all kinds of great high-tech stuff to make sure that we're not doing anything untoward with our neighbors.

671
01:07:58,827 --> 01:07:59,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

672
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:04,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And somebody else wanted to confirm this was going to be all units and no zoning for businesses.

673
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Retails like Starbucks or, you know, et cetera.

674
01:08:09,758 --> 01:08:11,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we have a good question.

675
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:19,645
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we were looking across the street at station landing and we thought that might be something to look at adding commercial use on the first floor.

676
01:08:21,006 --> 01:08:26,850
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, the traffic concerns raised tonight were something candidly we expected.

677
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:32,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I've personally watched some of the meetings with MassDOT and how they're reprogramming that intersection.

678
01:08:32,533 --> 01:08:36,956
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, the additional traffic impacts the need for

679
01:08:38,278 --> 01:08:49,711
[SPEAKER_08]: The things that took the additional traffic impacts and timing that retail would bring here, we thought would just be so negative that they might they might negatively present us the whole project.

680
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:53,595
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other piece that we're struggling with we get asked this a lot.

681
01:08:55,744 --> 01:09:04,278
[SPEAKER_08]: You know whether there's a good spot for retail, I would just say what the retail that would want to be in this zone is more like what's across the street at station landing.

682
01:09:05,019 --> 01:09:10,327
[SPEAKER_08]: And like for example right now, you can't lease a space to Starbucks if it's not a drive through.

683
01:09:11,128 --> 01:09:15,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of retailers, even other coffee shops that are going that way too.

684
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:21,114
[SPEAKER_08]: And coffee shop kind of felt, or cafe, kind of felt like the right use that would go here.

685
01:09:21,134 --> 01:09:29,378
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the time we accommodated all that, the impacts on traffic, we just decided to remove that part from our concept.

686
01:09:29,618 --> 01:09:37,863
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's worth more discussion, but candidly, I think it'd be worse for the neighborhood and for the site from a traffic and impact standpoint.

687
01:09:38,643 --> 01:09:42,685
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last is if you don't do it perfect and that retail doesn't lease.

688
01:09:43,826 --> 01:09:48,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if you know even if you least we decided to market it way below market.

689
01:09:49,428 --> 01:10:06,897
[SPEAKER_08]: A vacant blighted space is just from an urban planning standpoint a real problem it's just brings all kinds of negative outcomes so so I'm glad you asked that we spent a lot of time studying it and talking about it and that's why we landed with with just housing and associated uses.

690
01:10:09,242 --> 01:10:10,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Jean.

691
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have another question.

692
01:10:12,144 --> 01:10:16,207
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you're going to provide parking for one car per unit.

693
01:10:16,828 --> 01:10:24,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, a lot of units or most units have two cars, so there's no place in the area to park.

694
01:10:25,014 --> 01:10:26,255
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you do about that?

695
01:10:27,406 --> 01:10:28,026
[SPEAKER_08]: The 2 things.

696
01:10:28,947 --> 01:10:31,888
[SPEAKER_08]: One is I'd kindly like to disagree with you.

697
01:10:33,548 --> 01:10:43,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of our residents are not to car households even in and our him asset which was much larger units and more sort of older demographic less professional.

698
01:10:44,692 --> 01:10:46,933
[SPEAKER_08]: We did not get to a 2 car per unit average.

699
01:10:47,693 --> 01:10:54,555
[SPEAKER_08]: But even if I'm wrong I'll tell you this I put my money where my mouth is where we've done this and other projects.

700
01:10:55,755 --> 01:10:56,396
[SPEAKER_08]: We're certainly

701
01:10:57,356 --> 01:11:04,259
[SPEAKER_08]: concerned about folks that might park off-site in impact area streets, and particularly 9th Street in this case.

702
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:12,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can have a simple rider and make it illegal for our residents to park off-site and make them contractually obligated to it.

703
01:11:12,683 --> 01:11:13,583
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've done that before.

704
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:14,744
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an easy thing to do.

705
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:22,247
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's something that the neighborhood or the city thinks is important, we're fine with restricting it with something hard like that.

706
01:11:25,093 --> 01:11:28,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, I don't think it's gonna, I think one O is, is a little cushy.

707
01:11:29,376 --> 01:11:36,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I think our competitors are, are, are fine to go as low as 0.75 or one car per or 0.85 cars per unit.

708
01:11:36,842 --> 01:11:39,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I think candidly Medford zoning is pretty progressive on that.

709
01:11:39,965 --> 01:11:47,931
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't, they obviously have done some studies because we do a lot of that, that analysis and it can't be a coincidence.

710
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:50,573
[SPEAKER_08]: They, they know precisely what this customer does.

711
01:11:50,653 --> 01:11:51,934
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, uh,

712
01:11:53,428 --> 01:11:56,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been pushed to go less parking in cities like Cambridge.

713
01:11:56,691 --> 01:11:58,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been pushed to go more in other places.

714
01:11:59,693 --> 01:12:00,834
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot of studies on this.

715
01:12:00,874 --> 01:12:02,575
[SPEAKER_08]: We know what we need from a business standpoint.

716
01:12:02,615 --> 01:12:07,479
[SPEAKER_08]: If we don't have enough parking for our customers, they won't lease with us.

717
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:14,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So the last thing I want to do is unnecessarily limit the parking if it's going to harm our business.

718
01:12:15,425 --> 01:12:20,549
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you don't have to take my word for it, I'll put my money where my mouth is, and we'll restrict it.

719
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:28,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I just have one last question.

720
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,700
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Jean.

721
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:37,043
[SPEAKER_04]: The entrance to the garage and the entrance to the building is on Middlesex Avenue, not on Ninth Street.

722
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:37,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

723
01:12:38,503 --> 01:12:39,704
[SPEAKER_08]: On this concept, that's right.

724
01:12:40,184 --> 01:12:43,605
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a feeling you guys weren't going to want us putting new cars on the Ninth Street.

725
01:12:43,785 --> 01:12:44,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

726
01:12:44,145 --> 01:12:45,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caviello.

727
01:12:47,047 --> 01:12:47,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Cathy.

728
01:12:54,114 --> 01:13:06,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I can just have one to 2 things for you on is there any talk about buying that that little corner unit that kind of powerful that just to square that this way up this way our property have to make it look a little more uniform.

729
01:13:07,761 --> 01:13:10,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor how would you advise me to to answer this question.

730
01:13:12,414 --> 01:13:13,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

731
01:13:13,635 --> 01:13:21,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it would obviously, it would obviously enhance your property would make it look a lot better.

732
01:13:22,718 --> 01:13:28,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you have the whole thing, you know, I'll say, I'll say this, I married an urban planner, and she's tough.

733
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:32,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And this has been the subject of some discussion.

734
01:13:32,643 --> 01:13:33,543
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't miss it.

735
01:13:33,563 --> 01:13:35,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to drop property.

736
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:39,567
[SPEAKER_08]: The short answer is I've taken a couple shots at it unsuccessfully.

737
01:13:39,607 --> 01:13:41,429
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was just curious.

738
01:13:41,929 --> 01:13:42,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I would prefer to have it.

739
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:43,790
[SPEAKER_09]: But OK.

740
01:13:44,571 --> 01:13:46,452
[SPEAKER_09]: And you made the point about the parking.

741
01:13:47,272 --> 01:13:52,996
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go over to Rivers Edge, the Moderna, or the Rivers Edge apartments, Moderna, their parking lot is not full.

742
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:56,298
[SPEAKER_09]: And neither is the Rivers Edge units with cars.

743
01:13:59,297 --> 01:14:03,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the day of the two-car parking is, I mean, the two cars are out.

744
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:12,867
[SPEAKER_09]: You might have a few people with two cars, but basically the younger crowd, all Ubers around, and some of them don't even own cars anymore.

745
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:16,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Check with Moderna and check with Rivers Edge, the new apartment buildings over there.

746
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:23,555
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll tell you that they both have, their parking is, they have plenty of parking there.

747
01:14:23,715 --> 01:14:25,977
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not enough people own cars anymore.

748
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:28,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that we're going to do that.

749
01:14:29,202 --> 01:14:33,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one last question Mary Harris and then we'll we'll get to the trash the the jet.

750
01:14:35,105 --> 01:14:45,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I thank you so my question about parking or cars which they're very valid and I do have concerns about that to my questions a little bit different.

751
01:14:46,092 --> 01:14:49,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So I miss the beginning of your of

752
01:14:50,373 --> 01:14:57,361
[SPEAKER_03]: your presentation, Mike, and I didn't hear exactly how many stories you're planning to build.

753
01:14:57,781 --> 01:15:03,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And my question is, what about the shadows that would affect, say, our pool?

754
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:10,356
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in the summertime, when we're sitting around trying to get some fun, how would that affect that?

755
01:15:11,768 --> 01:15:19,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so the first is we're proposing an eight story or underwriting and analyzing an eight story community here.

756
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:29,443
[SPEAKER_08]: So pretty similar to the stuff around in the neighborhood on the north and south side of route 16 we didn't feel it was appropriate to go any taller, certainly.

757
01:15:30,963 --> 01:15:34,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And then from a shadow studies, I mean, candidly, we are not quite there yet.

758
01:15:35,145 --> 01:15:38,566
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not an unusual part of a permitting process.

759
01:15:39,106 --> 01:15:40,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I suspect we would be doing that here.

760
01:15:41,207 --> 01:15:42,147
[SPEAKER_08]: So I apologize.

761
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:46,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know precisely where your pool is, but that's something we can study.

762
01:15:46,449 --> 01:15:47,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's facing ninth street.

763
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:48,850
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's right behind Kathy.

764
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:52,791
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm not there, I can actually see the rooftop of Kathy.

765
01:15:54,171 --> 01:15:54,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

766
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:55,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

767
01:15:55,312 --> 01:15:58,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the short answer is it's something we would certainly study and take a look at.

768
01:15:59,478 --> 01:16:06,024
[SPEAKER_08]: And I I apologize I don't have a good precise answer for you that would be part of the permitting process.

769
01:16:06,864 --> 01:16:07,885
[SPEAKER_02]: As you as you go through.

770
01:16:07,905 --> 01:16:09,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

771
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:22,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of what we have in the chat I believe has been answered but let's run through one question that was asked was why rentals instead of condos.

772
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:33,055
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple good answers there, but the short one is Alliance Residential just doesn't build condominiums.

773
01:16:33,716 --> 01:16:35,237
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a privately held company.

774
01:16:35,397 --> 01:16:38,340
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's one thing that sets us apart from some of our competitors.

775
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:43,384
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we are not a investment bank backed type of group.

776
01:16:43,564 --> 01:16:51,011
[SPEAKER_08]: We build a lot of homes every year, some years more than everybody else, but we're effectively four senior partners.

777
01:16:52,052 --> 01:16:53,373
[SPEAKER_08]: We are fully privately owned.

778
01:16:54,332 --> 01:17:02,440
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something that our guys in Phoenix, where we're based, have fought pretty hard to keep the investors at bay.

779
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:10,367
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a downstream liability with condominium construction that is something that they just decided they don't want to do.

780
01:17:11,408 --> 01:17:17,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's just sort of structurally, programmatically, we just don't do it.

781
01:17:18,742 --> 01:17:29,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe we answered the questions and had the discussion discussion concerning 9th Street and also the number of bedrooms, 1, 2, and 3, I think you went through that correct Mike.

782
01:17:30,185 --> 01:17:42,136
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so in concept, you know, again, we were sort of we're still in the still some flux there, which is why we keep saying about on our unit types, but you know, this is a, this is an interesting and changing market.

783
01:17:42,156 --> 01:17:46,500
[SPEAKER_08]: So that mix has been changing, but it's primarily a one and two bed community is what we think.

784
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:49,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there'll certainly be some larger and smaller units as well.

785
01:17:50,697 --> 01:17:53,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a question about what about infrastructure.

786
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:55,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Well our water pressure go down with the new building.

787
01:17:55,904 --> 01:18:01,312
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I can someone answer that that that everything that's done has to go through the engineering department and it's vetted.

788
01:18:01,871 --> 01:18:10,561
[SPEAKER_02]: through engineering to ensure that the infrastructure can take the added building.

789
01:18:11,102 --> 01:18:12,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you want to add anything to that.

790
01:18:13,424 --> 01:18:14,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I could add a little bit.

791
01:18:14,646 --> 01:18:17,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you the answer is almost certainly not.

792
01:18:17,329 --> 01:18:19,631
[SPEAKER_08]: We've tested the water out there already as a part.

793
01:18:19,771 --> 01:18:22,414
[SPEAKER_08]: We test to see if all the utilities we need are available.

794
01:18:23,362 --> 01:18:25,623
[SPEAKER_08]: certainly all the telecom and communications.

795
01:18:26,563 --> 01:18:28,884
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of water and good pressure there.

796
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:36,686
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition, our building, because it's a high-rise building, probably like yours, would require its own pumps.

797
01:18:37,426 --> 01:18:42,068
[SPEAKER_08]: If this were a five-story building or less, it wouldn't.

798
01:18:42,268 --> 01:18:47,729
[SPEAKER_08]: This building is a pretty robust proposal if we're able to put it forward.

799
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:50,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you'd have any impacts like that.

800
01:18:51,129 --> 01:18:55,353
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the other questions is, will there be union or non-union labor?

801
01:18:55,633 --> 01:18:58,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's kind of early in the project, too.

802
01:18:59,397 --> 01:19:01,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll just say typically it's a big mix.

803
01:19:01,879 --> 01:19:03,040
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends.

804
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,963
[SPEAKER_08]: The truckers and the concrete guys are almost always union elevators and roofs.

805
01:19:07,023 --> 01:19:10,366
[SPEAKER_08]: And then some trades, but we bid competitively on everything.

806
01:19:11,467 --> 01:19:14,110
[SPEAKER_08]: But the very, very short answer is we just don't know yet.

807
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:17,433
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a lot of work to do before we get there.

808
01:19:19,341 --> 01:19:29,985
[SPEAKER_02]: question as to will you add any common areas for existing residents, benches, shade trees, any of those things that will be available to existing residents?

809
01:19:31,045 --> 01:19:31,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

810
01:19:32,126 --> 01:19:45,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think that's part of the spirit of what we were talking about in the beginning, which is what we think returning some of that asphalt on the west side and on the south side that were originally intended to be a parkway connection to the Mystic

811
01:19:46,171 --> 01:19:47,512
[SPEAKER_08]: reservation into the Felsway.

812
01:19:47,552 --> 01:19:55,938
[SPEAKER_08]: So certainly, I mean, I think technically, it'll be private property, but you know, it's going to be connected to all the area sidewalks and crosswalks and all that.

813
01:19:56,078 --> 01:19:58,019
[SPEAKER_08]: So the short answer is yes.

814
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:04,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Along those areas, we think there's a lot of improvement that we can we can contribute there on those spaces.

815
01:20:05,474 --> 01:20:24,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think most of the other check questions were answered with the exception of there was a question about emailing the video of the meeting and certainly my e-mail is on the letter that was sent out and I can try to do that I know that I had some difficulty with the last meeting based on the size.

816
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:34,456
[SPEAKER_02]: of getting that out to people but it is generally posted on that the Medford website of meetings it will it will be there.

817
01:20:35,296 --> 01:20:42,960
[SPEAKER_02]: If if people want to review it and you can certainly me in the email me and I'll I'll do my best to get you a link to get it get it to you.

818
01:20:44,601 --> 01:20:46,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it for the chat.

819
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:48,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And the questions.

820
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:54,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So something this up would like to thank everybody for coming Mike you want to say.

821
01:20:55,057 --> 01:20:55,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask a few words.

822
01:20:56,578 --> 01:21:00,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll just say that this is an amazing turnout.

823
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate you guys all.

824
01:21:03,141 --> 01:21:04,622
[SPEAKER_08]: You brought very advanced questions.

825
01:21:04,642 --> 01:21:07,223
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are a well-studied group.

826
01:21:07,263 --> 01:21:08,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for participating.

827
01:21:08,804 --> 01:21:12,705
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something we, you know, I do, I mentioned that I live locally.

828
01:21:12,745 --> 01:21:15,887
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something I'm very passionate about building housing in greater Boston.

829
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:18,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And so these are all good questions.

830
01:21:18,328 --> 01:21:20,429
[SPEAKER_08]: These are things that we manage on all of our developments.

831
01:21:20,829 --> 01:21:22,350
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I,

832
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:25,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I will stand by the prop work I've done in the past.

833
01:21:27,352 --> 01:21:43,155
[SPEAKER_08]: We are skilled as anyone at resolving all these matters so we want to be a good neighbor we build homes, you know this is not a lab building a retail not that there's anything wrong with that we're building a place where we want to make sure people really want to stay and enjoy what you guys are all enjoying around here so.

834
01:21:44,555 --> 01:21:51,337
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for thank you for having us and say if this if there were any other questions that we missed maybe get one last shot to check them out there before we

835
01:21:52,428 --> 01:22:05,608
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a question on construction and where construction vehicles will be parked during construction, and also fire hydrants if that lose any parking spaces on nine street as a result of placement of.

836
01:22:06,724 --> 01:22:07,965
[SPEAKER_02]: fire apparatus, et cetera.

837
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:09,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say probably not.

838
01:22:09,886 --> 01:22:16,250
[SPEAKER_08]: That is really up to the fire department, but on a building like this, we'd have quite a bit of the hose connections on the building.

839
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:24,915
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, certainly if the fire chief wants a hydrant would do that, but I don't think if that were the case, it would be, it would impact any parking.

840
01:22:25,856 --> 01:22:34,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the first, the earlier question on construction vehicle parking, it's a great question, primarily offsite and is the short answer.

841
01:22:34,882 --> 01:22:35,302
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when we,

842
01:22:36,056 --> 01:22:52,683
[SPEAKER_08]: excuse me, when we get into the construction phase, we require a full logistic study, manpower studies, and I think on every job we have under construction right now, our contractors are using substantial offsite parking, and then we shut all the folks over.

843
01:22:53,924 --> 01:23:01,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So if the concern is that they're gonna start clogging up 9th Street, the answer is no, we're gonna keep our guys off.

844
01:23:02,985 --> 01:23:10,594
[SPEAKER_02]: And one question, you know, how will the neighbors know if you're going to proceed, I guess, you know, they'll, they'll be public hearings.

845
01:23:11,515 --> 01:23:13,278
[SPEAKER_02]: If that comes to fruition.

846
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:18,043
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's the next step is determining what it is.

847
01:23:18,898 --> 01:23:23,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I would just say if we're going to proceed, it probably wouldn't be until after the holidays.

848
01:23:24,721 --> 01:23:35,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And we used the same notification structure for this meeting to notify abutters as we would have had to for any other public hearing or meeting process.

849
01:23:35,968 --> 01:23:39,090
[SPEAKER_08]: So the short answer is I think probably a lot like this.

850
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:41,992
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're going forward, we'll see something in your inbox.

851
01:23:43,622 --> 01:23:53,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to conclude the meeting folks and we'd like to wish you all happy and safe Thanksgiving take care over the holidays and thank you for your attention.

852
01:23:54,298 --> 01:23:54,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
