    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=280.245s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  So these first slides we're going to start with are really just to get you acclimated with the neighborhood.
 I know that sounds silly because many of you live in the immediate area.
 However, we want to just make sure we all get started on the same page and talk about a little bit about the context for where we started our studies and conceptual program for the site.
 So the first one here is, of course, this is East Medford.
 Route 16 runs right across the page left to right.
 And the Fellsway and Middlesex Avenue run north to south.
 The taped site in yellow is the assembled parcels.
 Cappy's is the larger sort of hexagonal building.
 And Monroe Muffler is here on the east side on the property line.
 So the combined site,
 which again are 573 Fellsway, which is Cappy's Liquors, and 20 Revere Beach Parkway just to the east is the Monroe Muffler Shop.
 You'll see to the south here, Station Landing, the Mystic River Reservation off to the southwest, and the shopping centers up to the northwest.
 Of course, Wellington Station is at about 430 on your page.
 We've got a few axios here to show the immediate neighborhood.
 Again, these are really just to kind of show context of how the site fits in with the larger areas.
 We've turned the camera a bit on you.
 So, Route 16 or Revere Beach Parkway is running off to the east towards the top of Page and the Fellsway down to the right and Middlesex Avenue and the Fellsway up to the left.
 Cappy's there is just left of center.
 So obviously the neighborhood really is, you know, primarily seven and eight-story mixed-use buildings, quite a bit of housing in high-rise format.
 And you'll see Wellington just off top right of page.
 We'll flip the camera a bit here and looking southeast now, Cappies again just left of center, Route 16 traveling up and to the left of your screen, and station landing off across, southerly across Route 16 there.
 So looking at these photos, we like this site in the city for a lot of reasons.
 Medford's a great city.
 It features anything a modern resident would want, which is, of course, our business.
 The city is close to Boston, which in itself is always attractive.
 But really, it already has its own deep bench of employment of retail of walkability open space and history so all of those things stitched together to where, where, where our customers would want to live, they want to be close to home, they want to be able to walk to amenities, you know, nobody really wants to be in their car.
 And we've spent some time studying this intersection.
 Growing up in Arlington, I know this intersection well.
 So getting out of your car in this neighborhood is certainly an attractive thing, and Medford offers the ability to do that.
 And this site is really a microcosm more broadly of Medford, having all of those things I just mentioned within sometimes less than 1,000 feet of walking.
 Macro as a Bostonian, this is the type of modern housing I think greater Boston needs and regionally we need in eastern Massachusetts, where people even in cold weather aren't required to get into their vehicle to get a coffee to travel to work to pick up a prescription or to go get a classic roast beef at Kelly's across the street.
 So
 I'm going to move into some site photographs.
 I'm sure you guys are all relatively familiar with this, but I feel like we just want to be thorough.
 So this is a shot looking north of Cappy's, somewhat northeast, with 9th Street just in the back.
 You'll see a blue double two-story home on the left side of the screen with a garage.
 That is the 9th Street area.
 Monroe is just off to the right of your screen.
 This is a shot from Revere Beach Parkway on one of the many curb cuts on these two parcels.
 So we're looking straight north across the property line between Monroe and the Cappy site.
 This is a shot from 9th Street looking south.
 So Station Landing is in the background.
 Monroe is on just left of center and Cappy's, the back of Cappy's is just right of center.
 So you're looking at the intersection basically concealed only by the Cappy's.
 And then this is also a 9th Street shot looking the other direction.
 So you can see Boston Tattoo here in the background and the 9th Street intersection, current intersection and curb cut with Cappy's.
 So this last is an obvious satellite image of the site.
 We've oriented this North and South so we can stop getting you guys dizzy.
 9th Street runs East and West across the top of the site.
 This is Middlesex Avenue on the left, and again, Route 16 on the bottom.
 The property isn't taped, but it is this L-shaped combination of these two parcels, not including the Boston Tattoo Company.
 This is a good start to show where the site planning begins for us, apart from the macro context of the area and the uses that are here and the amenities.
 This is really where we start trying to integrate and stitch those things together into a program.
 On the left and on the south of the site, we're bound by these two roads or parkways.
 These were
 These are actually very interesting if you don't know the history, but these were formerly, like many parkways in greater Boston, were run by the MDC, now DCR.
 The spirit of these roads was effectively, as we were becoming an automobile-focused society, to have a pleasure-driving avenue to explore the area's benefits.
 So you, I'm sure, are all familiar with the Middlesex Bells.
 and the Mystic River reservations.
 These are really just spectacular green spaces, and the former MDC knew that, and they knew that they wanted people to experience those in a pleasurable way.
 So on the south side of the site, you'll see there's a pretty deep, for an urban zone like this, a pretty deep setback with mature trees and paths.
 Believe it or not, there's actually a deed restriction on these sites that allows the parkways to remain what their original intent was.
 So while we might not be putting around in a 57 Chevrolet enjoying the Mystic River Reservation here today,
 I drive on at least three parkways on the way to work every day.
 These are commuter roads now.
 But there's still an opportunity here, we think, to maintain the spirit of what these parkways were initially for.
 And one thing we found interesting was that on the west side of this site, along the Middlesex Avenue, it's paved right to the sidewalk.
 and there so those setbacks and deed notes actually exist there as well and so one of the things we thought might be attractive and seems to mate with some of the intersection plans being discussed is is an ability to use that even though it is on this property rather than leave it as asphalt is to try and continue that parkway um parkway spirit the paths put mature trees and native plantings there and the like um so
 We think restoring that buffer could be a real opportunity.
 So I'm going to move to the next shot.
 This is an actual concept we're working with.
 And it's roughly centered on the page as this is.
 So again, you'll see the, well, mislabeled Fellsway.
 That's technically Middlesex, of course, but Revere Beach Parkway on the bottom.
 And you'll see how we're looking at really adding back into those buffer zones, as I mentioned before, some of the green spaces.
 A number of other things worth highlighting as we get into this we're going to show you some more details on on how we program space conceptually.
 This community's proposed at 265 units of rental housing, we do not build condominiums in an eight story format with 100% of the resident parking enclosed within the building so.
 A lot of the surface parking areas that are on the perimeter of the area and nearby sites, we're going to instead work to green those up and bring the parking inside the envelope completely.
 We'll talk a little more about the rest of the program.
 But to get you started, effectively, we craft these communities so that they are a completely enclosed community.
 And so by that I mean, while this looks like a pretty normal building,
 from the outside, all of our building systems are located internally.
 So, trash, refuse collection and recycling, separation, emergency services and access, all of our amenities, or most of the amenities, I should say, that are internal to the site.
 Everything is neatly encapsulated within the envelope of the building we propose here.
 So, you'll see on the site, there's donut shape is primarily the mass of the building.
 However, there is a hole in the middle and we'll use that courtyard to have some outdoor private space for residents.
 That's a little more private than perhaps walking across the street to the mystic river.
 But typically, and we'll show you some photos of how we treat these spaces.
 But these spaces typically have a large pool deck, sort of resort styled.
 We'll have outdoor cooking areas, lounges and cabanas and that sort of thing.
 A space where, you know, to kind of center the entire community around.
 On the upper left of the page, you'll note we've got a curb cut proposed here off of Middlesex.
 And in fact, to expand on that, the site currently features five curb cuts.
 And I'm sure we'll spend a lot of time talking about traffic and parking here.
 But the big story here is we're going to try and eliminate all of those curb cuts but one.
 We have not engaged a traffic engineer at this time.
 However, we've done enough of these to know that on a busy intersection like this, particularly one that's in flux for its future, that the less interruption and the less curb cuts that you're delivering traffic onto, the better.
 Excuse me.
 So our goal here would be to eliminate as many of those curb cuts in this planet, four of the five would be would be removed from the site.
 Inside the garage, so residents will drive into the building here, just above where it says loading, and there'll be three levels of parking.
 So the first three levels of the program would all be structured parking and other building services, and then all of the housing, but for a very few units, would be located on floors four and above.
 So we're gonna dig into the building here a little bit.
 This would be the first level if you were to just shave everything on floors two through eight off.
 And so as you arrive, you'll see the only surface parking we're proposing is just at the amenity area.
 That's also where we would have our 24-hour leasing and staff located.
 So future residents might use these spaces if they were to come look at a home or to check out the community.
 So that that sort of area all on the west side labeled as amenity would be a two story volume focused on the leasing and then a number of different amenities, which we'll talk a little bit about later.
 but primarily work from home type spaces, screening rooms, flex spaces.
 And we'll show you some of the other examples of what we do for fun in those spaces.
 So those would be separated from the garage element.
 The next two levels above this would also be parking served by internal ramps.
 So invisible to the outside.
 This would be an upper garage.
 parking floor like two or three you'll note that now above the common program area will add some homes and there'll be some again on the south side until we get to the upper residential floors, such as this where it'll be all housing on force for and above.
 So we'll also in these upper floors probably have some amenities.
 We're finding that most surprising amount of people are not going back to the office.
 And so the flex time and work from home spaces are becoming an important part of our business.
 So while some people may go to work, the typical customer here is working in a high tech or an R&D type
 And those have, you know, non traditional non nine to five types of hours.
 So we're now building our amenities to make those spaces more pleasurable and make your sort of to help you separate work from home, even when you are near home, as you would be in this.
 So we've added some, these shots are what we call axiometrics.
 These shots were created with the intent to kind of stitch what we're proposing into the neighborhood.
 So you'll notice, like most of the buildings around here, this is also eight stories.
 I think one of the station landing buildings up front is seven.
 but you'll see we're looking to pull things back off of the parkways and contribute back to what that sort of original mission was for those roadways and also just give this a little bit of a softer edge on what is a very hard-edged zone.
 So this we've also picked these spaces to
 try to relate to the aerial views we showed you earlier.
 So where we were showing you a photo very similar to this of the Cappies and Monroe site to show you how this would stitch into those with the massing around it.
 Now, this is a shot looking south, excuse me, southeast.
 So Ninth Street would be just in front of the building here in your view and the Middlesex Avenue and the Fells Way coming basically straight up the page on the right side.
 station landings here in the back.
 We're proposing a lot of verticality.
 This is what we'd call a Vitruvian style building.
 It's very classic.
 We're not sure this is the space based on what's around it.
 There's a lot of brick.
 There's a lot of sort of traditional materials.
 Station landing is a relatively classic and timeless architecture.
 So we didn't feel it was appropriate to use some of the real contemporary modern looks.
 for this space.
 So we stuck with some pretty classic verticality and spacing and dimensions to the building.
 To help you stay oriented, this was the small little future resident parking area, and the garage entry would be right here.
 And again, these first three levels, despite the fact that they look traditional with windows and the like, would actually be just the same cladding, just enclosing the parking structure.
 So this is a similar angle to the one we just showed you just brought down from from the seagull residents of Medford's viewpoint to get you down to a more pedestrian scale.
 Again this is where those future resident spots in the curb cut on the middle section might be and a garage parking entrance here if you can see my cursor moving.
 So
 This is, again, this is an early concept, so this may look developed, and we have looked at a couple of other options, but this is sort of the path we've been going stylistically with the concept.
 Next, we're gonna show you some photos of other projects we've done in Greater Boston that have things that we think at least conceptually belong in a project like this.
 This is a community we built called The Val that we've just finished, or just finishing leasing up.
 And so some of the things you'll note here is a big two-story volume at the arrival.
 I mentioned that there was that amenity labeled space was also amenities, but also our leasing and management staff.
 So this is a good example of how we integrate some of these things.
 On the right side of this feature wall is actually the back of house where at all times you can find somebody on our team working there.
 But there's also this sort of hotel-styled arrival here, which is some of the way
 apartment home communities are going.
 So there's someone here at all times kind of giving you a more full service feeling during the
 well, during regular hours, more full service feeling to the building.
 And then you'll see these two stories and a feature stair.
 This is something we'd like to integrate in this project as well, where we really are stitching together some of these assembly spaces, work from home spaces, or maybe you're just scrolling and rolling with your earbuds in and your music on, but places where this is a little more activated and a little more public.
 This actually, this wall was, we had a local artist custom paint it for us in sort of a thematic nod to the name.
 This is a project we built two years ago called The Cove.
 This is another idea of just some of those sort of flex spaces where this is really,
 more recreational space, obviously a pool table, there's actually a beer tap back there and wine, excuse me, and a wine cooler.
 But this is a space that would also be, we would propose something like stylistically different, of course, right near those amenity and leasing spaces, a little more open concept.
 This is one of our fitness centers we just completed.
 This one's actually done on two levels.
 We had a lot of fun with this one.
 We're utilizing private mirror rooms for online workouts and then of course all the traditional cardio.
 So this one has actually up top of this spiral staircase has a cardio deck and then the rest of your workout is all below here.
 So you can get an idea of how we really want to create an enclosed, fully encapsulated community, but in a very first class way.
 This is a pool deck shot.
 So this is an important one because this is a good analogy for how we would treat that center of the donut type space you saw.
 This is also a green roof on deck.
 These trees, while brand new, will grow to be full 40 foot sugar maples and red maples.
 So we have a team that understands how to put
 full-sized real vegetation on top of a deck.
 Under this is a parking level, not unlike we would propose on this site.
 Then a full, of course, heated pool and resort style, three, four months of the year, great place to hang out with your iPad or just get some sun.
 This is a good example of how we would treat that.
 This is in the same project at the Val I mentioned earlier, similar green roof.
 You know, you'll see something.
 We had some taller trees at the inception here, but, and some lawn back there, which is hard to see, but we fully green up hard and soft scape.
 This one has a cool sun deck where you can throw your chaise lounge right in the water.
 It's heated and, and hang out, you know, we'll have fire, we have a large fire pit.
 And then this one, you can actually see the grilling stations, private grilling areas where you and your friends can kind of hang out.
 and have dinner.
 And then this is just, we just wanted to give you an idea of what some of our apartment homes look like.
 Alliance is a little different than some of our more cookie cutter national competitors.
 I'm not here to throw shade at any of them.
 There's a lot of great groups out there.
 We just really kind of treat each project with a little bit more of a customized approach.
 And so, you know, in our Hingham asset, you know, that was more appropriate to have a little bit more of a coastal New England style and a little bit more classic sort of features.
 You know, at workforce spaces, you might want to be a little cooler, have a little bit more fun with some of the design, a little less safe.
 And then, of course, the unit mix and the lighting and all that changes.
 So this is a good example.
 We actually did two different types of backsplash tile with a custom featured backsplash tile behind the range.
 and sort of things like that.
 But we build, you know, the goal is to build, you know, first class modern housing from connectivity to finishes and the like.
 And so that is that.
 Let's see if I can understand how to put this off.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1607.608s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 물어봐도 될까요? 우리가 질문을 시작할 수 있을지 모르겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1613.152s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 당신이 앞으로 나아갈 때, 당신은 침묵하지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1615.393s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 글쎄, 완벽해.
 감사합니다
 음, 메모해 주셔서 감사합니다.
 첫째, 나는 당신을 알고 있습니다.
 글쎄요, 우선 보도 부분이 정의되어 있어서 단면의 매끄러움이 마음에 드시는 것 같아요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1630.277s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 따라서 보도는 보도이고 여러분은 실망하게 될 것입니다. 그것은 훌륭한 예술 작품이 아니며 단지 보도일 뿐이며 사유지에 있는 공공 도로의 ​​중요한 부분이 될 수 있는 주요 도로일 뿐입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1645.285s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 글쎄요, 당신이 언급한 것을 압니다. 사람들은 자동차를 사용할 필요가 없고 아마도 집에서 일하고 싶어할 수도 있다는 큰 의미가 있습니다.
 R&D팀에도 여기로 이사할 수 있는 사람이 많다고 하셨어요.
 아시다시피 보스턴은 생명공학 산업의 거대한 중심지이고, 많은 사람들이 차를 몰고 다니는 것 같습니다.
 그들은 연구실에 가야 해요.
 알았어
 아직 초기 단계라고 말씀하셨지만, 올바른 배송 경로를 찾는 것이 중요하다고 생각합니다.
 누가 접근권한을 갖고 있는지 어떻게 확인하나요?
 집에서 일할 수 있는 사람만 채용하는 것은 아닙니다.
 저를 포함해 여러분도 제가 생명공학 분야에서 일하고 있다는 사실을 알고 있다고 생각하시는 데에는 여러 가지 이유가 있을 것입니다.
 사람들은 케임브리지와 벌링턴으로 가기 위해 이곳을 떠납니다.
 그리고 아시다시피 업계에서는 여전히 과학 사무실이 필요한 많은 사람들이 있는데, 그것이 업계의 대다수입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1710.315s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 예, 좋은 질문입니다.
 그 중 일부는 올바르게 인용했는지 확인합니다.
 우선, 이것은 추정치입니다. 목표 시장의 반복 고객이 누구인지, 반복 임차인이 누구인지 말할 수 있습니다.
 하지만 물론 우리는 사람들을 위한 집을 짓습니다.
 우리는 누가 우주 생활에 가장 관심이 있는지 이해할 수 있도록 제품을 디자인하려고 노력합니다.
 그러나 당신은 절대적으로 옳습니다.
 내 말은
 자동차는 피할 수 없으며 모든 교차로에서 발견될 수 있습니다.
 물론 생명공학 분야든 다른 산업 분야든 여전히 통근하는 사람들도 있습니다.
 국방부에서 R&D 부서로 일하는 친구가 있는데, 새벽 2시가 될 수도 있습니다.
 프로세스나 테스트가 끝나면 모든 사람이 Slack이나 Teams에 로그인하고 "자, 가자. 모두 짐을 싸서 가세요."라고 말합니다.
 물론 우리는 구체적인 목표를 설정하지 않고 임대 가격에 반응하지 않으며 누구나 환영한다고 말하고 싶습니다.
 하지만 그들은 항상 여기 오는 사람들이고, 누군가가 조금 돌아다니고 싶다면 입구에 있는 Hingham 지점으로 오는 데 관심이 있을 수 있습니다. 제 생각에 여기 아이디어는 커피를 사거나 Walgreens에 가기 위해 운전할 필요가 없으며 그렇지 않으면 그들이 쇠고기 등을 살 것이라는 것입니다.
 그러나 전문적인 관점에서 볼 때 이는 우리의 목표 시장에 완벽할 수 있습니다.
 그는 전문적이고 교육을 잘 받은 청년이었습니다. 그래서 우리는 보스턴의 더 넓은 지역에 집을 지었습니다.
 케이티, 제가 입 다물고 침묵할 수 있도록 도와달라고 부탁하고 싶습니다. 하지만 제게 그렇게 할 권리가 있는지 확신이 서지 않으니까요.
 그래서 나는 당신이 이 문제를 해결하는 데 도움을 줄 것이라고 확신합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1843.122s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 우리가 먼저 논의해야 할 것 같아요.
 Wellington Circle 주민들로부터 몇 가지 질문을 받은 것 같습니다.
 아직 로그인되어 있는 경우 로그아웃하시겠습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1861.02s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 나는 전부입니다.
 그래서 93에 대해 묻고 싶습니다.
 계속하십시오.
 당신은 그것이 재미 있다고 말합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1872.247s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 물어보려는 남자가 있었다.
 계속하자 얘들아.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1907.962s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 예, 제가 가진 유일한 질문은 매우 짧습니다. 교통을 원활하게 하기 위해 교차로에 보행자 다리를 건설하시겠습니까? 아무래도 사람이 많은 것 같아서 T 방식은 현재 효과적으로 활용되고 있지 않기 때문에 유용할 수도 있겠네요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1933.541s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 예, 솔직하게 말씀드리자면, 주에서는 엔터테인먼트 센터를 통해 고속도로에 다리를 건설하는 것을 허용하고 있습니다.
 반면에 이를 위해서는 더 큰 패키지가 필요할 수 있습니다.
 실제로 경사로와 장애물을 사용하십시오. 캠브리지에서도 비슷한 프로그램을 봤어요.
 여객열차가 지나갔으니 모든 걸 보고 다 해봐야겠다는 뜻이었는데, 아쉽게도 아주 좋은 인상을 받았습니다.
 글쎄요, 아마도 이것은 우리가 나열할 수 없는 것일 수도 있고, 아마도 이 다리가 건설된 후에는 거주지가 전혀 남지 않았을 수도 있습니다.</p>

 9번 차선은 현재보다 더 많은 차량을 수용할 수 없습니다. 특히 표지판이 Venerable West Avenue에 위치하여 브랜드가 숨을 쉴 수 있는 공간을 제공하기 때문입니다.
 내 시스템은 매일 아침 9번을 추적하도록 지시합니다.
 매일 3~4대의 버스가 운행됩니다.
 버스가 보입니다.
 이것은 우리를 많이 걱정하게 만드는 문제입니다.
 여러 이웃이 나에게 편지를 보냈기 때문에 나는 이것을 알고 있습니다.
 내가 묻는 질문도 나에게 중요합니다.
 두 달에 한 번씩 우리는 집을 유지하고 해충을 제거하기 위해 최선을 다합니다. 미끼 스테이션이 있어 원하는 만큼 깊이 파낼 수 있습니다.
 주차에 관해서는 이 지역이 인기가 없을 수도 있겠다는 생각이 듭니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2053.406s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 저도 손을 어떻게 들어야할지 모르겠지만 린다를 응원합니다.
 저는 파크웨이 플라자 사우스에 살고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2062.814s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 데보라. 당신이 이 사람들을 통과할 수 있다면 나는 당신을 목록에 유지하고 목록에 누가 있는지 알게 되는 대로 당신을 추가할 것입니다.
 하지만 손을 든 사람이 누구인지 확인한 후 참여하실 수 있도록 귀하의 전화번호가 있습니다.
 우리 앞에 세 사람이 있었고 나는 그들을 지켜보고 있었습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2079.292s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Linda, 이것은 훌륭한 질문입니다. 개념 계획에는 의도적인 차단을 포함하지 않았으며 실제로 이 지역과 9번 주간고속도로 사이의 일부 차단을 제거했다는 것을 알 수 있을 것입니다.
 그래서 우리는 그런 일이 일어날지 의심합니다.
 뜨거운 주제.
 다른 도시 주민들은 이것이 9번가의 문제라고 말했습니다.
 내 생각에 우리는 의식적인 일을 했고, 우리 차를 존중하고 9번 차량에 접근하지 않으려고 노력했습니다.
 하지만 일부러 하지 않는데도 도움이 되는 일이 있는 것 같아요.
 West River Beach Boulevard에 있는 세 개의 부두
 이 시점에서 쉽게 우회전하여 Monroe 역으로 가거나 Cappies 역을 거쳐 9번 고속도로를 타고 교차로로 가서 교차로의 주요 신호등을 통과한 후 Fellsway 또는 Middlesex를 통해 북쪽으로 향할 수 있습니다.
 그래서 우리가 의도적으로 하는 일은 분명 새로운 고통을 야기하지 않는다고 생각합니다.
 하지만 저는 우리가 제안하는 개발 계획으로 이제 사람들이 9번가를 건너는 것을 막을 것이라고 믿습니다.
 좀 줄여야 한다고 하더군요.
 죄송합니다. 말씀하신 표지판이 있는 화강암 산책로가 어디에 있는지 모르니 알아봅시다.
 하지만 이 패키지를 통과하는 사람들은 절대 그렇게 할 수 없을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2185.727s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: 나는 그것이 나를 괴롭혔다고 생각한다.
 아직도 당신의 말을들을 수 있습니다. 아, 괜찮아요. 리뷰 비치 파크에서 키스까지 이어지는 9번 고속도로 끝에서 신호를 놓쳤어요. 아, Wellington Flats에는 물론 9번 고속도로에서 Key Factory까지 표지판이 있고, 여기에 온 이후로 훨씬 더 많은 표지판이 있습니다.
 도시는 후반부를 차지합니다.
 좋습니다. 중앙에 있는 숫자 6과 유사점이 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2221.06s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 따라서 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 많지 않습니다. 하지만 다시 말하지만, 이것은 사람들이 현재 신호등을 뛰어넘는 교통 체증을 확실히 제거할 것입니다.
 또한 오늘 밤에는 자동차를 추가하지 않는 것이 좋습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2236.131s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: 네, 성장하고 있으니까요. 저는 이곳에서 거의 30년 동안 살았는데 그 규모가 얼마나 큰지 믿을 수가 없습니다.
 이 기간 동안.
 이것은 걱정스럽습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2249.175s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Linda, 우리는 지역 교통 수단을 통해 몇 가지 창의적인 움직임을 보였습니다.
 제가 완벽한 솔루션을 제공해드릴 수 있을지 모르겠습니다. 나는 우리가 할 수 없다는 것을 압니다.
 하지만 저는 확실히 경청하고 최고의 전문가를 선택하여 이 새로운 교차점을 이 섹션에 통합할 것입니다. 그러나 이는 9번가 주민들의 우려에 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2273.261s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: 어느 날 우리는 시청 같은 특별한 모임을 가질 예정입니다. 무슨 말인지 아시겠습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2280.587s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 네, 논의 과정에서 몇 가지 문제가 제기될 것으로 생각하며 이에 대해 좀 더 자세히 다루겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2287.492s">[Unidentified]</a>: 괜찮은</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2288.593s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 대답: 잘 모르겠습니다.
 우리가 지금 계획하고 하는 일 중 하나는 공부입니다.
 이것을 우리는 생존기간이라고 부릅니다.
 재산권과 계약부터 환경적 요구사항, 허가를 받는 방법 등 모든 것을 살펴보고, 이웃과 우리가 모르는 것들에 대해 이야기를 나눕니다. 오늘날 우리의 주요 목표는 다른 사람들의 의견을 경청하여 앞으로 나아갈 수 있고 보다 공개적이고 공식적인 회의를 포함하는 공개 프로세스에 들어가는 것입니다.
 소개 솔직히 말해서 더 나은 대답이 있을 수 있습니다.
 우리는 오늘 귀하와 도시로부터 들은 내용을 알고 있으므로 이를 염두에 두고 우리가 제대로 연구하거나 이해하지 못한 새로운 프로그램에 대한 아이디어만 제시하는 것이 아닙니다.</p>

 안녕하세요. 제 이름은 Christina이고 Parkway Plaza West를 소유하고 있습니다.
 나는 개발에 대한 이러한 접근 방식을 지지합니다.
 대중교통 정류장 지역은 좀 더 밀집된 개발이 이루어져야 한다고 생각합니다.
 하지만 건축에 관해 두 가지 걱정이 있습니다.
 하나는 다른 사람들이 말한 것입니다.
 Ninth Street에서는 Linda의 말이 옳았습니다. 이 장애물을 제거하더라도 사람들은 솔직히 재난 지역이기 때문에 주차장을 건너지 않을 것이지만 그들은 Brainerd까지 운전한 다음 Ninth Street로 운전할 것입니다.
 9번 고속도로에 위치해 있고 꽤 작기 때문에 첫 번째 질문은 '이 회사가 귀하의 회사입니까, 아니면 이전에 회사가 있었습니까?'입니다.
 그는 이 도로를 개선하기 위해 이 도로를 건설한 지역사회와 몇 가지 작업을 수행했습니다. 불행히도 9번 도로는 사유 도로이기 때문에 아마도 좋은 의도로 그랬을 것입니다.
 모든 것이 동일합니다. 보도는 개선이 필요합니다.
 방법이 있으면 참 좋을 것 같아요.
 그래서 나의 첫 번째 질문은: 가지고 있나요?
 귀하의 회사는 도로 개선에 관심이 있거나 경험이 있습니까?
 보도가 절단되지 않았기 때문에 사람들은 교차로를 피하기 위해 브레이너드에서 9번 고속도로 방향으로 이동하기 시작할 것입니다.
 두 번째 질문은 설치류 문제를 줄이는 것에 관한 것입니다. 대규모 건설 프로젝트를 시작할 때 설치류 문제로 인해 악몽을 꾸는 사람들에 대한 이야기를 방금 읽었기 때문입니다.
 오늘 저는 Somerville과 Brookline이 차세대 스마트 박스를 출시한다는 기사를 읽었습니다.
 귀하의 회사는 현재 운영에서 기본 설치류 제어 도구를 사용하고 있습니까, 아니면 고급 설치류 제어 기술에 투자할 계획입니까?
 아, 저희집은 합선으로 아파트 주인이 많지 않아서 설치류 문제가 크게 발생한다면 안타까운 일이 아닐까 싶습니다.
 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2493.5s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 오늘 아침에 이 기사를 읽었지만 이 기술에 대해 들어본 적이 없기 때문에 첫 번째와 마지막을 해보겠습니다.
 이름이 무엇인지 기억하시나요?
 이것이 그들이 얻은 상자입니다.</p>

 ខ្ញុំពិតជាបានមើលវានៅព្រឹកនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះដំណាក់កាលទី 1 រួមមានបីដំណាក់កាលនៃបញ្ហាសត្វកកេរ។

 និយាយឱ្យត្រង់ទៅ ខ្ញុំមិនយកឥណទានណាមួយសម្រាប់រឿងនោះទេ។
 នោះ​នឹង​ជា​ការ​ខិត​ខំ​អាត្មានិយម ព្រោះ​យើង​មិន​ចង់​បាន​វា​ដែរ។

 បាទ ត្រឹមត្រូវហើយ។
 នេះគឺជាទីមួយ។
 ទីពីរ​គឺ​អំពី​ការ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រសើរ​ឡើង​នៅ​ផ្លូវ Ninth Street និង​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​នៅ​កន្លែង​ផ្សេង។
 ចម្លើយចំពោះសំណួរទាំងពីរគឺ បាទ/ចាស ស្ទើរតែគ្រប់ពេល ហើយយើងដឹងខ្លះថា អាត្មានិយម ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងមិនរាប់បញ្ចូលនោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែយើងចង់បានសហគមន៍ល្អ ហើយខ្ញុំនឹងមិនសាងសង់នៅលើដីបៃតងនោះទេ។
 កន្លែងទាំងអស់ដែលយើងបានសាងសង់គឺជាអគារឧស្សាហកម្មចាស់ៗ ឬអគារការិយាល័យដែលខូច ហើយដោយមិនធ្វើឱ្យខូចកេរ្តិ៍ឈ្មោះរបស់ Cappy's គ្រឿងបរិក្ខារគឺល្អណាស់ ហើយខ្ញុំបានទិញនៅទីនោះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែគោលដៅរបស់យើងគឺមិនមែនដើម្បីបំផ្លាញកន្លែងថ្មីទេ។
 វាពាក់ព័ន្ធនឹងការកែលម្អដីដែលទទួលមរតកតាមរយៈការជួសជុលអចលនទ្រព្យដែលបានទទួលមរតក។
 ដូច្នេះ ការធ្វើឱ្យ Ninth Street កាន់តែទាក់ទាញ គឺដើម្បីផលប្រយោជន៍របស់យើង។
 នេះពិតជារឿងដែលយើងចង់ពិភាក្សាជាមួយអ្នក។
 យើង​មាន​គម្រោង​ខាង​ផ្លូវ​លេខ​៩។
 អ្នកដឹងថាផ្លូវក្រាលកៅស៊ូមើលទៅដូចម្ដេច ហើយអ្នកដឹងពីរបៀបដែលការកាត់ asphalt ទាំងនេះសមឥតខ្ចោះ។

 ដូច្នេះ​ចម្លើយ​ខ្លី​គឺ​ពិត​ជា៖ យើង​ចង់​និយាយ​ទៅ​កាន់​អ្នក​អំពី​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​អាច​ធ្វើ​ដើម្បី​កែលម្អ​ផ្លូវ Ninth Street។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកមានសំណួរទីបី។ ខ្ញុំភ្លេចអ្វីមួយ ហើយនឹកអ្វីមួយ។
 សូមអរគុណ</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2696.694s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 내 생각엔 당신이 다음인 것 같아요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2700.316s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_30]</a>: 시간을 내주셔서 정말 감사합니다.
 당신은 현지인이라고 했으니 Katie가 추수감사절과 크리스마스 기간 동안 매우 바쁠 것이라는 것을 당신도 알고 있을 것입니다.
 Cappy의 판매 데이터나 주 또는 지역 경찰을 사용하는 것에 대해 이야기하는 사람이 있습니까? 왜냐하면 그들은 항상 사람들이 보도에 주차되어 있기 때문에 지역 교통을 살펴보고 이 크기의 건물이 어떤 종류의 교통 체증을 일으킬지 판단하는 데 도움을 주기 때문입니다.
 아마도 Cappy의 크기 때문일 것입니다.
 내 말은 구매자가 아마도 건물에 거주하고 관리하는 거주자와 동일하다는 것입니다. 두 가지 모두 도착 및 출발하는 사람과 차량의 수, 특히 도시에서 발생하는 방해 유형에 대한 데이터를 제공할 수 있습니다.
 지나가는 차량이 많을 때.
 다음 주에 데이터 수집에 대한 논의가 있나요?
 추수감사절이라 캐피 크로싱(Cappy Crossing)이 개방되고 사람들이 다시 모일 예정이어서 혼잡할 것입니다.
 아마도 이 데이터는 이러한 유형의 건설로 인해 어떤 유형의 교통이나 문제가 발생할지 결정하는 데 사용될 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2785.256s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ជា​ការ​ពិត​ណាស់ អ្វី​ខ្លះ​នោះ​គឺ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រាកដ​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​យល់​ពី​ចំណុច។
 និយាយឱ្យត្រង់ទៅ យើងនៅតែឆាប់ពេកក្នុងដំណើរការជួលអ្នកប្រឹក្សាផ្នែកដឹកជញ្ជូន។ ជាធម្មតា ខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើមចំណាយលុយនៅពេលដែលខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងអាចមានអារម្មណ៍សុខស្រួលទទួលយកហានិភ័យដែលយើងត្រូវទទួលយកដើម្បីបន្ត។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងហៅ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំនឹងប្រាប់អ្នកពីរឿងនេះ
 វាត្រូវបានគេហៅថា ITE ។
 នៅពេលដែលយើងជួលអ្នកជំនាញទាំងនេះ ពួកគេមិនចូលចិត្តប្រើទិន្នន័យអក្ខរាវិរុទ្ធទេ។
 អញ្ចឹងខ្ញុំនឹងហៅទៅមើលថា តើមានវិធីណាក្នុងការបញ្ចូលវាទេ ពីព្រោះនៅក្នុងពេលវេលារបស់យើង អ្នកដឹងទេ តាមការពិត យើងនឹងមិនទេ សន្មត់ថាយើងបន្ត នោះនឹងនៅដើមឆ្នាំក្រោយ អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងមានប្រអប់ជាច្រើនដែលត្រូវពិនិត្យមុនពេលចូលឆ្នាំថ្មី ដើម្បីមើលថាតើយើងចង់បន្តធ្វើកិច្ចការនេះដែរឬទេ។
 ជាអកុសល នេះមានន័យថា ដល់ពេលដែលយើងធ្វើការសិក្សាផ្លូវការទាំងនេះ ដែលនឹងចំណាយពេលច្រើនខែ យើងនឹងហួសពីការថ្លែងអំណរគុណ។
 ដូច្នេះ​សំណួរ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ​គឺ៖ តើ​អ្នក​គិត​ឬ​សម្រប​ខ្លួន​ទៅ​នឹង​រឿង​នេះ​ដោយ​របៀប​ណា?
 ដោយសារតែប្រសិនបើនេះជាពេលមួយដែលមានឥទ្ធិពលពិសេសលើអ្នក ហើយវាសមហេតុផលទាំងស្រុង ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកអាចនឹងឃើញខ្លួនអ្នកនៅក្នុងស្ថានភាពស្រដៀងគ្នាក្នុងអំឡុងពេលបុណ្យណូអែល។
 ត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 អ្នកដឹងពីរបៀបបញ្ចូលវា។
 ជាអកុសល ចម្លើយខ្លីគឺថា អ្នកប្រហែលជាមិនទទួលបានចរាចរណ៍ពិតប្រាកដណាមួយទេ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលយើងចាប់ផ្តើមការងារនេះ យើងនឹងចេញទៅវាលស្រែ ហើយពួកគេនឹងឡើងខ្សែកៅស៊ូតូចៗទាំងនេះដែលអ្នកឃើញនៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃផ្លូវ។ ពេលខ្លះពួកគេពិតជារាប់បរិមាណរាងកាយ និងទទួលបានមួយ។
 ខ្ញុំមានអ្នកវិភាគមួយចំនួនដែលធ្វើការលើក្រុមដែលកំពុងធ្វើតេស្តផងដែរ ដើម្បីមើលថាតើវាដំណើរការឬអត់ ដូច្នេះយើងទទួលបានទិដ្ឋភាពដ៏ស្មោះត្រង់នៃដំណើរការនេះ។ ខ្ញុំ​សង្ស័យ​ថា​តើ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​អាច​កៀរគរ​អ្នក​ណា​ម្នាក់​នៅ​សប្តាហ៍​ក្រោយ។
 ទោះបីជាខ្ញុំប្រថុយនឹងប្រាក់ដុល្លារទាំងនេះកាន់តែច្រើនក៏ដោយ។

 អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយ ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ យើងមិនបានជ្រើសរើសអ្នកជំនាញមួយចំនួនដែលយើងត្រូវធ្វើការងារត្រឹមត្រូវសម្រាប់កម្មវិធីនេះទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយើងបានជួលជួរឈរពិតប្រាកដ។
 យើងមិនជ្រៀតជ្រែកជាមួយក្រុមបន្ទាប់បន្សំទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​អ្នក​ទាំង​នេះ​គឺ​ជា​អ្នក​វិទ្យាសាស្ត្រ​បរិមាណ​ពិត​ប្រាកដ។
 ពួកគេកំពុងគណនាមនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នា។
 ដូច្នេះ​កុំ​ឲ្យ​យើង​មើល​រំលង​អី។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាផ្នែកមួយនៃនេះគឺជាដំណឹងល្អ៖ ការប្រើប្រាស់របស់យើងនឹងបង្កើតចរាចរតិចជាងការប្រើប្រាស់ផ្សេងទៀតដែលនរណាម្នាក់អាចបង្កើតនៅថ្ងៃនេះ។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកក្រឡេកមើលផ្ទៃដីពិតប្រាកដ ខ្ញុំមិនមានតួលេខពិតប្រាកដនៅពីមុខខ្ញុំទេ ប៉ុន្តែមាននរណាម្នាក់អាចចូលមកទីនេះជាមួយនឹងអគារពិសោធន៍កម្ពស់ 4 ជាន់ ជិត 300,000 ហ្វីត ហើយនឹងមិនមានដំណើរការសវនាការជាសាធារណៈនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេគ្រាន់តែទុកផែនការរបស់ពួកគេជាមួយការិយាល័យអធិការកិច្ចអគារ ហើយរង់ចាំ 30 ថ្ងៃ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​មាន​កម្រិត​ទាប​បើ​ធៀប​នឹង​ការ​ប្រើ​ជម្រើស​មួយ​ចំនួន​នៅ​ទីនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាត្រូវធ្វើអ្វីពីអ្វីដែល Cappy បានធ្វើនោះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​សង្ស័យ​ថា​ប្រហែល​ជា​មាន​បន្តិច​ទៀត។
 ប៉ុន្តែបាទ ខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយថា ប្រសិនបើវាជាការិយាល័យលក់រាយ ឬបន្ទប់ពិសោធន៍ កន្លែងទាំងនោះជាធម្មតាមានឡានពី 4 ទៅ 5 គ្រឿងក្នុង 1,000 ហ្វីត ហើយយើងមានឡានប្រហែលមួយក្នុង 1,000 ហ្វីត ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិននិយាយទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​មិន​ប្រាប់​អ្នក​ថា​នឹង​មិន​មាន​រថយន្ត​នៅ​ទីនេះ​ដែល​រំខាន​អ្នក, ចូល​ទៅ​ក្នុង​ផ្លូវ​របស់​អ្នក​ឬ​អ្វី​មួយ​។
 ប៉ុន្តែមានតែតាមទស្សនៈបរិមាណប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ជាពិសេសក្នុងអំឡុងពេលថ្ងៃឈប់សម្រាកទាំងនេះនឹងមានតិចជាង។</p>

 단위당 하나 이상의 크기를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.
 우리는 몇 가지 다른 구역 설정 요소를 살펴본 결과 도시가 단위당 0.85평방피트 이상을 허용하는 것으로 보입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3061.287s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 그래서 우리는... 내 생각에 우리의 격차는 0.75 대 1.5라고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3065.248s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 예, 우리는 이것이 대중교통 지역이라는 점에 동의하지만 그 이상이 적절하다고 생각합니다.
 따라서 대답은 단위당 하나의 공간 정도입니다.

 베드포드 콘도미니엄 규칙 및 규정을 따르는 것이 좋습니다. 따라서 그 숫자는 15%라고 생각합니다.</p>

 절대.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3091.353s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 방금 말했어요, 알다시피, 방금 당신에게 말했어요.
 몇 년이 걸리기 때문에 어떻게 될지 말씀드릴 수 없습니다.
 그러나 이는 거리와 우리로부터 1마일 이내의 일부 새로운 커뮤니티에서 볼 수 있는 것과 일치하여 좋은 경쟁을 제공할 수 있다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3109.89s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 아시다시피, 기업가들이 와서 이 일을 하고 싶어한다는 말을 들었습니다.
 한 가지 문제는 우리가 스스로 먹고 살 만큼 충분한 집이 있는지 여부입니다.
 이사하고 싶은 도시에서 경력을 쌓을 가능성이 있습니다.
 이제 질문과 대답은 다음과 같습니다. 아니요, 우리는 그렇게 하지 않습니다.
 나는 크리스틴이 그 점을 분명히 했다고 생각한다.
 그러나 단점은 Medford에서 가장 붐비는 거리 중 하나와 아마도 Medford에서 가장 붐비는 모퉁이에 건물을 짓고 있다는 것입니다.
 일부 DCI 천재들은 이 하드웨어를 모두 없애는 것이 좋은 생각이라고 생각합니다.
 이는 당시 큰 실수였습니다. 누가 이걸 생각해냈는지는 모르겠지만 이 모든 아파트와 콘도에 교통과 돈을 투자했는데, 나는 그곳이 나라에 좋은 곳이 아니라고 말했습니다.
 하지만 그것은 좋은 생각이므로 이 경우에는 귀하의 잘못이 아닙니다.
 당신은 긍정적인 면을 알고 있습니다.
 아시다시피, 이 지역에서 커비 운하와 먼로 운하를 제거하면 교통 흐름이 크게 줄어들 것입니다.
 이 고양이는 일주일 내내 일하는 택시 운전사입니다.
 직장에서는 9시부터 10시까지의 근무 일정을 알고 있으며, 많은 사람들이 말하는 것처럼 쉬는 날이 있다는 것도 알고 있습니다.
 거북이는 잡을 수 없으며 수가 많지 않습니다.
 당신은 이 아이들을 그곳에서 구출하기 위해 최선을 다할 것입니다.
 이로 인해 약간의 교통 정체가 발생하겠지만, 주정부가 9번 도로에서 실수를 저질렀다는 사실을 인정하기 전까지는 이 이웃들이 어떻게 할지 모르겠습니다.
 나는 그들이 당신이 알고 있는 완화 조치를 살펴보기를 바랍니다. 아마도 그것이 개척자를 식별하는 데 도움이 될 것입니다.
 내 말은, 이것이 당신의 능력 밖의 일이라는 것을 알지만, 당신 입장에서는 좋은 행동입니다.
 내 다음 질문은: 내가 듣기에 관련성이 있다고 생각되는 다른 사람들의 의견을 차단하고 있습니까?
 이 문제를 어떻게 해결할 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3254.415s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 비전에 관해서는 좋은 대답이 없습니다.
 아시다시피, 그것은 그러한 건물이 있는 지역의 기능일 뿐입니다.
 그래서 어떤 사람들은 통찰력을 갖지 못할 것이라고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3268.188s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 아니요, 당신의 땅은 아닙니다. 하지만 제가 말했듯이 그곳은 매우 바쁜 지역입니다.
 이제 알잖아</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3276.015s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 이것은 공정한 질문입니다.
 이것은 공정한 질문입니다.
 내 말은, 어떤 사람들의 관점에서 볼 때 솔직히 내 목표는 합리적으로 매력적인 건물을 짓는 것이라고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3283.804s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 이 건물은 정말 아름다워요</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3285.786s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 문제는 커비의 엉덩이가 별로 안 좋아 보인다는 겁니다.
 우리는 일부 전망을 개선하고 예방을 제공할 수 있기를 바랍니다.
 몇몇 분들이 댓글을 달 수도 있을 것 같아요.
 당신은 우리가 남서부에 있고 당신은 미스틱 강을 볼 수 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 나는 그것을 본 적이 없지만 그것이 존재하는지 의심하고 우리의 전망이 적어도 Monroe의 Capiz 전망보다 낫기를 바랍니다. 그러나 당신은 거기에 약간의 보상이 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 이 질문에 대한 완벽한 대답은 없습니다.
 이것은 컵인가요? 그렇게 말했나요? 그들의 말이 맞습니다. 모든 것이 비뚤어져 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3316.688s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 맞습니다. 이 사무실은 우리 모두가 알고 있듯이 9번 고속도로, 즉 서비스 스트리트(Service Street)를 건너므로 다리를 건너면 16번 주간고속도로로 나가게 됩니다.
 이것이 사람들의 두뇌에 필요한 것입니다.
 사람들이 말했듯이 그것은 실제로 사유 도로이고 판매는 시에 속합니다. 그리고 그들이 나왔을 때 믿을 수 없었고 누군가가 이것에 대해 돈을 받을 것이라고 믿을 수 없었습니다. 이 지역에서 가장 바쁜 도로인 16번 고속도로의 교통을 완화하기 위해 이런 짓을 하는 것은 어리석은 일이었습니다.
 이 블록을 계속 따라가세요.
 다시 말하지만, 사고는 그의 잘못이나 다른 사람의 잘못이 아니라 전적으로 DCR의 잘못이었습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3359.618s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 예, 저는 이렇게 말하고 싶습니다. 우리는 이러한 모든 문제를 해결할 수는 없지만 해결할 수 있으며 우리 전문가들은 매우 훌륭합니다.
 그러면 적어도 우리는 긍정적인 일을 할 수 있을 것입니다.
 내 말은, 웨스트우드에서는 교통을 합리화하고 회전 및 로터리 주변의 병목 현상을 제거하는 데 많은 노력을 기울이고 있다는 것입니다.
 어떤 사람들은 이 모든 말과 기술을 싫어하지만 때로는 정중하고 정중하게 교통을 멈추기 위해 사용할 수 있는 효과적인 단어와 기술이 있습니다.
 우리는 필요한 장비를 갖추고 있으며 팀을 활용하여 최선을 다해 운영합니다.
 9번가는 특별하고 좋기도 하고 나쁘기도 합니다.
 기술적으로는 이 가방이나 지갑이 줄 중앙에 있을 것 같아요.
 따라서 개인 정보 보호 통제가 필요하며, 집에서 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지, 사람들이 무엇을 원하든 탑승한 모든 사람이 안전한지 확인하기 위해 이웃과 협력해야 합니다.
 따라서 여기에는 좋은 민주적 절차가 있습니다.
 하지만 어쩌면 이 문제에 대한 해결책이 있을 수도 있습니다.
 공평하게 말하면, 우리가 대부분의 이미지를 만드는 데 도움을 준 건축가들은 이 교차로 재건축을 위한 매사추세츠 교통부 운영 위원회에 속해 있습니다.
 그래서 일관성이 많이 있고, 피드백과 우리가 받는 피드백 중 일부, 우리가 살펴보는 질문을 얻을 수 있는 기회가 있다면 그렇게 할 수 있습니다.
 고치지 못할 수도 있지만, 생각보다 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 수도 있습니다.
 우리 팀이 이에 대해 작업할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3445.637s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 마이크, 영업 시간 중에 역까지 셔틀을 마련해 보는 것을 고려해 보시겠습니까? 아마 7시에서 10시, 4시에서 6시 정도겠죠?
 아니면 전화해도 돼요
 왜냐하면 우리는 미래의 어떤 사건에 대해 이야기하고 있기 때문입니다.
 우리는 역까지의 공유 교통 편성 가능성에 대해 문의했습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3473.179s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 우리는 이 점을 확실히 고려할 것입니다.
 솔직히 버스가 우리를 떠나 출퇴근 시간에 웰링턴에 도착했다면 더 좋았을 것 같아요.
 우리가 사는 곳에서 도보로 약 6분 거리였고 나는 더 이상 그렇게 빠르지 않았습니다.
 따라서 교차로는 물론이고 그곳에 빨리 도착할 수 있다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.
 그래서 우리는 볼 수 있습니다.
 나는 아니라고 말하고 싶지 않지만 둘 중 하나를 의심합니다.
 죄송합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3501.709s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 그냥 비명을 지르고 싶을 뿐이에요.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3511.616s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 응, 카멜로. 지금은 아니라고 말하지 않겠습니다.
 그건 좀 살펴봐야 할 것 같아요.
 만약 해당 지역에 TMA가 있다면, 우리는 항상 TMA에 가입하고 기여하도록 요청받습니다.
 그래서 우리는 그들이 어떻게 하는지 지켜봐야 합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3523.705s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 그런데 메드포드에서 가장 번화한 지역에 집을 지을 수 있다고 했잖아요.
 그래서 그들은 Capi와 Monroe가 교통량이 많지 않다는 것이 좋은 점이라고 말합니다. 특히 Capi는 하루 24시간 열려 있습니다.
 지금의 상황에 비하면 교통상황에 대해 조금은 안도감을 느끼시는 분들도 계실 거라 생각됩니다.
 그래서
 안내해 주셔서 감사합니다.
 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3561.56s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 케이티, 당신은 침착한 것 같아요.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3568.025s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 나는 주로 여기에서 다른 의견을 사용하고 있습니다.
 나의 가장 큰 걱정은 내가 16번가에서 떨어진 Parkway Plaza South에 있는 아파트에 살고 있다는 것입니다.
 여기에는 많은 사람들이 있습니다.
 오늘은 9번 고속도로에서 내리기가 어렵습니다.
 16번 고속도로와 웰링턴 로터리에서 운전을 하려고 한다면 정말 끔찍할 것입니다.
 큰 건물을 지으면 엄청난 혼잡이 초래될까 봐 걱정이 되는 것 같아요.
 이것이 나의 주요 관심사입니다.
 반면에 설치류 문제를 제기한 사람은 린다였다고 생각합니다.
 하지만 발굴과 공사 중에 재난이 발생할 것이라고 생각합니다.
 이 새 건물이 궁극적으로 우리 부동산 가치에 영향을 미칠까요?
 내 말은, 사람들이 크고 사람이 많은 곳에서 살고 싶어한다고 생각하지 않는다는 거죠.
 Rick이 방금 언급했듯이 이곳은 Medford에서 가장 바쁜 지역입니다.
 내 말은, 이것이 우리 재산의 가치를 감소시킬 것인가?
 왜냐하면 우리 모두 여기에 아파트가 있기 때문입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3646.851s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 마이크, 저는 부동산 감정사가 아닙니다.
 그러나 나는 그가 Cabe의 아름다운 창조물을 더럽히지 않은 철창 뒤에서 자동차를 사용하는 배후에 있었다고 의심합니다.
 좋은 이웃이 되어주세요.
 따라서 연구가 MIT에서 수행됩니다.
 내 생각에 그것은 15년 전에 이루어진 것 같은데 그들은 그것에 정말 집착했습니다. 그것은 두 개의 기사였는데 불행히도 나는 그것을 읽지 못했습니다.
 그들은 혼합 소득 지역이 주변 지역의 가치를 거의 일방적으로 증가시킨다는 것을 발견했습니다.
 그래서 나는 감정인이 아니라고 말하고 싶지만, 최고 수준의 친절한 이웃이 있다는 사실 외에도 당신의 가치에 도움이 될 수도 있고 영향을 미치지 않을 것이라고 상상해야 합니다.
 당신은 나를 겁주려고 하고 있고, 쥐는 조금 겁을 먹습니다.
 이 어려운 작업의 근본 원인을 살펴보겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3704.461s">[Maria D'Orsi]</a>: 감사합니다
 나는 당신이 이것을 직접 경험했다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3716.871s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 이것은 새로운 유닛입니다.
 좋아요, 가셔도 됩니다.
 이때 손을 든 사람이 있나요?
 내 생각엔 우리가 볼 수 없을 것 같아요.
 이 대화는 여기서 끝내면 될 것 같습니다.
 많은 질문이 동일하지만 확인할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3738.621s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 케이티, 내가 볼 수 있도록 여기서 채팅을 여는 방법을 가르쳐 주셔야 할 것 같아요.
 나는 그들이 나타나는 것을 보았다.
 이상적인.
 우리에게는 복잡한 문제가 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3749.926s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 당신이 원한다면 우리는 할 수 있습니다
 구두 질문.
 안녕하세요 마이크, 소개해주셔서 감사합니다.
 우리는 West Parkway Plaza에 위치하고 있습니다.
 우리는 또 다른 이웃일 뿐입니다.
 만나서 반가워요.
 이런 행사를 주최해주셔서 감사합니다.
 그래서 우리는 몇 가지 간단한 질문을 가지고 있습니다.
 첫째, 이러한 유형의 건설이 얼마나 오래 걸릴 것이라고 생각하십니까?
 아주 이르다고 말씀하셨는데, 언제 시작할 수 있을 것 같나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3785.098s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 따라서 그러한 프로젝트를 건설하는 데는 최대 2024개월이 걸릴 수 있습니다.
 이에 대해 주로 이야기하겠습니다.
 건물이 완성되었고 우리 아이들은 안에서 바쁘게 지내고 있습니다.
 네, 저는 발견과 파괴에 관해 두 가지를 말씀드리고 싶습니다. 그러나 현재 시장에 출시된 기간은 약 2년 정도입니다.
 공사가 언제 시작될지는 시에서 허가 절차가 얼마나 걸릴지 말씀드릴 수 없지만, 보통 허가를 받는 데 1년 정도 걸리고 설계와 엔지니어링에 6~9개월이 더 걸립니다.
 따라서 우리가 앞으로 나아갈 수 있는 한 이것은 앞으로 나아갈 수 있는 좋은 방법입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3836.325s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 감사합니다
 누군가가 이웃 건물을 방해하는 경우 어떻게 해야 합니까?
 우리가 공사 중에 하는 것과 마찬가지로, 공사가 완료된 후에도 마찬가지입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3849.11s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 틀림없이.
 아시다시피, 우리 주변의 모든 건물을 확인하는 것부터 시작해서, 어떤 일을 하기 전에 건물이 잘 지어졌고 손상되지 않았는지 확인하겠습니다.
 정말 힘든 일이에요.
 하지만 오늘날 이 모든 건물은 중앙 크레인을 사용하여 지어졌습니다.
 일반적으로 모든 것은 내부에서 만들어집니다.
 그런 다음
 우리 주변 건물에 미치는 영향에 대해 우리는 많은 도시에서 이 점을 연구하고 있습니다. 이러한 작은 장소는 주거 지역 근처에 위치하는 경우가 많습니다.
 아이디어는 불투명한 메쉬로 멋지고 긴 울타리를 만들어서 우리가 뒤에서 무엇을 하는지 많이 볼 필요가 없다는 것입니다.
 다행스럽게도 이러한 유형의 건설은 그다지 지루한 건설 과정이 아닙니다.
 우리는 공청회에서 도시 및 귀하와 같은 사람들과 협력하여 적절한 시기 등을 논의할 것입니다.
 우리는 당신을 괴롭히지 않을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3917.32s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 감사합니다
 이야기할 수 있는 기회가 매우 도움이 되었기 때문에 정말 감사드립니다.
 마지막 질문: 5층짜리 아파트는 260개 이하입니다. 평균 아파트 크기를 알고 싶으신가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3931.2s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 그냥 토하면 920정도 됩니다.
 945화
 그래서 우리는 외로움이 이해하기 어려운 개념이라고 생각해서 이 큰 주황색 상자에서 외로움을 발견합니다.
 우리는 여기서 가장 중요한 것은 제품 시리즈의 프로그래밍이라고 믿습니다.
 메드퍼드시는 소득 수준, 교육 수준, 직업 유형, 교통 옵션 등 다양한 분야를 가지고 있습니다.
 따라서 스튜디오와 유아용 침대에 적합하다고 생각하는 장비의 양은 더 적어질 것입니다.
 이 사람들은 아직 결혼하지 않았고, 딸이나 아들도 없고, 경력의 두 번째 단계를 기대하고 있는 우리의 첫 번째 직원인 경우가 많습니다.
 그래서 매 분기마다 강력한 시장입니다.
 당신은 싱글이고 직업을 추구하는 것처럼 들리지만, 아직 첫 번째 또는 두 번째 직업을 하고 있기 때문에 조금 늦을 수도 있지만 결혼했고 여자친구나 남자친구가 있는 것 같습니다.
 마음에 들었나요?
 그래서 지난번 검색에서 우리는 확실히 품질 좋은 2베드룸 아파트를 위한 공간이 있다고 생각했지만 계속 살펴보니 생각보다 조금 작은 것으로 나타났습니다.
 감사합니다.
 아시다시피, 우리는 Medford에 서비스를 제공하기 위해 다양한 시장을 찾으려고 계속 노력해야 합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4018.142s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 감사합니다
 우리 대통령에게 질문하고 싶습니다.
 그 사람은 내가 그에게 물어보길 원했어요</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4024.407s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 네, 건축을 시작하기 전에 건물 설계를 평가해 주실 수 있는지 궁금합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4030.666s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 내 말 들려?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4032.069s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 글쎄, 우리는 검색에서 멀리 가지 않았습니다.
 아시다시피, 저는 그것이 필요하다고 생각하지 않습니다. 왜냐하면 우리는 운전하는 방법을 모르고, 주식 같은 것도 필요하지 않기 때문입니다.
 그러나 일반적으로 현장에 큰 소란이 있는 경우, 구덩이를 굴착하거나 잔해더미를 쌓거나 모든 지역에 대한 지진 분석을 수행하는 경우에는 이를 전문으로 하는 회사를 고용합니다.
 특히 다른 건물 근처에 있을 때는 더욱 그렇습니다.
 우리는 이웃으로부터 약 12피트 떨어진 Waltham에서 프로젝트를 진행하고 있습니다.
 그래서 우리는 이웃에게 나쁜 짓을 하지 않기 위해 온갖 종류의 지진계와 첨단 장비를 사용합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4078.827s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 감사합니다
 다른 사람들은 모든 것이 하나이고 일이 나누어지지 않았다는 확인을 원합니다.
 스타벅스나 프렌즈 같은 소매점.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4089.758s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 좋은 질문이 있습니다.
 아시다시피, 우리는 대중교통 역을 검토하고 있으며 1층에서 더 많은 상업적 용도를 보고 싶다고 생각했습니다.
 그런데 오늘 밤에 제기된 교통 문제는 우리가 진심으로 바라는 것입니다.
 저는 개인적으로 MassDOT과의 회의 중 일부와 그들이 이 교차로를 어떻게 안정화했는지 관찰했습니다.
 더 많은 트래픽에 영향을 미칠 것이라는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 우리는 추가 트래픽 및 매출에 대한 일시적인 영향과 관련된 모든 것이 우리에게 부정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있는 만큼 부정적인 것이라고 믿습니다.
 우리가 노력하고 있는 또 다른 일은 높은 수요입니다.
 아시다시피, 소매 공간이 좋다면 제가 말할 수 있는 것은 그 지역의 소매 공간이 길 아래의 소매 공간과 더 비슷했으면 좋겠다는 것뿐입니다.
 예를 들어 지금까지 스타벅스에서는 셀프 서비스가 없으면 좌석을 빌릴 수 없었습니다.
 이 길을 따라 다른 카페를 포함해 많은 소매점도 있습니다.
 특정 유형의 카페나 카페가 해당 위치에 적합한 것 같습니다.
 이러한 모든 점과 그것이 트래픽에 미치는 영향을 고려하여 우리는 이 부분을 컨셉에서 제외하기로 결정했습니다.
 따라서 더 논의할 가치가 있지만 솔직히 트래픽과 영향의 관점에서 볼 때 커뮤니티와 사이트에는 더 나쁠 것입니다.
 마지막으로, 이 일을 완벽하게 하지 않으면 회사에서 당신을 채용할 수 없습니다.
 우리가 아는 것이 적더라도 시장 가격보다 낮은 가격에 판매하기로 결정합니다.
 도시 계획의 관점에서 볼 때, 공간과 황폐화는 모든 종류의 부정적인 영향을 수반하는 실제 문제입니다. 그래서 우리가 많은 시간을 들여 연구하고 토론했기 때문에 그런 질문을 해주셔서 기쁩니다. 그래서 우리는 주택과 그와 관련된 용도에 대해서만 이야기하고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4209.242s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 안녕하세요, 제 이름은 제나입니다.
 다른 질문이 있습니다.
 차량당 1개의 주차공간이 있다고 말씀하셨습니다.
 현재 이 아파트에는 차량이 2대 정도 있으므로 해당 지역에는 주차 공간이 없습니다.
 당신은 무엇을 할 것인가?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4227.406s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 두 가지.
 우선, 나는 당신의 관점에 동의하지 않습니다.
 대부분의 주민들은 주택 재고가 많고 인구가 노령화되고 기술이 부족하기 때문에 집이나 주거 지역에서도 자동차를 사용하지 않습니다.
 우리는 차량 당 평균 2대의 차량이 있는 시점에 있지 않습니다.
 하지만 제가 틀렸다고 해도 한 가지만 말씀드리겠습니다. 저는 입이 있는 곳에, 이 프로젝트와 다른 프로젝트를 진행하는 곳에 돈을 투자할 것입니다.
 물론 우리는
 우리는 누군가가 피해 지역의 도로, 특히 이번 경우에는 9번가에 차량을 주차했을 수 있다는 점을 우려하고 있습니다.
 주민들이 길거리에 주차하는 것을 금지하고 계약을 통해 그렇게 하도록 요구하는 간단한 문구를 생각해 낼 수 있습니다.
 나는 전에 이것을 해본 적이 있습니다.
 매우 쉽습니다.
 지역사회나 도시가 중요하게 여기는 사항이라면 우리는 동일한 강력한 조치를 통해 이를 인식할 수 있습니다.
 아니요, 그렇지 않다고 생각합니다. 매우 쉬운 것 같습니다.
 우리 경쟁업체에서는 이 금액을 자동차당 0.75달러 또는 자동차당 0.85달러로 줄일 수 있다고 생각합니다.
 솔직히 저는 이 점에 있어서 Medford의 입장이 매우 진보적이라고 생각합니다.
 사실, 그들은 어떤 연구도 할 수 없습니다. 왜냐하면 우리는 항상 연구를 하고 그 분석은 무작위일 수 없기 때문입니다.
 그들은 이 고객이 무엇을 하는지 알고 있습니다.
 그래서 오오
 케임브리지와 같은 도시에서는 주차 빈도를 줄여야 합니다.
 그들은 나에게 다른 곳으로 가라고 조언했습니다.
 우리는 이 문제에 대해 많은 연구를 했습니다.
 비즈니스 관점에서 우리는 우리에게 필요한 것이 무엇인지 알고 있습니다.
 고객을 위한 주차 공간이 충분하지 않은 경우 고객은 우리로부터 주차 공간을 임대하지 않습니다.
 그래서 제가 하고 싶은 마지막 일은 주차를 불필요하게 제한하는 것입니다. 왜냐하면 그것이 우리 사업에 영향을 미칠 것이기 때문입니다.
 하지만 당신이 내 말을 믿지 않는다면, 나는 내 돈을 꼬집을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4346.218s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 죄송합니다. 마지막 질문이 하나 있습니다.
 이것이 남아 있습니다.
 차고와 건물 입구는 Ninth Street가 아닌 Middlesex Street에 있습니다.
 이게 맞나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4358.503s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 이러한 관점에서 이것은 사실입니다.
 당신은 우리가 9번가에 새 차를 가져오는 것을 원하지 않는 것 같습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4363.785s">[Unidentified]</a>: 감사합니다
 카라벨로 상담사.
 고마워요, 케이티.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4374.114s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 이 작은 모퉁이에 있지 않은 아파트 구입에 관해 이야기하고 계시다면, 귀하의 아파트에 적합한 한두 가지와 아파트를 더욱 균일하게 만드는 데 필요한 부동산 유형을 알려드릴 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4387.761s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 상담사님, 이 질문에 어떻게 대답하라고 하시나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4392.414s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 모르겠습니다.
 내 말은 그것이 당신의 재산을 향상시키고 더 좋게 보이게 할 것이라는 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4402.718s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 당신은 모든 것을 가지고 있기 때문에, 나는 말할 것입니다, 나는 말할 것입니다. 나는 도시 계획가와 결혼했고 그는 강력합니다.
 이것은 토론의 주제입니다.
 나는 이것을 놓치지 않을 것이다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4413.563s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 나는 그 부동산을 떠나고 싶지 않다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4416.425s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 간단히 말해서, 나는 여러 번 해고를 당했지만 소용이 없었습니다.
 아니요, 그냥 알고 싶어요.
 나는 이것을하고 싶다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4423.15s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: 그러나 그것은 중요하지 않습니다.
 주차 문제도 언급하셨는데요.
 리버스엣지, 모더나, 리버스엣지에 가시면 모더나아파트 주차장이 꽉 차지 않습니다.
 Rivers Edge 구역에도 차량 통행이 금지됩니다.
 이틀 주차하면 두 대의 차가 모두 비어 있는 것 같아요.
 차 두 대를 가지고 있는 사람도 있겠지만, 대부분은 우버의 모든 것을 가진 젊은이들이고, 차조차 없는 사람도 있습니다.
 Moderna와 Rivers Edge의 새로운 아파트 건물을 확인해 보세요.
 그들은 모두 주차장과 부지가 있다고 말할 것입니다.
 지금은 차를 가지고 있는 사람이 부족합니다.
 이 일을 할 수 있게 해주셔서 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4469.202s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Mary Harris의 마지막 질문 다음에는 날아다니는 쓰레기통으로 가보겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4475.105s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 네, 주차에 관해 질문해 주셔서 감사합니다. 그럴만한 가치가 있습니다. 제 질문이 조금 다를 것 같습니다.
 그래서 처음부터 네가 보고 싶었어
 마이크, 당신의 프리젠테이션과 나는 아직도 당신이 얼마나 많은 일을 할 계획인지 정확히 모릅니다.
 내 질문은: 어떤 색상이 우리 수영장과 같은 영역에 영향을 미칠 수 있습니까?
 여름에 앉아서 즐거운 시간을 보내는 것이 어떤 영향을 미치는지 아시나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4511.768s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 우리는 레벨 8 구독을 시작했으며 여기에서 레벨 8 커뮤니티를 볼 수 있습니다.
 16번가 남북 지역의 상황은 당연히 계속하는 것이 적절하지 않다고 봅니다.
 따라서 연구의 관점에서 볼 때, 솔직히 말해서 우리는 아직 거기에 도달하지 못했습니다.
 이는 라이센스 프로세스에서 드문 일이 아닙니다.
 나는 우리가 여기서 성공할 수 있을지 의심스럽다.
 그래서 사과드립니다.
 나는 당신의 수영장이 어디에 있는지 모르지만 우리는 그것을 볼 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4546.449s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 9번 거리 맞은편.
 케이시 뒤에 있어요.
 내가 거기 없을 때 나는 내 자루의 천장을 볼 수 있었습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4554.171s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 이상적인.
 이것은 정확합니다.
 짧은 대답은 우리가 그것을 보고 분석한다는 것입니다.
 죄송합니다. 라이선스 프로세스의 일부가 될 명확하고 명확한 답변이 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4566.864s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 당신이 성장함에 따라.
 감사합니다
 대화에서 우리가 이야기하는 대부분의 내용이 다루어졌다고 생각합니다. 하지만 당면한 질문으로 돌아가서 왜 아파트가 아닌 집을 임대합니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4587.23s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 좋은 답변은 많지만 짧게 대답하자면 Alliance Homes는 아파트를 전혀 짓지 않는다는 것입니다.
 우리는 민간 회사입니다.
 이것이 우리가 일부 경쟁사와 차별화되는 점입니다.
 아시다시피 저희는 은행 지원 투자 그룹이 아닙니다.
 우리는 매년 많은 집을 짓습니다. 다른 어떤 집보다 몇 년 더 많이 짓지만 사실 우리는 4명의 주요 파트너입니다.
 우리는 완전히 비공개입니다.
 이것이 바로 우리 본사가 있는 피닉스에 있는 사람들이 투자자들의 참여를 막기 위해 최선을 다하는 것입니다.
 그래서 아파트를 지을 때 무엇을 하지 않기로 결정했는지 다시 생각해 봐야 한다.
 그래서 그것은 우리가 다루지 않는 구조와 절차입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4638.742s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 내 생각엔 우리가 질문에 답하고 9번가와 1, 2, 3호실에 대해 논의한 것 같아요. 제 생각엔 당신이 제대로 하고 있는 것 같아요, Mike.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4650.185s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 제 생각에는 이론적으로 우리는 여전히 불확실한 상태에 있기 때문에 여전히 우리 제품의 품질에 대해 이야기하고 있지만 여러분도 알다시피 이 시장은 흥미롭고 변화하는 시장입니다.
 그래서 그 혼합은 끊임없이 변하고 있지만 우리는 주로 침실 1개와 2개를 갖춘 커뮤니티를 생각하고 있습니다.
 당연히 더 크고 작은 단위도 있을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4670.697s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 다음 질문은 인프라에 어떤 일이 일어날 것인가입니다.
 네, 새 건물의 수압이 떨어졌습니다.
 아시다시피, 생산되는 모든 제품은 설계되고 테스트되었다고 누구나 대답할 수 있습니다.
 인프라가 새로운 건설을 지원할 수 있도록 노력하십시오.
 여기에 무엇을 추가하고 싶은지 궁금하십니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4693.424s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 이것을 추가할 수 있습니다.
 대답은 확실히 '아니요'라고 말씀드릴 수 있습니다.
 우리는 물을 테스트했습니다.
 필요한 장비가 모두 갖추어져 있는지 확인하세요.
 물론 모든 커뮤니케이션과 미디어도 마찬가지입니다.
 물도 많고 수압도 좋습니다.
 또한, 우리 건물은 키가 커서 자체 물 펌프가 필요할 수도 있습니다.
 5층 이하의 건물이 아닙니다.
 이 건물은 우리가 탈출할 수 있다면 정말 도움을 청하고 있습니다.
 나는 당신이 그런 효과를 가질 것이라고 생각하지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4731.129s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 또 다른 질문: 노동조합 활동이 있을까요, 없을까요?
 나는 이것이 또한 프로젝트의 첫 번째 단계라는 것을 알고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4739.397s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 글쎄, 나는 그것이 일반적으로 훌륭한 조합이라고 말하고 싶습니다.
 상황에 따라 다릅니다.
 목수, 콘크리트 노동자는 언제나 노동조합을 결성한 목수, 목수이다.
 다른 사업도 많이 있지만 우리는 모든 면에서 경쟁력 있는 가격을 제공합니다.
 하지만 간단히 대답하자면, 우리는 아직 모릅니다.
 거기에 도달하기 전에 우리는 아직 해야 할 일이 많습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4759.341s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 거실에 딱 맞는 Shaw 러그를 선택하는 방법이 궁금하세요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4771.045s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 내 말은, 그게 우리가 처음에 이야기했던 것의 요점이라고 생각합니다. 우리는 원래 신비한 섬으로 가는 길로 여겨졌던 서쪽과 남쪽으로 아스팔트의 일부가 돌아올 것으로 기대하고 있습니다.
 Fellsway에서 객실을 예약하세요.
 물론 내 요점은 기술적으로는 그것이 개인 소유일 것이라고 생각하지만 그것이 모든 거리와 교차로 및 그 지역의 다른 모든 것과 연결될 것이라는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 따라서 짧은 대답은 다음과 같습니다. 그렇습니다.
 우리는 이러한 분야에 많은 혁신을 가져올 수 있다고 믿습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4805.474s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 이메일로 화상회의를 보내는 것에 대한 질문을 제외하고 다른 확인 질문은 대부분 답변된 것 같습니다. 물론 제 이메일 주소는 우체국에 있으니 시도해 볼 수 있습니다. 규모 때문에 지난 회의에 대해 논의한 것으로 알고 있습니다.
 그 정보를 외부에 게시하십시오. 그러나 일반적으로 Medford Conference 웹사이트에 게시되며 거기에 있을 것입니다.
 사람들이 보고 싶어하면 나에게 이메일을 보내주시면 링크를 찾아보도록 하겠습니다.
 대화는 여기서 끝나는 것 같아요.
 여전히 문제입니다.
 참석한 모든 사람, 즉 Mike에게 감사를 표하고 싶습니다.
 몇 가지 질문을 드리겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4856.578s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 글쎄요, 저는 이번 선거가 정말 놀라운 선거였다고 말하고 싶습니다.
 여러분 모두에게 감사드립니다.
 당신은 어려운 질문을 제기합니다.
 당신은 잘 생각한 팀입니다.
 참여해 주셔서 감사합니다.
 아시다시피, 우리는 이것을 합니다. 나는 이미 여기에 산다고 말했습니다.
 이것이 제가 정말로 열정을 갖고 있는 것입니다: 보스턴 지역에 주택을 짓는 것입니다.
 이것은 좋은 질문입니다.
 이는 우리가 모든 사업에서 통제하는 사항입니다.
 당신이 그리워요
 나는 이전에 했던 일을 계속할 것이다.
 우리는 다른 누구 못지않게 이러한 모든 문제를 해결하는 데 능숙합니다. 그래서 우리는 좋은 이웃이 되고 집을 짓고 싶습니다. 아시다시피 이곳은 소매점을 짓기 위한 실험실도 아니고 사람들이 실제로 머물고 싶어하고 여러분이 좋아하는 장소를 즐기고 싶어하는 장소를 짓는 데 나쁜 것도 아닙니다.
 지원해 주셔서 감사드리며, 누락된 다른 문제가 있으면 알려주시기 바랍니다. 마지막으로 이를 확인할 기회가 있을 수도 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4912.428s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: 공사 중 어떤 건설장비가 주차될지, 소방호스 설치로 인해 9번 국도 주차가 유실될지는 의문이다.
 소화기 및 기타</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4928.465s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 아마 그렇지 않을 것 같아요.
 실제로 소방서에 따라 다르지만 이런 건물에서는 건물 내부에 배관이 많이 있을 것입니다.
 내 말은, 소방서장이 소화전을 필요로 한다면 그렇게 할 것이지만, 만약 그렇다면 주차장에 영향을 미칠 것이라고는 생각하지 않습니다.
 따라서 주차에 관한 이전 질문인 첫 번째 질문에 대한 짧은 답변이 있습니다. 이는 특히 건설 현장에서 큰 문제입니다.
 우리가 언제인지 아시나요?
