    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=280.245s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  So these first slides we're going to start with are really just to get you acclimated with the neighborhood.
 I know that sounds silly because many of you live in the immediate area.
 However, we want to just make sure we all get started on the same page and talk about a little bit about the context for where we started our studies and conceptual program for the site.
 So the first one here is, of course, this is East Medford.
 Route 16 runs right across the page left to right.
 And the Fellsway and Middlesex Avenue run north to south.
 The taped site in yellow is the assembled parcels.
 Cappy's is the larger sort of hexagonal building.
 And Monroe Muffler is here on the east side on the property line.
 So the combined site,
 which again are 573 Fellsway, which is Cappy's Liquors, and 20 Revere Beach Parkway just to the east is the Monroe Muffler Shop.
 You'll see to the south here, Station Landing, the Mystic River Reservation off to the southwest, and the shopping centers up to the northwest.
 Of course, Wellington Station is at about 430 on your page.
 We've got a few axios here to show the immediate neighborhood.
 Again, these are really just to kind of show context of how the site fits in with the larger areas.
 We've turned the camera a bit on you.
 So, Route 16 or Revere Beach Parkway is running off to the east towards the top of Page and the Fellsway down to the right and Middlesex Avenue and the Fellsway up to the left.
 Cappy's there is just left of center.
 So obviously the neighborhood really is, you know, primarily seven and eight-story mixed-use buildings, quite a bit of housing in high-rise format.
 And you'll see Wellington just off top right of page.
 We'll flip the camera a bit here and looking southeast now, Cappies again just left of center, Route 16 traveling up and to the left of your screen, and station landing off across, southerly across Route 16 there.
 So looking at these photos, we like this site in the city for a lot of reasons.
 Medford's a great city.
 It features anything a modern resident would want, which is, of course, our business.
 The city is close to Boston, which in itself is always attractive.
 But really, it already has its own deep bench of employment of retail of walkability open space and history so all of those things stitched together to where, where, where our customers would want to live, they want to be close to home, they want to be able to walk to amenities, you know, nobody really wants to be in their car.
 And we've spent some time studying this intersection.
 Growing up in Arlington, I know this intersection well.
 So getting out of your car in this neighborhood is certainly an attractive thing, and Medford offers the ability to do that.
 And this site is really a microcosm more broadly of Medford, having all of those things I just mentioned within sometimes less than 1,000 feet of walking.
 Macro as a Bostonian, this is the type of modern housing I think greater Boston needs and regionally we need in eastern Massachusetts, where people even in cold weather aren't required to get into their vehicle to get a coffee to travel to work to pick up a prescription or to go get a classic roast beef at Kelly's across the street.
 So
 I'm going to move into some site photographs.
 I'm sure you guys are all relatively familiar with this, but I feel like we just want to be thorough.
 So this is a shot looking north of Cappy's, somewhat northeast, with 9th Street just in the back.
 You'll see a blue double two-story home on the left side of the screen with a garage.
 That is the 9th Street area.
 Monroe is just off to the right of your screen.
 This is a shot from Revere Beach Parkway on one of the many curb cuts on these two parcels.
 So we're looking straight north across the property line between Monroe and the Cappy site.
 This is a shot from 9th Street looking south.
 So Station Landing is in the background.
 Monroe is on just left of center and Cappy's, the back of Cappy's is just right of center.
 So you're looking at the intersection basically concealed only by the Cappy's.
 And then this is also a 9th Street shot looking the other direction.
 So you can see Boston Tattoo here in the background and the 9th Street intersection, current intersection and curb cut with Cappy's.
 So this last is an obvious satellite image of the site.
 We've oriented this North and South so we can stop getting you guys dizzy.
 9th Street runs East and West across the top of the site.
 This is Middlesex Avenue on the left, and again, Route 16 on the bottom.
 The property isn't taped, but it is this L-shaped combination of these two parcels, not including the Boston Tattoo Company.
 This is a good start to show where the site planning begins for us, apart from the macro context of the area and the uses that are here and the amenities.
 This is really where we start trying to integrate and stitch those things together into a program.
 On the left and on the south of the site, we're bound by these two roads or parkways.
 These were
 These are actually very interesting if you don't know the history, but these were formerly, like many parkways in greater Boston, were run by the MDC, now DCR.
 The spirit of these roads was effectively, as we were becoming an automobile-focused society, to have a pleasure-driving avenue to explore the area's benefits.
 So you, I'm sure, are all familiar with the Middlesex Bells.
 and the Mystic River reservations.
 These are really just spectacular green spaces, and the former MDC knew that, and they knew that they wanted people to experience those in a pleasurable way.
 So on the south side of the site, you'll see there's a pretty deep, for an urban zone like this, a pretty deep setback with mature trees and paths.
 Believe it or not, there's actually a deed restriction on these sites that allows the parkways to remain what their original intent was.
 So while we might not be putting around in a 57 Chevrolet enjoying the Mystic River Reservation here today,
 I drive on at least three parkways on the way to work every day.
 These are commuter roads now.
 But there's still an opportunity here, we think, to maintain the spirit of what these parkways were initially for.
 And one thing we found interesting was that on the west side of this site, along the Middlesex Avenue, it's paved right to the sidewalk.
 and there so those setbacks and deed notes actually exist there as well and so one of the things we thought might be attractive and seems to mate with some of the intersection plans being discussed is is an ability to use that even though it is on this property rather than leave it as asphalt is to try and continue that parkway um parkway spirit the paths put mature trees and native plantings there and the like um so
 We think restoring that buffer could be a real opportunity.
 So I'm going to move to the next shot.
 This is an actual concept we're working with.
 And it's roughly centered on the page as this is.
 So again, you'll see the, well, mislabeled Fellsway.
 That's technically Middlesex, of course, but Revere Beach Parkway on the bottom.
 And you'll see how we're looking at really adding back into those buffer zones, as I mentioned before, some of the green spaces.
 A number of other things worth highlighting as we get into this we're going to show you some more details on on how we program space conceptually.
 This community's proposed at 265 units of rental housing, we do not build condominiums in an eight story format with 100% of the resident parking enclosed within the building so.
 A lot of the surface parking areas that are on the perimeter of the area and nearby sites, we're going to instead work to green those up and bring the parking inside the envelope completely.
 We'll talk a little more about the rest of the program.
 But to get you started, effectively, we craft these communities so that they are a completely enclosed community.
 And so by that I mean, while this looks like a pretty normal building,
 from the outside, all of our building systems are located internally.
 So, trash, refuse collection and recycling, separation, emergency services and access, all of our amenities, or most of the amenities, I should say, that are internal to the site.
 Everything is neatly encapsulated within the envelope of the building we propose here.
 So, you'll see on the site, there's donut shape is primarily the mass of the building.
 However, there is a hole in the middle and we'll use that courtyard to have some outdoor private space for residents.
 That's a little more private than perhaps walking across the street to the mystic river.
 But typically, and we'll show you some photos of how we treat these spaces.
 But these spaces typically have a large pool deck, sort of resort styled.
 We'll have outdoor cooking areas, lounges and cabanas and that sort of thing.
 A space where, you know, to kind of center the entire community around.
 On the upper left of the page, you'll note we've got a curb cut proposed here off of Middlesex.
 And in fact, to expand on that, the site currently features five curb cuts.
 And I'm sure we'll spend a lot of time talking about traffic and parking here.
 But the big story here is we're going to try and eliminate all of those curb cuts but one.
 We have not engaged a traffic engineer at this time.
 However, we've done enough of these to know that on a busy intersection like this, particularly one that's in flux for its future, that the less interruption and the less curb cuts that you're delivering traffic onto, the better.
 Excuse me.
 So our goal here would be to eliminate as many of those curb cuts in this planet, four of the five would be would be removed from the site.
 Inside the garage, so residents will drive into the building here, just above where it says loading, and there'll be three levels of parking.
 So the first three levels of the program would all be structured parking and other building services, and then all of the housing, but for a very few units, would be located on floors four and above.
 So we're gonna dig into the building here a little bit.
 This would be the first level if you were to just shave everything on floors two through eight off.
 And so as you arrive, you'll see the only surface parking we're proposing is just at the amenity area.
 That's also where we would have our 24-hour leasing and staff located.
 So future residents might use these spaces if they were to come look at a home or to check out the community.
 So that that sort of area all on the west side labeled as amenity would be a two story volume focused on the leasing and then a number of different amenities, which we'll talk a little bit about later.
 but primarily work from home type spaces, screening rooms, flex spaces.
 And we'll show you some of the other examples of what we do for fun in those spaces.
 So those would be separated from the garage element.
 The next two levels above this would also be parking served by internal ramps.
 So invisible to the outside.
 This would be an upper garage.
 parking floor like two or three you'll note that now above the common program area will add some homes and there'll be some again on the south side until we get to the upper residential floors, such as this where it'll be all housing on force for and above.
 So we'll also in these upper floors probably have some amenities.
 We're finding that most surprising amount of people are not going back to the office.
 And so the flex time and work from home spaces are becoming an important part of our business.
 So while some people may go to work, the typical customer here is working in a high tech or an R&D type
 And those have, you know, non traditional non nine to five types of hours.
 So we're now building our amenities to make those spaces more pleasurable and make your sort of to help you separate work from home, even when you are near home, as you would be in this.
 So we've added some, these shots are what we call axiometrics.
 These shots were created with the intent to kind of stitch what we're proposing into the neighborhood.
 So you'll notice, like most of the buildings around here, this is also eight stories.
 I think one of the station landing buildings up front is seven.
 but you'll see we're looking to pull things back off of the parkways and contribute back to what that sort of original mission was for those roadways and also just give this a little bit of a softer edge on what is a very hard-edged zone.
 So this we've also picked these spaces to
 try to relate to the aerial views we showed you earlier.
 So where we were showing you a photo very similar to this of the Cappies and Monroe site to show you how this would stitch into those with the massing around it.
 Now, this is a shot looking south, excuse me, southeast.
 So Ninth Street would be just in front of the building here in your view and the Middlesex Avenue and the Fells Way coming basically straight up the page on the right side.
 station landings here in the back.
 We're proposing a lot of verticality.
 This is what we'd call a Vitruvian style building.
 It's very classic.
 We're not sure this is the space based on what's around it.
 There's a lot of brick.
 There's a lot of sort of traditional materials.
 Station landing is a relatively classic and timeless architecture.
 So we didn't feel it was appropriate to use some of the real contemporary modern looks.
 for this space.
 So we stuck with some pretty classic verticality and spacing and dimensions to the building.
 To help you stay oriented, this was the small little future resident parking area, and the garage entry would be right here.
 And again, these first three levels, despite the fact that they look traditional with windows and the like, would actually be just the same cladding, just enclosing the parking structure.
 So this is a similar angle to the one we just showed you just brought down from from the seagull residents of Medford's viewpoint to get you down to a more pedestrian scale.
 Again this is where those future resident spots in the curb cut on the middle section might be and a garage parking entrance here if you can see my cursor moving.
 So
 This is, again, this is an early concept, so this may look developed, and we have looked at a couple of other options, but this is sort of the path we've been going stylistically with the concept.
 Next, we're gonna show you some photos of other projects we've done in Greater Boston that have things that we think at least conceptually belong in a project like this.
 This is a community we built called The Val that we've just finished, or just finishing leasing up.
 And so some of the things you'll note here is a big two-story volume at the arrival.
 I mentioned that there was that amenity labeled space was also amenities, but also our leasing and management staff.
 So this is a good example of how we integrate some of these things.
 On the right side of this feature wall is actually the back of house where at all times you can find somebody on our team working there.
 But there's also this sort of hotel-styled arrival here, which is some of the way
 apartment home communities are going.
 So there's someone here at all times kind of giving you a more full service feeling during the
 well, during regular hours, more full service feeling to the building.
 And then you'll see these two stories and a feature stair.
 This is something we'd like to integrate in this project as well, where we really are stitching together some of these assembly spaces, work from home spaces, or maybe you're just scrolling and rolling with your earbuds in and your music on, but places where this is a little more activated and a little more public.
 This actually, this wall was, we had a local artist custom paint it for us in sort of a thematic nod to the name.
 This is a project we built two years ago called The Cove.
 This is another idea of just some of those sort of flex spaces where this is really,
 more recreational space, obviously a pool table, there's actually a beer tap back there and wine, excuse me, and a wine cooler.
 But this is a space that would also be, we would propose something like stylistically different, of course, right near those amenity and leasing spaces, a little more open concept.
 This is one of our fitness centers we just completed.
 This one's actually done on two levels.
 We had a lot of fun with this one.
 We're utilizing private mirror rooms for online workouts and then of course all the traditional cardio.
 So this one has actually up top of this spiral staircase has a cardio deck and then the rest of your workout is all below here.
 So you can get an idea of how we really want to create an enclosed, fully encapsulated community, but in a very first class way.
 This is a pool deck shot.
 So this is an important one because this is a good analogy for how we would treat that center of the donut type space you saw.
 This is also a green roof on deck.
 These trees, while brand new, will grow to be full 40 foot sugar maples and red maples.
 So we have a team that understands how to put
 full-sized real vegetation on top of a deck.
 Under this is a parking level, not unlike we would propose on this site.
 Then a full, of course, heated pool and resort style, three, four months of the year, great place to hang out with your iPad or just get some sun.
 This is a good example of how we would treat that.
 This is in the same project at the Val I mentioned earlier, similar green roof.
 You know, you'll see something.
 We had some taller trees at the inception here, but, and some lawn back there, which is hard to see, but we fully green up hard and soft scape.
 This one has a cool sun deck where you can throw your chaise lounge right in the water.
 It's heated and, and hang out, you know, we'll have fire, we have a large fire pit.
 And then this one, you can actually see the grilling stations, private grilling areas where you and your friends can kind of hang out.
 and have dinner.
 And then this is just, we just wanted to give you an idea of what some of our apartment homes look like.
 Alliance is a little different than some of our more cookie cutter national competitors.
 I'm not here to throw shade at any of them.
 There's a lot of great groups out there.
 We just really kind of treat each project with a little bit more of a customized approach.
 And so, you know, in our Hingham asset, you know, that was more appropriate to have a little bit more of a coastal New England style and a little bit more classic sort of features.
 You know, at workforce spaces, you might want to be a little cooler, have a little bit more fun with some of the design, a little less safe.
 And then, of course, the unit mix and the lighting and all that changes.
 So this is a good example.
 We actually did two different types of backsplash tile with a custom featured backsplash tile behind the range.
 and sort of things like that.
 But we build, you know, the goal is to build, you know, first class modern housing from connectivity to finishes and the like.
 And so that is that.
 Let's see if I can understand how to put this off.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2079.292s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: លីនដា ទាំងនេះគឺជាសំណួរដ៏អស្ចារ្យ ហើយអ្នកនឹងសម្គាល់ឃើញនៅក្នុងផែនការគំនិតដែលយើងមិនរួមបញ្ចូលការទប់ស្កាត់ដោយចេតនា ហើយពិតជាបានលុបចោលការទប់ស្កាត់មួយចំនួនរវាងដីឡូតិ៍ទាំងនេះ និងផ្លូវលេខ 9។
 ដូច្នេះ​អ្នក​ដឹង​ហើយ យើង​សង្ស័យ​ថា​នឹង​មាន​ករណី​នេះ។
 ប្រធានបទក្តៅ។
 អ្នកផ្សេងទៀតនៅក្នុងទីក្រុងបានប្រាប់យើងថាផ្លូវទី 9 មានបញ្ហាក្នុងរឿងនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា យើង​បាន​ធ្វើ​រឿង​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដោយ​ចេតនា យើង​ព្យាយាម​គោរព និង​រក្សា​រថយន្ត​របស់​យើង​ឱ្យ​ឆ្ងាយ​ពី​លេខ​ប្រាំបួន។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​មាន​រឿង​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដែល​យើង​មិន​ធ្វើ​ដោយ​ចេតនា​ដែល​មាន​ប្រយោជន៍។
 ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវបីនៅលើ Revere Beach Avenue ខាងលិច,
 នៅចំណុចនេះ អ្នកអាចបត់ស្តាំបានយ៉ាងងាយស្រួល ហើយទៅកាន់ចំណតរថយន្ត Monroe ឬឆ្លងកាត់ចំណតរថយន្ត Cappies និងទៅកាន់ផ្លូវលេខ 9 ទៅកាន់ផ្លូវប្រសព្វ លុបបំបាត់ភ្លើងចរាចរណ៍ជាសំខាន់នៅចំនុចប្រសព្វ ហើយឆ្ពោះទៅភាគខាងជើងតាម Fellsway ឬ Middlesex ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​ដោយ​ចេតនា គឺ​ប្រាកដ​ជា​មិន​បង្ក​ការ​ឈឺចាប់​ថ្មី​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ជាមួយ​នឹង​ផែនការ​អភិវឌ្ឍន៍​ដែល​យើង​កំពុង​តែ​ស្នើ​នោះ ឥឡូវ​នេះ​យើង​នឹង​បញ្ឈប់​មនុស្ស​មិន​ឲ្យ​ឆ្លង​ចិញ្ចើម​ផ្លូវ​លេខ ៩។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​និយាយ​ថា​វា​គួរ​តែ​ត្រូវ​បាន​កាត់​បន្ថយ​មួយ​ចំនួន​។
 សូមអភ័យទោស ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាផ្លូវក្រានីតនៅទីណាដែលមានសញ្ញាដែលអ្នកបានរៀបរាប់នោះ តោះស្វែងរកទាំងអស់គ្នា។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដែលឆ្លងកាត់កញ្ចប់ទាំងនេះប្រាកដជាមិនអាចធ្វើវាបានទៀតទេ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2185.727s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: ខ្ញុំគិតថាខ្ញុំត្រូវបានរំខាន។
 ខ្ញុំនៅតែអាចលឺអ្នកបាន អូ ខ្ញុំមិនអីទេ ខ្ញុំបានបាត់ផ្លាកសញ្ញានៅចុងផ្លូវទី 9 ដែលរត់ពី Review Beach Park ដល់ Keys ah, Wellington Apartments ពិតណាស់ មានផ្លាកសញ្ញាពីផ្លូវលេខ 9 ដល់ Key Factory ហើយក៏មានរបស់ជាច្រើនទៀតតាំងពីខ្ញុំមកទីនេះ។
 ទីក្រុងកាន់កាប់ពាក់កណ្តាលទៀត។
 មែនហើយ ខ្ញុំមានប៉ារ៉ាឡែល ស្របជាមួយលេខ 6 នៅខាងក្រៅនៅកណ្តាល។</p>

 ក្នុងអំឡុងពេលនេះ។
 នេះ​ជា​ការ​ព្រួយ​បារម្ភ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2249.175s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ខ្ញុំអាចប្រាប់អ្នកបាន លីនដា ពួកយើងបានធ្វើរឿងប្រកបដោយភាពច្នៃប្រឌិតមួយចំនួនអំពីការដឹកជញ្ជូននៅក្នុងតំបន់។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាតើខ្ញុំអាចផ្តល់ឱ្យអ្នកនូវដំណោះស្រាយដ៏ល្អឥតខ្ចោះមួយឬយ៉ាងណានោះទេ។ ខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងមិនអាច។

 នេះគឺជាអ្វីដែលយើងហៅថារយៈពេលរស់រានមានជីវិត។
 យើងកំពុងស្រាវជ្រាវអ្វីៗគ្រប់យ៉ាងតាំងពីកម្មសិទ្ធិ និងកិច្ចសន្យា រហូតដល់តម្រូវការបរិស្ថាន របៀបទទួលបានលិខិតអនុញ្ញាតជាដើម និយាយជាមួយអ្នកជិតខាង និងរឿងដែលយើងមិនដឹង។ គោលដៅចម្បងរបស់យើងនៅថ្ងៃនេះគឺដើម្បីស្តាប់អ្នកដែលនៅជុំវិញយើងដើម្បីឱ្យយើងអាចឆ្ពោះទៅមុខ និងចូលទៅក្នុងដំណើរការបើកចំហមួយដែលកិច្ចប្រជុំបើកចំហ និងផ្លូវការកាន់តែច្រើននឹងប្រព្រឹត្តទៅ។

 ជំរាបសួរ ខ្ញុំឈ្មោះ Christine ហើយខ្ញុំជាម្ចាស់ Parkway Plaza West ។
 ខ្ញុំគាំទ្រវិធីសាស្រ្តអភិវឌ្ឍន៍នេះ។
 ខ្ញុំមានអារម្មណ៍ថាដូចជាតំបន់ដែលនៅជិតការដឹកជញ្ជូនសាធារណៈគួរតែមានលំនៅដ្ឋានក្រាស់ជាងនេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​មាន​ការ​ព្រួយ​បារម្ភ​ពីរ​អំពី​ការ​សាង​សង់។
 មួយក្នុងចំណោមពួកគេគឺជាអ្វីដែលអ្នកផ្សេងទៀតបាននិយាយ។
 នៅផ្លូវទី 9 លីនដានិយាយត្រូវ បើទោះបីជាអ្នកលុបបំបាត់ការបិទផ្លូវទាំងនោះក៏ដោយ ក៏មនុស្សនឹងមិនមានទំនោរទៅកាត់ចំណតនោះទេ ព្រោះនិយាយដោយត្រង់ទៅ វាជាតំបន់គ្រោះមហន្តរាយ ប៉ុន្តែពួកគេនឹងចូលទៅក្នុង Brainrd ហើយបន្ទាប់មកចូលទៅក្នុងផ្លូវទី 9 ។
 វាស្ថិតនៅលើផ្លូវលេខ 9 ហើយវាតូចណាស់ ដូច្នេះសំណួរដំបូងរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺ តើនេះជាក្រុមហ៊ុនរបស់អ្នក ឬតើអ្នកធ្លាប់មានក្រុមហ៊ុនបែបនេះពីមុនមក?
 គាត់បានធ្វើការងារមួយចំនួនជាមួយសហគមន៍ដែលគាត់បានសាងសង់ដើម្បីកែលម្អផ្លូវនេះ ប្រហែលជាមានចេតនាល្អ ព្រោះជាអកុសលផ្លូវលេខ 9 គឺជាផ្លូវឯកជន។
 អ្វីៗនៅតែដដែល ត្រូវការការកែលម្អ ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ជា​ការ​ល្អ​ប្រសិន​បើ​មាន​វិធី​មួយ។
 ដូច្នេះសំណួរដំបូងរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺ៖ តើអ្នកមានទេ?
 តើក្រុមហ៊ុនរបស់អ្នកមានចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍ ឬប្រវត្តិក្នុងការជួយកែលម្អផ្លូវទេ?
 ដោយសារ​តែ​មិន​បាន​កាត់​ចិញ្ចើម​ផ្លូវ​ទេ មនុស្ស​នឹង​ចាប់​ផ្តើម​បើក​បរ​ពី Brainerd ទៅ​ផ្លូវ​លេខ ៩ ដើម្បី​បញ្ចៀស​ផ្លូវ​ប្រសព្វ។
 សំណួរទីពីររបស់ខ្ញុំគឺអំពីការកាត់បន្ថយបញ្ហាសត្វកកេរ ព្រោះខ្ញុំទើបតែបានអានអំពីមនុស្សដែលមានសុបិន្តអាក្រក់ជាមួយនឹងបញ្ហាសត្វកកេរ នៅពេលដែលពួកគេចាប់ផ្តើមការសាងសង់ទ្រង់ទ្រាយធំ។
 ថ្ងៃនេះខ្ញុំបានអានអត្ថបទមួយអំពី Somerville និង Brookline ដែលចាប់ផ្តើមប្រើប្រព័ន្ធជំនាន់ក្រោយហៅថា smart boxes។
 តើក្រុមហ៊ុនរបស់អ្នកអនុវត្តវិធានការកាត់បន្ថយសត្វកកេរជាមូលដ្ឋាននៅក្នុងការងារបច្ចុប្បន្នរបស់ខ្លួន ឬតើអ្នកមានគម្រោងវិនិយោគលើបច្ចេកទេសកាត់បន្ថយសត្វកកេរកម្រិតខ្ពស់ដែរឬទេ?
 អូ ដោយសារយើងមានម្ចាស់អាផាតមិនច្រើនក្នុងរង្វង់ខ្លីមួយ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាពិតជាគួរឱ្យរំខាន ប្រសិនបើរឿងនេះបណ្តាលឱ្យមានបញ្ហាសត្វកកេរធំមួយ។

 បាទ ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ដែល​ឮ​អំពី​រឿង​នោះ​ទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចាប់​អារម្មណ៍។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាបានមើលវានៅព្រឹកនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះដំណាក់កាលទី 1 រួមមានបីដំណាក់កាលនៃបញ្ហាសត្វកកេរ។
 ទីមួយ ក្នុងអំឡុងពេលដំណើរការសាងសង់ ច្បាប់តម្រូវឱ្យយើងខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងច្រើន។
 ខ្ញុំអាចនិយាយបានថាពួកគេមានប្រសិទ្ធភាពណាស់។
 តាមពិតទៅ យើង​ត្រូវ​បាន​ច្បាប់​តម្រូវ​ឱ្យ​ជួល​អ្នកជំនាញ​សត្វកកេរ។
 បុគ្គលនេះត្រូវតែជាសមាជិកនៃក្រុមរបស់យើងពេញមួយដំណើរការសាងសង់។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាវាមិនមែនជាអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងទេ ប៉ុន្តែវាជាជំហានដំបូង។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាតើបច្ចេកទេសនេះអាចទៅរួច ឬប្រសិនបើក្រុមហ៊ុនកំចាត់សត្វល្អិតដែលយើងធ្វើការជាមួយប្រើវា។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាចង់សុំឱ្យពួកគេធ្វើបែបនេះ ព្រោះវាហាក់ដូចជាបច្ចេកវិទ្យាគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ណាស់។
 រឿងទីពីរគឺអ្នកដឹងទេ
 យើង​សង់​ផ្ទះ​ហើយ​ព្យាយាម​ប្រាប់​មនុស្ស​ថា​យើង​សង់​ផ្ទះ​ស្អាត។
 ដូច្នេះ​អ្វី​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​បាន​ចុង​ក្រោយ​គឺ​ការ​រាតត្បាត​របស់​សត្វ​កណ្ដុរ​នៅ​ក្នុង ឬ​ជុំវិញ​សង្កាត់​របស់​ខ្ញុំ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំត្រូវស្វែងយល់បន្ថែមនៅទីនេះ ហើយសន្មតថាយើងអាចបន្តនៅទីនេះ Matt និង Greg នឹងក្លាយជាអ្នកជំនាញកណ្តុរក្នុងតំបន់នៅលើទូរស័ព្ទ។
 និយាយឱ្យត្រង់ទៅ ខ្ញុំមិនយកឥណទានណាមួយសម្រាប់រឿងនោះទេ។
 នោះ​នឹង​ជា​ការ​ខិត​ខំ​អាត្មានិយម ព្រោះ​យើង​មិន​ចង់​បាន​វា​ដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងមានការគ្រប់គ្រងសត្វល្អិតនៅក្នុងថវិកាប្រតិបត្តិការរបស់យើង ហើយដូចដែលអ្នកអាចស្រមៃបាន វាមាន 150 បន្ទាត់ ហើយនេះគឺជារឿងមួយដែលត្រូវបានរួមបញ្ចូល ហើយវាជាអ្វីមួយដែលយើងនឹងធ្វើបន្ទាប់ពីការសាងសង់។
 បាទ ត្រឹមត្រូវហើយ។
 នេះគឺជាទីមួយ។
 ទីពីរ​គឺ​អំពី​ការ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រសើរ​ឡើង​នៅ​ផ្លូវ Ninth Street និង​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​នៅ​កន្លែង​ផ្សេង។
 ចម្លើយចំពោះសំណួរទាំងពីរគឺ បាទ/ចាស ស្ទើរតែគ្រប់ពេល ហើយយើងដឹងខ្លះថា អាត្មានិយម ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងមិនរាប់បញ្ចូលនោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែយើងចង់បានសហគមន៍ល្អ ហើយខ្ញុំនឹងមិនសាងសង់នៅលើដីបៃតងនោះទេ។
 កន្លែងទាំងអស់ដែលយើងបានសាងសង់គឺជាអគារឧស្សាហកម្មចាស់ៗ ឬអគារការិយាល័យដែលខូច ហើយដោយមិនធ្វើឱ្យខូចកេរ្តិ៍ឈ្មោះរបស់ Cappy's គ្រឿងបរិក្ខារគឺល្អណាស់ ហើយខ្ញុំបានទិញនៅទីនោះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែគោលដៅរបស់យើងគឺមិនមែនដើម្បីបំផ្លាញកន្លែងថ្មីទេ។
 វាពាក់ព័ន្ធនឹងការកែលម្អដីដែលទទួលមរតកតាមរយៈការជួសជុលអចលនទ្រព្យដែលបានទទួលមរតក។
 ដូច្នេះ ការធ្វើឱ្យ Ninth Street កាន់តែទាក់ទាញ គឺដើម្បីផលប្រយោជន៍របស់យើង។
 នេះពិតជារឿងដែលយើងចង់ពិភាក្សាជាមួយអ្នក។
 យើង​មាន​គម្រោង​ខាង​ផ្លូវ​លេខ​៩។
 អ្នកដឹងថាផ្លូវក្រាលកៅស៊ូមើលទៅដូចម្ដេច ហើយអ្នកដឹងពីរបៀបដែលការកាត់ asphalt ទាំងនេះសមឥតខ្ចោះ។
 អ្នកដឹងថាយើងនឹងមានវេទិកាថ្មីមួយចំនួនទាក់ទងនឹងរឿងនោះ ហើយជាការពិតណាស់ ប្រសិនបើយើងបន្តកែលម្អ និងស្ថាបនាឡើងវិញនូវសតិបណ្ដោះអាសន្នព្រំដែន Parkway នោះអ្នកដឹងថាពួកគេនឹងត្រូវរួមបញ្ចូលជាមួយវាផងដែរ។

 តើមាននរណាម្នាក់និយាយអំពីការប្រើប្រាស់ទិន្នន័យលក់របស់ Cappy ឬរដ្ឋ ឬប៉ូលីសក្នុងតំបន់ទេ ពីព្រោះពួកគេតែងតែមានមនុស្សចតរថយន្តនៅលើចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ ដើម្បីមើលចរាចរណ៍ក្នុងតំបន់ ដើម្បីជួយអ្នកកំណត់ថាតើការរំខានចរាចរណ៍ប្រភេទណាដែលអគារទំហំនេះនឹងបណ្តាលឱ្យមាន?

 ដោយសារវាជាថ្ងៃ Thanksgiving នោះមានន័យថាផ្លូវប្រសព្វជាមួយ Cappy's នឹងបើក ហើយមនុស្សនឹងមកជួបជុំគ្នាម្តងទៀត ដូច្នេះវានឹងមានមនុស្សច្រើនកុះករ។

 និយាយឱ្យត្រង់ទៅ យើងនៅតែឆាប់ពេកក្នុងដំណើរការជួលអ្នកប្រឹក្សាផ្នែកដឹកជញ្ជូន។ ជាធម្មតា ខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើមចំណាយលុយនៅពេលដែលខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងអាចមានអារម្មណ៍សុខស្រួលទទួលយកហានិភ័យដែលយើងត្រូវទទួលយកដើម្បីបន្ត។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងហៅ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំនឹងប្រាប់អ្នកពីរឿងនេះ
 វាត្រូវបានគេហៅថា ITE ។
 នៅពេលដែលយើងជួលអ្នកជំនាញទាំងនេះ ពួកគេមិនចូលចិត្តប្រើទិន្នន័យអក្ខរាវិរុទ្ធទេ។
 អញ្ចឹងខ្ញុំនឹងហៅទៅមើលថា តើមានវិធីណាក្នុងការបញ្ចូលវាទេ ពីព្រោះនៅក្នុងពេលវេលារបស់យើង អ្នកដឹងទេ តាមការពិត យើងនឹងមិនទេ សន្មត់ថាយើងបន្ត នោះនឹងនៅដើមឆ្នាំក្រោយ អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងមានប្រអប់ជាច្រើនដែលត្រូវពិនិត្យមុនពេលចូលឆ្នាំថ្មី ដើម្បីមើលថាតើយើងចង់បន្តធ្វើកិច្ចការនេះដែរឬទេ។
 ជាអកុសល នេះមានន័យថា ដល់ពេលដែលយើងធ្វើការសិក្សាផ្លូវការទាំងនេះ ដែលនឹងចំណាយពេលច្រើនខែ យើងនឹងហួសពីការថ្លែងអំណរគុណ។
 ដូច្នេះ​សំណួរ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ​គឺ៖ តើ​អ្នក​គិត​ឬ​សម្រប​ខ្លួន​ទៅ​នឹង​រឿង​នេះ​ដោយ​របៀប​ណា?
 ដោយសារតែប្រសិនបើនេះជាពេលមួយដែលមានឥទ្ធិពលពិសេសលើអ្នក ហើយវាសមហេតុផលទាំងស្រុង ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកអាចនឹងឃើញខ្លួនអ្នកនៅក្នុងស្ថានភាពស្រដៀងគ្នាក្នុងអំឡុងពេលបុណ្យណូអែល។
 ត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 អ្នកដឹងពីរបៀបបញ្ចូលវា។
 ជាអកុសល ចម្លើយខ្លីគឺថា អ្នកប្រហែលជាមិនទទួលបានចរាចរណ៍ពិតប្រាកដណាមួយទេ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលយើងចាប់ផ្តើមការងារនេះ យើងនឹងចេញទៅវាលស្រែ ហើយពួកគេនឹងឡើងខ្សែកៅស៊ូតូចៗទាំងនេះដែលអ្នកឃើញនៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃផ្លូវ។ ពេលខ្លះពួកគេពិតជារាប់បរិមាណរាងកាយ និងទទួលបានមួយ។
 ខ្ញុំមានអ្នកវិភាគមួយចំនួនដែលធ្វើការលើក្រុមដែលកំពុងធ្វើតេស្តផងដែរ ដើម្បីមើលថាតើវាដំណើរការឬអត់ ដូច្នេះយើងទទួលបានទិដ្ឋភាពដ៏ស្មោះត្រង់នៃដំណើរការនេះ។ ខ្ញុំ​សង្ស័យ​ថា​តើ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​អាច​កៀរគរ​អ្នក​ណា​ម្នាក់​នៅ​សប្តាហ៍​ក្រោយ។
 ទោះបីជាខ្ញុំប្រថុយនឹងប្រាក់ដុល្លារទាំងនេះកាន់តែច្រើនក៏ដោយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​រក​វិធី​ពន្យល់ ព្រោះ​មាន​ថ្ងៃ​ខ្លះ​ពិបាក​ខ្លាំង​ក្នុង​អំឡុង​ឆ្នាំ។
 យើងនឹងរៀនពីរបៀបធ្វើវា។
 អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយ ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ យើងមិនបានជ្រើសរើសអ្នកជំនាញមួយចំនួនដែលយើងត្រូវធ្វើការងារត្រឹមត្រូវសម្រាប់កម្មវិធីនេះទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយើងបានជួលជួរឈរពិតប្រាកដ។
 យើងមិនជ្រៀតជ្រែកជាមួយក្រុមបន្ទាប់បន្សំទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​អ្នក​ទាំង​នេះ​គឺ​ជា​អ្នក​វិទ្យាសាស្ត្រ​បរិមាណ​ពិត​ប្រាកដ។
 ពួកគេកំពុងគណនាមនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នា។
 ដូច្នេះ​កុំ​ឲ្យ​យើង​មើល​រំលង​អី។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាផ្នែកមួយនៃនេះគឺជាដំណឹងល្អ៖ ការប្រើប្រាស់របស់យើងនឹងបង្កើតចរាចរតិចជាងការប្រើប្រាស់ផ្សេងទៀតដែលនរណាម្នាក់អាចបង្កើតនៅថ្ងៃនេះ។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកក្រឡេកមើលផ្ទៃដីពិតប្រាកដ ខ្ញុំមិនមានតួលេខពិតប្រាកដនៅពីមុខខ្ញុំទេ ប៉ុន្តែមាននរណាម្នាក់អាចចូលមកទីនេះជាមួយនឹងអគារពិសោធន៍កម្ពស់ 4 ជាន់ ជិត 300,000 ហ្វីត ហើយនឹងមិនមានដំណើរការសវនាការជាសាធារណៈនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេគ្រាន់តែទុកផែនការរបស់ពួកគេជាមួយការិយាល័យអធិការកិច្ចអគារ ហើយរង់ចាំ 30 ថ្ងៃ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​មាន​កម្រិត​ទាប​បើ​ធៀប​នឹង​ការ​ប្រើ​ជម្រើស​មួយ​ចំនួន​នៅ​ទីនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាត្រូវធ្វើអ្វីពីអ្វីដែល Cappy បានធ្វើនោះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​សង្ស័យ​ថា​ប្រហែល​ជា​មាន​បន្តិច​ទៀត។
 ប៉ុន្តែបាទ ខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយថា ប្រសិនបើវាជាការិយាល័យលក់រាយ ឬបន្ទប់ពិសោធន៍ កន្លែងទាំងនោះជាធម្មតាមានឡានពី 4 ទៅ 5 គ្រឿងក្នុង 1,000 ហ្វីត ហើយយើងមានឡានប្រហែលមួយក្នុង 1,000 ហ្វីត ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិននិយាយទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​មិន​ប្រាប់​អ្នក​ថា​នឹង​មិន​មាន​រថយន្ត​នៅ​ទីនេះ​ដែល​រំខាន​អ្នក, ចូល​ទៅ​ក្នុង​ផ្លូវ​របស់​អ្នក​ឬ​អ្វី​មួយ​។
 ប៉ុន្តែមានតែតាមទស្សនៈបរិមាណប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ជាពិសេសក្នុងអំឡុងពេលថ្ងៃឈប់សម្រាកទាំងនេះនឹងមានតិចជាង។</p>

 សំណួរបន្ទាប់របស់ខ្ញុំគឺ តើអ្នកកំពុងរារាំងទស្សនៈរបស់អ្នកផ្សេងទៀតដែលខ្ញុំបានលឺថាពាក់ព័ន្ធឬទេ?
 តើយើងអាចដោះស្រាយបញ្ហានេះដោយរបៀបណា?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3254.415s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ខ្ញុំមិនមានចម្លើយល្អសម្រាប់អ្នកទេ នៅពេលនិយាយអំពីចក្ខុវិស័យ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ នោះគ្រាន់តែជាមុខងារនៃតំបន់ដែលមានអគារបែបនេះប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ដូច្នេះ អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំគិតថាមនុស្សមួយចំនួននឹងមិនមានការមើលឃើញទុកជាមុនទេ។</p>

 នោះ​ជា​សំណួរ​យុត្តិធម៌។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា ខ្ញុំគិតថាតាមទស្សនៈរបស់មនុស្សមួយចំនួន និយាយដោយត្រង់ទៅ គោលដៅរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺបង្កើតអគារដែលទាក់ទាញគ្រប់គ្រាន់។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3285.786s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: បញ្ហាគឺថា វាមិនមែនជារូបរាងដ៏អស្ចារ្យនៅគូទរបស់ Kirby នោះទេ។
 យើងសង្ឃឹមថានឹងធ្វើឱ្យប្រសើរឡើងនូវទស្សនៈមួយចំនួន និងធានាបាននូវការទប់ស្កាត់។
 ខ្ញុំ​ប្រាកដ​ថា មនុស្ស​មួយ​ចំនួន​ប្រហែល​ជា​មាន​យោបល់។
 អ្នកដឹងថាយើងស្ថិតនៅភាគនិរតី ហើយអ្នកអាចមើលឃើញទន្លេអាថ៌កំបាំង ខ្ញុំមិនបានឃើញពួកវាទេ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំសង្ស័យថាវាមាន ហើយខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាទស្សនៈរបស់យើងយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ប្រសើរជាង Capiz នៅ Monroe ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងច្បាស់ថាមានសំណងខ្លះនៅទីនោះ។ ខ្ញុំមិនមានចម្លើយល្អឥតខ្ចោះសម្រាប់រឿងនេះទេ។
 តើវាជាពែងទេ? តើ​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​និយាយ​ថា​? ពួកគេនិយាយត្រូវ៖ វាកោងទាំងអស់។</p>

 នោះហើយជាអ្វីដែលមនុស្សត្រូវការនៅក្នុងខួរក្បាលរបស់ពួកគេ។
 ដូចមនុស្សនិយាយអញ្ចឹង តាមពិតនេះគឺជាផ្លូវឯកជន ការលក់គឺឯកជនទៅទីក្រុង ហើយខ្ញុំថាពេលគេឡើងមក ខ្ញុំមិនជឿទេ ខ្ញុំមិនជឿថាមានអ្នកណាបង់លុយធ្វើបែបនេះទេ វាជារឿងឆោតល្ងង់ដែលធ្វើដើម្បីសម្រួលចរាចរណ៍នៅផ្លូវ ១៦ ដែលជាផ្លូវដែលមមាញឹកបំផុតនៅក្នុងតំបន់នោះ។
 បន្តនៅពីក្រោយប្លុកទាំងនេះ។
 ជាថ្មីម្តងទៀត គ្រោះថ្នាក់នេះមិនមែនជាកំហុសរបស់គាត់ ឬអ្នកដ៏ទៃទេ វាជាកំហុសរបស់ DCR ទាំងស្រុង។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3359.618s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: មែនហើយ ខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយដូចនេះ៖ យើងប្រហែលជាមិនអាចដោះស្រាយបញ្ហាទាំងអស់នេះបានទេ ប៉ុន្តែយើងអាច ហើយអ្នកជំនាញរបស់យើងល្អណាស់។
 ដូច្នេះ ប្រហែល​ជា​យើង​អាច​ធ្វើ​អ្វី​មួយ​យ៉ាង​ហោច​ណាស់​ជា​វិជ្ជមាន។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា នៅ Westwood ខ្ញុំធ្វើកិច្ចការជាច្រើនលើការសម្រួលចរាចរណ៍ និងរឿងរកាំរកូស ផ្លូវបត់ និងរង្វង់មូល។
 មនុស្សមួយចំនួនស្អប់ពាក្យ និងបច្ចេកទេសទាំងអស់នេះ ប៉ុន្តែពេលខ្លះមានពាក្យ និងបច្ចេកទេសដែលមានប្រសិទ្ធភាព ដែលយើងអាចបញ្ឈប់ចរាចរណ៍ដោយសុភាព និងទន់ភ្លន់។
 យើងមានឧបករណ៍នៅទីនោះ ហើយយើងនឹងដាក់ពង្រាយក្រុមរបស់យើង ដើម្បីគ្រប់គ្រងពួកគេឱ្យអស់ពីសមត្ថភាព។
 ផ្លូវទីប្រាំបួនគឺជាឯកជនដែលល្អនិងអាក្រក់។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា តាម​បច្ចេកទេស​កាបូប ឬ​កាបូប​នេះ​នឹង​ស្ថិត​នៅ​កណ្តាល​ខ្សែ​កណ្តាល។
 ដូច្នេះត្រូវតែមានការគ្រប់គ្រងឯកជនភាពមួយចំនួន ហើយយើងត្រូវធ្វើការជាមួយអ្នកជិតខាងរបស់យើង ដើម្បីប្រាកដថាអ្នកគ្រប់គ្នានៅលើយន្តហោះ មិនថាមានរឿងអ្វីកើតឡើងនៅផ្ទះ មិនថាមនុស្សចង់បានអ្វីនោះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​មាន​ដំណើរការ​ប្រជាធិបតេយ្យ​ល្អ​នៅ​ទីនេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែប្រហែលជាមានដំណោះស្រាយចំពោះបញ្ហានេះ។
 និយាយឱ្យត្រង់ទៅ ស្ថាបត្យករដែលយើងបានជួយបង្កើតរូបភាពភាគច្រើនគឺស្ថិតនៅលើគណៈកម្មាធិការដឹកនាំនៃនាយកដ្ឋានដឹកជញ្ជូននៃរដ្ឋ Massachusetts ដើម្បីធ្វើការអភិវឌ្ឍឡើងវិញនូវចំនុចប្រសព្វនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះមានភាពស៊ីសង្វាក់គ្នាច្រើន ហើយប្រសិនបើយើងមានសមត្ថភាពក្នុងការទទួលយកមតិកែលម្អនេះ និងមតិកែលម្អមួយចំនួនដែលយើងនឹងទទួលបាន និងសំណួរដែលយើងនឹងពិនិត្យមើលនោះ យើងអាចធ្វើវាបាន។

 កង្វល់ចម្បងគឺថាខ្ញុំរស់នៅក្នុងផ្ទះល្វែង Parkway Plaza South ទល់មុខផ្លូវ 16 ។
 មានមនុស្សច្រើននៅទីនេះ។
 វាពិបាកក្នុងការចុះពីផ្លូវលេខ 9 សព្វថ្ងៃនេះ។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកព្យាយាមធ្វើដំណើរតាមផ្លូវ ចរាចរណ៍នៅលើផ្លូវលេខ 16 និងរង្វង់មូល Wellington គឺគួរឱ្យរន្ធត់ណាស់។
 តាម​គំនិត​ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំ​បារម្ភ​ថា​ការ​សាង​សង់​អគារ​ធំ​នឹង​បង្ក​ឱ្យ​មាន​ការ​កកស្ទះ​មិន​គួរ​ឱ្យ​ជឿ។
 នេះជាកង្វល់ចម្បងរបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 ម្យ៉ាងទៀត ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​គឺ​លីនដា​ដែល​លើក​យក​បញ្ហា​សត្វ​កកេរ​មក​និយាយ។

 ហើយដូចដែល Rick ទើបតែបាននិយាយ តំបន់នេះគឺជាតំបន់ដែលមមាញឹកបំផុតនៅ Medford ។

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយថា ខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាអ្នកវាយតម្លៃទេ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំត្រូវតែស្រមៃថា ការមានអ្នកជិតខាងដែលមានភាពរួសរាយរាក់ទាក់ ថ្នាក់ដំបូងបែបនេះ ក្រៅពីអ្វីដែលវានៅទីនោះ នឹងជួយអ្នក ឬប្រាកដជាមិនប៉ះពាល់ដល់តម្លៃរបស់អ្នក។

 អ្នកបានរៀបរាប់ ខ្ញុំដឹងថាវានៅឆាប់នៅឡើយ ប៉ុន្តែតើអ្នកគិតថាយើងអាចចាប់ផ្តើមនៅពេលណា?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3785.098s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ការ​សាងសង់​គម្រោង​បែប​នេះ​អាច​ចំណាយ​ពេល​ដល់​ទៅ ២.០២៤ ខែ។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយភាគច្រើនអំពីវា។
 អគារ​នេះ​បាន​បញ្ចប់​ហើយ កូនៗ​របស់​យើង​កំពុង​រវល់​នៅ​ខាង​ក្នុង។
 ដូច្នេះ ប៉ុន្តែ បាទ ខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយរឿងពីរក្នុងការបើក និងបំផ្លាញ។ ក្នុងករណីណាក៏ដោយពេលវេលាបច្ចុប្បន្ននៅលើទីផ្សារគឺប្រហែល 2 ឆ្នាំ។
 ចំពោះការសាងសង់នឹងចាប់ផ្តើមនៅពេលណា ខ្ញុំមិនអាចប្រាប់ទីក្រុងថាតើដំណើរការអនុញ្ញាតនឹងចំណាយពេលប៉ុន្មាននោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែជាធម្មតាវាត្រូវចំណាយពេលប្រហែលមួយឆ្នាំដើម្បីទទួលបានការអនុញ្ញាត និងបន្ទាប់មកពី 6 ទៅ 9 ខែទៀតសម្រាប់ការរចនា និងវិស្វកម្ម។
 ដូច្នេះ ដរាបណា​យើង​អាច​បន្ត​ទៅ​មុខ​ទៀត នោះ​គឺ​ជា​ផ្លូវ​ចេញ​ដ៏​ល្អ​មួយ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3836.325s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: សូមអរគុណ
 ចុះ​បើ​មាន​ការ​រំខាន​ពី​អគារ​ក្បែរ​នោះ?
 ដូចយើងធ្វើដែរ កំឡុងពេលសាងសង់ ឬអ្នកដឹងទេថា បន្ទាប់ពីការសាងសង់រួចរាល់។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3849.11s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ប្រាកដ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងនឹងចាប់ផ្តើម យើងនឹងពិនិត្យមើលអគារទាំងអស់នៅជុំវិញយើង ហើយត្រូវប្រាកដថាពួកវាមានរចនាសម្ព័ន្ធល្អ និងនៅដដែល មុនពេលយើងធ្វើអ្វីមួយ។
 វាពិតជាការងារលំបាកណាស់។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​សព្វ​ថ្ងៃ​នេះ អគារ​ទាំង​អស់​នេះ​ត្រូវ​បាន​សាង​សង់​ដោយ​ប្រើ​ស្ទូច​កណ្តាល។
 ដូច្នេះ​ជា​ទូទៅ អ្វីៗ​ត្រូវ​បាន​បង្កើត​ឡើង​ពី​ខាងក្នុង​មក​ក្រៅ។
 បន្ទាប់មក
 បើនិយាយពីផលប៉ះពាល់លើអគារជុំវិញយើង យើងកំពុងសិក្សាពីចំណុចនេះនៅតាមទីក្រុងជាច្រើន កន្លែងតូចៗបែបនេះ ជារឿយៗនៅជិតតំបន់លំនៅដ្ឋាន។
 ដូច្នេះ​គំនិត​គឺ​ថា​យើង​សង់​របង​ខ្ពស់​ស្អាត​ចេញ​ពី​សំណាញ់​ស្រអាប់ ដូច្នេះ​អ្នក​មិន​ចាំបាច់​ឃើញ​អ្វី​ច្រើន​នៃ​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​នៅ​ខាងក្រោយ​ឆាក។
 ជាសំណាងល្អ សំណង់ប្រភេទនេះមិនមែនជាដំណើរការសាងសង់ដែលរំខានខ្លាំងនោះទេ។
 យើងពិតជានឹងធ្វើការជាមួយទីក្រុង និងមនុស្សដូចអ្នកនៅក្នុងសវនាការសាធារណៈ ដើម្បីពិភាក្សាអំពីពេលវេលាសមស្រប និងអ្វីៗដូចនោះ។
 យើងនឹងមិនរំខានអ្នកទេ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3917.32s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: សូមអរគុណ
 យើង​ពិតជា​កោតសរសើរ​ចំពោះ​ឱកាស​ដើម្បី​និយាយ​ណាស់ ព្រោះ​វា​ពិតជា​មាន​ប្រយោជន៍​។
 សំនួរចុងក្រោយ មានអាផាតមិនជាង 260 ជាន់ 5 ជាន់ គ្រាន់តែចង់ដឹងទេ តើអាផាតមិនមធ្យមមានទំហំប៉ុនណា?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3931.2s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: គ្រាន់តែក្អួតប្រហែល 920 ។
 ជំពូក 945
 ដូច្នេះ យើងគិតថាការរួបរួមគឺជាគំនិតពិបាកយល់ ដូច្នេះហើយយើងរកឃើញនូវអារម្មណ៍នៃភាពរួបរួមគ្នានៅក្នុងប្រអប់ពណ៌ទឹកក្រូចដ៏ធំនោះ។
 យើងគិតថាអ្វីដែលសំខាន់បំផុតនៅទីនេះគឺការសរសេរកម្មវិធីស៊េរីនៃផលិតផល។
 Medford មានភាពចម្រុះក្នុងវិស័យជាច្រើនដូចជា កម្រិតប្រាក់ចំណូល កម្រិតអប់រំ ប្រភេទការងារ និងជម្រើសដឹកជញ្ជូន។
 ដូច្នេះបរិមាណឧបករណ៍ដែលយើងចាត់ទុកថាសមរម្យសម្រាប់ស្ទូឌីយោហើយគ្រែតូចនឹងមានតិចជាង។
 មនុស្សទាំងនេះច្រើនតែជាអ្នកជួលអាជីពដំបូងរបស់យើង ដែលមិនទាន់រៀបការជាមួយកូនស្រី ឬកូនប្រុស ហើយកំពុងសម្លឹងឆ្ពោះទៅរកដំណាក់កាលទីពីរនៃអាជីពរបស់ពួកគេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ជា​ទីផ្សារ​ខ្លាំង​ជា​រៀង​រាល់​ត្រីមាស។
 វាហាក់ដូចជាអ្នកនៅលីវ និងបន្តអាជីពរបស់អ្នក ឬប្រហែលជាយឺតជាងនេះបន្តិច ដោយសារអ្នកនៅតែធ្វើការងារទីមួយ ឬទីពីររបស់អ្នក ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកបានរៀបការ និងមានមិត្តស្រី ឬមិត្តប្រុស។
 អ្នកចូលចិត្តវា។
 ដូច្នេះក្នុងការស្វែងរកថ្មីៗបំផុតរបស់យើង យើងគិតថាពិតជាមានបន្ទប់សម្រាប់អាផាតមិនពីរបន្ទប់គេង និងគុណភាពខ្ពស់ ប៉ុន្តែនៅពេលយើងបន្តរកមើល វាមានតិចជាងយើងគិតបន្តិច។
 សូមអរគុណ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងត្រូវបន្តព្យាយាមស្វែងរកទីផ្សារចម្រុះដើម្បីបម្រើ Medford ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4018.142s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: សូមអរគុណ
 ខ្ញុំចង់សួរប្រធានក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលរបស់យើង។
 គាត់ចង់ឱ្យខ្ញុំសួរគាត់ថា</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4024.407s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: បាទ/ចាស៎ ខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើអ្នកអាចវាយតម្លៃរចនាសម្ព័ន្ធអគារមុននឹងចាប់ផ្តើមសាងសង់ដែរឬទេ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4030.666s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: តើអ្នកអាចលឺបានទេ?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4032.069s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ជាការប្រសើរណាស់, យើងមិនបានទៅឆ្ងាយនៅក្នុងការស្វែងរករបស់យើង, នៅក្នុងការស្វែងរករបស់យើង។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំមិនគិតថាយើងត្រូវការទេ អ្នកដឹងដូចជា យើងមិនអាចបើកបរ ខ្ញុំមិនគិតថាយើងត្រូវការភាគហ៊ុន ឬអ្វីដូចនោះទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែជាធម្មតា ប្រសិនបើមានការរំខានធំខ្លះនៅលើគេហទំព័រ ប្រសិនបើយើងកំពុងជីករណ្តៅ ឬគំនរសំរាម ឬប្រសិនបើយើងកំពុងធ្វើការវិភាគរញ្ជួយដីនៅគ្រប់ផ្នែកទាំងអស់ យើងនឹងជួលក្រុមហ៊ុនដែលមានជំនាញក្នុងនោះ។
 ជាពិសេសនៅពេលដែលអ្នកនៅជិតអគារផ្សេងទៀត។
 យើងកំពុងធ្វើគម្រោងមួយនៅ Waltham ចម្ងាយប្រហែល 12 ហ្វីតពីអ្នកជិតខាងមួយចំនួន។
 ដូច្នេះ អ្នកដឹងទេថា យើងប្រើប្រាស់ឧបករណ៍វាស់ស្ទង់រញ្ជួយដី និងឧបករណ៍បច្ចេកវិទ្យាខ្ពស់គ្រប់ប្រភេទ ដើម្បីប្រាកដថាយើងមិនធ្វើអ្វីខុសចំពោះអ្នកជិតខាងរបស់យើង។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4078.827s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: សូមអរគុណ
 អ្នកផ្សេងទៀតចង់បានការបញ្ជាក់ថាអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងត្រូវបានបង្រួបបង្រួមហើយអាជីវកម្មមិនត្រូវបានបែងចែកទេ។
 ហាងលក់រាយដូចជា Starbucks ឬអ្នកស្គាល់ជាដើម។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4089.758s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: មែនហើយ យើងមានសំណួរល្អ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងកំពុងសម្លឹងមើលស្ថានីយឆ្លងកាត់ផ្លូវ ហើយយើងគិតថាយើងប្រហែលជាចង់មើលការប្រើប្រាស់ពាណិជ្ជកម្មបន្ថែមទៀតនៅជាន់ទីមួយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​អ្នក​ដឹង​ទេ បញ្ហា​ចរាចរណ៍​ដែល​លើក​ឡើង​នៅ​យប់​នេះ គឺជា​រឿង​មួយ​ដែល​យើង​សង្ឃឹម​ដោយ​ស្មោះ។
 ខ្ញុំផ្ទាល់បានមើលការប្រជុំមួយចំនួនជាមួយ MassDOT និងរបៀបដែលពួកគេកំណត់ផ្លូវបំបែកនេះ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ចរាចរណ៍បន្ថែមនឹងរងផលប៉ះពាល់
 យើងជឿថាអ្វីដែលទាក់ទងនឹងចរាចរណ៍បន្ថែម និងផលប៉ះពាល់ពេលវេលាលើការលក់នឹងមានភាពអវិជ្ជមានដល់កម្រិតដែលពួកគេអាចមានផលប៉ះពាល់អវិជ្ជមានមកលើយើង។
 រឿងមួយទៀតដែលយើងកំពុងធ្វើការគឺតម្រូវការខ្ពស់។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ប្រសិនបើកន្លែងលក់រាយល្អ ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែអាចនិយាយបានថា សង្ឃឹមថាការលក់រាយនៅក្នុងតំបន់នោះនឹងកាន់តែដូចកន្លែងលក់រាយនៅចំណតផ្លូវ។
 ជាឧទាហរណ៍ រហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះ អ្នកមិនអាចជួលកន្លែងនៅ Starbucks បានទេ ប្រសិនបើវាមិនមែនជាសេវាកម្មខ្លួនឯង។
 ក៏មានហាងលក់រាយជាច្រើន រួមទាំងហាងកាហ្វេផ្សេងទៀត ដែលធ្វើដំណើរតាមផ្លូវនេះ។
 ប្រភេទ​ហាង​កាហ្វេ ឬ​ហាង​កាហ្វេ​មួយ​ចំនួន​ហាក់​ដូច​ជា​ស័ក្តិសម​នឹង​កន្លែង។
 ដោយពិចារណាលើចំណុចទាំងអស់នេះ និងផលប៉ះពាល់លើចរាចរណ៍ យើងបានសម្រេចចិត្តលុបចោលផ្នែកនៃគំនិតនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះវាមានតម្លៃក្នុងការពិភាក្សាបន្ថែមទៀត ប៉ុន្តែនិយាយដោយត្រង់ទៅ ពីទិដ្ឋភាពចរាចរណ៍ និងផលប៉ះពាល់ វានឹងកាន់តែអាក្រក់សម្រាប់សហគមន៍ និងទីតាំង។
 រឿងចុងក្រោយគឺថា ប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនធ្វើវាឱ្យល្អឥតខ្ចោះទេ អាជីវកម្មនឹងមិនអាចជួលអ្នកបានទេ។
 បើ​ដឹង​ទោះ​តិច​ក៏​យើង​នៅ​តែ​សម្រេច​លក់​ក្នុង​តម្លៃ​ថោក​ជាង​ទីផ្សារ។
 តាមទស្សនៈនៃការធ្វើផែនការទីក្រុង កន្លែងទំនេរ និងការរិចរិលគឺជាបញ្ហាពិតដែលមានផលវិបាកអវិជ្ជមានគ្រប់ប្រភេទ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំរីករាយដែលអ្នកបានសួរសំណួរនេះ ពីព្រោះយើងបានចំណាយពេលច្រើនក្នុងការស្រាវជ្រាវ និងពិភាក្សាវា ដែលជាមូលហេតុដែលយើងនិយាយតែអំពីលំនៅដ្ឋាន និងការប្រើប្រាស់ពាក់ព័ន្ធប៉ុណ្ណោះ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4209.242s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: សួស្តី ខ្ញុំឈ្មោះហ្សេន។
 ខ្ញុំមានសំណួរមួយទៀត។
 អ្នកបាននិយាយថានឹងមានចំណតសម្រាប់ឡានមួយក្នុងមួយគ្រឿង។
 បច្ចុប្បន្ននេះ យូនីតច្រើន ឬច្រើនមានរថយន្តពីរ ដូច្នេះមិនមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តនៅក្នុងតំបន់នេះទេ។
 តើអ្នកនឹងធ្វើអ្វី?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4227.406s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: រឿងពីរ។
 មួយគឺថាខ្ញុំមិនយល់ស្របនឹងទស្សនៈរបស់អ្នក។
 អ្នករស់នៅរបស់យើងភាគច្រើនមិនប្រើប្រាស់រថយន្តនៅផ្ទះ ឬសូម្បីតែនៅក្នុងតំបន់លំនៅដ្ឋាន ដោយសារស្តុកលំនៅដ្ឋានរបស់យើងកាន់តែធំ ហើយប្រជាជនរបស់យើងកាន់តែចាស់ និងមិនសូវមានជំនាញ។
 យើង​មិន​នៅ​ត្រង់​ចំណុច​ដែល​យើង​មាន​រថយន្ត​ជា​មធ្យម​២​គ្រឿង​ក្នុង​មួយ​គ្រឿង​នោះ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែទោះជាខ្ញុំខុសក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំនឹងប្រាប់អ្នកនូវរឿងមួយ ខ្ញុំនឹងដាក់ប្រាក់របស់ខ្ញុំនៅឯណា មាត់របស់ខ្ញុំ និងកន្លែងដែលយើងយកគម្រោងនេះ និងគម្រោងផ្សេងទៀត។
 ជាការពិតណាស់យើង
 យើង​បារម្ភ​ថា​មាន​អ្នក​ណា​ម្នាក់​ចត​នៅ​តាម​ផ្លូវ​ក្នុង​តំបន់​ដែល​មាន​បញ្ហា ជាពិសេស​ផ្លូវ​លេខ ៩ ក្នុង​ករណី​នេះ។
 យើង​អាច​បង្កើត​ឃ្លា​សាមញ្ញ​មួយ​ដែល​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​វា​ខុស​ច្បាប់​សម្រាប់​អ្នក​រស់​នៅ​ក្នុង​ការ​ចត​នៅ​ក្រៅ​កន្លែង និង​កាតព្វកិច្ច​ឱ្យ​ពួក​គេ​ធ្វើ​ដូច្នេះ​តាម​កិច្ច​សន្យា។
 ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើរឿងនេះពីមុនមក។
 នេះជារឿងងាយស្រួលធ្វើណាស់។
 ប្រសិនបើវាជាអ្វីមួយដែលសហគមន៍ ឬទីក្រុងចាត់ទុកថាសំខាន់ យើងអាចកំណត់វាបានជាមួយនឹងវិធានការណ៍ខ្លាំងដូចគ្នា។
 ទេ ខ្ញុំមិនគិតដូច្នេះទេ ខ្ញុំគិតថា អូគឺស្រួលណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាដៃគូប្រកួតប្រជែងរបស់យើងអាចកាត់បន្ថយចំនួននេះមកត្រឹម 0.75 ក្នុងមួយឡាន ឬក្នុងមួយឡាន ឬ 0.85 ក្នុងមួយឡាន។
 និយាយតាមត្រង់ទៅ ខ្ញុំគិតថា ការដាក់តំបន់របស់ Medford គឺមានភាពជឿនលឿនគួរសមក្នុងរឿងនេះ។
 ពួកគេមិនអាចទេ ជាក់ស្តែងពួកគេបានធ្វើការស្រាវជ្រាវមួយចំនួន ពីព្រោះយើងធ្វើដូច្នេះគ្រប់ពេល ហើយការវិភាគនេះមិនអាចជាការចៃដន្យនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេដឹងពីអ្វីដែលអតិថិជននេះកំពុងធ្វើ។
 ដូច្នេះ អូ អូ
 នៅក្នុងទីក្រុងដូចជា Cambridge ខ្ញុំត្រូវចតតិចជាងមុន។
 ពួកគេបានលើកទឹកចិត្តខ្ញុំឱ្យទៅកន្លែងផ្សេងទៀត។
 យើងមានការស្រាវជ្រាវជាច្រើនលើបញ្ហានេះ។
 តាមទស្សនៈអាជីវកម្ម យើងដឹងពីអ្វីដែលយើងត្រូវការ។
 ប្រសិនបើយើងមិនមានចំណតរថយន្តគ្រប់គ្រាន់សម្រាប់អតិថិជនទេ ពួកគេនឹងមិនជួលចំណតរថយន្តពីយើងទេ។
 ដូច្នេះរឿងចុងក្រោយដែលខ្ញុំចង់ធ្វើគឺដាក់កម្រិតការចតឡានដោយមិនចាំបាច់ ព្រោះវានឹងប៉ះពាល់ដល់អាជីវកម្មរបស់យើង។
 តែ​បើ​អ្នក​មិន​ជឿ ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ដាក់​កំហិត​អ្នក​ដោយ​លុយ​ខ្ញុំ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4346.218s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: សូមអភ័យទោស ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែមានសំណួរចុងក្រោយមួយ។

 យើងពូកែដោះស្រាយបញ្ហាទាំងអស់នេះដូចអ្នកណាក៏ដោយ ដូច្នេះយើងចង់ក្លាយជាអ្នកជិតខាងល្អ ហើយយើងសាងសង់ផ្ទះ ហើយអ្នកដឹងទេ វាមិនមែនជាមន្ទីរពិសោធន៍សម្រាប់សាងសង់ហាងលក់រាយ ឬគ្មានអ្វីខុសជាមួយយើងសាងសង់កន្លែងដែលយើងចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាមនុស្សពិតជាចង់ស្នាក់នៅ និងរីករាយនឹងកន្លែងដែលអ្នកស្រលាញ់។
 ដូច្នេះ សូមអរគុណសម្រាប់ការគាំទ្រ និងអនុញ្ញាតឱ្យពួកយើងដឹងថា មានបញ្ហាអ្វីផ្សេងទៀតដែលត្រូវបានខកខាន ហើយប្រហែលជាយើងនឹងមានឱកាសចុងក្រោយដើម្បីពិនិត្យមើលពួកគេ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4912.428s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: មានចម្ងល់អំពីការសាងសង់ ដែលរថយន្តសំណង់នឹងចតកំឡុងពេលសាងសង់ ហើយថាតើចំណតរថយន្តនៅលើផ្លូវលេខ 9 នឹងត្រូវបាត់បង់ដោយសារការដាក់បំពង់ពន្លត់អគ្គីភ័យដែរឬទេ។
 ឧបករណ៍ពន្លត់អគ្គីភ័យ។ល។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4928.465s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយថាប្រហែលជាមិនមែនទេ។
 វាពិតជាអាស្រ័យលើនាយកដ្ឋានពន្លត់អគ្គីភ័យ ប៉ុន្តែនៅក្នុងអគារបែបនេះ យើងនឹងមានការភ្ជាប់ទុយោជាច្រើននៅខាងក្នុងអាគារ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​មាន​ន័យ​ថា ប្រសិន​បើ​ប្រធាន​ពន្លត់​អគ្គិភ័យ​ចង់​បាន​បំពង់​ពន្លត់​អគ្គិភ័យ គាត់​ប្រាកដ​ជា​ធ្វើ​បែប​នេះ ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា វា​មិន​ប៉ះ​ពាល់​ដល់​ចំណត​រថយន្ត​ណា​មួយ​ទេ​ប្រសិន​បើ​មាន​ករណី​នោះ។
 ដូច្នេះ សំណួរទី១ សំណួរមុនអំពីចំណតយានជំនិះសំណង់ ដែលជាបញ្ហាធំ ជាពិសេសការដ្ឋានសំណង់ គឺជាចម្លើយខ្លី។
 អ្នកដឹងទេនៅពេលដែលយើង
 សូមអភ័យទោស នៅពេលដែលយើងឈានចូលដល់ដំណាក់កាលសាងសង់ យើងត្រូវធ្វើការសិក្សាផ្នែកភស្តុភារ សិក្សាការងារ ហើយខ្ញុំជឿថា ការងារទាំងអស់ដែលយើងធ្វើក្នុងការសាងសង់សព្វថ្ងៃនេះ អ្នកម៉ៅការរបស់យើងកំពុងប្រើប្រាស់ចំណតរថយន្តនៅក្រៅកន្លែង ដូច្នេះយើងកំពុងធ្វើវាសម្រាប់អ្នករាល់គ្នា។
 ដូច្នេះ​បើ​មាន​ការ​ព្រួយ​បារម្ភ​ថា​គេ​នឹង​ចាប់​ផ្តើម​បិទ​ផ្លូវ​លេខ​ប្រាំបួន ចម្លើយ​គឺ​ទេ សូម​នៅ​ឲ្យ​ឆ្ងាយ​ពី​កូន​ចៅ​យើង។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4982.985s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: ហើយ​បន្ទាប់​មក​មាន​សំណួរ​សួរ​ថា តើ​អ្នក​ជិត​ខាង​ដឹង​ថា​អ្នក​នឹង​បន្ត​ឬ​អត់? ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា ទាំង​នេះ​នឹង​ជា​សវនាការ​សាធារណៈ។
 ប្រសិនបើមានតែនេះអាចសម្រេចបាន។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំគិតថាជំហានបន្ទាប់គឺដើម្បីកំណត់ថាវាជាអ្វី។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4998.898s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: បាទ ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​និយាយ​ថា ប្រហែល​មិន​ដល់​ថ្ងៃ​ឈប់​សម្រាក​ទេ បើ​យើង​បន្ត​ទៅ។
 យើងបានប្រើរចនាសម្ព័ន្ធការជូនដំណឹងដូចគ្នា ដើម្បីជូនដំណឹងដល់ភាគីជិតខាងនៅក្នុងកិច្ចប្រជុំនេះថា យើងនឹងប្រើប្រាស់នៅក្នុងការប្រជុំ ឬសវនាការសាធារណៈផ្សេងទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះ ចម្លើយខ្លីគឺ៖ ខ្ញុំគិតថាពួកគេប្រហែលជាមើលទៅដូចនេះ។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកបន្ត យើងនឹងឃើញអ្វីមួយនៅក្នុងប្រអប់សំបុត្ររបស់អ្នក។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=5023.622s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: នេះបញ្ចប់ការប្រជុំ។ សូមជូនពរអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នាជួបតែសេចក្តីសុខ សុវត្ថិភាព និងថែរក្សាខ្លួនអ្នកក្នុងឱកាសបុណ្យភ្ជុំបិណ្ឌ។ អរគុណអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នាសម្រាប់ការស្តាប់។
 សូមអរគុណ</p>
