    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=0.091s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Bonswa tout moun.
 Kathleen pa manyen biwo nou yo.
 Mwen la aswè a.
 Li sanble ke li fini pou Julian, CEO nan yon konpayi rezidansyèl alyans nan New England.
 ak Matthew Harrity, manadjè devlopman alyans rezidansyèl yo.
 Premyèman, nou ta renmen remèsye tout moun paske yo te patisipe nan reyinyon kominotè sa a konsènan posib re-devlopman pwopriyete ki sitiye nan 5.73 Bells Way, ki se Cappies Liquor Store nan 20 Revere Beach Park Way Monroe Muffler Break.
 Objektif reyinyon sa a se prezante pwojè a ki nan faz preliminè 19 kòmantè nou menm, moun ki abite nan katye a.
 Nou antisipe prezantasyon an.
 Apeprè 15 a 20 minit apre prezantasyon an pral gen yon opòtinite pou kesyon ak kòmantè. Nou’n allocate apepre inerdtan pou sa meeting.
 An tèm de règ jeneral yo.
 Mwen mande w pou w rete an silans jiskaske yo mande w pou w pale.
 Anplis de poze kesyon ak gwoup la.
 Ou ka poze kesyon ou yo ak kòmantè yo tou nan chat la, epi nou pral diskite sou yo nan dènye senk a 10 minit reyinyon an.
 Mwen mande w pou evite voye mesaj prive dirèk, jis paske li difisil pou kowòdone chat ak kontwole yon mesaj prive.
 Se konsa, si ou gen nenpòt kesyon, ou ka poste yo nan chat gwoup la epi nou pral gade nan yo.
 Epi ak sa, mwen pral remèt prezantasyon an bay Mike Bajulian, PDG Alliance Residential.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=90.257s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Tout se byen.
 Mèsi, Kathy.
 Bonswa tout moun.
 Kòm Kathy mansyone, non mwen se Mike Bejulian.
 Mwen se patnè rejyonal pou Alliance Residential Company nan New England.
 Nou se yon konpayi konstriksyon miltifanmi nan tout peyi a.
 Sepandan, nou jere chak rejyon nòmalman tankou si se te pwòp operasyon pa yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=112.722s">[Unidentified]</a>: Kite l ale kounye a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=113.903s">[Maria D'Orsi]</a>: Anrejistreman an ap fèt.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=117.704s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 对不起。
 Nenpòt fason, nou dirije konpayi nou an nan chak divizyon.
 Kidonk, pandan nou se yon gwoup nasyonal ki gen katye jeneral nan Phoenix, biwo nou yo nan 184 High Street nan Boston.
 Mwen te fèt, mwen te grandi epi mwen toujou ap viv nan Arlington.
 Epi tout ekip nou an sitiye isit la nan Boston.
 Se konsa, si ou pa gen pwoblèm, kenbe mikwofòn la muet pou nou ka jwenn kèk entèferans.
 Aswè a nou la pou nou pale de yon posib redevlopman 2 lot nan Medford.
 Mon oule met lanfaz ki nou pa selman later ki pe ganny kontrate aktyelman e nou annan en peryod letid kot nou pe evalye fezabilite pou en posib rekalifikasyon sa bann later.
 Onètman, sa a se yon ti kras pi bonè ke nou ta nòmalman fè yon reyinyon katye nan kalite sa a.
 Nòmalman nou ta ale yon ti kras pi lwen nan pwosesis la.
 epi li gen yon ti kras pi bon detay.
 Mwen panse ke nou gen kèk bon repons ak kèk bon pwen pou pale avèk ou aswè a.
 Men, pou nou klè, materyèl sa a pa fè pati yon aplikasyon fòmèl, e nou poko fòmèlman devan okenn konsèy vil oswa konsèy vil pou konsidere pwojè sa a.
 Se konsa, ankò, mwen jis mande pou pasyans ou.
 Sa a se materyèl preliminè.
 Nou ka pa gen tout repons pou kesyon ou yo.
 Nou ka pwobableman pale ak yo nan anpil detay.
 Epi se poutèt sa nou kontan fè yon Q&A avèk ou.
 Pandan mwa kap vini an oswa konsa, nou pral konplete peryòd etid nou an pou pwojè a.
 Se konsa, li se pwobableman pa sipriz ke mond lan ak ekonomi li yo nan yon ti kras nan flux kounye a.
 N ap mache ak anpil atansyon pou asire nou pa fè erè pandan n ap navige nan moman boulvèse sa yo.
 Èske mwen ka prepare prezantasyon an pou ou?
 Nan kèk moman mwen pral pataje ekran mwen an epi montre kèk nan konsèp nou devlope, kote ak kontèks sit la ak lòt bagay.
 Kòm Kathy mansyone, santi yo lib pou prepare nenpòt kesyon ou genyen sou pwojè a nan chat la Zoom.
 我们正在记录这一点。
 Nou pral gade nan sa a nan fen epi eseye reponn tout kesyon yo pi byen nan kapasite nou an.
 Avèk sa, mwen pral eseye pataje ekran mwen an.
 请耐心听我说。
 我不太用 Zoom。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=265.599s">[Unidentified]</a>: OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=280.245s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  So these first slides we're going to start with are really just to get you acclimated with the neighborhood.
 I know that sounds silly because many of you live in the immediate area.
 However, we want to just make sure we all get started on the same page and talk about a little bit about the context for where we started our studies and conceptual program for the site.
 So the first one here is, of course, this is East Medford.
 Route 16 runs right across the page left to right.
 And the Fellsway and Middlesex Avenue run north to south.
 The taped site in yellow is the assembled parcels.
 Cappy's is the larger sort of hexagonal building.
 And Monroe Muffler is here on the east side on the property line.
 So the combined site,
 which again are 573 Fellsway, which is Cappy's Liquors, and 20 Revere Beach Parkway just to the east is the Monroe Muffler Shop.
 You'll see to the south here, Station Landing, the Mystic River Reservation off to the southwest, and the shopping centers up to the northwest.
 Of course, Wellington Station is at about 430 on your page.
 We've got a few axios here to show the immediate neighborhood.
 Again, these are really just to kind of show context of how the site fits in with the larger areas.
 We've turned the camera a bit on you.
 So, Route 16 or Revere Beach Parkway is running off to the east towards the top of Page and the Fellsway down to the right and Middlesex Avenue and the Fellsway up to the left.
 Cappy's there is just left of center.
 So obviously the neighborhood really is, you know, primarily seven and eight-story mixed-use buildings, quite a bit of housing in high-rise format.
 And you'll see Wellington just off top right of page.
 We'll flip the camera a bit here and looking southeast now, Cappies again just left of center, Route 16 traveling up and to the left of your screen, and station landing off across, southerly across Route 16 there.
 So looking at these photos, we like this site in the city for a lot of reasons.
 Medford's a great city.
 It features anything a modern resident would want, which is, of course, our business.
 The city is close to Boston, which in itself is always attractive.
 But really, it already has its own deep bench of employment of retail of walkability open space and history so all of those things stitched together to where, where, where our customers would want to live, they want to be close to home, they want to be able to walk to amenities, you know, nobody really wants to be in their car.
 And we've spent some time studying this intersection.
 Growing up in Arlington, I know this intersection well.
 So getting out of your car in this neighborhood is certainly an attractive thing, and Medford offers the ability to do that.
 And this site is really a microcosm more broadly of Medford, having all of those things I just mentioned within sometimes less than 1,000 feet of walking.
 Macro as a Bostonian, this is the type of modern housing I think greater Boston needs and regionally we need in eastern Massachusetts, where people even in cold weather aren't required to get into their vehicle to get a coffee to travel to work to pick up a prescription or to go get a classic roast beef at Kelly's across the street.
 So
 I'm going to move into some site photographs.
 I'm sure you guys are all relatively familiar with this, but I feel like we just want to be thorough.
 So this is a shot looking north of Cappy's, somewhat northeast, with 9th Street just in the back.
 You'll see a blue double two-story home on the left side of the screen with a garage.
 That is the 9th Street area.
 Monroe is just off to the right of your screen.
 This is a shot from Revere Beach Parkway on one of the many curb cuts on these two parcels.
 So we're looking straight north across the property line between Monroe and the Cappy site.
 This is a shot from 9th Street looking south.
 So Station Landing is in the background.
 Monroe is on just left of center and Cappy's, the back of Cappy's is just right of center.
 So you're looking at the intersection basically concealed only by the Cappy's.
 And then this is also a 9th Street shot looking the other direction.
 So you can see Boston Tattoo here in the background and the 9th Street intersection, current intersection and curb cut with Cappy's.
 So this last is an obvious satellite image of the site.
 We've oriented this North and South so we can stop getting you guys dizzy.
 9th Street runs East and West across the top of the site.
 This is Middlesex Avenue on the left, and again, Route 16 on the bottom.
 The property isn't taped, but it is this L-shaped combination of these two parcels, not including the Boston Tattoo Company.
 This is a good start to show where the site planning begins for us, apart from the macro context of the area and the uses that are here and the amenities.
 This is really where we start trying to integrate and stitch those things together into a program.
 On the left and on the south of the site, we're bound by these two roads or parkways.
 These were
 These are actually very interesting if you don't know the history, but these were formerly, like many parkways in greater Boston, were run by the MDC, now DCR.
 The spirit of these roads was effectively, as we were becoming an automobile-focused society, to have a pleasure-driving avenue to explore the area's benefits.
 So you, I'm sure, are all familiar with the Middlesex Bells.
 and the Mystic River reservations.
 These are really just spectacular green spaces, and the former MDC knew that, and they knew that they wanted people to experience those in a pleasurable way.
 So on the south side of the site, you'll see there's a pretty deep, for an urban zone like this, a pretty deep setback with mature trees and paths.
 Believe it or not, there's actually a deed restriction on these sites that allows the parkways to remain what their original intent was.
 So while we might not be putting around in a 57 Chevrolet enjoying the Mystic River Reservation here today,
 I drive on at least three parkways on the way to work every day.
 These are commuter roads now.
 But there's still an opportunity here, we think, to maintain the spirit of what these parkways were initially for.
 And one thing we found interesting was that on the west side of this site, along the Middlesex Avenue, it's paved right to the sidewalk.
 and there so those setbacks and deed notes actually exist there as well and so one of the things we thought might be attractive and seems to mate with some of the intersection plans being discussed is is an ability to use that even though it is on this property rather than leave it as asphalt is to try and continue that parkway um parkway spirit the paths put mature trees and native plantings there and the like um so
 We think restoring that buffer could be a real opportunity.
 So I'm going to move to the next shot.
 This is an actual concept we're working with.
 And it's roughly centered on the page as this is.
 So again, you'll see the, well, mislabeled Fellsway.
 That's technically Middlesex, of course, but Revere Beach Parkway on the bottom.
 And you'll see how we're looking at really adding back into those buffer zones, as I mentioned before, some of the green spaces.
 A number of other things worth highlighting as we get into this we're going to show you some more details on on how we program space conceptually.
 This community's proposed at 265 units of rental housing, we do not build condominiums in an eight story format with 100% of the resident parking enclosed within the building so.
 A lot of the surface parking areas that are on the perimeter of the area and nearby sites, we're going to instead work to green those up and bring the parking inside the envelope completely.
 We'll talk a little more about the rest of the program.
 But to get you started, effectively, we craft these communities so that they are a completely enclosed community.
 And so by that I mean, while this looks like a pretty normal building,
 from the outside, all of our building systems are located internally.
 So, trash, refuse collection and recycling, separation, emergency services and access, all of our amenities, or most of the amenities, I should say, that are internal to the site.
 Everything is neatly encapsulated within the envelope of the building we propose here.
 So, you'll see on the site, there's donut shape is primarily the mass of the building.
 However, there is a hole in the middle and we'll use that courtyard to have some outdoor private space for residents.
 That's a little more private than perhaps walking across the street to the mystic river.
 But typically, and we'll show you some photos of how we treat these spaces.
 But these spaces typically have a large pool deck, sort of resort styled.
 We'll have outdoor cooking areas, lounges and cabanas and that sort of thing.
 A space where, you know, to kind of center the entire community around.
 On the upper left of the page, you'll note we've got a curb cut proposed here off of Middlesex.
 And in fact, to expand on that, the site currently features five curb cuts.
 And I'm sure we'll spend a lot of time talking about traffic and parking here.
 But the big story here is we're going to try and eliminate all of those curb cuts but one.
 We have not engaged a traffic engineer at this time.
 However, we've done enough of these to know that on a busy intersection like this, particularly one that's in flux for its future, that the less interruption and the less curb cuts that you're delivering traffic onto, the better.
 Excuse me.
 So our goal here would be to eliminate as many of those curb cuts in this planet, four of the five would be would be removed from the site.
 Inside the garage, so residents will drive into the building here, just above where it says loading, and there'll be three levels of parking.
 So the first three levels of the program would all be structured parking and other building services, and then all of the housing, but for a very few units, would be located on floors four and above.
 So we're gonna dig into the building here a little bit.
 This would be the first level if you were to just shave everything on floors two through eight off.
 And so as you arrive, you'll see the only surface parking we're proposing is just at the amenity area.
 That's also where we would have our 24-hour leasing and staff located.
 So future residents might use these spaces if they were to come look at a home or to check out the community.
 So that that sort of area all on the west side labeled as amenity would be a two story volume focused on the leasing and then a number of different amenities, which we'll talk a little bit about later.
 but primarily work from home type spaces, screening rooms, flex spaces.
 And we'll show you some of the other examples of what we do for fun in those spaces.
 So those would be separated from the garage element.
 The next two levels above this would also be parking served by internal ramps.
 So invisible to the outside.
 This would be an upper garage.
 parking floor like two or three you'll note that now above the common program area will add some homes and there'll be some again on the south side until we get to the upper residential floors, such as this where it'll be all housing on force for and above.
 So we'll also in these upper floors probably have some amenities.
 We're finding that most surprising amount of people are not going back to the office.
 And so the flex time and work from home spaces are becoming an important part of our business.
 So while some people may go to work, the typical customer here is working in a high tech or an R&D type
 And those have, you know, non traditional non nine to five types of hours.
 So we're now building our amenities to make those spaces more pleasurable and make your sort of to help you separate work from home, even when you are near home, as you would be in this.
 So we've added some, these shots are what we call axiometrics.
 These shots were created with the intent to kind of stitch what we're proposing into the neighborhood.
 So you'll notice, like most of the buildings around here, this is also eight stories.
 I think one of the station landing buildings up front is seven.
 but you'll see we're looking to pull things back off of the parkways and contribute back to what that sort of original mission was for those roadways and also just give this a little bit of a softer edge on what is a very hard-edged zone.
 So this we've also picked these spaces to
 try to relate to the aerial views we showed you earlier.
 So where we were showing you a photo very similar to this of the Cappies and Monroe site to show you how this would stitch into those with the massing around it.
 Now, this is a shot looking south, excuse me, southeast.
 So Ninth Street would be just in front of the building here in your view and the Middlesex Avenue and the Fells Way coming basically straight up the page on the right side.
 station landings here in the back.
 We're proposing a lot of verticality.
 This is what we'd call a Vitruvian style building.
 It's very classic.
 We're not sure this is the space based on what's around it.
 There's a lot of brick.
 There's a lot of sort of traditional materials.
 Station landing is a relatively classic and timeless architecture.
 So we didn't feel it was appropriate to use some of the real contemporary modern looks.
 for this space.
 So we stuck with some pretty classic verticality and spacing and dimensions to the building.
 To help you stay oriented, this was the small little future resident parking area, and the garage entry would be right here.
 And again, these first three levels, despite the fact that they look traditional with windows and the like, would actually be just the same cladding, just enclosing the parking structure.
 So this is a similar angle to the one we just showed you just brought down from from the seagull residents of Medford's viewpoint to get you down to a more pedestrian scale.
 Again this is where those future resident spots in the curb cut on the middle section might be and a garage parking entrance here if you can see my cursor moving.
 So
 This is, again, this is an early concept, so this may look developed, and we have looked at a couple of other options, but this is sort of the path we've been going stylistically with the concept.
 Next, we're gonna show you some photos of other projects we've done in Greater Boston that have things that we think at least conceptually belong in a project like this.
 This is a community we built called The Val that we've just finished, or just finishing leasing up.
 And so some of the things you'll note here is a big two-story volume at the arrival.
 I mentioned that there was that amenity labeled space was also amenities, but also our leasing and management staff.
 So this is a good example of how we integrate some of these things.
 On the right side of this feature wall is actually the back of house where at all times you can find somebody on our team working there.
 But there's also this sort of hotel-styled arrival here, which is some of the way
 apartment home communities are going.
 So there's someone here at all times kind of giving you a more full service feeling during the
 well, during regular hours, more full service feeling to the building.
 And then you'll see these two stories and a feature stair.
 This is something we'd like to integrate in this project as well, where we really are stitching together some of these assembly spaces, work from home spaces, or maybe you're just scrolling and rolling with your earbuds in and your music on, but places where this is a little more activated and a little more public.
 This actually, this wall was, we had a local artist custom paint it for us in sort of a thematic nod to the name.
 This is a project we built two years ago called The Cove.
 This is another idea of just some of those sort of flex spaces where this is really,
 more recreational space, obviously a pool table, there's actually a beer tap back there and wine, excuse me, and a wine cooler.
 But this is a space that would also be, we would propose something like stylistically different, of course, right near those amenity and leasing spaces, a little more open concept.
 This is one of our fitness centers we just completed.
 This one's actually done on two levels.
 We had a lot of fun with this one.
 We're utilizing private mirror rooms for online workouts and then of course all the traditional cardio.
 So this one has actually up top of this spiral staircase has a cardio deck and then the rest of your workout is all below here.
 So you can get an idea of how we really want to create an enclosed, fully encapsulated community, but in a very first class way.
 This is a pool deck shot.
 So this is an important one because this is a good analogy for how we would treat that center of the donut type space you saw.
 This is also a green roof on deck.
 These trees, while brand new, will grow to be full 40 foot sugar maples and red maples.
 So we have a team that understands how to put
 full-sized real vegetation on top of a deck.
 Under this is a parking level, not unlike we would propose on this site.
 Then a full, of course, heated pool and resort style, three, four months of the year, great place to hang out with your iPad or just get some sun.
 This is a good example of how we would treat that.
 This is in the same project at the Val I mentioned earlier, similar green roof.
 You know, you'll see something.
 We had some taller trees at the inception here, but, and some lawn back there, which is hard to see, but we fully green up hard and soft scape.
 This one has a cool sun deck where you can throw your chaise lounge right in the water.
 It's heated and, and hang out, you know, we'll have fire, we have a large fire pit.
 And then this one, you can actually see the grilling stations, private grilling areas where you and your friends can kind of hang out.
 and have dinner.
 And then this is just, we just wanted to give you an idea of what some of our apartment homes look like.
 Alliance is a little different than some of our more cookie cutter national competitors.
 I'm not here to throw shade at any of them.
 There's a lot of great groups out there.
 We just really kind of treat each project with a little bit more of a customized approach.
 And so, you know, in our Hingham asset, you know, that was more appropriate to have a little bit more of a coastal New England style and a little bit more classic sort of features.
 You know, at workforce spaces, you might want to be a little cooler, have a little bit more fun with some of the design, a little less safe.
 And then, of course, the unit mix and the lighting and all that changes.
 So this is a good example.
 We actually did two different types of backsplash tile with a custom featured backsplash tile behind the range.
 and sort of things like that.
 But we build, you know, the goal is to build, you know, first class modern housing from connectivity to finishes and the like.
 And so that is that.
 Let's see if I can understand how to put this off.

 Oke, mèsi pou montre sa, mwen devine.
 Premye a tout, mwen konnen ou.
 Oke, anvan tout bagay, koupe twotwa a tèlman espesifik ke mwen devine ou renmen koule nan pwopriyete sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1630.277s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Yeah, twotwa koupe yo se koupe twotwa, ou pral wont, se pa yon gwo tèm nan atizay, jis gen koupe twotwa, antre kay, fondamantalman kapasite nan yo dwe yon gwo pòsyon nan yon wout piblik sou tè prive.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1645.285s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Oke, mwen konnen ou mansyone ke, ou konnen, yon anpil nan lide a se ke moun pa nesesèman oblije sèvi ak machin yo, petèt yo ap vle travay nan kay la.
 Ou te mansyone tou ke gen anpil moun ki kalite R&D ou konnen ki ta ka deplase isit la.
 Boston, ou konnen, se yon gwo sant pou endistri biotechnologie a, ak anpil moun, ou konnen, sanble ap kondwi alantou.
 Yo dwe ale nan laboratwa a.
 OK
 Mwen konnen ou mansyone nou toujou nan premye etap yo, men mwen panse ke pwoblèm nan se jwenn wout la trafik dwat.
 Ki jan ou pran an kont ki moun ki ka antre nan, dwa?
 Se pa tankou w ap lwe sèlman bay moun ki ta ka travay nan kay la.
 Mwen panse ke gen anpil rezon pou kwè ke, ou konnen, enkli mwen menm, mwen travay nan endistri a biotech.
 Moun kite isit la pou Cambridge ak Burlington.
 Epi, ou konnen, mwen wè anpil moun nan endistri a ki toujou bezwen nan biwo syantifik yo, e sa reprezante a vas majorite nan endistri a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1710.315s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, sa se yon bon kesyon.
 Gen kèk nan yo, asire w ke ou dezip yo kòrèkteman.
 Mwen vle di, premye a se, ou konnen, sa yo se estimasyon, mwen ka di ou ki moun ki tipik mache sib nou an, mwen ka di ou ki tipikman lwe.
 Men, nan kou, nou ap bati kay pou tout moun.
 Nou eseye adapte pwodwi nou yo pou konprann ki moun ki pi enterese nan k ap viv nan yon espas.
 Men ou gen rezon absoliman.
 Mwen vle di, mwen vle di,
 Machin yo inevitab, jan yo ka wè nan nenpòt ki pwen nan entèseksyon an.
 Natirèlman, gen kèk moun ki toujou kondwi nan travay, si w ap nan biotech oswa yon lòt bagay.
 Mwen gen zanmi ki travay nan Depatman Defans, nan R&D, e li ka 2 è nan maten.
 Lè yon pwosesis oswa tès fini, tout moun ale sou Slack oswa Ekip epi yo di, oke, ann ale, epi Lè sa a, tout moun mobilize epi ale.
 Alor mon pwen se, sirman nou pa spesifikman target oubyen cater to ki nou lwe, nou welcome personn.
 Men, se moun ki tipikman vini isit la, ou konnen, yon moun, yon moun ta ka plis enterese nan ale nan pwopriyete Hingham nou an nan papòt la si yo vle kondwi yon ti kras plis, ou konnen, e mwen panse ke lide a isit la se, ou konnen, ou pa bezwen antre nan machin ou epi pran kafe, oswa ale nan Walgreens, oswa yo pral achte vyann bèf ou oswa yon bagay konsa.
 Men, mesye, nan yon pwendvi pwofesyonèl, pwobableman ou anfòm mache sib nou an pafètman.
 Li se yon jèn pwofesyonèl, byen edike, epi ou konnen, se egzakteman sa nou bati kay pou nan zòn nan pi gwo Boston.
 Kathy, mwen pral mande w pou ede m bèbè ak unmute leve men paske mwen pa menm sèten mwen gen otorite pou fè sa.
 Se konsa, mwen kwè ou pral ede m 'rezoud pwoblèm sa a.</p>

 Ricky, konbyen tan sa ka dire?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1843.122s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Mwen panse ke nou ta dwe diskite sou li an premye.
 Mwen panse ke nou te resevwa kesyon nan men moun ki abite Wellington Circle.
 Si w toujou konekte, èske w vle dekole?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1861.02s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Mwen se tout bagay.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1884.157s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Sanble nou pa gen yon vwazen Wellington Circle ankò.
 Mwen panse ke nou pral fè sa a sekans soti nan tèt la nan ekran an.
 Lauren, sanble ou gen men ou anlè.
 Si ou vle, mwen ka retire w epi poze kesyon w.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1899.089s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Nou pral sove chat la jouk nan fen pou nou konnen ki moun ki leve men yo epi kontinye soti nan la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1907.962s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Wi, sèl kesyon mwen an se yon kesyon trè kout: Èske w ta renmen konstwi yon pon pou pyeton sou entèseksyon an pou fasilite trafik la? Depi mwen santi ke gen anpil moun siplemantè yo deyò, li ta ka itil pou gen aksè a T a paske li pa ka itilize trè efikas nan moman sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1933.541s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, mwen vle di, mwen pral onèt avèk ou, eta a pèmèt ou ale bati yon pon sou otowout nou yo atravè DC.
 Nan lòt mo, nou ka bezwen yon pi gwo pake pou fè sa.
 Senpleman mete ranp obstak ak koub pou rete konfòme. Mwen te gade aplikasyon ki sanble nan Cambridge.
 Te pase tren banlye pou mwen ta di nou ta wè tout bagay epi fè li men malerezman mwen te gen yon trè bon eksperyans.
 Wi, sa a se pwobableman yon bagay nou pa ka enkli, ka pa gen okenn lojman kite yon fwa pon an fin bati.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1977.11s">[Unidentified]</a>: Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1980.232s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Mwen pa konn kijan poum leve men mwen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1984.054s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Linda, vini, nou pare pou ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1986.19s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Mwen se Wellington e mwen se yon manm konsèy nan Wellington Apartments.
 Ninth Street pa t 'kapab akomode plis machin pase sa li te deja, espesyalman depi yo te plase siy la sou venerab Beach Boulevard nan direksyon lwès la epi li te bay mak la kèk espas pou l respire.
 Aparèy mwen an fè fas a Ninth Street chak maten.
 Gen twa oswa kat otobis lekòl chak apremidi.
 Mwen te wè otobis vil yo.
 Sa a se yon pwoblèm ki gen gwo enkyetid pou nou.
 Mwen konnen sa paske kèk vwazen mwen te ekri m.
 Kesyon mwen poze yo tou enpòtan pou mwen.
 Nou fè tout sa nou kapab pou pran swen lakay nou epi pou kontwole ensèk nuizib yo chak de mwa. Nou gen estasyon Garnier epi ou ka fouye byen fon jan ou vle.
 Pou pakin, mwen panse katye sa a ta ka vin trè enpopilè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2053.406s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: Mwen pa konnen ki jan pou m leve men m tou, men mwen avèk Linda.

 Men mwen gen nimewo telefòn ou pou w ka patisipe apre nou fin revize moun ki leve men yo.
 Te gen twa moun devan nou epi mwen t ap gade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2079.292s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Linda, sa yo se gwo kesyon epi ou pral remake nan plan an konsèp ke nou entansyonèlman pa enkli koupe twotwa ak aktyèlman elimine kèk nan koupe twotwa yo ant lo sa yo ak 9th Street.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, nou sispèk sa a pral ka a.
 Yon sijè ki cho.
 Gen lòt ki nan vil la di nou Ninth Street gen pwoblèm nan sans sa a.
 Mwen panse ke nou te fè kèk bagay espre, nou te eseye fè respè epi kenbe machin nou an lwen nevyèm plas.
 Men, mwen panse ke gen kèk bagay nou pa fè espre ki ta dwe ede.
 Twa twotwa sou direksyon lwès Revere Beach Boulevard,
 Nan pwen sa a, ou ka fasilman vire adwat epi ale nan pakin Monroe a, oswa ale pase pakin Cappies la ak sou 9th Street, ale nan entèseksyon an, esansyèlman elimine nenpòt limyè trafik nan entèseksyon an, epi ale nan nò sou Fellsway oswa Middlesex.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke sa nou ap fè entansyonèlman se sètènman pa pral ajoute okenn nouvo doulè.
 Men, mwen panse ak plan devlopman ke n ap pwopoze a, kounye a nou pral esansyèlman anpeche tout moun travèse twotwa a nan Nevyèm Ri.
 Mwen ta di sa ta dwe redwi li kèk.
 Dezole m pa konn kote Granite Street ak siy ou mansyone a, ann jwenn li.
 Men, moun ki ap pase nan pakè sa yo sètènman pa kapab fè sa ankò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2185.727s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Mwen panse ke yo te entèwonp mwen.
 Mwen ka tande ou toujou, o, mwen byen, mwen pèdi siy mak la nan fen 9th Street, ki kouri soti nan Review Beach Park rive nan Keys, byen, Wellington Apartments, nan kou, gen mak la soti nan 9th Street nan Key Factory, epi li se yon anpil nan bagay diferan anplis sa depi mwen te isit la.
 Vil la posede lòt mwatye a.
 Oke, mwen gen paralèl, paralèl ak 6 deyò a nan mitan an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2221.06s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Se konsa, pa gen anpil bagay nou ka fè sou sa, men ankò, li ta sètènman elimine blokis yo kote moun ap sote nan limyè trafik yo kounye a.
 Nou pa rekòmande tou pou ajoute yon machin aswè a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2236.131s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Wi, paske mwen aktyèlman vle di li ogmante. Mwen te isit la prèske 30 ane epi mwen pa ka kwè konbyen li te grandi.

 Sa a se mangonmen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2249.175s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, mwen ka di ou, Linda, nou te fè kèk bagay trè kreyatif ak transpò nan zòn nan.
 Mwen pa konnen si mwen ka ba ou yon solisyon pafè. Mwen konnen nou pa kapab.
 Me definitivman mon pou en bon ekoute e anploy bann meyer eksper pou fer sir ki nou’n entegre dan sa laterseksyon, sa nouvo intersection ; sepandan, sa ka touche nan enkyetid yo nan jan yo nan Nevyèm Street.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2287.492s">[Unidentified]</a>: OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2288.593s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Repons lan se mwen pa sèten.
 Yon pati nan sa n ap planifye ak fè kounye a se aprann.
 Sa a se sa nou rele peryòd siviv.
 Nou ap fè rechèch sou tout bagay soti nan tit ak alyans ak kondisyon anviwònman an, kijan pou jwenn pèmi, elatriye, pale ak vwazen ak sa nou pa konnen. Objektif prensipal nou jodi a se pou nou bon koute moun ki bò kote nou pou nou ka avanse pou pi devan epi antre nan yon pwosesis ouvè kote reyinyon ouvè ak plis fòmèl pral fèt.
 Entwodiksyon, onètman, gen pwobableman yon pi bon repons.
 Nou ap enfòme dapre sa nou tande nan men ou menm ak ofisyèl vil yo jodi a, kidonk nou vle kenbe sa nan tèt ou epi yo pa jis voye jete ide pou nouvo aplikasyon ke nou tou senpleman pa te rechèch oswa konprann otan ke nou ta dwe.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2341.722s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Sa a se Kelsey. Mwen panse ke ou ka fè li tèt ou kounye a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2350.097s">[Scalise]</a>: Mèsi.
 Bonjou, non mwen se Christine, e mwen se pwopriyetè magazen Parkway Plaza West la.
 Mwen an favè metòd devlopman sa a.
 Mwen santi tankou zòn ki toupre transpò piblik yo ta dwe gen lojman ki pi dans.
 Men, mwen gen de enkyetid sou konstriksyon an.
 Youn nan yo se sa lòt moun te di.
 Nan Ninth Street, Linda gen rezon, menm si ou elimine koupe twotwa sa yo, moun pa pral gen tandans ale nan pakin nan paske, franchman, se yon zòn dezas, men yo pral antre nan Brainerd ak Lè sa a, nan Nevyèm Street.
 Li nan Ninth Street epi li piti anpil, kidonk premye kesyon mwen an se: èske konpayi ou a oswa èske ou te gen youn tankou sa a nan tan lontan?
 Li fè kèk bagay ak kominote li bati pou amelyore lari a, petèt ak bon entansyon paske malerezman Ninth Street se yon wout prive.
 Bagay yo se sa yo ye, amelyorasyon bezwen fè, twotwa, twotwa, lari.
 Mwen panse ke li ta bèl si te gen, ou konnen, petèt yon fason.
 Se konsa, premye kesyon mwen an se: ou gen youn?
 Èske konpayi ou gen yon enterè nan oswa yon istwa nan ede amelyore lari a?
 Paske menm san koupe twotwa yo, rezidan yo ta kòmanse kondwi desann Brainerd rive nan Ninth Street pou evite entèseksyon an.
 Dezyèm kesyon mwen an se sou diminye pwoblèm wonjè paske mwen jis li sou moun ki gen kochma ak pwoblèm wonjè lè yo kòmanse konstriksyon gwo echèl,
 Mwen li yon atik jodi a sou Somerville ak Brookline k ap kòmanse sèvi ak yon sistèm pwochen jenerasyon ki rele yon bwat entelijan.
 Èske konpayi ou fè mezi debaz alèjman wonjè sou travay aktyèl yo, oswa èske w planifye envesti nan teknik mitigasyon pi wo nivo?
 Uh, paske nou gen anpil pwopriyetè inite nan yon reyon yon ti blòk, mwen panse ke li ta vrèman anmèdan si sa te kreye yon gwo pwoblèm wonjè.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2493.5s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Oke, ann fè premye a ak dènye a paske mwen panse mwen li atik sa a maten an e mwen pa janm tande pale de teknoloji sa a.
 Ou sonje kòman li rele?
 Sa a se bwat yo te resevwa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2505.07s">[Scalise]</a>: Cymex-prèv bwat entelijan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2507.612s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: sa se tout.
 Wi, mwen pa janm tande pale de sa.
 Mwen kaptive.
 Mwen aktyèlman googled li maten an.
 Se poutèt sa, premye faz la gen ladan twa etap yo nan yon pwoblèm wonjè.
 Premyèman, pandan pwosesis konstriksyon an, lalwa mande pou nou fè gwo efò.
 Mwen ka di yo trè efikas.
 An reyalite, dapre lalwa nou oblije anboche yon ekspè wonjè.
 Moun sa a dwe fè pati ekip nou an pandan tout pwosesis konstriksyon an.
 Mwen konnen se pa tout bagay, men se premye etap la.
 Mwen pa konnen si teknik sa a posib oswa si konpayi kontwòl ensèk nuizib nou travay avèk yo sèvi ak li.
 Mwen ta sètènman renmen mande yo fè sa paske li son tankou yon teknoloji vrèman fre.
 Dezyèm bagay la se, ou konnen,
 Nou bati kay epi eseye di tout moun ke nou bati bèl kay.
 Se konsa, dènye bagay mwen vle se yon enfeksyon rat nan oswa alantou katye mwen an.
 Se konsa, mwen bezwen aprann plis isit la, e sipoze nou ka kontinye isit la, Matt ak Greg yo pral ekspè yo sou rat nan zòn nan nan telefòn nan.
 Pou m onèt, mwen pa pran okenn kredi pou li.
 Se ta yon efò egoyis paske nou pa vle sa tou.
 So, nou annan bann pest control dan nou bidze fonkswit e parey ou kapab mazinen, i annan 150 lines, e sa i enn bann keksoz ki ladan, e i en keksoz ki nou pou fer lo en baz apre konstriksyon.
 Wi, se li.
 Sa a se youn nan premye.
 Dezyèm lan se sou amelyorasyon nan Ninth Street ak sa n ap fè lòt kote.
 Repons toulède kesyon an se wi, prèske tout tan, epi nou konnen kèk nan li se egoyis kidonk mwen pa pral pran anpil kredi pou sa, men nou vle yon bon kominote epi mwen pa ta bati sou tè vèt.
 Tout kote nou te bati yo se te ansyen bilding endistriyèl oswa bilding biwo delambre e san yo pa domaje repitasyon Cappy's, enstalasyon yo te trè bon epi mwen te achte la.
 Men, objektif nou se pa detwi nouvo kote.
 Li enplike amelyorasyon nan yon pasèl tè eritye atravè amelyorasyon byen imobilye eritye.
 Kidonk, se nan avantaj nou pou nou fè Ninth Street pi atiran.
 Sa a se definitivman yon bagay nou vle diskite avèk ou.
 Nou deja gen plan pou bò 9th Street.
 Ou konnen ki sa pave sanble ak ou konnen ki jan koupe sa yo nan asfalt la anfòm ansanm parfe.
 Ou konnen nou pral gen kèk nouvo platfòm ki asosye ak sa a epi, nan kou, si nou kontinye amelyore ak rebati tanpon fwontyè Parkway la, kidonk ou konnen yo pral oblije entegre ak sa tou.
 Se konsa, repons lan kout se absoliman: Nou vle pale ak ou sou sa nou ka fè pou amelyore Ninth Street.
 Mwen panse ke ou gen yon twazyèm kesyon. Mwen bliye yon bagay epi mwen rate yon bagay.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2696.694s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Mwen panse ke ou se pwochen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2700.316s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_30]</a>: Mèsi anpil pou tan ou.
 Ou te di ou se lokal, kidonk mwen sèten ou konnen Kathy pral trè okipe pandan Thanksgiving ak Nwèl la.
 Èske gen moun ki pale sou itilizasyon done sou lavant Cappy oswa lapolis leta oswa lokal paske yo toujou gen moun ki pake sou twotwa a jis pou gade sikilasyon nan zòn nan pou ede w detèmine ki kalite dezòd sikilasyon yon bilding nan gwosè sa a ta lakòz?
 Paske gwosè Cappy ta ka
 Mwen vle di, achtè a se pwobableman ekivalan a yon rezidan ki abite nan bilding lan epi ki kondwi bilding lan. De bagay sa yo ka sèvi kòm done sou konbyen moun ki genyen ak konbyen machin ap vini ak ale, ak ki kalite konmosyon yo lakòz, espesyalman nan
 Lè gen anpil trafik.
 Se konsa, èske gen nenpòt diskisyon sou eseye kolekte kèk done semèn pwochèn?
 Piske se fèt Thanksgiving, sa vle di entèseksyon ak Cappy a ouvè epi moun ap rasanble ankò, kidonk li pral trè okipe.
 Petèt done sa yo ta ka itilize pou detèmine ki kalite sikilasyon oswa pwoblèm kalite konstriksyon sa a ta lakòz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2785.256s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Natirèlman, kèk nan li se jis asire w ke mwen konprann pwoblèm nan.
 Pou nou onèt, nou twò bonè nan pwosesis anbochaj yon konsiltan transpò. Tipikman, mwen kòmanse depanse lajan an lè mwen konnen nou ka santi nou konfòtab pran sou risk nou dwe pran yo kontinye.
 Mwen pral rele.
 Men, men mwen pral di ou sa a
 Yo rele li ITE.
 Lè nou anboche pwofesyonèl sa yo, yo pa renmen sèvi ak done anekdotik.
 Se konsa, mwen pral fè yon apèl epi wè si gen yon fason yo enkòpore sa paske nan peryòd tan nou an, ou konnen, realistikman, nou pa pral, sipoze nou kontinye, sa ta pral bonè ane pwochèn, ou konnen, nou gen yon anpil nan bwat yo tcheke anvan nouvo ane a pou wè si nou vle kontinye fè sa.
 Malerezman, sa vle di ke lè nou fè etid fòmèl sa yo, ki pral pran plizyè mwa, nou deja pase Thanksgiving.
 Se konsa, kesyon mwen an se: Ki jan ou panse sou oswa adapte yo ak sa a?
 Paske si sa a se yon moman inikman enpak pou ou, epi li fè yon sans total, mwen devine ou ta ka nan yon sitiyasyon ki sanble pandan sezon Nwèl la.
 Wi.
 Ou konnen ki jan yo enkòpore sa.
 Malerezman, repons kout la se ke pwobableman ou pa pral jwenn trafik reyèl.
 Kidonk, lè nou te kòmanse travay sa a, nou t ap soti nan jaden yo epi yo t ap monte ti kòd kawotchou sa yo ke ou wè lòt bò wout la. Pafwa yo aktyèlman fè yon konte fizik epi yo gen yon
 Mwen gen kèk analis k ap travay nan ekip la ki ap tcheke tou pou wè si li mache byen, kidonk nou jwenn yon gade onèt nan pwosesis la. Mwen doute mwen pral kapab mobilize nenpòt moun semèn pwochèn.
 Menmsi mwen riske plis ak dola sa yo.
 Men, mwen pral chèche konnen ki jan yo eksplike li, paske gen kèk jou trè difisil nan ane a.
 Nou pral aprann kijan pou fè sa.
 Sa ki mon ava dir, parey mon’n dir, nou pa’n anploy serten bann eksper ki nou bezwen fer sa travay ki apropriye pour sa laplikasyon.
 Men, nou anboche poto reyèl.
 Nou pa entèfere ak gwoup segondè yo.
 Se konsa, sa yo se syantis reyèl ak aktyèlman quantitative.
 Yo ap kalkile moun.
 Alor annou pa perdi sa.
 Mwen panse ke yon pati nan sa a se yon bon nouvèl: Itilizasyon nou an pral jenere mwens trafik pase lòt itilizasyon ke yon moun ta ka kreye jodi a.
 Si w gade zòn ki kòrèk la, mwen pa gen nimewo egzak la devan m, men yon moun ta ka antre isit la ak yon bilding laboratwa kat etaj, tou pre 300,000 pye, epi pa ta gen yon pwosesis odyans piblik.
 Yo senpleman kite plan yo sou biwo enspektè bilding lan epi tann 30 jou.
 Se konsa, nou trè modès konpare ak kèk nan itilizasyon altènatif yo isit la.
 Mwen pa konnen ki sa nou dwe fè ak sa Cappy te fè.
 Mwen sispèk ka gen yon ti kras plis.
 Men, wi, mwen ka di ke si se yon biwo an detay oswa yon laboratwa travay, espas sa yo anjeneral gen kat a senk machin pou chak 1,000 pye, epi nou gen apeprè yon machin pou chak 1,000 pye, kidonk mwen pa ta di.
 Mwen p'ap di w ke p'ap janm gen yon machin isit la ki fè w fache, oswa ki bloke wout ou, oswa kèlkeswa sa.
 Men, jis nan yon pèspektiv quantitative.
 Espesyalman pandan jou ferye sa yo, pral gen mwens.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3004.034s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Jis an tèm de rete onèt.
 Pral gen odyans piblik, revize plan sit ak nenpòt bagay ki nan nati sa a, men si ou gen rezon, Lè sa a, li se itilizasyon jis epi li se jis yon revizyon sit.
 Kopye li tou, byenke mwen panse ou pral pwochen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3018.156s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Mwen panse sa, mwen apresye demonstrasyon an nan fè sa, si mwen konprann ou byen.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3033.241s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Senk pwochen yo pral espas rezidansyèl, totalize 250 inite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3037.502s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, mwen panse ke li se 265 kounye a, li toujou, ou konnen, evidamman nou pa te prevwa sa, li pa tèlman wo, sou wi, ou konnen, konbyen pòch ta ka gen nan total?
 Mwen panse ke nou rekòmande plis pase yon espas pou chak inite.
 Nou ap gade kèk lòt eleman dekoupaj an zòn nan epi li parèt vil la pèmèt 0.85 espas oswa plis pou chak inite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3061.287s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Se konsa, nou panse... Mwen panse ke ranje zonaj nou an soti nan 0.75 a 1.5.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3065.248s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, nou panse yon ti kras plis se apwopriye, byenke nou dakò sa a se yon zòn transpò piblik.
 Se konsa, repons lan se apeprè yon espas pou chak inite.
 Mika, konbyen lojman abòdab pral genyen isit la?
 Nou rekòmande swiv règ ak règleman lojman enklizyon Bedford yo, kidonk mwen panse ke li se 15%.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3084.169s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Ki sa ou panse se seri a pri pou pwodwi sa yo?
 Non.</p>

 Mwen pa ka di w kisa sa pral ye paske se plizyè ane travay.
 Men, sa kowenside ak sa w ap wè lòtbò lari a ak kèk nan lòt nouvo kominote ki nan yon mil nan nou ke nou panse ka byen konpetisyon ak yo.</p>

 Koulye a, kesyon an ak repons se, non, nou pa fè sa.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke Kristen te fè sa klè.
 Men, inconvénient la se, pwobableman w ap bati yon bilding sou detire ki pi okipe nan wout nan vil Medford, pwobableman nan kwen ki pi okipe nan vil Medford.
 Gen kèk jeni nan DCI te panse li ta yon bon lide yo mete yon dekoupaj nan do a nan tout inite sa yo.
 Sa a te yon gwo erè nan moman an. Mwen pa konnen ki moun ki te panse de sa, men tout sa yo te fè se trafik dirèk ak lajan nan tout apatman ak apatman sa yo, epi mwen te di, mwen jis pa wè ki kote sa a prale pou peyi a.
 Men, se yon bon lide, kidonk li pa fòt ou nan ka sa a.
 Ou konnen bò pozitif la.
 Ou konnen, retire silansye Kirby ak Monroe yo nan zòn nan ta evidamman diminye anpil trafik.
 Se yon chat, ou konnen, chofè taksi travay sèt jou pa semèn.
 Ou konnen 9 a 10 nan biznis, ak jan anpil moun di, ou konnen ou gen wikenn.
 Ou pa ka trape tòti, pa sa anpil.
 Ou pral fè pati ou pou fè timoun sa yo soti la.
 Sa pral sispann kèk trafik, men mwen pa konnen kisa vwazen sa yo pral fè jiskaske leta deside admèt yo te fè yon erè ak 9th Street Bypass la.
 Mwen espere ou pral konsidere mezi mitigasyon, ou konnen, petèt sa a pral ede yo, ou konnen, pave wout la.
 Mwen vle di, mwen konnen li depase kapasite w, men se yon bèl jès nan men ou.
 Pwochen kesyon mwen an se, èske ou kounye a bloke kèk nan opinyon kèk nan lòt moun mwen te tande yo gen enkyetid?
 Ki jan nou ka rezoud pwoblèm sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3254.415s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen pa gen yon bon repons pou ou lè li rive vizyon.
 Ou konnen, se jis yon fonksyon nan yon zòn ki gen bilding tankou sa a.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, mwen devine kèk moun yo pa pral gen yon gwo vizyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3268.188s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Oke, non, pa sou pwopriyete w la, men ou konnen, tankou mwen te di, li se yon zòn trè okipe.
 Kounye a ou konnen,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3276.015s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Se yon kesyon ki jis.
 Se yon kesyon ki jis.
 Mwen vle di, mwen panse ke nan pèspektiv kèk moun, franchman, objektif mwen se te fè yon bilding ki te atire ase.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3283.804s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Bilding lan trè bèl.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3285.786s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Pwen se, li pa yon bon gade nan bourik Kirby a.
 Nou espere amelyore kèk opinyon epi asire bloke.
 Mwen sèten kèk moun ka gen yon opinyon.
 Ou konnen nou nan sidwès la epi ou ka wè misterye prezève rivyè yo, mwen poko wè yo men mwen sispèk yo egziste e mwen espere wè nou an omwen pi bon pase Capiz la nan Monroe, men ou konnen definitivman gen kèk konpansasyon la. Mwen pa gen yon repons pafè pou sa a.
 Èske se yon tas? Èske mwen te di sa? Yo gen rezon: yo tout koube.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3316.688s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Yeah, se te biwo a ki te pase nan sa ki kounye a se 9th Street, oswa wout sèvis sa a jan nou tout konnen li, se sa yo rele li, kidonk le pli vit ke ou travèse pon an jis swiv Route 16.
 Se sa moun bezwen nan sèvo yo.
 Ebyen jan rezidan yo te di, sa se yon wout prive an reyalite, vant lan prive pou vil la, e mwen te di lè yo te pote sa, mwen pa kapab, mwen pa ka kwè yon moun ap peye pou fè sa, se yon bagay sòt fè pou retire trafik sou Route 16, youn nan wout ki pi chaje nan zòn nan.
 Kontinye dèyè sa yo ak blòk sa a.
 Yon fwa ankò, aksidan sa a pa te fòt li oswa nenpòt lòt moun, se te fòt totalman DCR.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3359.618s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Oke, mwen pral di sa a: Nou ka pa kapab rezoud tout pwoblèm sa yo, men nou kapab, ak ekspè nou yo trè bon.
 Se konsa, petèt nou ka fè yon bagay ki omwen pozitif.
 Mwen vle di, nan Westwood, mwen fè anpil travay sou kalme trafik ak bagay ki trè sibtil, vire epingl ak wonn-bout.
 Gen kèk moun ki rayi tout mo ak teknik sa yo, men pafwa gen kèk mo ak teknik efikas nou ka politès ak dousman sispann trafik nan bloke.
 Nou gen zouti yo la epi nou pral deplwaye ekip nou yo pou jere yo jan nou kapab.
 Ninth Street se prive, ki bon ak move.
 Mwen panse ke teknikman sak sa a oswa sak yo ta dwe tonbe nan mitan liy santral la.
 Alor i bezwen annan serten jesyon dwa prive, e nou bezwen travay avek vwazen nou pou asire ki tou dimoun i abor, nenport ki sa ki arive lo lakaz, nenport ki sa ki tou dimoun i anvi.
 Se konsa, gen yon bon pwosesis demokratik isit la.
 Men, ka gen yon solisyon pou sa.
 Pou nou onèt, achitèk nou te itilize pou ede kreye pi fò nan imaj yo te nan komite direktè Depatman Transpò Massachusetts la pou redevlope entèseksyon sa a.
 Se konsa, gen yon anpil nan simetri, e si nou gen kapasite pou pran kèk nan fidbak sa yo ak kèk nan fidbak ke nou pral jwenn ak kesyon yo ke nou pral konsidere, nou ta ka kapab.
 Ou ka pa ka ranje li, men li ka gen yon enpak plis pozitif pase ou panse.
 Nou pral gen ekip nou an k ap travay sou li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3445.637s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Mike, èske ou ta konsidere fè aranjman pou yon kalite navèt nan estasyon tren an pandan lè biznis yo? Petèt 7 a 10, 4 a 6, yon bagay konsa?
 oswa petèt konekte
 Paske nou ap pale de kèk devlopman nan lavni.
 Nou te mande sou posiblite pou yon sèvis transpò konbine pou ale ak pou soti nan estasyon tren an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3473.179s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Nou pral definitivman pran yon gade nan sa a.
 Pou m onèt, mwen te panse li ta pi bon si otobis la kite kote nou an epi ale nan Wellington nan lè pik yo.
 Se anviwon sis minit ap mache soti kote nou rete a e mwen pa yon mesye rapid ankò.
 Kidonk, ou konnen, ou ka rive nan twotwa sa a trè vit, e sa pa konte pasaj pou pyeton an nan entèseksyon an.
 Se konsa, men nou pral wè.
 Mwen pa ta di non, men mwen gen dout youn nan bagay sa yo.
 Mwen regrèt.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3501.709s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Mwen jis vle sone nan.
 Mwens pase sis minit mache.
 Apeprè 15 minit.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3506.753s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Mike, travèse Route 16 epi ou pèdi tout bagay.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3511.616s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi mesye Carmelo mwen pap di non kounye a.
 Mwen devine nou pral oblije gade nan sa a.
 Si gen yon TMA nan zòn nan, yo souvan mande nou rantre nan ak kontribisyon nan TMA a.
 Se konsa, nou pral definitivman kenbe yon je sou ki jan yo fè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3523.705s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Men, pou tout sa ou konnen, ou te di ou ta ka bati nan kwen ki pi okipe nan Medford.
 Se konsa, yo te di, ou konnen, bò pozitif la se ou jwenn byen yon ti kras nan trafik nan Cappies ak Monroe, espesyalman Cappies, ki louvri 24 èdtan pa jou.
 Mwen panse ke rezidan yo pral wè kèk, petèt kèk soulajman ak trafik konpare ak kounye a.
 Se konsa,
 Mèsi pou entwodiksyon ou.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3561.56s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Kathy, mwen panse w ap fèmen bouch ou.
 Mwen te tonbe an silans.
 Debra Carante, ou te gen yon kesyon anvan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3568.025s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: Wi.
 Fondamantalman, mwen ap pwofite lòt kòmantè isit la.
 Enkyetid prensipal la se paske mwen abite nan apatman Parkway Plaza South ki anfas Route 16.
 Li gen anpil moun isit la.
 Li difisil anpil pou desann Route 9 jou sa yo.
 Si w eseye vwayaje sou wout la, trafik sou Route 16 ak Wellington Roundabout se terib.
 Nan opinyon mwen, mwen enkyete ke bati yon gwo konplèks ta lakòz konjesyon enkwayab.
 Sa a se enkyetid prensipal mwen an.
 Epitou, mwen panse ke li te Linda ki te pote pwoblèm nan wonjè epi li te pale sou li.
 Men, mwen panse yon dezas pral rive pandan fouyman ak konstriksyon.
 Finalman, èske nouvo konplèks sa a ap afekte valè pwopriyete nou an?
 Mwen vle di, mwen pa panse moun vle viv nan zòn ki gen anpil moun, ki gen anpil moun.
 E jan Rick fèk di, zòn sa a se zòn ki pi konjesyone nan Medford.
 Mwen vle di, èske sa pral diminye valè pwopriyete nou an?
 Paske nou tout posede apatman isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3646.851s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mike, mwen pa yon ekspè nan evalyasyon byen imobilye.
 Men, mwen sispèk li te dèyè itilizasyon yon machin dèyè yon magazen likè, ki pa diskredite etablisman amann Cappy a.
 Se yon pi bon vwazen pou ou.
 Se konsa, gen rechèch nan MIT.
 Li te fè, mwen panse, 15 ane de sa, epi yo te trè dedye a li, epi li te de ram papye, e malerezman mwen li li.
 Yo te jwenn ke katye ki gen revni melanje prèske inilateralman amelyore valè vwazen yo.
 Se konsa, mwen jis pral di, mwen pa yon estimatè, men mwen dwe imajine ke gen yon zanmitay, vwazen premye pousantaj tankou sa a, anplis objektif pou yo te la, ta ede ou, oswa sètènman pa fè mal valè ou.
 Ou mesye yo ap eseye fè m pè ak rat la vin yon ti kras nève.
 Ann kraze angajman pito difisil sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3704.461s">[Maria D'Orsi]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen sipoze ou te fè eksperyans sa a tèt ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3716.871s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Sa a se yon nouvo inite.
 Oke, ou bon pou ale.
 Se konsa, nenpòt lòt moun leve men yo nan pwen sa a?
 Mwen pa kwè nou pral wè okenn.
 Mwen panse ke nou ka pwobableman fini chat nou an nan pwen sa a.
 Anpil nan kesyon yo se menm bagay la, men nou ka pran yon gade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3738.621s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Kidonk, Kathy, mwen ta ka bezwen ou moutre m 'ki jan yo louvri chanm nan chat isit la yo wè li.
 Mwen te wè yo parèt.
 Briyan.
 Nou gen yon pwoblèm difisil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3749.926s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: si ou vle nou kapab
 Kesyon oral.
 Bonjou Mike, mèsi pou entwodiksyon an.
 Nou nan West Parkway Plaza.
 Nou jis yon lòt vwazen.
 Mwen kontan rankontre w.
 Mèsi paske w te òganize evènman sa a.
 Se konsa, nou gen kèk kesyon senp.
 Premyèman, konbyen tan ou panse yon bati tankou sa a ta pran?
 Ou te mansyone, mwen konnen li byen bonè, men ki lè ou panse nou ka kòmanse?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3785.098s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi.
 Se poutèt sa, konstriksyon nan yon pwojè sa yo ka pran 2,024 mwa.
 Mwen ta di pi fò nan li.
 Bilding lan deja monte epi timoun nou yo ap okipe andedan.
 Se konsa, men, wi, mwen ta di de nan ouvèti ak demolisyon; nenpòt fason, li nan apeprè de ane nan mache aktyèl la.
 Kòm pou ki lè konstriksyon pral kòmanse, mwen pa ka di vil la konbyen tan pwosesis pèmi yo pran, men anjeneral li pran apeprè yon ane pou pèmi ak apre sis a nèf mwa lòt pou konsepsyon ak jeni.
 So osi lontan ki nou kapab kontinyen, sa i en bon fason sorti.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3836.325s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Mèsi.
 Ki sa ki sou entèferans nan bilding ki tou pre?
 Tankou nou fè, pandan konstriksyon oswa, ou konnen, apre konstriksyon fini.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3849.11s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: sètènman.
 Nou pral kòmanse, nou pral fè, ou konnen, teste tout bilding ki ozalantou nou ak asire w ke yo estriktirèl bon ak entak anvan nou fè anyen.
 Se sètènman travay di.
 Men, jodi a, tout bilding sa yo konstwi lè l sèvi avèk trepye santral.
 Se konsa, an jeneral, tout bagay se bati soti nan andedan an deyò.
 lè sa a
 An tèm de enpak sou bilding ki ozalantou nou yo, nou ap travay sou sa a nan yon anpil nan zòn iben, nan trè ti kote tankou sa a, souvan tou pre itilizasyon rezidansyèl yo.
 Se konsa, lide a se ke nou bati yon bèl kloti wo ak may opak pou ke ou pa bezwen wè anpil nan sa nou ap fè dèyè sèn nan.
 Erezman, kalite konstriksyon sa a se pa yon pwosesis konstriksyon trè fè bwi.
 Nou pral sètènman ap travay ak vil la ak moun tankou ou nan odyans piblik yo pale sou ki lè ki apwopriye ak bagay konsa.
 Nou pa deranje ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3917.32s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Mèsi.
 Nou vrèman apresye opòtinite pou nou pale paske li vrèman ede.
 Dènye kesyon rapid, gen plis pase 260 inite nan senk etaj, jis soti nan kiryozite, ki gwosè inite mwayèn?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3931.2s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Jis vomi alantou 920.
 Chapit 945 Wi.
 Se konsa, nou panse inite se konseptyèlman konfizyon, e se konsa nou jwenn siyifikasyon an ki graj nan inite nan sa yo gwo bwat zoranj.
 Nou panse ke bagay ki pi enpòtan isit la se pwogramasyon yon seri de pwodwi.
 Medford trè divès nan plizyè domèn tankou nivo revni, edikasyon, kalite travay, ak opsyon transpò.
 Se poutèt sa, kantite inite nou konsidere apwopriye pou estidyo ak ti kabann pi piti.
 Moun sa yo se souvan lokatè ki pi antre nan nivo nou yo, ki poko marye ak ti fi oswa ti gason epi yo ap dirije nan direksyon pou dezyèm etap nan karyè yo.
 Se konsa, li te yon trè fò mache chak trimès.
 Li sanble ke ou selibatè ak plis avanse nan karyè ou, oswa petèt yon ti kras dèyè kote ou toujou ap travay premye oswa dezyèm travay karyè ou, men ou marye epi ou gen yon mennaj oswa konpayon.
 Ou renmen li.
 Se konsa, nan rechèch ki pi resan nou an, nou te panse te gen definitivman plas pou de chanm ak pi gwo kalite inite, men pandan n ap kontinye rechèch, gen yon ti kras mwens pase sa nou te panse.
 Se konsa, mèsi.
 Ou konnen, nou dwe kontinye eseye kalkile bon melanj de mache yo sèvi Medford.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4018.142s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen ta renmen poze prezidan konsèy nou an yon kesyon.
 Li te vle mwen mande li,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4024.407s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Wi, mwen t ap mande si ou ta ka fè yon revizyon estriktirèl nan bilding nan anvan konstriksyon kòmanse.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4030.666s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Èske ou ka tande sa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4032.069s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, nou pa te rive byen lwen nan rechèch la, pwosesis rechèch la.
 Ou konnen, mwen pa panse ke nou bezwen, ou konnen, tankou, nou pa ka kondwi, mwen pa panse ke nou bezwen piling oswa nenpòt bagay konsa.
 Men, tipikman, si gen kèk gwo twoub sou plas, si nou ap fouye twou oswa kondwi pil, oswa si nou ap fè analiz sismik nan tout domèn, nou anboche kèk konpayi ki espesyalize nan sa.
 Sitou lè w toupre yon lòt bilding
 Nou ap travay sou yon pwojè nan Waltham anviwon 12 pye de kèk vwazen.
 Kidonk, ou konnen, nou sèvi ak monitè tranblemanntè ak tout kalite ekipman gwo teknoloji pou asire w ke nou pa fè anyen mal ak vwazen nou yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4078.827s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Mèsi.
 Gen lòt ki vle konfime ke tout bagay inifye e ke biznis yo pa patisyon.
 Magazen Yo Vann an Detay tankou Starbucks oswa ou konnen ak sou sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4089.758s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, nou gen yon gwo kesyon.
 Ou konnen, nou t ap gade estasyon an ateri lòtbò lari a epi nou te panse nou ta ka vle gade nan ajoute itilizasyon komèsyal nan premye etaj la.
 Men, ou konnen, pwoblèm transpò ki te soulve aswè a se youn ke nou sensèman espere.
 Mwen pèsonèlman te wè kèk nan reyinyon yo ak MassDOT ak ki jan yo te reroute entèseksyon sa a.
 Ou konnen, trafik siplemantè a pral afekte a
 Nou kwè ke bagay ki enplike trafik adisyonèl ak enpak tan nan lavant Yo pral tèlman negatif ke li ta ka gen yon enpak negatif sou nou.
 Yon lòt bagay nou ap travay sou se nan gwo demann.
 Ou konnen, si gen yon bon espas pou vann an detay, mwen ta jis di, èspere ke lavant an detay ki pral nan zòn sa a se plis tankou magazen an detay nan estasyon an aterisaj lòtbò lari a.
 Pou egzanp, tankou kounye a, ou pa ka lwe espas nan Starbucks si li pa oto-sèvis.
 Genyen tou anpil détaillants, ki gen ladan lòt boutik kafe, ki pral wout sa a.
 Gen kèk kalite Kafe oswa boutik kafe sanble ap itilize nan dwa pou kote sa a.
 Lè nou te konsidere tout bagay sa yo ak enpak sou trafik, nou te deside elimine pati sa a nan konsèp la.
 Se konsa, li vo diskite plis, men onètman nan yon pèspektiv trafik ak enpak li ta pi mal pou kominote a ak kote a.
 Dènye bagay la se, si ou pa fè li parfe, biznis la pa pral lwe.
 Menm si ou te konnen, menm si li te mwens, nou deside vann li nan yon pri byen anba mache a.
 Soti nan yon pèspektiv planifikasyon iben, espas vid ak degrade se yon pwoblèm reyèl ak tout kalite konsekans negatif, donk mwen byen kontan w ap poze kesyon sa a paske nou pase anpil tan etidye ak diskite sou li, se pou sa n ap pale sèlman sou lojman ak itilizasyon ki gen rapò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4209.242s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Bonjou, non mwen se Gene.
 Mwen gen yon lòt kesyon.
 Ou te di ke ta gen pakin pou yon machin pou chak inite.
 Koulye a, anpil oswa pifò inite yo gen de machin kidonk pa gen okenn kote yo pake nan zòn nan.
 Kisa ou ta fè?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4227.406s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: De bagay.
 Youn se ke mwen pa dakò ak pwennvi ou.
 Pifò nan rezidan nou yo pa itilize machin lakay yo oswa menm nan katye rezidansyèl nou yo paske inite lojman nou yo pi gwo epi popilasyon nou an pi gran epi mwens espesyalize.
 Nou pa nan nivo kote nou genyen an mwayèn 2 machin pou chak inite.
 Men menm si mwen mal, map di nou yon sèl bagay, map mete kòb mwen sou sa mwen di e ki kote nou fè pwojè sa ak lòt pwojè.
 Natirèlman nou ye
 Nou enkyete ke yon moun ka pakin nan lari yo nan zòn ki afekte a, espesyalman 9th Street nan ka sa a.
 Nou ta ka kreye yon kloz senp ki ta rann li ilegal pou rezidan yo pake andeyò sit la epi fòse yo fè sa pa kontra.
 Mwen te fè sa anvan.
 Sa a se yon bagay trè fasil fè.
 Si se yon bagay yon kominote oswa yon vil konsidere enpòtan, nou ka limite li ak mezi egalman drastik.
 Non, mwen pa panse ke se ka a, mwen panse ke O a se kalite konfòtab.
 Mwen panse ke konpetitè nou yo ka diminye kantite a 0.75 pou chak machin oswa yon machin, oswa 0.85 pou chak machin.
 Onètman, mwen panse dekoupaj an zòn Medford a trè pwogresif nan sans sa a.
 Yo pa kapab, evidamman yo te fè kèk rechèch paske nou fè sa tout tan e analiz sa a pa kapab yon konyensidans.
 Yo konnen egzakteman sa kliyan sa a ap fè.
 Se konsa, o, o,
 Nan yon vil tankou Cambridge, mwen oblije pakin mwens.
 Yo ankouraje m 'ale nan lòt kote.
 Nou gen anpil rechèch sou sa.
 Soti nan yon pèspektiv biznis, nou konnen sa nou bezwen.
 Si nou pa gen ase pakin pou kliyan nou yo, yo p ap lwe nan men nou.
 Se konsa, dènye bagay mwen vle fè se mete restriksyon sou pakin san nesesite paske sa pral fè mal biznis nou an.
 Men, si w pa kwè m, m ap limite w ak lajan m.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4346.218s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Padon, mwen jis gen yon dènye kesyon.
 Sa a se kite.
 Antre nan garaj la ak bilding lan se sou Middlesex Avenue, pa Ninth Street.
 Èske sa kòrèk?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4358.503s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Soti nan konsèp sa a, sa a kòrèk.
 Nou gen yon santiman ou pa vle nou mete nouvo machin nan Nevyèm Street.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4363.785s">[Unidentified]</a>: Mèsi.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4387.761s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Konseye, ki jan ou sijere mwen reponn kesyon sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4423.15s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Men, li pa enpòtan.
 Ou tou mansyone pwoblèm nan pakin.
 Si w ale nan Rivers Edge, Moderna oswa Rivers Edge, Moderna Apartments, pakin nan p ap plen.
 Ni inite Rivers Edge ki gen machin.
 Mwen panse ke jou pakin doub machin yo lè tou de machin yo deyò.
 Gen dwa gen kèk moun ki posede de machin, men se fondamantalman jèn moun ak tout Uber yo la ak kèk moun ki pa menm posede machin ankò.
 Gade nan nouvo bilding apatman yo, Moderna ak Rivers Edge.
 Yo pral di w ke yo tout gen pakin epi gen anpil plas pou pakin.
 Pa gen ase moun ki posede machin ankò.
 Mèsi paske w kite nou fè sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4469.202s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Dènye kesyon, Mary Harris, epi apre sa nou pral ale nan fatra avyon an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4475.105s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Wi, mwen apresye kesyon mwen an sou pakin oswa machin, sa a trè valab, mwen te enkyete ke kesyon mwen an ta yon ti kras diferan.
 Se konsa, mwen manke ou nan kòmansman an
 Mike, prezantasyon ou a ak mwen pa tande egzakteman konbyen istwa ou planifye pou konstwi.
 Kesyon mwen an se: Ki sa ki sou tout koulè yo ki ka afekte kote tankou pisin nou yo?
 Ou konnen, ki enpak sa gen nan sezon lete an lè nou ap chita alantou eseye pran plezi kèk?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4511.768s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, premye a se nou te vini ak yon abònman uit nivo epi nou wè yon kominote uit nivo isit la.
 Menm jan ak sitiyasyon an toupre bò nò ak bò sid Route 16, nou sètènman pa t panse li ta apwopriye pou ale pi lwen.
 Se konsa, nan yon pèspektiv rechèch paralèl, franchman, nou pa la ankò.
 Sa a pa estraòdinè pandan pwosesis lisans lan.
 Mwen doute nou pral fè sa isit la.
 Se konsa, mwen eskize.
 Mwen pa konnen egzakteman ki kote pisin ou a, men nou ka gade nan li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4546.449s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Li fè fas a Nevyèm Street.
 Li dwat dèyè Casey.
 Lè mwen pa la, mwen ka wè do kay Casey a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4554.171s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Briyan.
 Wi.
 Mwen vle di, repons lan kout se ke nou pral definitivman gade nan li epi analize li.
 Mwen regrèt mwen pa gen yon bon repons egzat pou ou, sa a pral yon pati nan pwosesis lisans lan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4566.864s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Pandan w ap pwogrese.
 Mèsi.
 Mwen panse ke pifò nan sa nou te gen nan chat la te reponn, men ann tounen nan kesyon an ki te poze: Poukisa yon lokasyon epi yo pa yon apatman?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4587.23s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Gen kèk bon repons, men repons kout la se ke Alliance Homes pa bati apatman ditou.
 Nou se yon konpayi prive.
 Sa a se sa ki diferansye nou de kèk nan konpetitè nou yo.
 Ou konnen, nou pa yon gwoup envestisman bank apiye.
 Nou bati anpil kay chak ane, kèk ane plis pase lòt, men nou vrèman kat patnè prensipal.
 Nou konplètman prive.
 Sa a se yon bagay ke anplwaye nan Phoenix, kote nou gen biwo santral, ap fè tout sa yo kapab pou anpeche envestisè yo patisipe.
 Se konsa, te gen yon apre panse lè bati apatman an, se te yon bagay yo te jis deside yo pa t 'vle fè.
 Se konsa, li se yon bagay estriktirèl ak pwosedi ke nou jis pa fè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4638.742s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Mwen panse ke nou reponn kesyon yo epi diskite sou 9th Street ak kantite chanm yo, 1, 2 ak 3. Mwen panse ke w ap fè sa ki dwat, Mike.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4650.185s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen panse ke wi, konseptyèlman, nou toujou nan kèk kalite flux, kidonk nou toujou ap pale de kalite inite nou yo, men ou konnen, li se yon mache enteresan ak chanje.
 Se konsa, melanj la ap chanje tout tan an, men nou panse sitou nan yon sèl ak de chanm kominote.
 Natirèlman, pral gen kèk inite pi gwo ak pi piti tou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4670.697s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Pwochen kesyon an se sa ki pral rive nan enfrastrikti a.
 Oke, presyon dlo a te tonbe nan nouvo bilding lan.
 Ou konnen, yon moun ta ka reponn ke tout bagay ki fabrike gen yo dwe Enjenieri ak enspekte.
 Travay pou asire enfrastrikti ka sipòte nouvo konstriksyon.
 Mwen pa konnen si ou vle ajoute anyen nan sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4693.424s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen ta ka ajoute sa.
 Mwen ka di ou ke repons lan se prèske sètènman non.
 Nou te teste dlo a.
 Ann teste ke tout sèvis piblik nou bezwen yo disponib.
 Tout telekominikasyon ak kominikasyon, nan kou.
 Gen anpil dlo la ak presyon dlo a bon.
 Anplis de sa, bilding nou an trè wo epi li ka, tankou pa w la, mande pou pwòp ponp dlo pa l.
 Pa si se yon bilding senk etaj oswa mwens.
 Bilding sa a se yon pwopozisyon trè solid, si nou ka fè youn.
 Mwen pa panse ou pral gen enpak sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4731.129s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Youn nan lòt kesyon yo se: Èske pral gen travay sendika oswa ki pa sendika?
 Mwen konnen sa a se nan premye etap yo nan pwojè a tou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4739.397s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Yeah, mwen pral jis di li se jeneralman yon gwo konbinezon.
 sa depann de.
 Teamsters ak travayè beton yo te prèske toujou sendika riggers ak bòs chapant.
 Lè sa a, gen kèk biznis, men nou bay quotes konpetitif sou tout aspè.
 Men repons lan trè, trè kout se nou poko konnen.
 Nou toujou gen anpil travay pou nou fè anvan nou rive la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4759.341s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Èske w ap mande sou ajoute zòn komen, ban, pye bwa lonbraj, nenpòt bagay ki rezidan ki egziste deja yo ka itilize?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4771.045s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi.
 Mwen vle di, mwen panse ke se nan lespri a nan sa nou t ap pale nan kòmansman an, ke nou te gade nan retounen kèk nan asfalt la sou bò lwès ak sid yo ki te orijinèlman gen entansyon yo dwe wout la nan Mysterious Island.
 Rezèvasyon nan Fellsway.
 Natirèlman, mwen vle di, mwen panse ke teknikman li pral pwopriyete prive, men ou konnen, li pral konekte ak tout twotwa yo ak pasaj pou pyeton yo ak tout bagay nan zòn nan.
 Se konsa, repons lan kout se wi.
 Nan zòn sa yo, nou kwè nou kapab pote anpil amelyorasyon nan espas sa yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4805.474s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Mwen panse ke pi fò nan lòt kesyon verifikasyon yo te reponn, eksepte pou youn sou voye videyo reyinyon an pa imel, nan kou imel mwen an se nan lèt la voye epi mwen ka eseye sa. Mon konnen mon ti debat en dernyen meeting akoz sa size meeting.
 Jwenn enfòmasyon sa a bay moun, men tipikman li pral afiche sou sit entènèt konferans Medford la epi li pral la.
 Si moun vle pran yon gade, nan kou ou ka imèl mwen epi mwen pral eseye jwenn yon lyen yo bay li.
 Mwen panse ke chat la fini isit la.
 Gen pwoblèm toujou.
 Kidonk, mwen vle remèsye tout moun ki te vini yo, Mike, ou vle di.
 Kite m jis poze kèk kesyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4856.578s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, mwen jis vle di se te yon patisipasyon enkwayab.
 Mwen rekonesan anvè nou tout.
 Ou pote kesyon trè avanse.
 Ou se yon gwoup byen rechèch.
 Donk, mèsi paske w patisipe.
 Se sa nou, ou konnen, mwen fè, mwen mansyone mwen rete lokalman.
 Sa a se yon bagay mwen vrèman pasyone sou: bati kay nan zòn nan pi gwo Boston.
 Sa yo se tout bon kesyon.
 Sa yo se bagay nou jere atravè tout biznis.
 mwen manke m,
 Mwen pral kenbe travay prop mwen te fè nan tan lontan an.
 Nou bon pou rezoud tout pwoblèm sa yo menm jan ak nenpòt moun, kidonk nou vle vin bon vwazen epi nou bati kay epi, ou konnen, se pa yon laboratwa pou konstwi magazen an detay oswa pa gen anyen ki mal ak nou bati yon plas kote nou vle asire w ke moun aktyèlman vle rete epi jwi kote ou renmen yo.
 Se konsa, mèsi paske w te resevwa nou epi fè nou konnen si gen nenpòt lòt pwoblèm ki te rate e petèt nou pral gen yon dènye chans pou revize yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4912.428s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Gen kesyon sou konstriksyon an, kote machin konstriksyon yo pral estasyone pandan konstriksyon epi si espas pakin nan 9th Street yo pral pèdi akòz plasman idrant dife.
 Ekipman dife, elatriye.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4928.465s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen ta di pwobableman pa.
 Li vrèman depann de depatman ponpye a, men nan yon bilding tankou sa a nou pral gen kèk koneksyon kawotchou andedan bilding lan.
 Se konsa, mwen vle di, si chèf ponpye a te vle yon bouch dife, li ta sètènman fè li, men mwen pa panse ke li ta gen enpak sou okenn pakin si se te ka a.
 Se konsa, premye kesyon an, kesyon anvan an sou machin konstriksyon pakin, ki se yon gwo pwoblèm, espesyalman sou sit, se repons lan kout.
 Ou konnen, lè nou,
 Sorry, ler nou antre dan faz konstriksyon, nou bezwen fer en letid lojistik konplet, en letid travay, e mon krwar tou sa bann travay ki nou annan dan konstriksyon ozordi, nou bann kontrakter pe servi bann parking off-site, donk nou pe fer tou dimoun.
 Se konsa, si gen yon enkyetid ke yo pral kòmanse bloke nan Nevyèm Street, repons lan se non, kenbe timoun nou yo lwen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4982.985s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Apre sa, gen kesyon an, ou konnen, ki jan vwazen yo konnen si ou pral kontinye? Mwen panse ke sa yo pral odyans piblik.
 Si sèlman sa a te kapab reyalize.
 Ou konnen, mwen panse pwochen etap la se idantifye sa li ye.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4998.898s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, mwen vle di, mwen ta jis di, pwobableman pa anvan jou ferye yo si nou kontinye.
 Nou te itilize menm estrikti avi a pou avèti pati adjasan yo nan reyinyon sa a ke nou ta itilize pandan nenpòt lòt reyinyon piblik oswa odyans.
 Se konsa, repons lan kout se: Mwen panse ke yo pwobableman sanble anpil tankou sa a.
 Si nou kontinye, nou pral wè yon bagay nan bwat resepsyon ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=5023.622s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Sa a fini reyinyon an. Mwen swete nou tout yon fèt Thanksgiving kè kontan ak an sekirite epi pran swen tèt ou pandan jou ferye yo. Mèsi tout moun ki koute.
 Mèsi.</p>
