    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=265.599s">[Unidentified]</a>: بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=280.245s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  So these first slides we're going to start with are really just to get you acclimated with the neighborhood.
 I know that sounds silly because many of you live in the immediate area.
 However, we want to just make sure we all get started on the same page and talk about a little bit about the context for where we started our studies and conceptual program for the site.
 So the first one here is, of course, this is East Medford.
 Route 16 runs right across the page left to right.
 And the Fellsway and Middlesex Avenue run north to south.
 The taped site in yellow is the assembled parcels.
 Cappy's is the larger sort of hexagonal building.
 And Monroe Muffler is here on the east side on the property line.
 So the combined site,
 which again are 573 Fellsway, which is Cappy's Liquors, and 20 Revere Beach Parkway just to the east is the Monroe Muffler Shop.
 You'll see to the south here, Station Landing, the Mystic River Reservation off to the southwest, and the shopping centers up to the northwest.
 Of course, Wellington Station is at about 430 on your page.
 We've got a few axios here to show the immediate neighborhood.
 Again, these are really just to kind of show context of how the site fits in with the larger areas.
 We've turned the camera a bit on you.
 So, Route 16 or Revere Beach Parkway is running off to the east towards the top of Page and the Fellsway down to the right and Middlesex Avenue and the Fellsway up to the left.
 Cappy's there is just left of center.
 So obviously the neighborhood really is, you know, primarily seven and eight-story mixed-use buildings, quite a bit of housing in high-rise format.
 And you'll see Wellington just off top right of page.
 We'll flip the camera a bit here and looking southeast now, Cappies again just left of center, Route 16 traveling up and to the left of your screen, and station landing off across, southerly across Route 16 there.
 So looking at these photos, we like this site in the city for a lot of reasons.
 Medford's a great city.
 It features anything a modern resident would want, which is, of course, our business.
 The city is close to Boston, which in itself is always attractive.
 But really, it already has its own deep bench of employment of retail of walkability open space and history so all of those things stitched together to where, where, where our customers would want to live, they want to be close to home, they want to be able to walk to amenities, you know, nobody really wants to be in their car.
 And we've spent some time studying this intersection.
 Growing up in Arlington, I know this intersection well.
 So getting out of your car in this neighborhood is certainly an attractive thing, and Medford offers the ability to do that.
 And this site is really a microcosm more broadly of Medford, having all of those things I just mentioned within sometimes less than 1,000 feet of walking.
 Macro as a Bostonian, this is the type of modern housing I think greater Boston needs and regionally we need in eastern Massachusetts, where people even in cold weather aren't required to get into their vehicle to get a coffee to travel to work to pick up a prescription or to go get a classic roast beef at Kelly's across the street.
 So
 I'm going to move into some site photographs.
 I'm sure you guys are all relatively familiar with this, but I feel like we just want to be thorough.
 So this is a shot looking north of Cappy's, somewhat northeast, with 9th Street just in the back.
 You'll see a blue double two-story home on the left side of the screen with a garage.
 That is the 9th Street area.
 Monroe is just off to the right of your screen.
 This is a shot from Revere Beach Parkway on one of the many curb cuts on these two parcels.
 So we're looking straight north across the property line between Monroe and the Cappy site.
 This is a shot from 9th Street looking south.
 So Station Landing is in the background.
 Monroe is on just left of center and Cappy's, the back of Cappy's is just right of center.
 So you're looking at the intersection basically concealed only by the Cappy's.
 And then this is also a 9th Street shot looking the other direction.
 So you can see Boston Tattoo here in the background and the 9th Street intersection, current intersection and curb cut with Cappy's.
 So this last is an obvious satellite image of the site.
 We've oriented this North and South so we can stop getting you guys dizzy.
 9th Street runs East and West across the top of the site.
 This is Middlesex Avenue on the left, and again, Route 16 on the bottom.
 The property isn't taped, but it is this L-shaped combination of these two parcels, not including the Boston Tattoo Company.
 This is a good start to show where the site planning begins for us, apart from the macro context of the area and the uses that are here and the amenities.
 This is really where we start trying to integrate and stitch those things together into a program.
 On the left and on the south of the site, we're bound by these two roads or parkways.
 These were
 These are actually very interesting if you don't know the history, but these were formerly, like many parkways in greater Boston, were run by the MDC, now DCR.
 The spirit of these roads was effectively, as we were becoming an automobile-focused society, to have a pleasure-driving avenue to explore the area's benefits.
 So you, I'm sure, are all familiar with the Middlesex Bells.
 and the Mystic River reservations.
 These are really just spectacular green spaces, and the former MDC knew that, and they knew that they wanted people to experience those in a pleasurable way.
 So on the south side of the site, you'll see there's a pretty deep, for an urban zone like this, a pretty deep setback with mature trees and paths.
 Believe it or not, there's actually a deed restriction on these sites that allows the parkways to remain what their original intent was.
 So while we might not be putting around in a 57 Chevrolet enjoying the Mystic River Reservation here today,
 I drive on at least three parkways on the way to work every day.
 These are commuter roads now.
 But there's still an opportunity here, we think, to maintain the spirit of what these parkways were initially for.
 And one thing we found interesting was that on the west side of this site, along the Middlesex Avenue, it's paved right to the sidewalk.
 and there so those setbacks and deed notes actually exist there as well and so one of the things we thought might be attractive and seems to mate with some of the intersection plans being discussed is is an ability to use that even though it is on this property rather than leave it as asphalt is to try and continue that parkway um parkway spirit the paths put mature trees and native plantings there and the like um so
 We think restoring that buffer could be a real opportunity.
 So I'm going to move to the next shot.
 This is an actual concept we're working with.
 And it's roughly centered on the page as this is.
 So again, you'll see the, well, mislabeled Fellsway.
 That's technically Middlesex, of course, but Revere Beach Parkway on the bottom.
 And you'll see how we're looking at really adding back into those buffer zones, as I mentioned before, some of the green spaces.
 A number of other things worth highlighting as we get into this we're going to show you some more details on on how we program space conceptually.
 This community's proposed at 265 units of rental housing, we do not build condominiums in an eight story format with 100% of the resident parking enclosed within the building so.
 A lot of the surface parking areas that are on the perimeter of the area and nearby sites, we're going to instead work to green those up and bring the parking inside the envelope completely.
 We'll talk a little more about the rest of the program.
 But to get you started, effectively, we craft these communities so that they are a completely enclosed community.
 And so by that I mean, while this looks like a pretty normal building,
 from the outside, all of our building systems are located internally.
 So, trash, refuse collection and recycling, separation, emergency services and access, all of our amenities, or most of the amenities, I should say, that are internal to the site.
 Everything is neatly encapsulated within the envelope of the building we propose here.
 So, you'll see on the site, there's donut shape is primarily the mass of the building.
 However, there is a hole in the middle and we'll use that courtyard to have some outdoor private space for residents.
 That's a little more private than perhaps walking across the street to the mystic river.
 But typically, and we'll show you some photos of how we treat these spaces.
 But these spaces typically have a large pool deck, sort of resort styled.
 We'll have outdoor cooking areas, lounges and cabanas and that sort of thing.
 A space where, you know, to kind of center the entire community around.
 On the upper left of the page, you'll note we've got a curb cut proposed here off of Middlesex.
 And in fact, to expand on that, the site currently features five curb cuts.
 And I'm sure we'll spend a lot of time talking about traffic and parking here.
 But the big story here is we're going to try and eliminate all of those curb cuts but one.
 We have not engaged a traffic engineer at this time.
 However, we've done enough of these to know that on a busy intersection like this, particularly one that's in flux for its future, that the less interruption and the less curb cuts that you're delivering traffic onto, the better.
 Excuse me.
 So our goal here would be to eliminate as many of those curb cuts in this planet, four of the five would be would be removed from the site.
 Inside the garage, so residents will drive into the building here, just above where it says loading, and there'll be three levels of parking.
 So the first three levels of the program would all be structured parking and other building services, and then all of the housing, but for a very few units, would be located on floors four and above.
 So we're gonna dig into the building here a little bit.
 This would be the first level if you were to just shave everything on floors two through eight off.
 And so as you arrive, you'll see the only surface parking we're proposing is just at the amenity area.
 That's also where we would have our 24-hour leasing and staff located.
 So future residents might use these spaces if they were to come look at a home or to check out the community.
 So that that sort of area all on the west side labeled as amenity would be a two story volume focused on the leasing and then a number of different amenities, which we'll talk a little bit about later.
 but primarily work from home type spaces, screening rooms, flex spaces.
 And we'll show you some of the other examples of what we do for fun in those spaces.
 So those would be separated from the garage element.
 The next two levels above this would also be parking served by internal ramps.
 So invisible to the outside.
 This would be an upper garage.
 parking floor like two or three you'll note that now above the common program area will add some homes and there'll be some again on the south side until we get to the upper residential floors, such as this where it'll be all housing on force for and above.
 So we'll also in these upper floors probably have some amenities.
 We're finding that most surprising amount of people are not going back to the office.
 And so the flex time and work from home spaces are becoming an important part of our business.
 So while some people may go to work, the typical customer here is working in a high tech or an R&D type
 And those have, you know, non traditional non nine to five types of hours.
 So we're now building our amenities to make those spaces more pleasurable and make your sort of to help you separate work from home, even when you are near home, as you would be in this.
 So we've added some, these shots are what we call axiometrics.
 These shots were created with the intent to kind of stitch what we're proposing into the neighborhood.
 So you'll notice, like most of the buildings around here, this is also eight stories.
 I think one of the station landing buildings up front is seven.
 but you'll see we're looking to pull things back off of the parkways and contribute back to what that sort of original mission was for those roadways and also just give this a little bit of a softer edge on what is a very hard-edged zone.
 So this we've also picked these spaces to
 try to relate to the aerial views we showed you earlier.
 So where we were showing you a photo very similar to this of the Cappies and Monroe site to show you how this would stitch into those with the massing around it.
 Now, this is a shot looking south, excuse me, southeast.
 So Ninth Street would be just in front of the building here in your view and the Middlesex Avenue and the Fells Way coming basically straight up the page on the right side.
 station landings here in the back.
 We're proposing a lot of verticality.
 This is what we'd call a Vitruvian style building.
 It's very classic.
 We're not sure this is the space based on what's around it.
 There's a lot of brick.
 There's a lot of sort of traditional materials.
 Station landing is a relatively classic and timeless architecture.
 So we didn't feel it was appropriate to use some of the real contemporary modern looks.
 for this space.
 So we stuck with some pretty classic verticality and spacing and dimensions to the building.
 To help you stay oriented, this was the small little future resident parking area, and the garage entry would be right here.
 And again, these first three levels, despite the fact that they look traditional with windows and the like, would actually be just the same cladding, just enclosing the parking structure.
 So this is a similar angle to the one we just showed you just brought down from from the seagull residents of Medford's viewpoint to get you down to a more pedestrian scale.
 Again this is where those future resident spots in the curb cut on the middle section might be and a garage parking entrance here if you can see my cursor moving.
 So
 This is, again, this is an early concept, so this may look developed, and we have looked at a couple of other options, but this is sort of the path we've been going stylistically with the concept.
 Next, we're gonna show you some photos of other projects we've done in Greater Boston that have things that we think at least conceptually belong in a project like this.
 This is a community we built called The Val that we've just finished, or just finishing leasing up.
 And so some of the things you'll note here is a big two-story volume at the arrival.
 I mentioned that there was that amenity labeled space was also amenities, but also our leasing and management staff.
 So this is a good example of how we integrate some of these things.
 On the right side of this feature wall is actually the back of house where at all times you can find somebody on our team working there.
 But there's also this sort of hotel-styled arrival here, which is some of the way
 apartment home communities are going.
 So there's someone here at all times kind of giving you a more full service feeling during the
 well, during regular hours, more full service feeling to the building.
 And then you'll see these two stories and a feature stair.
 This is something we'd like to integrate in this project as well, where we really are stitching together some of these assembly spaces, work from home spaces, or maybe you're just scrolling and rolling with your earbuds in and your music on, but places where this is a little more activated and a little more public.
 This actually, this wall was, we had a local artist custom paint it for us in sort of a thematic nod to the name.
 This is a project we built two years ago called The Cove.
 This is another idea of just some of those sort of flex spaces where this is really,
 more recreational space, obviously a pool table, there's actually a beer tap back there and wine, excuse me, and a wine cooler.
 But this is a space that would also be, we would propose something like stylistically different, of course, right near those amenity and leasing spaces, a little more open concept.
 This is one of our fitness centers we just completed.
 This one's actually done on two levels.
 We had a lot of fun with this one.
 We're utilizing private mirror rooms for online workouts and then of course all the traditional cardio.
 So this one has actually up top of this spiral staircase has a cardio deck and then the rest of your workout is all below here.
 So you can get an idea of how we really want to create an enclosed, fully encapsulated community, but in a very first class way.
 This is a pool deck shot.
 So this is an important one because this is a good analogy for how we would treat that center of the donut type space you saw.
 This is also a green roof on deck.
 These trees, while brand new, will grow to be full 40 foot sugar maples and red maples.
 So we have a team that understands how to put
 full-sized real vegetation on top of a deck.
 Under this is a parking level, not unlike we would propose on this site.
 Then a full, of course, heated pool and resort style, three, four months of the year, great place to hang out with your iPad or just get some sun.
 This is a good example of how we would treat that.
 This is in the same project at the Val I mentioned earlier, similar green roof.
 You know, you'll see something.
 We had some taller trees at the inception here, but, and some lawn back there, which is hard to see, but we fully green up hard and soft scape.
 This one has a cool sun deck where you can throw your chaise lounge right in the water.
 It's heated and, and hang out, you know, we'll have fire, we have a large fire pit.
 And then this one, you can actually see the grilling stations, private grilling areas where you and your friends can kind of hang out.
 and have dinner.
 And then this is just, we just wanted to give you an idea of what some of our apartment homes look like.
 Alliance is a little different than some of our more cookie cutter national competitors.
 I'm not here to throw shade at any of them.
 There's a lot of great groups out there.
 We just really kind of treat each project with a little bit more of a customized approach.
 And so, you know, in our Hingham asset, you know, that was more appropriate to have a little bit more of a coastal New England style and a little bit more classic sort of features.
 You know, at workforce spaces, you might want to be a little cooler, have a little bit more fun with some of the design, a little less safe.
 And then, of course, the unit mix and the lighting and all that changes.
 So this is a good example.
 We actually did two different types of backsplash tile with a custom featured backsplash tile behind the range.
 and sort of things like that.
 But we build, you know, the goal is to build, you know, first class modern housing from connectivity to finishes and the like.
 And so that is that.
 Let's see if I can understand how to put this off.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1583.975s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: ឥឡូវនេះ យើងត្រៀមខ្លួនជាស្រេចដើម្បីឆ្លើយសំណួរ ដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងនៅតែត្រូវធ្វើ ហើយលើកដៃឡើងប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់បាន។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1607.608s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: هل يمكننا أن نسأل؟ لست متأكدًا من أنه يمكننا أن نبدأ بالسؤال.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1613.152s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: بينما تمضي قدمًا، فأنت لست صامتًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1615.393s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 حسنًا، مثالي.
 شكرا لك
 حسنًا، شكرًا على الملاحظة، على ما أعتقد.
 أولا أنا أعرفك.
 حسنًا، أولاً وقبل كل شيء، قطع الرصيف محددة، لذا أعتقد أنك تحب سلاسة القسم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1630.277s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: لذا فإن الأرصفة هي أرصفة، وسوف تشعر بخيبة أمل، فهي ليست قطعة فنية رائعة، إنها مجرد رصيف، وهو طريق رئيسي يمكن أن يصبح جزءًا مهمًا من الطرق العامة على الأراضي الخاصة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1645.285s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: حسنًا، أعلم أنك ذكرت ذلك، كما تعلم، هناك شعور كبير بأن الناس لا يحتاجون إلى الرغبة في استخدام سياراتهم، ربما يريدون العمل من المنزل.
 لقد قلت أيضًا أن هناك الكثير من الأشخاص في فريق البحث والتطوير الذين يعرفون من يمكنه الانتقال إلى هنا.
 كما تعلمون، بوسطن هي مركز ضخم لصناعة التكنولوجيا الحيوية، وكما تعلمون، يبدو أن الكثير من الناس يتجولون بالسيارة.
 عليهم أن يذهبوا إلى المختبر.
 حسنًا
 أعلم أنك ذكرت أننا مازلنا في المراحل الأولى، لكنني أعتقد أن الأمر يتعلق بإيجاد طريق الشحن الصحيح.
 كيف تنظر إلى من يمكنه الوصول؟
 ليس الأمر وكأنك تقوم فقط بتعيين الأشخاص الذين يمكنهم العمل من المنزل.
 أعتقد أن هناك العديد من الأسباب التي تجعلك تعتقد أنك تعلم، بما في ذلك أنا، أنني أعمل في مجال التكنولوجيا الحيوية.
 يغادر الناس هنا للذهاب إلى كامبريدج وبرلنغتون.
 وكما تعلمون، أرى الكثير من الأشخاص في الصناعة الذين ما زالوا بحاجة إلى المكتب العلمي، وهذا يمثل غالبية الصناعة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1710.315s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم، هذا سؤال جيد.
 البعض منهم يتأكد من أنك تستشهد بهم بشكل صحيح.
 أعني، أولاً وقبل كل شيء، كما تعلمون، هذه تقديرات، يمكنني أن أخبرك من هم العملاء المتكررون في السوق المستهدف، أستطيع أن أخبرك من هم المستأجرين المتكررين.
 لكننا بالطبع نبني منازل للناس.
 نحاول تصميم منتجاتنا لفهم الأشخاص الأكثر اهتمامًا بالعيش في الفضاء.
 لكنك على حق تماما.
 أعني
 السيارات أمر لا مفر منه ويمكن العثور عليها في أي تقاطع.
 بالطبع، لا يزال بعض الأشخاص يتنقلون إلى العمل، سواء كنت تعمل في مجال التكنولوجيا الحيوية أو غيرها من الصناعات.
 لديّ صديق يعمل في وزارة الدفاع للبحث والتطوير، وقد تكون الساعة الثانية صباحًا.
 عندما تنتهي العملية أو الاختبار، يقوم الجميع بتسجيل الدخول إلى Slack أو Teams ويقولون: "حسنًا، دعنا نذهب، الجميع يحزمون أمتعتهم ويذهبون".
 أريد أن أقول إننا بالطبع لا نضع لأنفسنا أهدافًا محددة ولا نتفاعل مع أسعار الإيجار، فنحن نرحب بأي شخص.
 لكن هؤلاء هم الأشخاص الذين يأتون دائمًا إلى هنا، كما تعلمون، قد يكون شخص ما مهتمًا بالقدوم إلى موقع هينغهام عند المدخل إذا أراد التجول قليلاً، كما تعلمون، وأعتقد أن الفكرة هنا هي، كما تعلمون، ليس عليك القيادة لشراء القهوة أو الذهاب إلى Walgreens وإلا سيشترون لحم البقر الخاص بك أو شيء من هذا القبيل.
 ولكن من وجهة نظر مهنية، قد يكون مثاليًا لسوقنا المستهدف.
 لقد كان شابًا محترفًا ومتعلمًا جيدًا، وكما تعلمون، لهذا السبب قمنا ببناء منازل في منطقة أكبر من بوسطن.
 كاتي، أود أن أطلب منك مساعدتي في الصمت والسكوت، ولكن بما أنني لست متأكدًا من أن لدي الحق في القيام بذلك.
 لذلك أنا متأكد من أنك سوف تساعدني في حل هذه المشكلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1832.817s">[Unidentified]</a>: هل يمكننا القفز؟
 ريكي، إلى متى يمكن أن يستمر هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1843.122s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: أعتقد أننا يجب أن نناقش أولا.
 أعتقد أننا تلقينا بعض الأسئلة من سكان ويلينغتون سيركل.
 إذا كنت لا تزال مسجلاً للدخول، هل تريد تسجيل الخروج؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1861.02s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: أنا كل شيء.
 لذلك أريد أن أسألك عن 93.
 يرجى الاستمرار.
 أنت تقول أنه مضحك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1872.247s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: كان هناك رجل على وشك أن يسأل.
 دعونا نواصل الأولاد.
 أنت لست صامتا.
 في باسيفيك بوليفارد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1878.511s">[Unidentified]</a>: أين؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1879.312s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: شارع المحيط الهادئ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1884.157s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: يبدو أنه لم يعد لدينا أي جيران في منطقة ويلينغتون بعد الآن.
 أعتقد أننا سنصور هذا المشهد من أعلى الشاشة.
 لورين. يبدو أن لديك اليد العليا.
 إذا أردت، يمكنني استبعادك وطرح أسئلتك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1899.089s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: سننقذ القطة حتى النهاية لنكتشف من رفع يده ونمضي قدمًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1907.962s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: نعم، السؤال الوحيد الذي لدي قصير جدًا: هل تريد بناء جسر للمشاة عبر التقاطع لتسهيل حركة المرور؟ وبما أنني أشعر أن هناك الكثير من الأشخاص، فقد تكون طريقة T مفيدة حيث لا يتم استخدامها حاليًا بشكل فعال.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1933.541s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم، أعني أنني سأكون صادقًا معك، الدولة تسمح ببناء الجسور عبر طرقنا السريعة عبر المركز الترفيهي.
 ومن ناحية أخرى، لهذا قد نحتاج إلى حزمة أكبر.
 مجرد استخدام الطريق المنحدر والعوائق في الممارسة العملية. لقد شاهدت برنامجًا مشابهًا في كامبريدج.
 مر قطار الركاب، أي أننا سنرى ونفعل كل شيء، لكن لسوء الحظ، تركت لدي انطباعات جيدة جدًا.
 حسنًا، ربما هذا شيء لا يمكننا إدراجه، ربما لم يبق أي سكن بعد بناء هذا الجسر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1977.11s">[Unidentified]</a>: شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1980.232s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: لا أعرف كيف أرفع يدي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1984.054s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ليندا، تعالي، نحن مستعدون لاستقبالك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1986.19s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: أنا من ولنجتون وأنا عضو مجلس إدارة في Wellington Apartments.
 لا يمكن للمسار التاسع أن يستوعب مركبات أكثر من الموجودة، خاصة وأن اللافتة تقع في شارع Venerable West Avenue وتمنح العلامة التجارية مساحة للتنفس.
 جهازي يشير إلى المسار التاسع كل صباح.
 هناك 3-4 حافلات كل يوم.
 أرى حافلة.
 وهذه مشكلة تقلقنا كثيرا.
 أعرف هذا لأن العديد من الجيران كتبوا لي.
 الأسئلة التي أطرحها مهمة أيضًا بالنسبة لي.
 كل شهرين نبذل قصارى جهدنا للحفاظ على المنزل والتخلص من الآفات. لدينا محطة للطعم ويمكنك الحفر بالعمق الذي تريده.
 فيما يتعلق بمواقف السيارات، أعتقد أن هذه المنطقة قد لا تحظى بشعبية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2053.406s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: لا أعرف كيف أرفع يدي أيضًا، لكني أدعم ليندا.
 أنا أعيش في باركواي بلازا ساوث.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2062.814s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: ديبورا. إذا تمكنا من الوصول إليك بعد هؤلاء الأشخاص، فسوف أبقيك في القائمة وأضيفك بمجرد أن نعرف من الموجود في القائمة.
 لكن لدي رقم هاتفك حتى تتمكن من الانضمام بعد أن نتحقق من الأشخاص الذين رفعوا أيديهم.
 كان هناك ثلاثة أشخاص أمامنا وكنت أشاهدهم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2079.292s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ليندا، هذه أسئلة رائعة، وستلاحظ أنه في الخطة المفاهيمية لم نقم بتضمين الحجب المتعمد وقمنا بالفعل بإزالة بعض الحجب بين هذه المناطق والطريق السريع 9.
 لذا، كما تعلمون، نشك في أن هذا سيحدث.
 موضوع ساخن.
 أخبرنا سكان آخرون في المدينة أن هذه مشكلة في الشارع التاسع.
 أعتقد أننا قمنا ببعض الأشياء الواعية، وحاولنا احترام سيارتنا وإبعادها عن الرقم تسعة.
 لكنني أعتقد أن هناك بعض الأشياء المفيدة التي لا نقوم بها عن قصد.
 ثلاثة أرصفة في شارع ويست ريفر بيتش
 عند هذه النقطة، يمكنك بسهولة الانعطاف يمينًا والذهاب إلى محطة Monroe أو عبر محطة Cappies واتخاذ الطريق السريع 9 إلى التقاطع، وإزالة إشارة المرور الرئيسية عند التقاطع، والتوجه شمالًا عبر Fellsway أو Middlesex.
 لذا أعتقد أن ما نقوم به عن عمد لا يسبب بالتأكيد ألمًا جديدًا.
 لكنني أعتقد أنه من خلال خطة التطوير التي نقترحها، سنمنع الآن الناس من عبور شارع 9.
 أود أن أقول إنه ينبغي تخفيضه إلى حد ما.
 عذرًا، لا أعرف أين يقع طريق الجرانيت الذي يحمل العلامة التي ذكرتها، فلنكتشف ذلك.
 لكن أولئك الذين يمرون بهذه الحزم لن يتمكنوا بالتأكيد من القيام بذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2185.727s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: أعتقد أنه أزعجني.
 لا يزال بإمكاني سماعك. أوه، أنا بخير، لقد فقدت الإشارة الموجودة في نهاية الطريق السريع رقم 9، والذي يمتد من متنزه ريفيو بيتش إلى ذا كيز. آه، شقق ويلينجتون، بالطبع هناك علامات من الطريق السريع 9 إلى Key Factory، وأكثر من ذلك بكثير منذ وصولي إلى هنا.
 المدينة تحتل النصف الثاني.
 حسنًا، لدي توازي مع الرقم 6 بالخارج في المنتصف.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2221.06s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: لذا، ليس هناك الكثير مما يمكننا فعله، ولكن مرة أخرى، سيؤدي هذا بالتأكيد إلى القضاء على الاختناقات المرورية حيث يقفز الناس حاليًا على إشارات المرور.
 كما أننا لا ننصح بإضافة سيارات الليلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2236.131s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: نعم، لأنني أعني أنها تنمو. لقد عشت هنا منذ ما يقرب من 30 عامًا ولا أستطيع أن أصدق حجمها.
 خلال هذا الوقت.
 وهذا أمر مقلق.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2249.175s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: أستطيع أن أخبرك يا ليندا، لقد قمنا ببعض التحركات الإبداعية مع وسائل النقل المحلية.
 لا أعرف إذا كان بإمكاني أن أقدم لك الحل الأمثل. أعلم أننا لا نستطيع ذلك.
 لكنني بالتأكيد سأكون مستمعًا جيدًا وأختار أفضل الخبراء حتى ندمج هذا التقاطع الجديد في هذا القسم. ومع ذلك، فإن هذا قد يؤثر على مخاوف سكان الشارع التاسع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2273.261s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: يومًا ما سيكون لدينا اجتماع خاص، مثلًا في قاعة المدينة أو شيء من هذا القبيل، هل تعرف ما أعنيه؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2280.587s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم، أعتقد أن هناك بعض القضايا التي ستطرح في المناقشة، وسنتناولها بمزيد من التفصيل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2287.492s">[Unidentified]</a>: بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2288.593s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: الجواب: لست متأكدا.
 جزء مما نخطط له ونفعله الآن هو الدراسة.
 وهذا ما نسميه فترة البقاء.
 نحن ننظر في كل شيء بدءًا من حقوق الملكية والعقود وحتى المتطلبات البيئية، وكيفية الحصول على التصاريح، وما إلى ذلك، والتحدث مع الجيران والأشياء التي لا نعرفها. هدفنا الرئيسي اليوم هو الاستماع إلى آراء الآخرين حتى نتمكن من المضي قدمًا والدخول في عملية مفتوحة تتضمن اجتماعات أكثر انفتاحًا ورسمية.
 مقدمة بصراحة، قد يكون هناك إجابة أفضل.
 لقد علمنا بما سمعناه منك ومن المدينة اليوم، لذلك نريد أن نضع ذلك في الاعتبار وألا نكتفي بتقديم أفكار لبرامج جديدة لم نقم بالبحث عنها أو فهمها بشكل صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2341.722s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 هذا هو كيلسي. أعتقد الآن أنه يمكنك القيام بذلك بنفسك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2350.097s">[Scalise]</a>: شكرا لك
 مرحبًا، اسمي كريستينا وأملك باركواي بلازا ويست.
 وأنا أؤيد هذا النهج في التنمية.
 أعتقد أنه يجب أن يكون هناك تطوير أكثر كثافة في منطقة توقف وسائل النقل العام.
 لكن لدي قلقان بشأن البناء.
 أحدهما هو ما قاله الآخرون.
 في الشارع التاسع، كانت ليندا على حق: حتى لو قمت بإزالة حواجز الطرق هذه، فلن يعبر الناس موقف السيارات لأنها، بصراحة، منطقة كوارث، لكنهم سيقودون سياراتهم إلى برينرد ثم إلى الشارع التاسع.
 إنها تقع على الطريق السريع 9 وهي صغيرة جدًا، لذا فإن سؤالي الأول هو: هل هذه شركتك أم كان لديك واحدة من قبل؟
 لقد قام ببعض الأعمال مع المجتمع الذي بناه لتحسين هذا الطريق، ربما بنوايا حسنة لأن 9 للأسف هو طريق خاص.
 كل شيء على حاله، الأرصفة تحتاج إلى تحسين.
 أعتقد أنه سيكون من الرائع لو كانت هناك طريقة.
 لذلك سؤالي الأول هو: هل لديكم؟
 هل لدى شركتك اهتمام أو خبرة في المساعدة في تحسين الطرق؟
 نظرًا لعدم قطع الرصيف، سيبدأ الناس في التحرك من برينرد باتجاه الطريق السريع 9 لتجنب التقاطع.
 سؤالي الثاني يتعلق بالحد من مشاكل القوارض لأنني قرأت للتو عن أشخاص كانت لديهم كوابيس حول مشاكل القوارض عندما بدأوا مشاريع بناء واسعة النطاق.
 قرأت اليوم مقالًا عن إطلاق Somerville وBrookline لجيل جديد من الصناديق الذكية.
 هل تستخدم شركتك أدوات مكافحة القوارض الأساسية في عملياتها الحالية أم أنك تخطط للاستثمار في تقنيات مكافحة القوارض المتقدمة؟
 أوه، نظرًا لأنه ليس لدينا العديد من أصحاب الشقق في دائرة كهربائية قصيرة، أعتقد أنه سيكون من المؤسف إذا تسبب ذلك في مشكلة كبيرة للقوارض.
 شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2493.5s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: لذا فلنقم بالأول والأخير لأنني أعتقد أنني قرأت هذا المقال هذا الصباح ولم أسمع مطلقًا بهذه التكنولوجيا.
 تذكر ما كان يطلق عليه؟
 هذا هو الصندوق الذي حصلوا عليه.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2505.07s">[Scalise]</a>: الصندوق الذكي المقاوم لـ Cymex.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2507.612s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: នោះហើយជាវា។
 បាទ ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ដែល​ឮ​អំពី​រឿង​នោះ​ទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចាប់​អារម្មណ៍។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាបានមើលវានៅព្រឹកនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះដំណាក់កាលទី 1 រួមមានបីដំណាក់កាលនៃបញ្ហាសត្វកកេរ។
 ទីមួយ ក្នុងអំឡុងពេលដំណើរការសាងសង់ ច្បាប់តម្រូវឱ្យយើងខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងច្រើន។
 ខ្ញុំអាចនិយាយបានថាពួកគេមានប្រសិទ្ធភាពណាស់។
 តាមពិតទៅ យើង​ត្រូវ​បាន​ច្បាប់​តម្រូវ​ឱ្យ​ជួល​អ្នកជំនាញ​សត្វកកេរ។
 បុគ្គលនេះត្រូវតែជាសមាជិកនៃក្រុមរបស់យើងពេញមួយដំណើរការសាងសង់។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាវាមិនមែនជាអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងទេ ប៉ុន្តែវាជាជំហានដំបូង។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាតើបច្ចេកទេសនេះអាចទៅរួច ឬប្រសិនបើក្រុមហ៊ុនកំចាត់សត្វល្អិតដែលយើងធ្វើការជាមួយប្រើវា។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាចង់សុំឱ្យពួកគេធ្វើបែបនេះ ព្រោះវាហាក់ដូចជាបច្ចេកវិទ្យាគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ណាស់។
 រឿងទីពីរគឺអ្នកដឹងទេ
 យើង​សង់​ផ្ទះ​ហើយ​ព្យាយាម​ប្រាប់​មនុស្ស​ថា​យើង​សង់​ផ្ទះ​ស្អាត។
 ដូច្នេះ​អ្វី​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​បាន​ចុង​ក្រោយ​គឺ​ការ​រាតត្បាត​របស់​សត្វ​កណ្ដុរ​នៅ​ក្នុង ឬ​ជុំវិញ​សង្កាត់​របស់​ខ្ញុំ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំត្រូវស្វែងយល់បន្ថែមនៅទីនេះ ហើយសន្មតថាយើងអាចបន្តនៅទីនេះ Matt និង Greg នឹងក្លាយជាអ្នកជំនាញកណ្តុរក្នុងតំបន់នៅលើទូរស័ព្ទ។
 និយាយឱ្យត្រង់ទៅ ខ្ញុំមិនយកឥណទានណាមួយសម្រាប់រឿងនោះទេ។
 នោះ​នឹង​ជា​ការ​ខិត​ខំ​អាត្មានិយម ព្រោះ​យើង​មិន​ចង់​បាន​វា​ដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងមានការគ្រប់គ្រងសត្វល្អិតនៅក្នុងថវិកាប្រតិបត្តិការរបស់យើង ហើយដូចដែលអ្នកអាចស្រមៃបាន វាមាន 150 បន្ទាត់ ហើយនេះគឺជារឿងមួយដែលត្រូវបានរួមបញ្ចូល ហើយវាជាអ្វីមួយដែលយើងនឹងធ្វើបន្ទាប់ពីការសាងសង់។
 បាទ ត្រឹមត្រូវហើយ។
 នេះគឺជាទីមួយ។
 ទីពីរ​គឺ​អំពី​ការ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រសើរ​ឡើង​នៅ​ផ្លូវ Ninth Street និង​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​នៅ​កន្លែង​ផ្សេង។
 ចម្លើយចំពោះសំណួរទាំងពីរគឺ បាទ/ចាស ស្ទើរតែគ្រប់ពេល ហើយយើងដឹងខ្លះថា អាត្មានិយម ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងមិនរាប់បញ្ចូលនោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែយើងចង់បានសហគមន៍ល្អ ហើយខ្ញុំនឹងមិនសាងសង់នៅលើដីបៃតងនោះទេ។
 កន្លែងទាំងអស់ដែលយើងបានសាងសង់គឺជាអគារឧស្សាហកម្មចាស់ៗ ឬអគារការិយាល័យដែលខូច ហើយដោយមិនធ្វើឱ្យខូចកេរ្តិ៍ឈ្មោះរបស់ Cappy's គ្រឿងបរិក្ខារគឺល្អណាស់ ហើយខ្ញុំបានទិញនៅទីនោះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែគោលដៅរបស់យើងគឺមិនមែនដើម្បីបំផ្លាញកន្លែងថ្មីទេ។
 វាពាក់ព័ន្ធនឹងការកែលម្អដីដែលទទួលមរតកតាមរយៈការជួសជុលអចលនទ្រព្យដែលបានទទួលមរតក។
 ដូច្នេះ ការធ្វើឱ្យ Ninth Street កាន់តែទាក់ទាញ គឺដើម្បីផលប្រយោជន៍របស់យើង។
 នេះពិតជារឿងដែលយើងចង់ពិភាក្សាជាមួយអ្នក។
 យើង​មាន​គម្រោង​ខាង​ផ្លូវ​លេខ​៩។
 អ្នកដឹងថាផ្លូវក្រាលកៅស៊ូមើលទៅដូចម្ដេច ហើយអ្នកដឹងពីរបៀបដែលការកាត់ asphalt ទាំងនេះសមឥតខ្ចោះ។
 អ្នកដឹងថាយើងនឹងមានវេទិកាថ្មីមួយចំនួនទាក់ទងនឹងរឿងនោះ ហើយជាការពិតណាស់ ប្រសិនបើយើងបន្តកែលម្អ និងស្ថាបនាឡើងវិញនូវសតិបណ្ដោះអាសន្នព្រំដែន Parkway នោះអ្នកដឹងថាពួកគេនឹងត្រូវរួមបញ្ចូលជាមួយវាផងដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ចម្លើយ​ខ្លី​គឺ​ពិត​ជា៖ យើង​ចង់​និយាយ​ទៅ​កាន់​អ្នក​អំពី​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​អាច​ធ្វើ​ដើម្បី​កែលម្អ​ផ្លូវ Ninth Street។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកមានសំណួរទីបី។ ខ្ញុំភ្លេចអ្វីមួយ ហើយនឹកអ្វីមួយ។
 សូមអរគុណ</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2696.694s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: أعتقد أنك التالي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2700.316s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_30]</a>: شكرا جزيلا على وقتك.
 لقد قلت أنك محلي، لذلك أنا متأكد من أنك تعرف أن كاتي ستكون مشغولة للغاية خلال عيد الشكر وعيد الميلاد.
 هل يتحدث أي شخص عن استخدام بيانات مبيعات Cappy أو شرطة الولاية أو الشرطة المحلية لأن لديهم دائمًا أشخاصًا متوقفين على الرصيف لإلقاء نظرة على حركة المرور المحلية ومساعدتك في تحديد نوع الاختناقات المرورية التي سيسببها مبنى بهذا الحجم؟
 ربما بسبب حجم كابي.
 ما أعنيه هو أن المشتري ربما يكون معادلاً للشاغلين الذين يعيشون في المبنى ويديرونه. يمكن أن يوفر كلاهما بيانات عن عدد الأشخاص والمركبات القادمة والمغادرين، وأنواع الاضطرابات التي تسببها، خاصة في
 عندما يكون هناك الكثير من حركة المرور المارة.
 فهل هناك أي نقاش حول جمع البيانات الأسبوع المقبل؟
 نظرًا لأنه عيد الشكر، فهذا يعني أن معبر كابي سيفتح وسيتجمع الناس مرة أخرى، لذلك سيكون مزدحمًا.
 وربما يمكن استخدام هذه البيانات لتحديد نوع حركة المرور أو المشاكل التي سيسببها هذا النوع من الإنشاءات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2785.256s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ជា​ការ​ពិត​ណាស់ អ្វី​ខ្លះ​នោះ​គឺ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រាកដ​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​យល់​ពី​ចំណុច។
 និយាយឱ្យត្រង់ទៅ យើងនៅតែឆាប់ពេកក្នុងដំណើរការជួលអ្នកប្រឹក្សាផ្នែកដឹកជញ្ជូន។ ជាធម្មតា ខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើមចំណាយលុយនៅពេលដែលខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងអាចមានអារម្មណ៍សុខស្រួលទទួលយកហានិភ័យដែលយើងត្រូវទទួលយកដើម្បីបន្ត។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងហៅ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំនឹងប្រាប់អ្នកពីរឿងនេះ
 វាត្រូវបានគេហៅថា ITE ។
 នៅពេលដែលយើងជួលអ្នកជំនាញទាំងនេះ ពួកគេមិនចូលចិត្តប្រើទិន្នន័យអក្ខរាវិរុទ្ធទេ។
 អញ្ចឹងខ្ញុំនឹងហៅទៅមើលថា តើមានវិធីណាក្នុងការបញ្ចូលវាទេ ពីព្រោះនៅក្នុងពេលវេលារបស់យើង អ្នកដឹងទេ តាមការពិត យើងនឹងមិនទេ សន្មត់ថាយើងបន្ត នោះនឹងនៅដើមឆ្នាំក្រោយ អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងមានប្រអប់ជាច្រើនដែលត្រូវពិនិត្យមុនពេលចូលឆ្នាំថ្មី ដើម្បីមើលថាតើយើងចង់បន្តធ្វើកិច្ចការនេះដែរឬទេ។
 ជាអកុសល នេះមានន័យថា ដល់ពេលដែលយើងធ្វើការសិក្សាផ្លូវការទាំងនេះ ដែលនឹងចំណាយពេលច្រើនខែ យើងនឹងហួសពីការថ្លែងអំណរគុណ។
 ដូច្នេះ​សំណួរ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ​គឺ៖ តើ​អ្នក​គិត​ឬ​សម្រប​ខ្លួន​ទៅ​នឹង​រឿង​នេះ​ដោយ​របៀប​ណា?
 ដោយសារតែប្រសិនបើនេះជាពេលមួយដែលមានឥទ្ធិពលពិសេសលើអ្នក ហើយវាសមហេតុផលទាំងស្រុង ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកអាចនឹងឃើញខ្លួនអ្នកនៅក្នុងស្ថានភាពស្រដៀងគ្នាក្នុងអំឡុងពេលបុណ្យណូអែល។
 ត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 អ្នកដឹងពីរបៀបបញ្ចូលវា។
 ជាអកុសល ចម្លើយខ្លីគឺថា អ្នកប្រហែលជាមិនទទួលបានចរាចរណ៍ពិតប្រាកដណាមួយទេ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលយើងចាប់ផ្តើមការងារនេះ យើងនឹងចេញទៅវាលស្រែ ហើយពួកគេនឹងឡើងខ្សែកៅស៊ូតូចៗទាំងនេះដែលអ្នកឃើញនៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃផ្លូវ។ ពេលខ្លះពួកគេពិតជារាប់បរិមាណរាងកាយ និងទទួលបានមួយ។
 ខ្ញុំមានអ្នកវិភាគមួយចំនួនដែលធ្វើការលើក្រុមដែលកំពុងធ្វើតេស្តផងដែរ ដើម្បីមើលថាតើវាដំណើរការឬអត់ ដូច្នេះយើងទទួលបានទិដ្ឋភាពដ៏ស្មោះត្រង់នៃដំណើរការនេះ។ ខ្ញុំ​សង្ស័យ​ថា​តើ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​អាច​កៀរគរ​អ្នក​ណា​ម្នាក់​នៅ​សប្តាហ៍​ក្រោយ។
 ទោះបីជាខ្ញុំប្រថុយនឹងប្រាក់ដុល្លារទាំងនេះកាន់តែច្រើនក៏ដោយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​រក​វិធី​ពន្យល់ ព្រោះ​មាន​ថ្ងៃ​ខ្លះ​ពិបាក​ខ្លាំង​ក្នុង​អំឡុង​ឆ្នាំ។
 យើងនឹងរៀនពីរបៀបធ្វើវា។
 អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយ ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ យើងមិនបានជ្រើសរើសអ្នកជំនាញមួយចំនួនដែលយើងត្រូវធ្វើការងារត្រឹមត្រូវសម្រាប់កម្មវិធីនេះទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយើងបានជួលជួរឈរពិតប្រាកដ។
 យើងមិនជ្រៀតជ្រែកជាមួយក្រុមបន្ទាប់បន្សំទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​អ្នក​ទាំង​នេះ​គឺ​ជា​អ្នក​វិទ្យាសាស្ត្រ​បរិមាណ​ពិត​ប្រាកដ។
 ពួកគេកំពុងគណនាមនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នា។
 ដូច្នេះ​កុំ​ឲ្យ​យើង​មើល​រំលង​អី។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាផ្នែកមួយនៃនេះគឺជាដំណឹងល្អ៖ ការប្រើប្រាស់របស់យើងនឹងបង្កើតចរាចរតិចជាងការប្រើប្រាស់ផ្សេងទៀតដែលនរណាម្នាក់អាចបង្កើតនៅថ្ងៃនេះ។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកក្រឡេកមើលផ្ទៃដីពិតប្រាកដ ខ្ញុំមិនមានតួលេខពិតប្រាកដនៅពីមុខខ្ញុំទេ ប៉ុន្តែមាននរណាម្នាក់អាចចូលមកទីនេះជាមួយនឹងអគារពិសោធន៍កម្ពស់ 4 ជាន់ ជិត 300,000 ហ្វីត ហើយនឹងមិនមានដំណើរការសវនាការជាសាធារណៈនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេគ្រាន់តែទុកផែនការរបស់ពួកគេជាមួយការិយាល័យអធិការកិច្ចអគារ ហើយរង់ចាំ 30 ថ្ងៃ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​មាន​កម្រិត​ទាប​បើ​ធៀប​នឹង​ការ​ប្រើ​ជម្រើស​មួយ​ចំនួន​នៅ​ទីនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាត្រូវធ្វើអ្វីពីអ្វីដែល Cappy បានធ្វើនោះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​សង្ស័យ​ថា​ប្រហែល​ជា​មាន​បន្តិច​ទៀត។
 ប៉ុន្តែបាទ ខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយថា ប្រសិនបើវាជាការិយាល័យលក់រាយ ឬបន្ទប់ពិសោធន៍ កន្លែងទាំងនោះជាធម្មតាមានឡានពី 4 ទៅ 5 គ្រឿងក្នុង 1,000 ហ្វីត ហើយយើងមានឡានប្រហែលមួយក្នុង 1,000 ហ្វីត ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិននិយាយទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​មិន​ប្រាប់​អ្នក​ថា​នឹង​មិន​មាន​រថយន្ត​នៅ​ទីនេះ​ដែល​រំខាន​អ្នក, ចូល​ទៅ​ក្នុង​ផ្លូវ​របស់​អ្នក​ឬ​អ្វី​មួយ​។
 ប៉ុន្តែមានតែតាមទស្សនៈបរិមាណប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ជាពិសេសក្នុងអំឡុងពេលថ្ងៃឈប់សម្រាកទាំងនេះនឹងមានតិចជាង។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3004.034s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: مجرد التفكير في الصدق.
 ستكون هناك جلسات استماع عامة، ومراجعات لخريطة الموقع، وما إلى ذلك، ولكن إذا كنت على حق، فهذا استخدام عادل ومجرد مراجعة للموقع.
 انسخ أيضًا، على الرغم من أنني أعتقد أنك ستكون التالي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3018.156s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: أعتقد ذلك، أشكرك على توضيح كيفية القيام بذلك إذا كنت أفهمك بشكل صحيح.
 سيتم استخدام الطوابق الثلاثة الأولى لمواقف السيارات، في حين سيتم تخصيص الطوابق الأربعة التالية للمعيشة الخاصة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3031.4s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: التالي 5.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3033.241s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: وستكون المناطق الخمس التالية عبارة عن مجمعات سكنية بإجمالي 250 شقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3037.502s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم، أعتقد أنه 265. لكن من الواضح أننا لم نتوقع أن يكون السعر منخفضًا. نعم، هل تعرف كم عدد الحقائب الموجودة؟
 أعتقد أننا نوصي باستخدام أكثر من حجم واحد لكل وحدة.
 نحن ننظر إلى بعض عوامل تقسيم المناطق الأخرى ويبدو أن المدينة تسمح بـ 0.85 قدم مربع أو أكثر لكل وحدة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3061.287s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: لذلك نعتقد... أعتقد أن قسمتنا هي 0.75 إلى 1.5.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3065.248s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم، نعتقد أن المزيد من ذلك مناسب، على الرغم من أننا نتفق على أن هذه منطقة عبور.
 إذن الإجابة هي حوالي مسافة واحدة لكل وحدة.
 ميكا، هل سيكون هناك منزل غير مكلف هنا؟
 نوصي باتباع قواعد ولوائح بيدفورد للوحدات السكنية، لذلك أعتقد أن الرقم هو 15%.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3084.169s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: كم تعتقد أن تكلفة هذه المنتجات؟
 مُطْلَقاً.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3091.353s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: لقد قلتها للتو، كما تعلمون، لقد قلتها لك للتو.
 لا أستطيع أن أخبرك كيف سيكون الأمر لأنه سيستغرق سنوات عديدة.
 ولكنه يتماشى مع ما تراه في الشوارع وفي بعض المجتمعات الجديدة الواقعة على بعد ميل واحد منا والتي نعتقد أنها يمكن أن تمنحهم بعض المنافسة الجيدة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3109.89s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: كما تعلمون، لقد سمعت أن رواد الأعمال يريدون الحضور والقيام بذلك.
 إحدى المشاكل هي ما إذا كان لدينا ما يكفي من المنازل لإطعام أنفسنا.
 إمكانية النمو الوظيفي في المدينة التي أرغب في الانتقال إليها.
 والآن السؤال والجواب: لا، لا نفعل ذلك.
 أعتقد أن كريستين أوضحت ذلك.
 لكن الجانب السلبي هو أنك قد تقوم بالبناء في أحد أكثر الشوارع ازدحامًا في ميدفورد، وربما الزاوية الأكثر ازدحامًا في ميدفورد.
 يعتقد بعض عباقرة DCI أنه سيكون من الجيد التخلص من كل هذه الأجهزة.
 وكان هذا خطأ كبيرا في ذلك الوقت. لا أعرف من توصل إلى هذا، لكنهم استثمروا حركة المرور والمال في كل هذه الشقق والوحدات السكنية، وقلت إنني لا أرى ذلك مكانًا مناسبًا للبلد.
 لكنها فكرة جيدة، لذا فهي ليست خطؤك في هذه الحالة.
 أنت تعرف الجانب الإيجابي.
 كما تعلمون، إزالة قنوات كيربي ومونرو من هذه المنطقة من شأنه أن يقلل بشكل كبير من تدفق حركة المرور.
 هذه قطة، كما تعلم، سائق سيارة أجرة يعمل سبعة أيام في الأسبوع.
 في العمل، أنت تعرف جدول العمل من الساعة 9 إلى 10، وكما يقول الكثيرون، فإنك تعرف أن لديك أيام عطلة.
 لا يمكنك اصطياد السلاحف، فهي ليست كثيرة.
 ستفعل كل ما بوسعك لإخراج هؤلاء الأطفال من هناك.
 سيؤدي هذا إلى عرقلة بعض حركة المرور، لكنني لا أعرف ماذا سيفعل هؤلاء الجيران حتى تقرر الولاية الاعتراف بأنهم ارتكبوا خطأً في المسار التاسع.
 أتمنى أن تلقي نظرة على إجراءات التخفيف التي تعرفها، ربما تساعدهم في التعرف على الرواد.
 أعني، أعلم أن هذا يفوق قدراتك، لكنها لفتة لطيفة من جانبك.
 سؤالي التالي هو: هل تحجب آراء الآخرين التي أسمع أنها ذات صلة؟
 كيف يمكننا حل هذه المشكلة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3254.415s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ليس لدي إجابة جيدة لك عندما يتعلق الأمر بالرؤية.
 كما تعلمون، إنها مجرد وظيفة للمنطقة التي بها مثل هذه المباني.
 لذلك، كما تعلمون، أعتقد أن بعض الناس لن يكون لديهم البصيرة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3268.188s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: لا، ليس على أرضك، لكن كما قلت، إنها منطقة مزدحمة للغاية.
 الآن أنت تعرف</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3276.015s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: هذا سؤال عادل.
 هذا سؤال عادل.
 أعني، أعتقد من وجهة نظر بعض الناس، بصراحة، أن هدفي هو بناء مبنى جذاب إلى حد معقول.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3283.804s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: هذا المبنى جميل جداً</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3285.786s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: المشكلة هي أنها لا تبدو جيدة جدًا على مؤخرة كيربي.
 نأمل في تحسين بعض الآفاق وتوفير الوقاية.
 أنا متأكد من أن بعض الناس قد يكون لديهم تعليقات.
 أنت تعلم أننا في الجنوب الغربي ويمكنك رؤية الأنهار الغامضة، لم أرها ولكني أشك في وجودها وآمل أن تكون وجهات نظرنا أفضل على الأقل من آراء كابيز في مونرو ولكنك تعلم أن هناك بعض التعويض هناك. ليس لدي إجابة مثالية لهذا السؤال.
 هل هذا كوب؟ هل قلت ذلك؟ إنهم على حق: كل شيء معوج.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3316.688s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: هذا صحيح، هذا المكتب يعبر الطريق السريع 9، أو شارع الخدمة كما نعرفه جميعًا، لذا عندما تعبر الجسر فإنك تخرج فقط إلى الطريق السريع 16.
 هذا ما يحتاجه الناس في أدمغتهم.
 كما يقول الناس، إنه في الواقع طريق خاص، والمبيعات ملك للمدينة، وقلت عندما خرجوا، لم أصدق ذلك، لم أصدق أن شخصًا ما سيحصل على أجر مقابل هذا، كان من الغباء القيام بذلك لتخفيف حركة المرور على الطريق السريع 16، وهو الطريق الأكثر ازدحامًا في المنطقة.
 استمر في متابعة هذه الكتل.
 مرة أخرى، لم يكن الحادث خطأه أو خطأ أي شخص آخر، بل خطأ DCR بالكامل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3359.618s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم، أود أن أقول هذا: قد لا نكون قادرين على حل كل هذه المشاكل، لكننا نستطيع ذلك، والمتخصصون لدينا جيدون جدًا.
 لذلك ربما يمكننا على الأقل القيام بشيء إيجابي.
 أعني، في ويستوود، أعمل كثيرًا على تبسيط حركة المرور والقضاء على الاختناقات حول المنعطفات والدوارات.
 يكره بعض الأشخاص كل هذه الكلمات والأساليب، ولكن في بعض الأحيان توجد كلمات وأساليب فعالة يمكننا استخدامها لإيقاف حركة المرور بأدب ولطف.
 لدينا المعدات اللازمة ونستخدم فريقنا لتشغيلها بأفضل ما في وسعنا.
 الشارع التاسع خاص، جيد وسيئ.
 أعتقد من الناحية الفنية أن هذه الحقيبة أو المحفظة ستكون في منتصف الصف.
 لذلك يجب أن تكون هناك بعض الضوابط للخصوصية، وعلينا أن نعمل مع جيراننا للتأكد من أن كل شخص على متن الطائرة آمن، بغض النظر عما يحدث في المنزل، وبغض النظر عما يريده الناس.
 إذن هناك عملية ديمقراطية جيدة هنا.
 ولكن ربما هناك حل لهذه المشكلة.
 ومن باب الإنصاف، فإن المهندسين المعماريين الذين ساعدناهم في إنشاء معظم الصور موجودون في اللجنة التوجيهية لوزارة النقل بولاية ماساتشوستس لإعادة بناء هذا التقاطع.
 لذا، هناك قدر كبير من الاتساق، وإذا أتيحت لنا الفرصة للحصول على تلك التعليقات وبعض التعليقات التي نحصل عليها والأسئلة التي ننظر فيها، فيمكننا القيام بذلك.
 قد لا تتمكن من إصلاحه، ولكن قد يكون له تأثير أكثر إيجابية مما تعتقد.
 سيعمل فريقنا على هذا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3445.637s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: مايك، هل تفكر في ترتيب خدمة نقل مكوكية إلى المحطة خلال ساعات العمل؟ ربما من 7 إلى 10، من 4 إلى 6، أليس كذلك؟
 أو يمكنك الاتصال
 لأننا نتحدث عن بعض الأحداث المستقبلية.
 استفسرنا عن إمكانية تنظيم نقل مشترك إلى المحطة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3473.179s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: سنأخذ هذا بعين الاعتبار بالتأكيد.
 بصراحة، أعتقد أنه كان من الأفضل لو أن الحافلة تركتنا ووصلت إلى ويلينغتون خلال ساعة الذروة.
 كان المكان على بعد حوالي ست دقائق سيرًا على الأقدام من المكان الذي نعيش فيه ولم أعد سريعًا بعد الآن.
 لذا فأنت تعلم أنك ستصل إلى هناك بسرعة، ناهيك عن التقاطع.
 لذلك سنرى.
 لن أقول لا، لكني أشك في إحداهما.
 أنا آسف.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3501.709s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: أريد فقط أن أصرخ.
 المشي أقل من ست دقائق.
 حوالي 15 دقيقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3506.753s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: يعبر مايك شارع 16 وتخسر ​​كل شيء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3511.616s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم يا كارميلو، لن أرفض الآن.
 أعتقد أنه سيتعين علينا أن ننظر إلى ذلك.
 إذا كان هناك TMA في المنطقة، يُطلب منا دائمًا الانضمام والمساهمة في TMA.
 لذلك علينا أن نراقب كيف يفعلون ذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3523.705s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: لكن كما تعلم، قلت أنه يمكنك بناء منزل في أكثر المناطق ازدحامًا في ميدفورد.
 لذلك يقولون، كما تعلمون، الشيء الجيد هو أن كابي ومونرو ليس لديهما الكثير من حركة المرور، وخاصة كابي، وهي مفتوحة 24 ساعة في اليوم.
 أعتقد أن بعض الناس سيشعرون بالارتياح قليلاً بشأن الوضع المروري مقارنة بالوضع الحالي.
 هكذا
 شكرا لتوجيهاتك.
 شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3561.56s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: كاتي، أعتقد أنك هادئة.
 كنت صامتا.
 ديبرا كارانتي لديك أسئلة بالفعل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3568.025s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 أنا في الغالب أستخدم التعليقات الأخرى هنا.
 أكبر ما يقلقني هو أنني أعيش في شقة في باركواي بلازا ساوث مقابل شارع 16.
 هناك الكثير من الناس هنا.
 من الصعب النزول من الطريق السريع رقم 9 اليوم.
 إذا حاولت القيادة على الطريق السريع 16 ودوار ويلينغتون، فسيكون الأمر فظيعًا.
 أعتقد أنني أشعر بالقلق من أن بناء المباني الكبيرة سيؤدي إلى ازدحام لا يصدق.
 هذا هو اهتمامي الرئيسي.
 ومن ناحية أخرى، أعتقد أن ليندا هي التي أثارت قضية القوارض.
 لكنني أعتقد أنه ستكون هناك كوارث أثناء أعمال التنقيب والبناء.
 هل سيؤثر هذا المبنى الجديد في النهاية على قيمة ممتلكاتنا؟
 أعني، لا أعتقد أن الناس يريدون العيش في أماكن كبيرة ومزدحمة.
 وكما ذكر ريك للتو، هذه هي المنطقة الأكثر ازدحامًا في ميدفورد.
 يعني هل هذا سيقلل من قيمة ممتلكاتنا؟
 لأن لدينا جميعا شقق هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3646.851s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: مايك، أنا لست المثمن العقاري.
 لكنني أظن أنه كان وراء استخدام السيارات خلف القضبان والتي لم تشوه إبداعات كابي الجميلة.
 كن جارًا جيدًا لك.
 لذلك، يتم إجراء الأبحاث في معهد ماساتشوستس للتكنولوجيا.
 أعتقد أنه تم إنجازه منذ 15 عامًا وكانوا مهووسين به حقًا، كان عبارة عن مقالتين ولسوء الحظ لم أقرأهما.
 ووجدوا أن الأحياء ذات الدخل المختلط تزيد من قيمة الأحياء المحيطة بها بشكل أحادي تقريبًا.
 لذلك أود أن أقول إنني لست مثمنًا، لكن يجب أن أتخيل أن وجود جار ودود من الدرجة الأولى، علاوة على حقيقة أنه كذلك، سيساعدك أو بالتأكيد لن يؤثر على قيمتك.
 أنت تحاول إخافتي، والفأر خائف قليلاً.
 دعونا نصل إلى جوهر هذه المهمة الشاقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3704.461s">[Maria D'Orsi]</a>: شكرا لك
 أعتقد أنك واجهت هذا بنفسك.</p>

 حسنًا، يمكنك الذهاب.
 فهل رفع أحد يده في هذه المرحلة؟
 لا أعتقد أننا سوف نرى.
 أعتقد أنه يمكننا إنهاء هذه المحادثة هنا.
 العديد من الأسئلة هي نفسها، ولكن يمكننا التحقق.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3738.621s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: كاتي، ربما أحتاج منك أن تعلميني كيفية فتح الدردشة هنا حتى أتمكن من رؤيتها.
 رأيتهم يظهرون.
 مثالي.
 لدينا مشكلة معقدة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3749.926s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: إذا كنت تريد يمكننا
 الأسئلة الشفهية.
 مرحبا مايك، شكرا على المقدمة.
 نحن موجودون في ويست باركواي بلازا.
 نحن مجرد جار آخر.
 سعيد بلقائك.
 شكرا لكم على تنظيم هذا الحدث.
 لذلك لدينا بعض الأسئلة البسيطة.
 أولاً، ما المدة التي تعتقد أن هذا النوع من البناء سيستغرقها؟
 لقد ذكرت، أعلم أن الوقت مبكر جدًا، ولكن متى تعتقد أنه يمكننا البدء؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3785.098s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 وبالتالي فإن بناء مثل هذا المشروع قد يستغرق ما يصل إلى 2024 شهرا.
 سأتحدث بشكل رئيسي عن هذا.
 تم الانتهاء من المبنى وأطفالنا مشغولون بالداخل.
 لذا، نعم، أود أن أقول شيئين حول الاكتشاف والتدمير. على أية حال، الوقت الحالي في السوق هو حوالي عامين.
 أما بالنسبة لموعد بدء البناء، فلا أستطيع أن أخبر المدينة بالمدة التي ستستغرقها عملية إصدار التصريح، لكن الأمر يستغرق عادةً حوالي عام للحصول على تصريح ثم ستة إلى تسعة أشهر أخرى للتصميم والهندسة.
 لذا، طالما أننا نستطيع المضي قدمًا، فهذه طريقة جيدة للمضي قدمًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3836.325s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: شكرا لك
 ماذا يجب أن تفعل إذا قام شخص ما بإزعاج مبنى مجاور؟
 مثلما نفعل أثناء البناء، أو كما تعلمون، بعد اكتمال البناء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3849.11s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: بالتأكيد.
 كما تعلمون، سنبدأ بفحص جميع المباني من حولنا والتأكد من أنها مبنية بشكل جيد وغير تالفة قبل أن نفعل أي شيء.
 إنه عمل شاق حقًا.
 ولكن اليوم يتم بناء كل هذه المباني باستخدام الرافعات المركزية.
 بشكل عام، الأشياء مصنوعة من الداخل.
 ثم
 أما بالنسبة لتأثيرها على المباني من حولنا، فإننا ندرس هذه النقطة في العديد من المدن؛ غالبًا ما تقع هذه الأماكن الصغيرة بالقرب من المناطق السكنية.
 الفكرة هي أننا سنقوم ببناء سياج طويل جميل بشبكة غير شفافة حتى لا تضطر إلى رؤية الكثير مما نفعله خلف الكواليس.
 لحسن الحظ، هذا النوع من البناء ليس عملية بناء مملة للغاية.
 سنعمل بالتأكيد مع المدن والأشخاص مثلك في جلسات الاستماع العامة لمناقشة التوقيت المناسب وأشياء من هذا القبيل.
 ونحن لن يزعجك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3917.32s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: شكرا لك
 نحن نقدر حقًا فرصة التحدث لأنها مفيدة جدًا.
 السؤال الأخير: لا يوجد أكثر من 260 شقة مكونة من 5 طوابق، فقط هل تريد معرفة حجم الشقة المتوسطة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3931.2s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: مجرد القيء حوالي 920.
 الفصل 945
 لذلك نعتقد أن الوحدة مفهوم يصعب فهمه، لذلك نجد إحساسًا بالوحدة في هذا الصندوق البرتقالي الكبير.
 نعتقد أن أهم شيء هنا هو برمجة سلسلة المنتجات.
 تتنوع مدينة ميدفورد في مجالات مثل مستويات الدخل ومستويات التعليم وأنواع الوظائف وخيارات النقل.
 وبالتالي فإن كمية المعدات التي نعتبرها مناسبة للاستوديو وسرير الأطفال ستكون أصغر.
 غالبًا ما يكون هؤلاء الأشخاص هم أول موظفينا الذين لم يتزوجوا بعد، وليس لديهم ابنة أو ابن ويتطلعون إلى المرحلة الثانية من حياتهم المهنية.
 لذلك فهو سوق قوي كل ثلاثة أشهر.
 يبدو أنك أعزب وتمارس مهنة ما، أو ربما بعد ذلك بقليل لأنك لا تزال تؤدي وظيفتك الأولى أو الثانية، لكنك متزوج ولديك صديقة أو صديق.
 هل أحببت ذلك.
 لذا، خلال بحثنا الأخير، اعتقدنا أن هناك بالتأكيد مساحة لشقة ذات جودة عالية مكونة من غرفتي نوم، ولكن مع استمرارنا في البحث، تبين أنها أصغر قليلاً مما كنا نعتقد.
 شكرًا لك.
 كما تعلمون، نحن بحاجة إلى مواصلة محاولة إيجاد سوق متنوعة لخدمة ميدفورد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4018.142s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: شكرا لك
 أريد أن أطرح سؤالاً على رئيسنا.
 أراد مني أن أسأله</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4024.407s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: نعم، أتساءل عما إذا كان بإمكانك تقييم تصميم المبنى قبل البدء في البناء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4030.666s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: أيمكنك سماعي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4032.069s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: حسنًا، نحن لم نذهب بعيدًا في بحثنا، في بحثنا.
 كما تعلمون، لا أعتقد أننا بحاجة إليها، كما تعلمون، لأننا لا نعرف كيفية القيادة، ولا أعتقد أننا بحاجة إلى أسهم أو أي شيء من هذا القبيل.
 ولكن عادة، إذا كان هناك بعض الاضطرابات الكبيرة في الموقع، إذا كنا نحفر حفرة أو كومة من الحطام أو نقوم بإجراء تحليل زلزالي لجميع المناطق، فسنقوم بتعيين شركة متخصصة في هذا الأمر.
 خاصة عندما تكون بالقرب من المباني الأخرى.
 نحن نعمل على مشروع في والثام على بعد حوالي 12 قدمًا من جيراننا.
 لذا، كما تعلمون، نحن نستخدم جميع أنواع أجهزة قياس الزلازل والأجهزة عالية التقنية للتأكد من أننا لا نفعل أي شيء سيئ لجيراننا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4078.827s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: شكرا لك
 ويريد آخرون تأكيدًا على أن كل شيء واحد وأن العمل غير مقسم.
 متاجر البيع بالتجزئة مثل ستاربكس أو الأصدقاء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4089.758s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: حسنا، لدينا سؤال جيد.
 كما تعلمون، نحن نبحث في محطات النقل واعتقدنا أننا قد نرغب في رؤية المزيد من الاستخدام التجاري في الطابق الأرضي.
 لكن كما تعلمون، فإن قضية المرور التي أثيرت الليلة هي شيء نأمله بصدق.
 لقد لاحظت شخصيًا بعض الاجتماعات مع MassDOT وكيف قاموا بتثبيت هذا التقاطع.
 أنت تعلم أنه سيؤثر على المزيد من حركة المرور.
 نعتقد أن أي شيء مرتبط بحركة المرور الإضافية والتأثير المؤقت على المبيعات سيكون سلبيًا إلى الحد الذي قد يكون له تأثير سلبي علينا.
 شيء آخر نعمل عليه هو ارتفاع الطلب.
 كما تعلمون، إذا كانت مساحة البيع بالتجزئة جيدة، كل ما يمكنني قوله هو أنني آمل أن تكون مساحة البيع بالتجزئة في تلك المنطقة أشبه بمساحة البيع بالتجزئة في الشارع.
 على سبيل المثال، حتى الآن لا يمكنك استئجار مقعد في ستاربكس ما لم يكن لديه خدمة ذاتية.
 هناك أيضًا العديد من منافذ البيع بالتجزئة على طول هذا الطريق، بما في ذلك المقاهي الأخرى.
 أنواع معينة من المقاهي أو المقاهي تبدو مناسبة للمكان.
 وبالنظر إلى كل هذه النقاط وتأثيرها على حركة المرور، قررنا استبعاد هذا الجزء من المفهوم.
 لذا فإن الأمر يستحق مناقشة المزيد، ولكن بصراحة من وجهة نظر حركة المرور والتأثير، سيكون الأمر أسوأ بالنسبة للمجتمع والموقع.
 شيء أخير: إذا لم تقم بذلك على أكمل وجه، فلن تتمكن الشركة من توظيفك.
 حتى لو كنا نعرف أقل، فإننا لا نزال نقرر البيع بسعر أقل من سعر السوق.
 من منظور التخطيط الحضري، يعتبر الفضاء والتدهور مسألتين حقيقيتين مع كل أنواع التأثيرات السلبية، لذلك أنا سعيد لأنك طرحت هذا السؤال لأننا أمضينا الكثير من الوقت في البحث عنه ومناقشته، لذلك نحن نتحدث فقط عن الإسكان والاستخدامات المرتبطة به.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4209.242s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: مرحبا، اسمي جينا.
 لدي سؤال آخر.
 لقد قلت أنه سيكون هناك موقف سيارة واحد لكل مركبة.
 حاليًا، تحتوي الوحدات أكثر أو أقل على سيارتين، لذلك لا يوجد موقف سيارات في المنطقة.
 ماذا ستفعل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4227.406s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: شيئين.
 بداية أنا لا أتفق مع وجهة نظرك.
 معظم سكاننا لا يستخدمون السيارات في منازلهم أو حتى في المناطق السكنية لأن مخزوننا من المساكن أكبر وسكاننا أكبر سناً وأقل مهارة.
 نحن لسنا في النقطة التي يوجد فيها متوسط ​​سيارتين لكل مركبة.
 لكن حتى لو كنت مخطئًا، سأخبرك بشيء واحد: سأضع أموالي حيثما يكون فمي وأين نأخذ هذا المشروع وغيره.
 بالطبع نحن
 نشعر بالقلق من قيام شخص ما بإيقاف السيارة على الطريق في المنطقة المتضررة، خاصة في هذه الحالة في الشارع التاسع.
 يمكننا أن نتوصل إلى عبارة بسيطة تمنع السكان من ركن سياراتهم في الشارع وتلزمهم بذلك بموجب عقد.
 لقد فعلت هذا من قبل.
 من السهل جدًا القيام بذلك.
 إذا كان شيئًا يعتبره المجتمع أو المدينة مهمًا، فيمكننا التعرف عليه بنفس التدابير القوية.
 لا، لا أعتقد ذلك، أعتقد أنه سهل جدًا.
 أعتقد أن منافسينا يمكنهم تخفيض هذا المبلغ إلى 0.75 لكل سيارة أو لكل سيارة أو إلى 0.85 لكل سيارة.
 بصراحة، أعتقد أن موقف ميدفورد في هذا الصدد متقدم جدًا.
 في الواقع، لا يمكنهم إجراء أي بحث، لأننا نفعل ذلك طوال الوقت ولا يمكن أن يكون هذا التحليل عشوائيًا.
 إنهم يعرفون ما يفعله هذا العميل.
 لذا أوه أوه
 في مدن مثل كامبريدج، يجب علي ركن السيارة بشكل أقل.
 لقد نصحوني بالذهاب إلى مكان آخر.
 لدينا الكثير من الأبحاث حول هذه المسألة.
 من وجهة نظر الأعمال، نحن نعرف ما نحتاج إليه.
 إذا لم يكن لدينا أماكن كافية لوقوف السيارات لعملائنا، فلن يقوموا بتأجير مكان لوقوف السيارات منا.
 لذا فإن آخر شيء أريد القيام به هو تقييد مواقف السيارات دون داعٍ لأن ذلك سيؤثر على أعمالنا.
 ولكن إذا كنت لا تصدقني، سأقتصر على أموالي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4346.218s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: آسف، كان لدي سؤال أخير.
 يبقى هذا.
 يقع مدخل المرآب والمبنى في شارع ميدلسكس، وليس في شارع ناينث.
 هذا صحيح؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4358.503s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ومن وجهة النظر هذه فهذا صحيح.
 نشعر أنك لا تريد منا أن نحضر سيارة جديدة إلى شارع ناينث.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4363.785s">[Unidentified]</a>: شكرا لك
 المستشار كارافييلو.
 شكرا لك كاتي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4374.114s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: إذا كنت تتحدث عن شراء شقة ليست في هذه الزاوية الصغيرة، فيمكنني أن أعطيك شيئًا أو شيئين يناسبان شقتك، ونوع العقار الذي نحتاجه لجعلها أكثر تجانسًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4387.761s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: أيها المستشار كيف تطلب مني أن أجيب على هذا السؤال؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4392.414s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: لا أعرف.
 ما أعنيه هو أنه سيحسن ممتلكاتك ويجعلها تبدو أفضل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4402.718s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: لأن لديك كل شيء، كما تعلم، سأقول ذلك، سأقوله، أنا متزوجة من مخطط مدينة وهو قوي.
 هذا موضوع لبعض المناقشات.
 لن يفوتني هذا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4413.563s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: لا أريد مغادرة العقار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4416.425s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: باختصار، لقد طردت عدة مرات دون جدوى.
 لا، أريد فقط أن أعرف.
 أريد أن أفعل هذا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4423.15s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: ولكن لا يهم.
 لقد ذكرت أيضًا مشكلة وقوف السيارات.
 إذا ذهبت إلى Rivers Edge أو Moderna أو Rivers Edge، فلن يكون موقف سيارات Moderna Apartments ممتلئًا.
 كما أن تقسيم Rivers Edge الفرعي خالي من السيارات.
 أعتقد أن يومين من وقوف السيارات تكون عندما تكون السيارتان فارغتين.
 قد يكون هناك أشخاص لديهم سيارتين، ولكن معظمهم من الشباب يمتلكون كل شيء من أوبر، والبعض لا يملك حتى سيارة.
 تحقق من المباني السكنية الجديدة في Moderna و Rivers Edge.
 سيخبرونك أن لديهم جميعًا مواقف للسيارات ومواقف للسيارات.
 ليس هناك ما يكفي من الناس لديهم سيارات في الوقت الحالي.
 شكرا لكم على السماح لنا بالقيام بذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4469.202s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: السؤال الأخير من ماري هاريس، ثم سنذهب إلى سلة المهملات الطائرة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4475.105s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: نعم، أقدر سؤالك حول مواقف السيارات، فهو يستحق ذلك، وأخشى أن سؤالي سيكون مختلفًا بعض الشيء.
 ولهذا السبب اشتقت لك منذ البداية
 مايك، عرضك التقديمي وأنا مازلنا لا نعرف بالضبط عدد الأشياء التي تخطط للقيام بها.
 سؤالي هو: ما هي الألوان التي قد تؤثر على مناطق مثل حمام السباحة لدينا؟
 هل تعلم ما هو التأثير الذي يحدث في الصيف عندما نجلس لنستمتع؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4511.768s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: لقد أطلقنا لأول مرة اشتراكًا من المستوى الثامن ونرى مجتمعًا من المستوى الثامن هنا.
 أما بالنسبة للوضع في منطقة شمال وجنوب شارع 16 فنحن بالطبع لا نرى أنه من المناسب الاستمرار فيه.
 لذا من وجهة نظر بحثية، لنكون صادقين، لم نحقق هذا الهدف بعد.
 هذا ليس من غير المألوف في عملية الترخيص.
 أشك في أننا سننجح هنا.
 لذلك أعتذر.
 لا أعرف مكان حمام السباحة الخاص بك، ولكن يمكننا رؤيته.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4546.449s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: مقابل شارع 9.
 انها وراء كيسي.
 عندما لم أكن هناك، كان بإمكاني رؤية سقف كيسي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4554.171s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: مثالي.
 هذا صحيح.
 أعني أن الإجابة المختصرة هي أننا سننظر في الأمر ونحلله.
 آسف، ليس لدي إجابة جيدة وواضحة لك، سيكون هذا جزءًا من عملية الترخيص.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4566.864s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: كما تنمو.
 شكرا لك
 أعتقد أن معظم ما نتحدث عنه في محادثاتنا قد تم تناوله، لكن لنعد إلى السؤال المطروح، لماذا تؤجر البيوت وليس الشقق؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4587.23s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: هناك العديد من الإجابات الجيدة، لكن الإجابة المختصرة هي أن Alliance Homes لا تقوم ببناء الشقق على الإطلاق.
 نحن شركة خاصة.
 وهذا ما يميزنا عن بعض منافسينا.
 كما تعلمون، نحن لسنا مجموعة استثمارية مدعومة من البنك.
 نحن نبني الكثير من المنازل كل عام، وفي بعض السنوات أكثر من أي منزل آخر، ولكننا في الواقع أربعة شركاء رئيسيين.
 نحن خصوصيون تمامًا.
 وهذا ما يفعله الأشخاص في فينيكس، حيث يقع مقرنا الرئيسي، كل ما في وسعهم لثني المستثمرين عن المشاركة.
 لذلك عندما يقومون ببناء شقة، عليهم إعادة التفكير في ما قرروا عدم القيام به.
 لذلك، هذا هيكل وإجراء لا نتعامل معه.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4638.742s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: أعتقد أننا أجبنا على الأسئلة وناقشنا الشارع 9 والغرف 1 و2 و3. أعتقد أنك تفعل ذلك بشكل صحيح يا مايك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4650.185s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: أعتقد نعم، من الناحية النظرية ما زلنا في حالة من عدم الاستقرار، لذلك ما زلنا نتحدث عن جودة وحداتنا، لكنك تعلم أنه سوق مثير للاهتمام ومتغير.
 لذا فإن هذا المزيج يتغير باستمرار، ولكننا نفكر في المقام الأول في المجتمعات المكونة من غرفة نوم واحدة وغرفتي نوم.
 وبطبيعة الحال، سيكون هناك أيضا وحدات أكبر وأصغر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4670.697s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: والسؤال التالي هو ماذا سيحدث للبنية التحتية.
 نعم، انخفض ضغط المياه في المبنى الجديد.
 كما تعلمون، يمكن لأي شخص أن يجيب بأن كل شيء يتم إنتاجه تم تصميمه واختباره.
 العمل على ضمان قدرة البنية التحتية على دعم البناء الجديد.
 أتساءل ماذا تريد أن تضيف هنا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4693.424s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: أستطيع أن أضيف هذا.
 أستطيع أن أخبرك أن الإجابة هي بالتأكيد لا.
 اختبرنا الماء.
 تأكد من أن لديك جميع المعدات اللازمة.
 وطبعا كافة الاتصالات والإعلام.
 هناك الكثير من الماء والضغط الجيد.
 بالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن المبنى الخاص بنا طويل وقد يحتاج إلى مضخة مياه خاصة به.
 ليس مبنى من خمسة طوابق أو أقل.
 هذا المبنى يطلب المساعدة حقًا إذا تمكنا من إخراجه.
 لا أعتقد أنه سيكون لديك هذا التأثير.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4731.129s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: سؤال آخر: هل سيكون هناك عمل نقابي أم لا؟
 أعلم أن هذه أيضًا هي المرحلة الأولى من المشروع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4739.397s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: حسنًا، أود أن أقول إنه عادةً ما يكون مزيجًا رائعًا.
 ذلك يعتمد.
 النجارون وعمال الخرسانة هم دائمًا نجارون ونجارون نقابيون.
 وهناك العديد من الأعمال الأخرى، ولكننا نقدم أسعار تنافسية في جميع الجوانب.
 لكن الإجابة المختصرة هي: لا نعرف بعد.
 لا يزال أمامنا الكثير من العمل لنقوم به قبل أن نصل إلى هناك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4759.341s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: هل تتساءل عن كيفية اختيار سجادة Shaw المثالية لغرفة معيشتك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4771.045s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 أعني، أعتقد أن هذا هو جوهر ما كنا نتحدث عنه في البداية: نحن نتوقع عودة بعض الأسفلت إلى الغرب والجنوب الذي كان من المفترض في الأصل أن يكون الطريق إلى الجزيرة الغامضة.
 احجز غرفتك في Fellsway.
 بالطبع، وجهة نظري هي أنني أعتقد من الناحية الفنية أنها ستكون مملوكة للقطاع الخاص، لكنك تعلم أنها ستتصل بكل شارع وتقاطع وكل شيء آخر في المنطقة.
 لذا فإن الإجابة المختصرة هي: نعم.
 نحن نؤمن أنه بإمكاننا جلب الكثير من الابتكارات إلى هذه الأماكن.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4805.474s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: أعتقد أن معظم أسئلة التحقق الأخرى قد تمت الإجابة عليها باستثناء السؤال المتعلق بإرسال مؤتمر فيديو عبر البريد الإلكتروني، بالطبع عنوان بريدي الإلكتروني موجود في مكتب البريد ويمكنني المحاولة. أعلم أنني ناقشت الاجتماع الأخير بسبب حجمه.
 قم بنشر هذه المعلومات هناك، ولكن عادة ما يتم نشرها على الموقع الإلكتروني لمؤتمر ميدفورد وستكون هناك.
 إذا أراد الناس رؤيته، يمكنك مراسلتي عبر البريد الإلكتروني وسأحاول العثور على رابط له.
 أعتقد أن هذا هو المكان الذي تنتهي فيه المحادثة.
 لا تزال مشكلة.
 لذلك أريد أن أشكر كل من حضر، تقصد مايك.
 اسمحوا لي أن أطرح عليك بعض الأسئلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4856.578s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: حسنًا، أريد فقط أن أقول إن هذه كانت انتخابات مذهلة.
 وأنا ممتن لكم جميعا.
 أنت تثير أسئلة صعبة.
 أنتم فريق مدروس جيدا.
 لذا شكرا لانضمامك.
 كما تعلمون، نحن نفعل هذا، لقد قلت بالفعل أنني أعيش هنا.
 هذا هو ما أنا متحمس له حقًا: بناء المنازل في منطقة بوسطن.
 هذه أسئلة جيدة.
 وهذا شيء نتحكم فيه في جميع الأعمال.
 اشتقت لك
 سأحتفظ بالعمل الذي قمت به من قبل.
 نحن جيدون في حل كل هذه المشاكل مثل أي شخص آخر، لذلك نريد أن نكون جيرانًا جيدين ونبني المنازل، كما تعلمون، إنه ليس مختبرًا لبناء متاجر البيع بالتجزئة أو أي شيء سيء في بناء مكان حيث نريد التأكد من أن الناس يريدون بالفعل البقاء والاستمتاع بالمكان الذي تحبه.
 لذا نشكرك على الدعم وأخبرنا إذا كانت هناك أية مشكلات أخرى مفقودة وربما تكون لدينا فرصة أخيرة للتحقق منها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4912.428s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: تطرح أسئلة حول معدات البناء التي سيتم إيقافها أثناء البناء وما إذا كان سيتم فقدان مواقف السيارات على الطريق 9 بسبب تركيب خراطيم إطفاء الحرائق.
 طفايات الحريق وغيرها</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4928.465s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: أود أن أقول ربما لا.
 يعتمد الأمر حقًا على قسم الإطفاء، ولكن في مبنى مثل هذا سيكون هناك الكثير من توصيلات السباكة داخل المبنى.
 أعني، إذا احتاج رئيس الإطفاء إلى صنبور إطفاء الحرائق، فسيفعل ذلك، لكنني لا أعتقد أن ذلك سيؤثر على أي موقف للسيارات إذا كان هذا هو الحال.
 لذلك هناك إجابة مختصرة للسؤال الأول، السؤال السابق حول مواقف السيارات، وهي مشكلة كبيرة، وخاصة في موقع البناء.
 هل تعلم متى نحن
 آسف، عندما نصل إلى مرحلة البناء، نحتاج إلى إجراء دراسات لوجستية، ودراسات تشغيلية، وأعتقد أن كل الأعمال التي نقوم بها اليوم في البناء، يستخدم مقاولونا مواقف سيارات خارج الموقع، لذلك نحن نقوم بذلك من أجل الجميع.
 لذا، إذا كان هناك أي قلق من أنهم سيبدأون في إغلاق الطريق 9، فالإجابة هي لا، ابتعدوا عن أطفالنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4982.985s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: ومن ثم يطرح السؤال هل يعرف جيرانك هل ستستمر؟ أعتقد أن هذه ستكون جلسات استماع علنية.
 إذا كان هذا فقط يمكن تحقيقه.
 كما تعلمون، أعتقد أن الخطوة التالية هي تحديد ما هو عليه.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4998.898s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم، أعني، ربما لن تنتهي العطلة إذا واصلنا المضي قدمًا.
 لقد استخدمنا نفس بنية الإشعارات لإعلام جيراننا في هذا الاجتماع بأننا سنستخدمها في اجتماعات أخرى أو جلسات استماع عامة.
 لذا فإن الإجابة المختصرة هي أنني أعتقد أنها قد تبدو هكذا.
 إذا تابعت، فسنرى شيئًا ما في بريدك الوارد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=5023.622s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: وبهذا يختتم الاجتماع. أتمنى للجميع السعادة والسلامة والعناية بمناسبة بتشوم بن. شكرا للجميع على اهتمامكم.
 شكرًا لك</p>
