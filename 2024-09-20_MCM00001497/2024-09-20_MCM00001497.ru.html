 Кэтлин
 ខ្ញុំនៅទីនេះយប់នេះ។
 Кажется, для Джулиана, генерального директора жилищного консорциума в Новой Англии, все кончено.
 និង Мэттью Харрити នាយកនៃការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍សម្ព័ន្ធលំនៅដ្ឋាន។
 Прежде всего, мы хотели бы поблагодарить всех, кто присутствовал на этом собрании сообщества по поводу потенциальной реконструкции объекта недвижимости, расположенного по адресу 5,73 Bells Way, бара Cappies по адресу 20 Revere Beach Park Way Monroe Muffler Break.
 Цель встречи – представить проект, находящийся на ранней стадии, с 19 комментариями жителей района.
 យើងទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំបទបង្ហាញ។
 Примерно через 15–20 минут после презентации у вас будет возможность задать вопросы и оставить комментарии. យើងបានបែងចែកប្រហែលមួយម៉ ោងសម្រាប់កិច្ចប្រជុំនេះ។
 នៅក្នុងលក្ខខណ្ឌនៃបទប្បញ្ញត្តិទូទៅ។
 Я прошу вас хранить молчание, пока вас не попросят высказаться.
 បន្ថែមពីលើការសួរសំណួរទៅកាន់ក្រុម។
 Вы также можете задать свои вопросы и комментарии в чате, и мы обсудим их в последние 5–10 минут встречи.
 Я призываю вас избегать отправки личных личных сообщений, поскольку сложно координировать чаты и управлять личными сообщениями.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=280.245s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  So these first slides we're going to start with are really just to get you acclimated with the neighborhood.
 I know that sounds silly because many of you live in the immediate area.
 However, we want to just make sure we all get started on the same page and talk about a little bit about the context for where we started our studies and conceptual program for the site.
 So the first one here is, of course, this is East Medford.
 Route 16 runs right across the page left to right.
 And the Fellsway and Middlesex Avenue run north to south.
 The taped site in yellow is the assembled parcels.
 Cappy's is the larger sort of hexagonal building.
 And Monroe Muffler is here on the east side on the property line.
 So the combined site,
 which again are 573 Fellsway, which is Cappy's Liquors, and 20 Revere Beach Parkway just to the east is the Monroe Muffler Shop.
 You'll see to the south here, Station Landing, the Mystic River Reservation off to the southwest, and the shopping centers up to the northwest.
 Of course, Wellington Station is at about 430 on your page.
 We've got a few axios here to show the immediate neighborhood.
 Again, these are really just to kind of show context of how the site fits in with the larger areas.
 We've turned the camera a bit on you.
 So, Route 16 or Revere Beach Parkway is running off to the east towards the top of Page and the Fellsway down to the right and Middlesex Avenue and the Fellsway up to the left.
 Cappy's there is just left of center.
 So obviously the neighborhood really is, you know, primarily seven and eight-story mixed-use buildings, quite a bit of housing in high-rise format.
 And you'll see Wellington just off top right of page.
 We'll flip the camera a bit here and looking southeast now, Cappies again just left of center, Route 16 traveling up and to the left of your screen, and station landing off across, southerly across Route 16 there.
 So looking at these photos, we like this site in the city for a lot of reasons.
 Medford's a great city.
 It features anything a modern resident would want, which is, of course, our business.
 The city is close to Boston, which in itself is always attractive.
 But really, it already has its own deep bench of employment of retail of walkability open space and history so all of those things stitched together to where, where, where our customers would want to live, they want to be close to home, they want to be able to walk to amenities, you know, nobody really wants to be in their car.
 And we've spent some time studying this intersection.
 Growing up in Arlington, I know this intersection well.
 So getting out of your car in this neighborhood is certainly an attractive thing, and Medford offers the ability to do that.
 And this site is really a microcosm more broadly of Medford, having all of those things I just mentioned within sometimes less than 1,000 feet of walking.
 Macro as a Bostonian, this is the type of modern housing I think greater Boston needs and regionally we need in eastern Massachusetts, where people even in cold weather aren't required to get into their vehicle to get a coffee to travel to work to pick up a prescription or to go get a classic roast beef at Kelly's across the street.
 So
 I'm going to move into some site photographs.
 I'm sure you guys are all relatively familiar with this, but I feel like we just want to be thorough.
 So this is a shot looking north of Cappy's, somewhat northeast, with 9th Street just in the back.
 You'll see a blue double two-story home on the left side of the screen with a garage.
 That is the 9th Street area.
 Monroe is just off to the right of your screen.
 This is a shot from Revere Beach Parkway on one of the many curb cuts on these two parcels.
 So we're looking straight north across the property line between Monroe and the Cappy site.
 This is a shot from 9th Street looking south.
 So Station Landing is in the background.
 Monroe is on just left of center and Cappy's, the back of Cappy's is just right of center.
 So you're looking at the intersection basically concealed only by the Cappy's.
 And then this is also a 9th Street shot looking the other direction.
 So you can see Boston Tattoo here in the background and the 9th Street intersection, current intersection and curb cut with Cappy's.
 So this last is an obvious satellite image of the site.
 We've oriented this North and South so we can stop getting you guys dizzy.
 9th Street runs East and West across the top of the site.
 This is Middlesex Avenue on the left, and again, Route 16 on the bottom.
 The property isn't taped, but it is this L-shaped combination of these two parcels, not including the Boston Tattoo Company.
 This is a good start to show where the site planning begins for us, apart from the macro context of the area and the uses that are here and the amenities.
 This is really where we start trying to integrate and stitch those things together into a program.
 On the left and on the south of the site, we're bound by these two roads or parkways.
 These were
 These are actually very interesting if you don't know the history, but these were formerly, like many parkways in greater Boston, were run by the MDC, now DCR.
 The spirit of these roads was effectively, as we were becoming an automobile-focused society, to have a pleasure-driving avenue to explore the area's benefits.
 So you, I'm sure, are all familiar with the Middlesex Bells.
 and the Mystic River reservations.
 These are really just spectacular green spaces, and the former MDC knew that, and they knew that they wanted people to experience those in a pleasurable way.
 So on the south side of the site, you'll see there's a pretty deep, for an urban zone like this, a pretty deep setback with mature trees and paths.
 Believe it or not, there's actually a deed restriction on these sites that allows the parkways to remain what their original intent was.
 So while we might not be putting around in a 57 Chevrolet enjoying the Mystic River Reservation here today,
 I drive on at least three parkways on the way to work every day.
 These are commuter roads now.
 But there's still an opportunity here, we think, to maintain the spirit of what these parkways were initially for.
 And one thing we found interesting was that on the west side of this site, along the Middlesex Avenue, it's paved right to the sidewalk.
 and there so those setbacks and deed notes actually exist there as well and so one of the things we thought might be attractive and seems to mate with some of the intersection plans being discussed is is an ability to use that even though it is on this property rather than leave it as asphalt is to try and continue that parkway um parkway spirit the paths put mature trees and native plantings there and the like um so
 We think restoring that buffer could be a real opportunity.
 So I'm going to move to the next shot.
 This is an actual concept we're working with.
 And it's roughly centered on the page as this is.
 So again, you'll see the, well, mislabeled Fellsway.
 That's technically Middlesex, of course, but Revere Beach Parkway on the bottom.
 And you'll see how we're looking at really adding back into those buffer zones, as I mentioned before, some of the green spaces.
 A number of other things worth highlighting as we get into this we're going to show you some more details on on how we program space conceptually.
 This community's proposed at 265 units of rental housing, we do not build condominiums in an eight story format with 100% of the resident parking enclosed within the building so.
 A lot of the surface parking areas that are on the perimeter of the area and nearby sites, we're going to instead work to green those up and bring the parking inside the envelope completely.
 We'll talk a little more about the rest of the program.
 But to get you started, effectively, we craft these communities so that they are a completely enclosed community.
 And so by that I mean, while this looks like a pretty normal building,
 from the outside, all of our building systems are located internally.
 So, trash, refuse collection and recycling, separation, emergency services and access, all of our amenities, or most of the amenities, I should say, that are internal to the site.
 Everything is neatly encapsulated within the envelope of the building we propose here.
 So, you'll see on the site, there's donut shape is primarily the mass of the building.
 However, there is a hole in the middle and we'll use that courtyard to have some outdoor private space for residents.
 That's a little more private than perhaps walking across the street to the mystic river.
 But typically, and we'll show you some photos of how we treat these spaces.
 But these spaces typically have a large pool deck, sort of resort styled.
 We'll have outdoor cooking areas, lounges and cabanas and that sort of thing.
 A space where, you know, to kind of center the entire community around.
 On the upper left of the page, you'll note we've got a curb cut proposed here off of Middlesex.
 And in fact, to expand on that, the site currently features five curb cuts.
 And I'm sure we'll spend a lot of time talking about traffic and parking here.
 But the big story here is we're going to try and eliminate all of those curb cuts but one.
 We have not engaged a traffic engineer at this time.
 However, we've done enough of these to know that on a busy intersection like this, particularly one that's in flux for its future, that the less interruption and the less curb cuts that you're delivering traffic onto, the better.
 Excuse me.
 So our goal here would be to eliminate as many of those curb cuts in this planet, four of the five would be would be removed from the site.
 Inside the garage, so residents will drive into the building here, just above where it says loading, and there'll be three levels of parking.
 So the first three levels of the program would all be structured parking and other building services, and then all of the housing, but for a very few units, would be located on floors four and above.
 So we're gonna dig into the building here a little bit.
 This would be the first level if you were to just shave everything on floors two through eight off.
 And so as you arrive, you'll see the only surface parking we're proposing is just at the amenity area.
 That's also where we would have our 24-hour leasing and staff located.
 So future residents might use these spaces if they were to come look at a home or to check out the community.
 So that that sort of area all on the west side labeled as amenity would be a two story volume focused on the leasing and then a number of different amenities, which we'll talk a little bit about later.
 but primarily work from home type spaces, screening rooms, flex spaces.
 And we'll show you some of the other examples of what we do for fun in those spaces.
 So those would be separated from the garage element.
 The next two levels above this would also be parking served by internal ramps.
 So invisible to the outside.
 This would be an upper garage.
 parking floor like two or three you'll note that now above the common program area will add some homes and there'll be some again on the south side until we get to the upper residential floors, such as this where it'll be all housing on force for and above.
 So we'll also in these upper floors probably have some amenities.
 We're finding that most surprising amount of people are not going back to the office.
 And so the flex time and work from home spaces are becoming an important part of our business.
 So while some people may go to work, the typical customer here is working in a high tech or an R&D type
 And those have, you know, non traditional non nine to five types of hours.
 So we're now building our amenities to make those spaces more pleasurable and make your sort of to help you separate work from home, even when you are near home, as you would be in this.
 So we've added some, these shots are what we call axiometrics.
 These shots were created with the intent to kind of stitch what we're proposing into the neighborhood.
 So you'll notice, like most of the buildings around here, this is also eight stories.
 I think one of the station landing buildings up front is seven.
 but you'll see we're looking to pull things back off of the parkways and contribute back to what that sort of original mission was for those roadways and also just give this a little bit of a softer edge on what is a very hard-edged zone.
 So this we've also picked these spaces to
 try to relate to the aerial views we showed you earlier.
 So where we were showing you a photo very similar to this of the Cappies and Monroe site to show you how this would stitch into those with the massing around it.
 Now, this is a shot looking south, excuse me, southeast.
 So Ninth Street would be just in front of the building here in your view and the Middlesex Avenue and the Fells Way coming basically straight up the page on the right side.
 station landings here in the back.
 We're proposing a lot of verticality.
 This is what we'd call a Vitruvian style building.
 It's very classic.
 We're not sure this is the space based on what's around it.
 There's a lot of brick.
 There's a lot of sort of traditional materials.
 Station landing is a relatively classic and timeless architecture.
 So we didn't feel it was appropriate to use some of the real contemporary modern looks.
 for this space.
 So we stuck with some pretty classic verticality and spacing and dimensions to the building.
 To help you stay oriented, this was the small little future resident parking area, and the garage entry would be right here.
 And again, these first three levels, despite the fact that they look traditional with windows and the like, would actually be just the same cladding, just enclosing the parking structure.
 So this is a similar angle to the one we just showed you just brought down from from the seagull residents of Medford's viewpoint to get you down to a more pedestrian scale.
 Again this is where those future resident spots in the curb cut on the middle section might be and a garage parking entrance here if you can see my cursor moving.
 So
 This is, again, this is an early concept, so this may look developed, and we have looked at a couple of other options, but this is sort of the path we've been going stylistically with the concept.
 Next, we're gonna show you some photos of other projects we've done in Greater Boston that have things that we think at least conceptually belong in a project like this.
 This is a community we built called The Val that we've just finished, or just finishing leasing up.
 And so some of the things you'll note here is a big two-story volume at the arrival.
 I mentioned that there was that amenity labeled space was also amenities, but also our leasing and management staff.
 So this is a good example of how we integrate some of these things.
 On the right side of this feature wall is actually the back of house where at all times you can find somebody on our team working there.
 But there's also this sort of hotel-styled arrival here, which is some of the way
 apartment home communities are going.
 So there's someone here at all times kind of giving you a more full service feeling during the
 well, during regular hours, more full service feeling to the building.
 And then you'll see these two stories and a feature stair.
 This is something we'd like to integrate in this project as well, where we really are stitching together some of these assembly spaces, work from home spaces, or maybe you're just scrolling and rolling with your earbuds in and your music on, but places where this is a little more activated and a little more public.
 This actually, this wall was, we had a local artist custom paint it for us in sort of a thematic nod to the name.
 This is a project we built two years ago called The Cove.
 This is another idea of just some of those sort of flex spaces where this is really,
 more recreational space, obviously a pool table, there's actually a beer tap back there and wine, excuse me, and a wine cooler.
 But this is a space that would also be, we would propose something like stylistically different, of course, right near those amenity and leasing spaces, a little more open concept.
 This is one of our fitness centers we just completed.
 This one's actually done on two levels.
 We had a lot of fun with this one.
 We're utilizing private mirror rooms for online workouts and then of course all the traditional cardio.
 So this one has actually up top of this spiral staircase has a cardio deck and then the rest of your workout is all below here.
 So you can get an idea of how we really want to create an enclosed, fully encapsulated community, but in a very first class way.
 This is a pool deck shot.
 So this is an important one because this is a good analogy for how we would treat that center of the donut type space you saw.
 This is also a green roof on deck.
 These trees, while brand new, will grow to be full 40 foot sugar maples and red maples.
 So we have a team that understands how to put
 full-sized real vegetation on top of a deck.
 Under this is a parking level, not unlike we would propose on this site.
 Then a full, of course, heated pool and resort style, three, four months of the year, great place to hang out with your iPad or just get some sun.
 This is a good example of how we would treat that.
 This is in the same project at the Val I mentioned earlier, similar green roof.
 You know, you'll see something.
 We had some taller trees at the inception here, but, and some lawn back there, which is hard to see, but we fully green up hard and soft scape.
 This one has a cool sun deck where you can throw your chaise lounge right in the water.
 It's heated and, and hang out, you know, we'll have fire, we have a large fire pit.
 And then this one, you can actually see the grilling stations, private grilling areas where you and your friends can kind of hang out.
 and have dinner.
 And then this is just, we just wanted to give you an idea of what some of our apartment homes look like.
 Alliance is a little different than some of our more cookie cutter national competitors.
 I'm not here to throw shade at any of them.
 There's a lot of great groups out there.
 We just really kind of treat each project with a little bit more of a customized approach.
 And so, you know, in our Hingham asset, you know, that was more appropriate to have a little bit more of a coastal New England style and a little bit more classic sort of features.
 You know, at workforce spaces, you might want to be a little cooler, have a little bit more fun with some of the design, a little less safe.
 And then, of course, the unit mix and the lighting and all that changes.
 So this is a good example.
 We actually did two different types of backsplash tile with a custom featured backsplash tile behind the range.
 and sort of things like that.
 But we build, you know, the goal is to build, you know, first class modern housing from connectivity to finishes and the like.
 And so that is that.
 Let's see if I can understand how to put this off.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1710.315s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Да, это хороший вопрос.
 Некоторые из них следят за тем, чтобы вы их правильно цитировали.
 Я имею в виду, во-первых, вы знаете, это оценки, я могу вам сказать, кто постоянные клиенты на нашем целевом рынке, я могу сказать вам, кто постоянные арендаторы.
 Но, конечно, мы строим дома для людей.
 Мы стараемся адаптировать наши продукты, чтобы понять, кто больше всего заинтересован в жизни в космосе.
 Но вы абсолютно правы.
 Я имею в виду
 Автомобили неизбежны, и их можно найти на любом перекрестке.
 Конечно, некоторые люди по-прежнему ездят на работу, независимо от того, работаете ли вы в биотехнологиях или в других отраслях.
 У меня есть друг, который работает в Министерстве обороны, исследований и разработок, и сейчас может быть 2 часа ночи.
 Когда процесс или тест окончен, все заходят в Slack или Teams и говорят: «Ладно, поехали, все собираются и идут».
 Я хочу сказать, что мы, конечно, не ставим перед собой конкретных целей и не реагируем на цены, которые арендуем, мы приветствуем кого угодно.
 Но это люди, которые всегда приезжают сюда, вы знаете, кому-то может быть интересно прийти в наше заведение в Хингеме у входа, если они хотят немного покататься, вы знаете, и я думаю, что идея здесь в том, вы знаете, вам не нужно водить машину, чтобы купить кофе или пойти в Walgreens, иначе они купят вашу говядину или что-то в этом роде.
 Но с профессиональной точки зрения он может идеально подойти нашему целевому рынку.
 Он был молодым, профессиональным, хорошо образованным молодым человеком, и, знаете, именно поэтому мы строили дома на большей территории, чем в Бостоне.
 Кэти, я бы попросил тебя помочь мне заткнуться и замолчать, но так как я не уверен, что имею на это право.
 Поэтому я уверен, что вы поможете мне решить эту проблему.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1907.962s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Да, единственный вопрос у меня очень короткий: хотите ли вы построить через перекресток пешеходный мост для облегчения движения? Поскольку я чувствую, что существует много людей, метод T может быть полезен, поскольку в настоящее время он не используется эффективно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1933.541s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Да, я имею в виду, я буду с вами честен, государство разрешает строить мосты через наши трассы через ДК.
 С другой стороны, для этого нам может понадобиться пакет большего размера.
 Просто используйте рампу и полосу препятствий на практике. Я смотрел похожую программу в Кембридже.
 Прошел пассажирский поезд, то есть мы все увидим и сделаем, но, к сожалению, у меня остались очень хорошие впечатления.
 Ну, это, наверное, что-то мы не можем вставить, может, жилья после того, как этот мост построили, не осталось.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1986.19s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Я из Веллингтона и являюсь членом правления Wellington Apartments.
 Девятая полоса не может вместить больше транспортных средств, чем существующая, тем более, что знак расположен на Почтенном Вест-авеню и дает бренду передышку.
 Мое устройство каждое утро указывает на девятую полосу.
 Каждый день ходит 3-4 автобуса.
 Я вижу автобус.
 Это проблема, которая нас очень беспокоит.
 Я знаю это, потому что мне написали многие соседи.
 Вопросы, которые я задаю, также важны для меня.
 Каждые два месяца мы делаем все возможное, чтобы ухаживать за домом и избавляться от вредителей. У нас есть приманочная станция, и вы можете копать так глубоко, как захотите.
 Что касается парковки, я думаю, что этот район может быть непопулярен.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2053.406s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: Я тоже не знаю, как поднять руку, но поддерживаю Линду.

 Но у меня есть ваш номер телефона, так что вы сможете присоединиться после того, как мы проверим людей, поднявших руки.
 Перед нами было три человека, и я наблюдал.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2079.292s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Линда, это отличные вопросы, и вы заметите, что в концептуальном плане мы не включили преднамеренную блокировку и фактически убрали часть блокировок между этими участками и шоссе 9.
 Итак, вы знаете, мы подозреваем, что это произойдет.
 Горячая тема.
 Другие жители города рассказали нам, что на 9-й улице с этим проблемы.
 Я думаю, что мы сделали некоторые осознанные вещи, мы старались уважать и держать нашу машину подальше от девятого номера.
 Но я думаю, что есть некоторые полезные вещи, которые мы не делаем намеренно.
 Три тротуара на Вест-Ривере-Бич-авеню,
 В этот момент вы можете легко повернуть направо и доехать до станции Монро или через станцию Кэппис и поехать по шоссе 9 до перекрестка, убрав главный светофор на перекрестке, и направиться на север через Феллсуэй или Миддлсекс.
 Поэтому я думаю, что то, что мы делаем намеренно, определенно не причиняет новой боли.
 Но я думаю, что с помощью плана развития, который мы предлагаем, мы теперь не позволим людям переходить улицу 9.
 Я бы сказал, что его следует сократить до некоторой степени.
 Извините, я не знаю, где находится гранитная дорога с упомянутым вами знаком, давайте выясним.
 Но те, кто пройдет через эти пакеты, уже точно не смогут этого сделать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2185.727s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Думаю, меня это встревожило.
 Я все еще вас слышу. О, со мной все в порядке, я потерял указатель в конце шоссе 9, которое идет от парка Ревью-Бич до Киса. Ах, апартаменты Веллингтона, конечно, есть указатели от шоссе 9 до фабрики ключей, и многое другое с тех пор, как я приехал сюда.
 Город занимает вторую половину.
 Ну, у меня есть параллель с цифрой 6 снаружи посередине.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2221.06s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Так что мы мало что можем сделать, но повторюсь, это обязательно устранит пробки, где люди сейчас перепрыгивают светофоры.
 Мы также не рекомендуем добавлять машины сегодня вечером.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2236.131s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Да, потому что я имею в виду, что он растет. Я живу здесь уже почти 30 лет и не могу поверить, насколько он большой.
 За это время.
 Это вызывает беспокойство.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2249.175s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Могу сказать тебе, Линда, мы сделали несколько творческих шагов в отношении местного транспорта.
 Я не знаю, смогу ли я предложить вам идеальное решение. Я знаю, что мы не можем.
 Но я обязательно буду хорошим слушателем и выберу лучших экспертов, чтобы мы интегрировали в этот раздел этот новый перекресток. Однако это может отразиться на беспокойстве жителей девятой улицы.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2273.261s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Однажды у нас будет личная встреча, например, в мэрии или где-то в этом роде, понимаешь, о чем я?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2280.587s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Да, я думаю, что в ходе дебатов возникают некоторые вопросы, и мы углубимся в них более подробно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2287.492s">[Unidentified]</a>: Хорошо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2288.593s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Ответ: я не уверен.
 Часть того, что мы планируем и делаем сейчас, — это изучение.
 Это то, что мы называем периодом выживания.
 Мы изучаем все: от прав собственности и контрактов до экологических требований, того, как получить разрешение и т. д., разговариваем с соседями и о вещах, которых мы не знаем. Наша главная цель сегодня — прислушаться к мнению окружающих, чтобы мы могли двигаться вперед и войти в открытый процесс, в ходе которого будут проходить более открытые и формальные встречи.
 Введение Честно говоря, возможно, есть лучший ответ.
 Мы информированы о том, что мы услышали сегодня от вас и городских властей, поэтому мы хотим иметь это в виду, а не просто предлагать идеи для новых программ, которые мы не исследовали или не поняли должным образом.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2341.722s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Это Келси. Я думаю, теперь ты сможешь сделать это сам.</p>

 Здравствуйте, меня зовут Кристина, и я владею Parkway Plaza West.
 Я поддерживаю такой подход к развитию.
 Я считаю, что в районе остановки общественного транспорта должна быть более плотная застройка.
 Но у меня есть два опасения по поводу строительства.
 Один из них — то, что сказали остальные.
 На 9-й улице Линда права: даже если вы уберете эти блокпосты, люди не будут пересекать парковку, потому что, честно говоря, это зона бедствия, но они въедут в Брейнрд, а затем на 9-ю улицу.
 Он находится на 9-м шоссе и очень маленький, поэтому мой первый вопрос: это ваша компания или у вас была такая компания раньше?
 Он провёл некоторую работу с сообществом, которое он построил, чтобы улучшить эту дорогу, вероятно, с добрыми намерениями, потому что, к сожалению, улица 9 — частная дорога.
 Все по-прежнему, тротуары нуждаются в улучшении.
 Я думаю, было бы хорошо, если бы был способ.
 Итак, мой первый вопрос: есть ли они у вас?
 Есть ли у вашей компании интерес или опыт оказания помощи в улучшении дорог?
 Поскольку тротуар не перерезан, люди начнут двигаться от Брейнерда к шоссе 9, чтобы избежать перекрестка.
 Мой второй вопрос касается уменьшения проблем с грызунами, потому что я только что читал о людях, которым снились кошмары с проблемами грызунов, когда они начинали масштабное строительство.
 Сегодня я прочитал статью о том, что Somerville и Brookline запускают смарт-боксы нового поколения.
 Применяет ли ваша компания базовые меры по борьбе с грызунами в своей текущей работе или вы планируете инвестировать в передовые методы борьбы с грызунами?
 О, поскольку у нас не так много владельцев квартир в коротком кругу, я думаю, было бы неприятно, если бы это вызвало большую проблему с грызунами.
 Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2493.5s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Итак, давайте сделаем первое и последнее, потому что я думаю, что читал эту статью сегодня утром и никогда не слышал об этой технологии.

 Вы сказали, что вы местный житель, поэтому я уверен, что вы знаете, что Кэти будет очень занята на День Благодарения и Рождество.
 Кто-нибудь говорит об использовании данных о продажах Кэппи или полиции штата или местной полиции, потому что у них всегда есть люди, припаркованные на тротуаре, чтобы посмотреть на местное движение и помочь вам определить, какие пробки вызовет здание такого размера?
 Возможно, из-за размера Кэппи.
 Я имею в виду, что покупатель, вероятно, является эквивалентом жильцов, живущих в здании и управляющих им. Оба могут служить данными о количестве прибывающих и уезжающих людей и транспортных средств, а также о типах нарушений, которые они вызывают, особенно в
 Когда мимо проезжает большой трафик.
 Итак, есть ли обсуждение возможности сбора данных на следующей неделе?
 Поскольку сегодня День Благодарения, значит, перекрёсток с Кэппи откроется и люди снова соберутся, поэтому будет многолюдно.
 Возможно, эти данные можно использовать для определения типа дорожного движения или проблем, которые вызовет этот тип конструкции.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2785.256s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: ជា​ការ​ពិត​ណាស់ អ្វី​ខ្លះ​នោះ​គឺ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រាកដ​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​យល់​ពី​ចំណុច។
 និយាយឱ្យត្រង់ទៅ យើងនៅតែឆាប់ពេកក្នុងដំណើរការជួលអ្នកប្រឹក្សាផ្នែកដឹកជញ្ជូន។ ជាធម្មតា ខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើមចំណាយលុយនៅពេលដែលខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងអាចមានអារម្មណ៍សុខស្រួលទទួលយកហានិភ័យដែលយើងត្រូវទទួលយកដើម្បីបន្ត។

 ប៉ុន្តែ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំនឹងប្រាប់អ្នកពីរឿងនេះ
 វាត្រូវបានគេហៅថា ITE ។
 នៅពេលដែលយើងជួលអ្នកជំនាញទាំងនេះ ពួកគេមិនចូលចិត្តប្រើទិន្នន័យអក្ខរាវិរុទ្ធទេ។
 អញ្ចឹងខ្ញុំនឹងហៅទៅមើលថា តើមានវិធីណាក្នុងការបញ្ចូលវាទេ ពីព្រោះនៅក្នុងពេលវេលារបស់យើង អ្នកដឹងទេ តាមការពិត យើងនឹងមិនទេ សន្មត់ថាយើងបន្ត នោះនឹងនៅដើមឆ្នាំក្រោយ អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងមានប្រអប់ជាច្រើនដែលត្រូវពិនិត្យមុនពេលចូលឆ្នាំថ្មី ដើម្បីមើលថាតើយើងចង់បន្តធ្វើកិច្ចការនេះដែរឬទេ។
 ជាអកុសល នេះមានន័យថា ដល់ពេលដែលយើងធ្វើការសិក្សាផ្លូវការទាំងនេះ ដែលនឹងចំណាយពេលច្រើនខែ យើងនឹងហួសពីការថ្លែងអំណរគុណ។
 ដូច្នេះ​សំណួរ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ​គឺ៖ តើ​អ្នក​គិត​ឬ​សម្រប​ខ្លួន​ទៅ​នឹង​រឿង​នេះ​ដោយ​របៀប​ណា?
 ដោយសារតែប្រសិនបើនេះជាពេលមួយដែលមានឥទ្ធិពលពិសេសលើអ្នក ហើយវាសមហេតុផលទាំងស្រុង ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកអាចនឹងឃើញខ្លួនអ្នកនៅក្នុងស្ថានភាពស្រដៀងគ្នាក្នុងអំឡុងពេលបុណ្យណូអែល។
 ត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 អ្នកដឹងពីរបៀបបញ្ចូលវា។
 ជាអកុសល ចម្លើយខ្លីគឺថា អ្នកប្រហែលជាមិនទទួលបានចរាចរណ៍ពិតប្រាកដណាមួយទេ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលយើងចាប់ផ្តើមការងារនេះ យើងនឹងចេញទៅវាលស្រែ ហើយពួកគេនឹងឡើងខ្សែកៅស៊ូតូចៗទាំងនេះដែលអ្នកឃើញនៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃផ្លូវ។ ពេលខ្លះពួកគេពិតជារាប់បរិមាណរាងកាយ និងទទួលបានមួយ។
 ខ្ញុំមានអ្នកវិភាគមួយចំនួនដែលធ្វើការលើក្រុមដែលកំពុងធ្វើតេស្តផងដែរ ដើម្បីមើលថាតើវាដំណើរការឬអត់ ដូច្នេះយើងទទួលបានទិដ្ឋភាពដ៏ស្មោះត្រង់នៃដំណើរការនេះ។ ខ្ញុំ​សង្ស័យ​ថា​តើ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​អាច​កៀរគរ​អ្នក​ណា​ម្នាក់​នៅ​សប្តាហ៍​ក្រោយ។
 ទោះបីជាខ្ញុំប្រថុយនឹងប្រាក់ដុល្លារទាំងនេះកាន់តែច្រើនក៏ដោយ។

 អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយ ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ យើងមិនបានជ្រើសរើសអ្នកជំនាញមួយចំនួនដែលយើងត្រូវធ្វើការងារត្រឹមត្រូវសម្រាប់កម្មវិធីនេះទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយើងបានជួលជួរឈរពិតប្រាកដ។
 យើងមិនជ្រៀតជ្រែកជាមួយក្រុមបន្ទាប់បន្សំទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​អ្នក​ទាំង​នេះ​គឺ​ជា​អ្នក​វិទ្យាសាស្ត្រ​បរិមាណ​ពិត​ប្រាកដ។
 ពួកគេកំពុងគណនាមនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នា។
 ដូច្នេះ​កុំ​ឲ្យ​យើង​មើល​រំលង​អី។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាផ្នែកមួយនៃនេះគឺជាដំណឹងល្អ៖ ការប្រើប្រាស់របស់យើងនឹងបង្កើតចរាចរតិចជាងការប្រើប្រាស់ផ្សេងទៀតដែលនរណាម្នាក់អាចបង្កើតនៅថ្ងៃនេះ។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកក្រឡេកមើលផ្ទៃដីពិតប្រាកដ ខ្ញុំមិនមានតួលេខពិតប្រាកដនៅពីមុខខ្ញុំទេ ប៉ុន្តែមាននរណាម្នាក់អាចចូលមកទីនេះជាមួយនឹងអគារពិសោធន៍កម្ពស់ 4 ជាន់ ជិត 300,000 ហ្វីត ហើយនឹងមិនមានដំណើរការសវនាការជាសាធារណៈនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេគ្រាន់តែទុកផែនការរបស់ពួកគេជាមួយការិយាល័យអធិការកិច្ចអគារ ហើយរង់ចាំ 30 ថ្ងៃ។

 ប៉ុន្តែបាទ ខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយថា ប្រសិនបើវាជាការិយាល័យលក់រាយ ឬបន្ទប់ពិសោធន៍ កន្លែងទាំងនោះជាធម្មតាមានឡានពី 4 ទៅ 5 គ្រឿងក្នុង 1,000 ហ្វីត ហើយយើងមានឡានប្រហែលមួយក្នុង 1,000 ហ្វីត ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិននិយាយទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​មិន​ប្រាប់​អ្នក​ថា​នឹង​មិន​មាន​រថយន្ត​នៅ​ទីនេះ​ដែល​រំខាន​អ្នក, ចូល​ទៅ​ក្នុង​ផ្លូវ​របស់​អ្នក​ឬ​អ្វី​មួយ​។

 ជាពិសេសក្នុងអំឡុងពេលថ្ងៃឈប់សម្រាកទាំងនេះនឹងមានតិចជាង។</p>

 Первые три этажа будут использоваться для парковки, а следующие четыре этажа будут предназначены для частной жизни.</p>

 Я думаю, мы рекомендуем использовать более одного размера на единицу.
 Мы рассматриваем некоторые другие факторы зонирования и, похоже, город допускает 0,85 или более площадей на единицу.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3061.287s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Итак, мы думаем... Я думаю, что наше деление составляет 0,75 к 1,5.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3065.248s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Да, мы считаем, что уместно немного больше, хотя мы согласны, что это транзитная зона.
 Итак, ответ — примерно одно место на единицу.
 Мика, здесь будет недорогой дом?
 Мы рекомендуем следовать правилам и положениям кондоминиумов Бедфорда, поэтому я думаю, что эта цифра составляет 15%.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3084.169s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Как вы думаете, сколько стоят эти продукты?
 Нисколько.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3091.353s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Я только что сказал это, ты знаешь, я только что сказал это тебе.
 Я не могу вам сказать, как это будет, потому что это многолетняя работа.
 Но это соответствует тому, что вы видите на улицах и в некоторых новых сообществах в радиусе мили от нас, которые, по нашему мнению, могут составить им хорошую конкуренцию.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3109.89s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Знаете, знаете, я слышал, что предприниматели хотят прийти и сделать это.
 Одна из проблем заключается в том, достаточно ли у нас домов, чтобы прокормить себя.
 Потенциал роста рабочих мест в городе, в который я хочу переехать.
 Теперь вопрос и ответ: нет, не делаем.
 Думаю, Кристен ясно дала это понять.
 Но недостатком является то, что вы можете строить здание на одной из самых оживленных улиц Медфорда, возможно, в самом оживленном углу Медфорда.
 Некоторые гении DCI считают, что было бы неплохо отказаться от всех этих устройств.
 В то время это было большой ошибкой. Я не знаю, кто с этим пришел, но они направили трафик и деньги на все эти квартиры и кондоминиумы, а я сказал, что просто не вижу такого места для страны.
 Но это хорошая идея, так что в данном случае вы не виноваты.
 Вы знаете положительную сторону.
 Знаете, удаление воздуховодов Кирби и Монро из этой зоны значительно сократило бы поток транспорта.
 Это кот, знаете ли, таксист, который работает семь дней в неделю.
 В бизнесе вы знаете график работы с 9 до 10 и, как многие говорят, знаете, что у вас есть выходные.
 Черепах не поймаешь, их не так много.
 Вы сделаете все возможное, чтобы вызволить этих детей оттуда.
 Это перекроет часть движения, но я не знаю, что будут делать эти соседи, пока государство не решит признать, что они ошиблись с девятой полосой.
 Я надеюсь, что вы взглянете на известные вам меры по смягчению последствий, возможно, это поможет им узнать пионеров.
 Я имею в виду, я знаю, что это выше твоих способностей, но это хороший жест с твоей стороны.
 Мой следующий вопрос: блокируете ли вы мнения других, которые, как я слышал, актуальны?
 Как мы можем решить эту проблему?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3254.415s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: У меня нет для вас хорошего ответа, когда дело касается видения.
 Знаете, это просто функция территории с такими постройками.
 Итак, вы знаете, я думаю, что у некоторых людей не будет предвидения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3268.188s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Нет, не на вашей земле, но вы знаете, как я уже сказал, это очень оживленный район.
 Теперь вы знаете,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3276.015s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Это справедливый вопрос.
 Это справедливый вопрос.
 Я имею в виду, я думаю, с точки зрения некоторых людей, честно говоря, моя цель — построить достаточно привлекательное здание.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3283.804s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Это здание очень красивое.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3285.786s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Проблема в том, что на заднице Кирби это смотрится не очень хорошо.
 Мы надеемся улучшить некоторые перспективы и обеспечить профилактику.
 Я уверен, что у некоторых людей могут быть комментарии.
 Вы знаете, что мы находимся на юго-западе и вы можете увидеть таинственные реки, я их не видел, но сомневаюсь, что они существуют, и я надеюсь, что наши виды по крайней мере лучше, чем у Каписа в Монро, но вы знаете, что там есть какая-то компенсация. У меня нет идеального ответа на этот вопрос.
 Это чашка? Я это сказал? Они правы: всё криво.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3316.688s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Правильно, этот офис пересекает шоссе 9, или Сервис-стрит, как мы все ее знаем, так что, когда вы пересекаете мост, вы выходите только на шоссе 16.
 Это то, что нужно людям в мозгу.
 Как говорят люди, на самом деле это частная дорога, продажи принадлежат городу, и я сказал, что когда они появились, я не мог в это поверить, я не мог поверить, что кому-то за это заплатили, было глупо делать это, чтобы облегчить движение на 16-м шоссе, самой загруженной дороге в этом районе.
 Продолжайте идти за этими блоками.
 Опять же, авария произошла не по его или чьей-либо вине, а полностью по вине DCR.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3359.618s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Да, я бы сказал так: возможно, мы не сможем решить все эти проблемы, но мы можем, и наши специалисты очень хорошие.
 Так что, возможно, мы сможем сделать что-то хотя бы положительное.
 Я имею в виду, что в Вествуде я много работаю над упрощением дорожного движения и устранением затруднений при поворотах и ​​кольцевых развязках.
 Некоторые люди ненавидят все эти слова и приемы, но иногда есть эффективные слова и приемы, с помощью которых мы можем вежливо и мягко остановить движение.
 У нас есть необходимое оборудование, и мы задействуем нашу команду, чтобы управлять им в меру своих возможностей.
 Девятая улица – частная, хорошая и плохая.
 Думаю, технически эта сумка или кошелек будет в середине очереди.
 Поэтому должен быть некоторый контроль конфиденциальности, и мы должны работать с нашими соседями, чтобы обеспечить безопасность всех в самолете, независимо от того, что происходит дома, независимо от того, чего хотят люди.
 Таким образом, здесь существует хороший демократический процесс.
 Но возможно есть решение этой проблемы.
 Честно говоря, архитекторы, которым мы помогли создать большинство изображений, входят в руководящий комитет Министерства транспорта Массачусетса, занимающийся реконструкцией этого перекрестка.
 Таким образом, существует большая последовательность, и если у нас есть возможность получить эту обратную связь и некоторые отзывы, которые мы получим, а также вопросы, которые мы рассмотрим, тогда мы сможем это сделать.
 Возможно, вы не сможете это исправить, но это может иметь более положительный эффект, чем вы думаете.
 Над этим будет работать наша команда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3445.637s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Майк, ты не подумаешь об организации трансфера до вокзала в рабочее время? Может быть, 7 к 10, 4 к 6, верно?
 Или можно подключить
 Потому что мы говорим о каких-то будущих событиях.
 Мы поинтересовались возможностью организации совместного трансфера до вокзала.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3473.179s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Мы обязательно это учтем.
 Честно говоря, я думаю, было бы лучше, если бы автобус оставил нас и прибыл в Веллингтон в час пик.
 Это было примерно в шести минутах ходьбы от того места, где мы жили, и я уже не был быстрым.
 Итак, вы знаете, что доберетесь туда быстро, не говоря уже о перекрестке.
 Так что посмотрим.
 Не скажу нет, но в одном из них я сомневаюсь.
 Мне жаль.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3501.709s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Мне просто хочется кричать.
 Прогулка менее шести минут.
 Около 15 минут.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3506.753s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Майк пересекает 16-ю улицу, и ты теряешь все.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3511.616s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Да, Кармело, сейчас я не откажусь.
 Я думаю, нам придется это рассмотреть.
 Если в этом районе есть ТМА, нас всегда просят присоединиться и внести свой вклад в ТМА.
 Поэтому мы должны наблюдать, как они это делают.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3523.705s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Но, насколько вам известно, вы сказали, что можете построить дом в самом оживленном уголке Медфорда.
 Итак, они говорят, знаете, плюс в том, что в Кэппи и Монро немного трафика, особенно в Кэппи, которые открыты 24 часа в сутки.
 Я думаю, что некоторые люди почувствуют некоторое облегчение из-за дорожной ситуации по сравнению с нынешней.
 Итак
 Спасибо за ваше руководство.
 Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3568.025s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: Это верно.
 Я в основном пользуюсь другими комментариями здесь.
 Меня больше всего беспокоит то, что я живу в квартире на Parkway Plaza South напротив 16-й улицы.
 Здесь много людей.
 Сегодня трудно съехать с 9-го шоссе.
 Если вы попытаетесь проехать по шоссе 16 и кольцевой развязке Веллингтона, это будет ужасно.
 По-моему, я обеспокоен тем, что строительство больших зданий вызовет невероятные заторов.
 Это моя главная забота.
 С другой стороны, я думаю, именно Линда подняла вопрос о грызунах.
 Но я думаю, что во время раскопок и строительства произойдут катастрофы.
 Повлияет ли это новое здание в конечном итоге на стоимость нашей собственности?
 Я имею в виду, я не думаю, что люди хотят жить в больших, многолюдных местах.
 И, как только что упомянул Рик, это самый оживленный район Медфорда.
 Я имею в виду, снизит ли это стоимость нашей собственности?
 Потому что у всех нас здесь есть квартиры.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3646.851s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Майк, я не оценщик недвижимости.
 Но я подозреваю, что именно он стоял за использованием за решеткой автомобилей, которые не запятнали прекрасные творения Кэппи.
 Будь тебе хорошим соседом.
 Итак, в Массачусетском технологическом институте проводятся исследования.
 Я думаю, это было сделано 15 лет назад, и они были действительно одержимы этим, это были две статьи, и, к сожалению, я их не прочитал.
 Они обнаружили, что районы с разными доходами практически в одностороннем порядке повышают ценность районов вокруг них.
 Так что я бы сказал, что я не оценщик, но я должен представить, что наличие такого дружелюбного первоклассного соседа, помимо того, что он есть, поможет вам или, конечно, не повлияет на вашу стоимость.
 Ты пытаешься меня напугать, и мышка немного напугана.
 Давайте разберемся с этой страшной задачей.</p>

 Привет, Майк, спасибо за знакомство.
 Мы находимся в Вест-Паркуэй Плаза.
 Мы просто еще один сосед.
 Рад встрече.
 Спасибо за организацию этого мероприятия.
 Итак, у нас есть несколько простых вопросов.
 Во-первых, как вы думаете, сколько времени займет такое строительство?
 Вы упомянули, я знаю, что еще слишком рано, но когда, по вашему мнению, мы сможем начать?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3785.098s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Это верно.
 Таким образом, строительство такого проекта может занять до 2024 месяцев.
 Я буду говорить в основном об этом.
 Здание закончено, и наши дети заняты внутри.
 Итак, да, я бы сказал две вещи об открытии и разрушении. В любом случае, текущее время на рынке около 2 лет.
 Что касается того, когда начнется строительство, я не могу сказать городу, сколько времени займет процесс получения разрешения, но обычно получение разрешения занимает около года, а затем еще шесть-девять месяцев на проектирование и проектирование.
 Так что, пока мы можем двигаться дальше, это хороший выход.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3836.325s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Спасибо
 Что делать, если кто-то мешает соседнему зданию?
 Как мы делаем во время строительства, или, вы знаете, после завершения строительства.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3849.11s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Конечно.
 Знаете, мы начнем, осмотрим все здания вокруг нас и убедимся, что они хорошо построены и не повреждены, прежде чем что-либо предпринимать.
 Это действительно тяжелая работа.
 Но сегодня все эти здания строятся с помощью центральных кранов.
 В общем, вещи сделаны изнутри.
 Тогда
 Что касается влияния на окружающие нас здания, мы изучаем этот момент во многих городах, такие небольшие места часто находятся вблизи жилых массивов.
 Идея в том, что мы построим красивый высокий забор из непрозрачной сетки, чтобы вам не приходилось видеть многое из того, что мы делаем за кулисами.
 К счастью, этот тип строительства не является очень утомительным строительным процессом.
 Мы обязательно будем работать с городами и такими людьми, как вы, на публичных слушаниях, чтобы обсудить подходящее время и тому подобное.
 Мы не будем вас беспокоить.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3917.32s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Спасибо
 Мы очень ценим возможность выступить, потому что это очень полезно.
 Последний вопрос: 5-этажных квартир не более 260, просто хотите узнать, насколько велика средняя квартира?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3931.2s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Просто рвота около 920.
 Глава 945.
 Итак, мы думаем, что единство — это трудная для понимания концепция, поэтому мы находим чувство единства в этой большой оранжевой коробке.
 Мы считаем, что самое важное здесь — это программирование серии продуктов.
 Медфорд разнообразен в таких областях, как уровень дохода, уровень образования, тип работы и варианты транспорта.
 Таким образом, количество оборудования, которое мы считаем подходящим для студии и детской кроватки, будет меньше.
 Эти люди часто становятся нашими первыми сотрудниками, которые еще не женаты, не имеют дочери или сына и с нетерпением ждут второго этапа своей карьеры.
 Так что это сильный рынок каждый квартал.
 Кажется, что вы одиноки и делаете карьеру, или, может быть, немного позже, потому что вы все еще выполняете свою первую или вторую работу, но вы женаты и у вас есть девушка или парень.
 Вам нравится это.
 Итак, во время нашего последнего поиска мы подумали, что определенно есть место для высококачественной квартиры с двумя спальнями, но, продолжая поиски, оказалось, что оно оказалось немного меньше, чем мы думали.
 Спасибо.
 Знаете, нам нужно продолжать попытки найти разнообразный рынок для обслуживания Медфорда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4018.142s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Спасибо
 Я хочу задать вопрос нашему председателю.
 Он хотел, чтобы я спросил его</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4024.407s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Да, мне интересно, сможете ли вы оценить конструкцию здания перед началом строительства.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4030.666s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Ты слышишь меня?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4032.069s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Что ж, далеко мы не ушли в своих поисках, в своих поисках.
 Знаете, я не думаю, что нам это нужно, знаете, типа мы не умеем ездить, я не думаю, что нам нужны акции или что-то в этом роде.
 Но обычно, если на объекте происходит какое-то серьезное нарушение, если мы копаем яму или кучу мусора или проводим сейсмический анализ на всех участках, мы нанимаем компанию, которая специализируется на этом.
 Особенно, когда вы находитесь рядом с другими зданиями.
 Мы работаем над проектом в Уолтеме, примерно в 12 футах от соседей.
 Итак, вы знаете, мы используем всевозможные сейсмометры и высокотехнологичные устройства, чтобы убедиться, что мы не делаем ничего плохого нашим соседям.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4078.827s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Спасибо
 Другие хотят подтверждения того, что все едино и бизнес не разделен.
 Розничные магазины, такие как Starbucks или знакомые.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4089.758s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Что ж, у нас есть хороший вопрос.
 Знаете, мы рассматриваем транзитные станции и подумали, что, возможно, нам захочется увидеть больше коммерческого использования на первом этаже.
 Но вы знаете, проблема дорожного движения, поднятая сегодня вечером, – это то, на что мы искренне надеемся.
 Я лично наблюдал за некоторыми встречами с MassDOT и за тем, как они установили этот перекресток.
 Вы знаете, это повлияет на большее количество трафика.
 Мы считаем, что все, что связано с дополнительным трафиком и временным влиянием на продажи, будет негативным в той степени, в которой они могут оказать негативное влияние на нас.
 Еще одна вещь, над которой мы работаем, — это высокий спрос.
 Знаете, если торговые площади хорошие, я могу только сказать, что, надеюсь, торговля в этом районе будет больше похожа на торговую площадь на улице.
 Например, до сих пор вы не могли арендовать место в Starbucks, если бы там не было самообслуживания.
 По этому маршруту также курсирует множество торговых точек, в том числе других кафе.
 Некоторые виды кафе или кафе кажутся подходящими для данного места проведения.
 Учитывая все эти моменты и влияние на трафик, мы решили исключить эту часть концепции.
 Так что стоит обсудить больше, но, честно говоря, с точки зрения трафика и воздействия это будет хуже для сообщества и местоположения.
 И последнее: если вы не сделаете это идеально, компания не сможет вас нанять.
 Даже если мы знаем меньше, мы все равно решаем продать по более низкой цене, чем рыночная.
 С точки зрения городского планирования пространство и деградация — это реальные проблемы со всевозможными негативными последствиями, поэтому я рад, что вы задали этот вопрос, потому что мы потратили так много времени на его исследование и обсуждение, поэтому мы говорим только о жилье и связанных с ним целях.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4209.242s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Здравствуйте, меня зовут Гена.
 У меня есть еще один вопрос.
 Вы сказали, что на каждое транспортное средство будет парковаться по одному автомобилю.
 В настоящее время в более или менее единицах есть две машины, поэтому парковки в этом районе нет.
 Что вы будете делать?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4227.406s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Две вещи.
 Во-первых, я не согласен с вашими взглядами.
 Большинство наших жителей не пользуются автомобилями дома или даже в жилых районах, потому что наш жилищный фонд больше, а население старше и менее квалифицировано.
 Мы не находимся на том этапе, когда в среднем на одно транспортное средство приходится по две машины.
 Но даже если я ошибаюсь, я скажу вам одно: я поставлю свои деньги туда, где мои слова, и туда, где мы берем этот и другие проекты.
 Конечно, мы
 Мы обеспокоены тем, что кто-то припарковался на дороге в пострадавшем районе, особенно в данном случае на улице 9.
 Мы можем придумать простую фразу, которая запрещает жителям парковаться на улице и обязать их делать это по контракту.
 Я делал это раньше.
 Это очень легко сделать.
 Если это что-то, что сообщество или город считает важным, мы можем выявить это с помощью таких же решительных мер.
 Нет, я так не думаю, я думаю, ох очень легко.
 Думаю, наши конкуренты могут снизить эту сумму до 0,75 за машину или за машину или до 0,85 за машину.
 Честно говоря, я думаю, что положение Медфорда в этом отношении довольно продвинутое.
 Они не могут, по сути, проводить какие-то исследования, потому что мы делаем это постоянно и этот анализ не может быть случайным.
 Они знают, что делает этот клиент.
 Так ох ох
 В таких городах, как Кембридж, мне приходится меньше парковаться.
 Они посоветовали мне поехать в другое место.
 У нас есть много исследований по этому вопросу.
 С точки зрения бизнеса мы знаем, что нам нужно.
 Если у нас недостаточно парковочных мест для наших клиентов, они не будут арендовать у нас парковочное место.
 Поэтому последнее, что я хочу сделать, — это ограничить парковку без необходимости, потому что это повлияет на наш бизнес.
 Но если вы не верите, я ограничу вас своими деньгами.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4346.218s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Извините, у меня только что был последний вопрос.
 Это остается.
 Вход в гараж и здание находится на Миддлсекс-авеню, а не на Девятой улице.
 Это правда?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4358.503s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: С этой точки зрения это правда.
 Мы чувствуем, что вы не хотите, чтобы мы привезли новую машину на Девятую улицу.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4363.785s">[Unidentified]</a>: Спасибо
 Советник Каравиелло.
 Спасибо, Кэти.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4374.114s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Если вы говорите о покупке квартиры не в этом маленьком уголке, то я могу вам дать одну-две вещи, с которыми у вашей квартиры все в порядке, какая для него недвижимость нам нужна, чтобы сделать ее более однородной.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4387.761s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Советник, как вы просите меня ответить на этот вопрос?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4392.414s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Я не знаю.
 Я имею в виду, что это улучшит вашу собственность и сделает ее лучше.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4402.718s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Потому что у тебя есть все, знаешь, я скажу это, я скажу это, я замужем за градостроителем, и это сильно.
 Это тема некоторого обсуждения.
 Я не пропущу этого.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4413.563s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Я не хочу покидать недвижимость.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4416.425s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Короче говоря, я выстрелил несколько раз безуспешно.
 Нет, я просто хочу знать.
 Я хочу это сделать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4423.15s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Но это не имеет значения.
 Вы также упомянули проблему с парковкой.
 Если вы поедете в Rivers Edge, Moderna или Rivers Edge, парковка Moderna Apartments не будет заполнена.
 В подразделении Rivers Edge также нет машин.
 Я думаю, что два дня стоянки — это когда обе машины пусты.
 Может быть, есть люди, у которых есть две машины, но в основном у молодых людей есть все Uber, а у некоторых даже нет машины.
 Посмотрите на новые многоквартирные дома Moderna и Rivers Edge.
 Они скажут вам, что у них у всех есть парковка и стоянки.
 Сейчас у недостаточного количества людей есть автомобили.
 Спасибо, что позволили нам это сделать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4469.202s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Последний вопрос Мэри Харрис, потом мы пойдем к мусору в самолете.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4475.105s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Да, я ценю ваш вопрос о парковке, оно того стоит, я боюсь, что мой вопрос будет немного другим.
 Вот почему я скучал по тебе с самого начала
 Майк, мы с твоей презентацией до сих пор точно не знаем, сколько вещей ты планируешь сделать.
 Мой вопрос: какие цвета могут повлиять на такие места, как наш бассейн?
 Знаете, какой эффект бывает летом, когда мы садимся веселиться?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4511.768s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Сначала мы запустили подписку восьмого уровня и видим здесь сообщество восьмого уровня.
 Что касается ситуации в районе Северной и Южной улиц, 16, то мы, конечно, не считаем целесообразным продолжать.
 Так что с исследовательской точки зрения, честно говоря, мы еще не достигли этой цели.
 Это не редкость в процессе лицензирования.
 Я сомневаюсь, что мы сделаем это здесь.
 Поэтому я прошу прощения.
 Я не знаю, где находится ваш бассейн, но мы его видим.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4546.449s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Напротив улицы 9.
 Оно позади Кейси.
 Когда меня там не было, я мог видеть крышу Кейси.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4554.171s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Идеальный.
 Это верно.
 Я имею в виду, что краткий ответ: мы изучим это и проанализируем.
 Извините, у меня нет для вас хорошего и четкого ответа, это будет частью процесса лицензирования.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4566.864s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: По мере вашего роста.
 Спасибо
 Думаю, большая часть того, о чем мы говорим в наших беседах, раскрыта, но вернемся к заданному вопросу, почему сдаются дома, а не квартиры?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4587.23s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Есть много хороших ответов, но краткий ответ заключается в том, что Alliance Homes вообще не строит квартиры.
 Мы частная компания.
 Это то, что отличает нас от некоторых наших конкурентов.
 Вы знаете, мы не инвестиционная группа, поддерживаемая банком.
 Мы строим много домов каждый год, а в некоторые годы больше, чем любой другой дом, но на самом деле мы четыре основных партнера.
 Мы полностью приватны.
 Именно это сотрудники Финикса, где находится наша штаб-квартира, делают все возможное, чтобы отговорить инвесторов от участия.
 Поэтому, когда они строят квартиру, им приходится переосмысливать то, чего они решили не делать.
 Итак, это структура и процедура, которой мы не занимаемся.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4638.742s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Думаю, мы ответили на вопросы и обсудили улицу 9 и комнаты 1, 2 и 3. Думаю, ты делаешь это правильно, Майк.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4650.185s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Я думаю, да, теоретически мы все еще находимся в состоянии нестабильности, поэтому мы все еще говорим о качестве наших единиц, но вы знаете, что это интересный и меняющийся рынок.
 Таким образом, состав постоянно меняется, но мы думаем в первую очередь о сообществах с одной и двумя спальнями.
 Конечно, будут также более крупные и более мелкие подразделения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4670.697s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Следующий вопрос – что будет с инфраструктурой.
 Да, в новостройке упал напор воды.
 Знаете, любой может ответить, что все производимое проектируется и тестируется.
 Работайте над тем, чтобы инфраструктура могла выдержать новое строительство.
 Интересно, что вы хотите сюда добавить?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4693.424s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Я могу добавить это.
 Могу сказать вам, что ответ почти наверняка — нет.
 Мы проверили воду.
 Проверьте наличие всего необходимого оборудования.
 Конечно, все телекоммуникации и СМИ.
 Воды много и хороший напор.
 Кроме того, наше здание высокое и может потребоваться собственный водяной насос.
 Не пятиэтажное здание или меньше.
 Это здание очень просится, если мы сможем его убрать.
 Я не думаю, что у вас будет такой эффект.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4731.129s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Другой вопрос: будет ли профсоюзная работа или нет?
 Я знаю, что это также первая фаза проекта.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4739.397s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Ну, я бы сказал, что обычно это отличная комбинация.
 Это зависит.
 Плотники и бетонщики почти всегда являются плотниками и плотниками из профсоюза.
 Есть еще несколько предприятий, но мы предлагаем конкурентоспособные цены во всех аспектах.
 Но краткий ответ: мы пока не знаем.
 Нам еще предстоит много работы, прежде чем мы доберемся туда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4759.341s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Хотите знать, как выбрать идеальный ковер Shaw для вашей гостиной?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4771.045s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Это верно.
 Я имею в виду, я думаю, что в этом суть того, о чем мы говорили вначале: мы ожидаем возвращения части асфальта на западе и юге, который изначально задумывался как путь к загадочному острову.
 Забронируйте номер в Fellsway.
 Конечно, я хочу сказать, что технически я думаю, что он будет находиться в частной собственности, но вы знаете, что он будет соединяться с каждой улицей, перекрестком и всем остальным в этом районе.
 Итак, краткий ответ: да.
 Мы считаем, что в этих областях мы можем привнести в эти места много инноваций.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4805.474s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Я думаю, что на большинство других проверочных вопросов даны ответы, за исключением вопроса об отправке видеоконференции по электронной почте, конечно, мой адрес электронной почты находится на почте, и я могу попробовать. Я знаю, что обсуждал последнюю встречу из-за ее размера.
 Разместите эту информацию там, но обычно она будет размещена на веб-сайте конференции в Медфорде и будет там.
 Если люди захотят это увидеть, вы можете написать мне по электронной почте, и я постараюсь найти ссылку на него.
 Думаю, на этом разговор закончится.
 Все еще проблема.
 Поэтому я хочу поблагодарить всех, кто пришел, вы имеете в виду Майка.
 Позвольте мне задать вам несколько вопросов.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4856.578s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Что ж, я просто хочу сказать, что это были невероятные выборы.
 Я благодарен всем вам.
 Вы поднимаете сложные вопросы.
 Вы — хорошо изученная команда.
 Так что спасибо, что присоединились.
 Знаете, мы этим занимаемся, я уже говорил, что живу здесь.
 Это то, чем я действительно увлечен: строительство домов в районе Бостона.
 Это хорошие вопросы.
 Это то, что мы контролируем всеми предприятиями.
 я скучаю по тебе
 Я сохраню работу, которую делал раньше.
 Мы умеем решать все эти проблемы не хуже других, поэтому мы хотим быть хорошими соседями и строим дома, и вы знаете, это не лаборатория для строительства розничных магазинов, или что-то плохое в том, что мы строим место, где мы хотим быть уверены, что люди действительно хотят оставаться и наслаждаться местом, которое вы любите.
 Так что спасибо за поддержку и сообщите нам, если есть какие-либо другие проблемы, которые отсутствуют, и, возможно, у нас будет последний шанс их проверить.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4912.428s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Возникают вопросы, какая строительная техника будет стоять во время строительства и не потеряется ли парковка на 9-м маршруте из-за установки пожарных рукавов.
 Огнетушители и т.д.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4928.465s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Я бы сказал, возможно, нет.
 Это действительно зависит от пожарной службы, но в таком здании внутри здания будет много водопроводных соединений.
 Я имею в виду, что если бы начальнику пожарной охраны нужен был пожарный гидрант, он бы это сделал, но я не думаю, что это повлияло бы на какую-либо парковку, если бы это было так.
 Поэтому на первый вопрос, предыдущий вопрос о парковке, которая является большой проблемой, особенно на стройке, есть краткий ответ.
 Знаешь, когда мы
 Извините, когда мы подходим к этапу строительства, нам нужно провести логистические исследования, рабочие исследования, и я считаю, что всю работу, которую мы выполняем сегодня в строительстве, наши подрядчики используют парковку за пределами площадки, поэтому мы делаем это для всех.
 Так что, если есть опасения, что они начнут блокировать 9-й маршрут, ответ — нет, держитесь подальше от наших детей.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4982.985s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: И тут возникает вопрос, а твои соседи знают, будешь ли ты продолжать? Я думаю, это будут общественные слушания.
 Если бы только этого можно было достичь.
 Знаете, я думаю, что следующий шаг — определить, что это такое.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4998.898s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Да, я имею в виду, возможно, каникулы не закончатся, если мы продолжим.
 Мы использовали ту же структуру уведомлений, чтобы сообщить нашим соседям на этой встрече, что мы будем использовать ее на других встречах или публичных слушаниях.
 Итак, краткий ответ: я думаю, они могут выглядеть вот так.
 Если вы продолжите, мы увидим что-то в вашем почтовом ящике.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=5023.622s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: На этом встреча завершается. Желаю всем счастья, безопасности и берегите себя по случаю Пчум Бена. Спасибо всем за внимание.
 Спасибо</p>
