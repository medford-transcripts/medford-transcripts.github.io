    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=0.091s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Buenas noches a todos.
 Kathleen no toca nuestras oficinas.
 Estoy aquí esta noche.
 Parece que se acabó Julian, director general de una empresa residencial de alianza en Nueva Inglaterra.
 y Matthew Harrity, gerente de desarrollo de alianza residencial.
 Primero, nos gustaría agradecer a todos por asistir a esta reunión comunitaria relacionada con la posible reurbanización de las propiedades ubicadas en 5.73 Bells Way, que es la licorería Cappies en 20 Revere Beach Park Way Monroe Muffler Break.
 El propósito de esta reunión es presentar el proyecto que se encuentra en sus etapas preliminares 19 comentarios de ustedes, el vecindario.
 Nos adelantamos a la presentación.
 Aproximadamente 15 a 20 minutos después de la presentación habrá una oportunidad para preguntas y comentarios. Hemos asignado aproximadamente una hora para esta reunión.
 En términos de reglas básicas generales.
 Le pediría que se mantenga en silencio hasta que le llamen a hablar.
 Además de hacer preguntas al grupo.
 También puede hacer sus preguntas y comentarios en el chat, y los analizaremos en los últimos cinco a 10 minutos de la reunión.
 Le pediría que se abstenga de enviar mensajes privados directos, sólo porque es difícil coordinar el chat y monitorear un mensaje privado.
 Entonces, si tienen alguna pregunta, pueden ponerla en el chat grupal y la analizaremos.
 Y dicho esto, le pasaré la presentación a Mike Bajulian, director general de Alliance Residential.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=90.257s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Está bien.
 Gracias, Kathy.
 Buenas noches a todos.
 Como mencionó Kathy, mi nombre es Mike Bejulian.
 Soy el socio regional de Alliance Residential Company en Nueva Inglaterra.
 Somos un constructor de viviendas multifamiliares a nivel nacional.
 Sin embargo, gestionamos cada región prácticamente como si fuera su propia operación.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=112.722s">[Unidentified]</a>: Y déjalo pasar ahora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=113.903s">[Maria D'Orsi]</a>: Grabación en curso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=117.704s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Lo lamento.
 De todos modos, administramos nuestra empresa desde cada división hacia arriba.
 Entonces, si bien somos un grupo nacional con sede en Phoenix, nuestras oficinas están en 184 High Street en Boston.
 Nací, crecí y todavía vivo en Arlington.
 Y todo nuestro personal está ubicado aquí en Boston.
 Entonces, si no le importa, mantenga el micrófono silenciado para que podamos tener alguna interferencia.
 Esta noche estamos aquí para hablar sobre una posible reurbanización de 2 parcelas en Medford.
 Quiero enfatizar que no solo los sitios los tenemos actualmente bajo contrato y estamos en un período de estudio en el que estamos evaluando un poco la viabilidad de una posible reurbanización para estas parcelas.
 Sinceramente, esto es un poco antes de lo que normalmente celebraríamos una reunión vecinal de este tipo.
 Normalmente habríamos avanzado un poco más en el proceso.
 y tener un poco mejor detalle.
 Creo que tenemos algunas buenas respuestas y algunos buenos puntos de discusión para hablar con ustedes esta noche.
 Pero para ser claros, este material no es parte de una solicitud formal, y aún no estamos formalmente ante ninguna junta municipal ni ante el concejo municipal para revisar este proyecto.
 Así que nuevamente, sólo les pido paciencia.
 Este es un material preliminar.
 Es posible que no tengamos todas las respuestas a sus preguntas.
 Probablemente podamos hablar con ellos con bastante detalle.
 Y es por eso que estamos emocionados de tener una sesión de preguntas y respuestas con ustedes.
 En el transcurso del próximo mes aproximadamente, completaremos nuestro período de estudio para el proyecto.
 Por eso, probablemente no sorprenda que el mundo y su economía en estos momentos estén un poco fluctuantes.
 Estamos procediendo con cuidado para asegurarnos de no cometer ningún error mientras atravesamos estos tiempos turbulentos.
 ¿Puedo prepararte la presentación?
 En unos momentos, compartiré mi pantalla y los guiaré a través de algunos de los conceptos que hemos desarrollado, el lugar y el contexto del sitio y otras cosas.
 Como mencionó Kathy, no dude en preparar cualquier pregunta que tenga sobre el proyecto en el chat de Zoom.
 Estamos grabando eso.
 Repasaremos eso al final e intentaremos abordar todas las preguntas lo mejor que podamos.
 Con eso, intentaré compartir mi pantalla.
 Y por favor tengan paciencia conmigo.
 No uso mucho Zoom.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=265.599s">[Unidentified]</a>: Bueno.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=280.245s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  So these first slides we're going to start with are really just to get you acclimated with the neighborhood.
 I know that sounds silly because many of you live in the immediate area.
 However, we want to just make sure we all get started on the same page and talk about a little bit about the context for where we started our studies and conceptual program for the site.
 So the first one here is, of course, this is East Medford.
 Route 16 runs right across the page left to right.
 And the Fellsway and Middlesex Avenue run north to south.
 The taped site in yellow is the assembled parcels.
 Cappy's is the larger sort of hexagonal building.
 And Monroe Muffler is here on the east side on the property line.
 So the combined site,
 which again are 573 Fellsway, which is Cappy's Liquors, and 20 Revere Beach Parkway just to the east is the Monroe Muffler Shop.
 You'll see to the south here, Station Landing, the Mystic River Reservation off to the southwest, and the shopping centers up to the northwest.
 Of course, Wellington Station is at about 430 on your page.
 We've got a few axios here to show the immediate neighborhood.
 Again, these are really just to kind of show context of how the site fits in with the larger areas.
 We've turned the camera a bit on you.
 So, Route 16 or Revere Beach Parkway is running off to the east towards the top of Page and the Fellsway down to the right and Middlesex Avenue and the Fellsway up to the left.
 Cappy's there is just left of center.
 So obviously the neighborhood really is, you know, primarily seven and eight-story mixed-use buildings, quite a bit of housing in high-rise format.
 And you'll see Wellington just off top right of page.
 We'll flip the camera a bit here and looking southeast now, Cappies again just left of center, Route 16 traveling up and to the left of your screen, and station landing off across, southerly across Route 16 there.
 So looking at these photos, we like this site in the city for a lot of reasons.
 Medford's a great city.
 It features anything a modern resident would want, which is, of course, our business.
 The city is close to Boston, which in itself is always attractive.
 But really, it already has its own deep bench of employment of retail of walkability open space and history so all of those things stitched together to where, where, where our customers would want to live, they want to be close to home, they want to be able to walk to amenities, you know, nobody really wants to be in their car.
 And we've spent some time studying this intersection.
 Growing up in Arlington, I know this intersection well.
 So getting out of your car in this neighborhood is certainly an attractive thing, and Medford offers the ability to do that.
 And this site is really a microcosm more broadly of Medford, having all of those things I just mentioned within sometimes less than 1,000 feet of walking.
 Macro as a Bostonian, this is the type of modern housing I think greater Boston needs and regionally we need in eastern Massachusetts, where people even in cold weather aren't required to get into their vehicle to get a coffee to travel to work to pick up a prescription or to go get a classic roast beef at Kelly's across the street.
 So
 I'm going to move into some site photographs.
 I'm sure you guys are all relatively familiar with this, but I feel like we just want to be thorough.
 So this is a shot looking north of Cappy's, somewhat northeast, with 9th Street just in the back.
 You'll see a blue double two-story home on the left side of the screen with a garage.
 That is the 9th Street area.
 Monroe is just off to the right of your screen.
 This is a shot from Revere Beach Parkway on one of the many curb cuts on these two parcels.
 So we're looking straight north across the property line between Monroe and the Cappy site.
 This is a shot from 9th Street looking south.
 So Station Landing is in the background.
 Monroe is on just left of center and Cappy's, the back of Cappy's is just right of center.
 So you're looking at the intersection basically concealed only by the Cappy's.
 And then this is also a 9th Street shot looking the other direction.
 So you can see Boston Tattoo here in the background and the 9th Street intersection, current intersection and curb cut with Cappy's.
 So this last is an obvious satellite image of the site.
 We've oriented this North and South so we can stop getting you guys dizzy.
 9th Street runs East and West across the top of the site.
 This is Middlesex Avenue on the left, and again, Route 16 on the bottom.
 The property isn't taped, but it is this L-shaped combination of these two parcels, not including the Boston Tattoo Company.
 This is a good start to show where the site planning begins for us, apart from the macro context of the area and the uses that are here and the amenities.
 This is really where we start trying to integrate and stitch those things together into a program.
 On the left and on the south of the site, we're bound by these two roads or parkways.
 These were
 These are actually very interesting if you don't know the history, but these were formerly, like many parkways in greater Boston, were run by the MDC, now DCR.
 The spirit of these roads was effectively, as we were becoming an automobile-focused society, to have a pleasure-driving avenue to explore the area's benefits.
 So you, I'm sure, are all familiar with the Middlesex Bells.
 and the Mystic River reservations.
 These are really just spectacular green spaces, and the former MDC knew that, and they knew that they wanted people to experience those in a pleasurable way.
 So on the south side of the site, you'll see there's a pretty deep, for an urban zone like this, a pretty deep setback with mature trees and paths.
 Believe it or not, there's actually a deed restriction on these sites that allows the parkways to remain what their original intent was.
 So while we might not be putting around in a 57 Chevrolet enjoying the Mystic River Reservation here today,
 I drive on at least three parkways on the way to work every day.
 These are commuter roads now.
 But there's still an opportunity here, we think, to maintain the spirit of what these parkways were initially for.
 And one thing we found interesting was that on the west side of this site, along the Middlesex Avenue, it's paved right to the sidewalk.
 and there so those setbacks and deed notes actually exist there as well and so one of the things we thought might be attractive and seems to mate with some of the intersection plans being discussed is is an ability to use that even though it is on this property rather than leave it as asphalt is to try and continue that parkway um parkway spirit the paths put mature trees and native plantings there and the like um so
 We think restoring that buffer could be a real opportunity.
 So I'm going to move to the next shot.
 This is an actual concept we're working with.
 And it's roughly centered on the page as this is.
 So again, you'll see the, well, mislabeled Fellsway.
 That's technically Middlesex, of course, but Revere Beach Parkway on the bottom.
 And you'll see how we're looking at really adding back into those buffer zones, as I mentioned before, some of the green spaces.
 A number of other things worth highlighting as we get into this we're going to show you some more details on on how we program space conceptually.
 This community's proposed at 265 units of rental housing, we do not build condominiums in an eight story format with 100% of the resident parking enclosed within the building so.
 A lot of the surface parking areas that are on the perimeter of the area and nearby sites, we're going to instead work to green those up and bring the parking inside the envelope completely.
 We'll talk a little more about the rest of the program.
 But to get you started, effectively, we craft these communities so that they are a completely enclosed community.
 And so by that I mean, while this looks like a pretty normal building,
 from the outside, all of our building systems are located internally.
 So, trash, refuse collection and recycling, separation, emergency services and access, all of our amenities, or most of the amenities, I should say, that are internal to the site.
 Everything is neatly encapsulated within the envelope of the building we propose here.
 So, you'll see on the site, there's donut shape is primarily the mass of the building.
 However, there is a hole in the middle and we'll use that courtyard to have some outdoor private space for residents.
 That's a little more private than perhaps walking across the street to the mystic river.
 But typically, and we'll show you some photos of how we treat these spaces.
 But these spaces typically have a large pool deck, sort of resort styled.
 We'll have outdoor cooking areas, lounges and cabanas and that sort of thing.
 A space where, you know, to kind of center the entire community around.
 On the upper left of the page, you'll note we've got a curb cut proposed here off of Middlesex.
 And in fact, to expand on that, the site currently features five curb cuts.
 And I'm sure we'll spend a lot of time talking about traffic and parking here.
 But the big story here is we're going to try and eliminate all of those curb cuts but one.
 We have not engaged a traffic engineer at this time.
 However, we've done enough of these to know that on a busy intersection like this, particularly one that's in flux for its future, that the less interruption and the less curb cuts that you're delivering traffic onto, the better.
 Excuse me.
 So our goal here would be to eliminate as many of those curb cuts in this planet, four of the five would be would be removed from the site.
 Inside the garage, so residents will drive into the building here, just above where it says loading, and there'll be three levels of parking.
 So the first three levels of the program would all be structured parking and other building services, and then all of the housing, but for a very few units, would be located on floors four and above.
 So we're gonna dig into the building here a little bit.
 This would be the first level if you were to just shave everything on floors two through eight off.
 And so as you arrive, you'll see the only surface parking we're proposing is just at the amenity area.
 That's also where we would have our 24-hour leasing and staff located.
 So future residents might use these spaces if they were to come look at a home or to check out the community.
 So that that sort of area all on the west side labeled as amenity would be a two story volume focused on the leasing and then a number of different amenities, which we'll talk a little bit about later.
 but primarily work from home type spaces, screening rooms, flex spaces.
 And we'll show you some of the other examples of what we do for fun in those spaces.
 So those would be separated from the garage element.
 The next two levels above this would also be parking served by internal ramps.
 So invisible to the outside.
 This would be an upper garage.
 parking floor like two or three you'll note that now above the common program area will add some homes and there'll be some again on the south side until we get to the upper residential floors, such as this where it'll be all housing on force for and above.
 So we'll also in these upper floors probably have some amenities.
 We're finding that most surprising amount of people are not going back to the office.
 And so the flex time and work from home spaces are becoming an important part of our business.
 So while some people may go to work, the typical customer here is working in a high tech or an R&D type
 And those have, you know, non traditional non nine to five types of hours.
 So we're now building our amenities to make those spaces more pleasurable and make your sort of to help you separate work from home, even when you are near home, as you would be in this.
 So we've added some, these shots are what we call axiometrics.
 These shots were created with the intent to kind of stitch what we're proposing into the neighborhood.
 So you'll notice, like most of the buildings around here, this is also eight stories.
 I think one of the station landing buildings up front is seven.
 but you'll see we're looking to pull things back off of the parkways and contribute back to what that sort of original mission was for those roadways and also just give this a little bit of a softer edge on what is a very hard-edged zone.
 So this we've also picked these spaces to
 try to relate to the aerial views we showed you earlier.
 So where we were showing you a photo very similar to this of the Cappies and Monroe site to show you how this would stitch into those with the massing around it.
 Now, this is a shot looking south, excuse me, southeast.
 So Ninth Street would be just in front of the building here in your view and the Middlesex Avenue and the Fells Way coming basically straight up the page on the right side.
 station landings here in the back.
 We're proposing a lot of verticality.
 This is what we'd call a Vitruvian style building.
 It's very classic.
 We're not sure this is the space based on what's around it.
 There's a lot of brick.
 There's a lot of sort of traditional materials.
 Station landing is a relatively classic and timeless architecture.
 So we didn't feel it was appropriate to use some of the real contemporary modern looks.
 for this space.
 So we stuck with some pretty classic verticality and spacing and dimensions to the building.
 To help you stay oriented, this was the small little future resident parking area, and the garage entry would be right here.
 And again, these first three levels, despite the fact that they look traditional with windows and the like, would actually be just the same cladding, just enclosing the parking structure.
 So this is a similar angle to the one we just showed you just brought down from from the seagull residents of Medford's viewpoint to get you down to a more pedestrian scale.
 Again this is where those future resident spots in the curb cut on the middle section might be and a garage parking entrance here if you can see my cursor moving.
 So
 This is, again, this is an early concept, so this may look developed, and we have looked at a couple of other options, but this is sort of the path we've been going stylistically with the concept.
 Next, we're gonna show you some photos of other projects we've done in Greater Boston that have things that we think at least conceptually belong in a project like this.
 This is a community we built called The Val that we've just finished, or just finishing leasing up.
 And so some of the things you'll note here is a big two-story volume at the arrival.
 I mentioned that there was that amenity labeled space was also amenities, but also our leasing and management staff.
 So this is a good example of how we integrate some of these things.
 On the right side of this feature wall is actually the back of house where at all times you can find somebody on our team working there.
 But there's also this sort of hotel-styled arrival here, which is some of the way
 apartment home communities are going.
 So there's someone here at all times kind of giving you a more full service feeling during the
 well, during regular hours, more full service feeling to the building.
 And then you'll see these two stories and a feature stair.
 This is something we'd like to integrate in this project as well, where we really are stitching together some of these assembly spaces, work from home spaces, or maybe you're just scrolling and rolling with your earbuds in and your music on, but places where this is a little more activated and a little more public.
 This actually, this wall was, we had a local artist custom paint it for us in sort of a thematic nod to the name.
 This is a project we built two years ago called The Cove.
 This is another idea of just some of those sort of flex spaces where this is really,
 more recreational space, obviously a pool table, there's actually a beer tap back there and wine, excuse me, and a wine cooler.
 But this is a space that would also be, we would propose something like stylistically different, of course, right near those amenity and leasing spaces, a little more open concept.
 This is one of our fitness centers we just completed.
 This one's actually done on two levels.
 We had a lot of fun with this one.
 We're utilizing private mirror rooms for online workouts and then of course all the traditional cardio.
 So this one has actually up top of this spiral staircase has a cardio deck and then the rest of your workout is all below here.
 So you can get an idea of how we really want to create an enclosed, fully encapsulated community, but in a very first class way.
 This is a pool deck shot.
 So this is an important one because this is a good analogy for how we would treat that center of the donut type space you saw.
 This is also a green roof on deck.
 These trees, while brand new, will grow to be full 40 foot sugar maples and red maples.
 So we have a team that understands how to put
 full-sized real vegetation on top of a deck.
 Under this is a parking level, not unlike we would propose on this site.
 Then a full, of course, heated pool and resort style, three, four months of the year, great place to hang out with your iPad or just get some sun.
 This is a good example of how we would treat that.
 This is in the same project at the Val I mentioned earlier, similar green roof.
 You know, you'll see something.
 We had some taller trees at the inception here, but, and some lawn back there, which is hard to see, but we fully green up hard and soft scape.
 This one has a cool sun deck where you can throw your chaise lounge right in the water.
 It's heated and, and hang out, you know, we'll have fire, we have a large fire pit.
 And then this one, you can actually see the grilling stations, private grilling areas where you and your friends can kind of hang out.
 and have dinner.
 And then this is just, we just wanted to give you an idea of what some of our apartment homes look like.
 Alliance is a little different than some of our more cookie cutter national competitors.
 I'm not here to throw shade at any of them.
 There's a lot of great groups out there.
 We just really kind of treat each project with a little bit more of a customized approach.
 And so, you know, in our Hingham asset, you know, that was more appropriate to have a little bit more of a coastal New England style and a little bit more classic sort of features.
 You know, at workforce spaces, you might want to be a little cooler, have a little bit more fun with some of the design, a little less safe.
 And then, of course, the unit mix and the lighting and all that changes.
 So this is a good example.
 We actually did two different types of backsplash tile with a custom featured backsplash tile behind the range.
 and sort of things like that.
 But we build, you know, the goal is to build, you know, first class modern housing from connectivity to finishes and the like.
 And so that is that.
 Let's see if I can understand how to put this off.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1607.608s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: ¿Podemos preguntar? No estaba seguro de que pudiéramos empezar a preguntar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1613.152s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Adelante, no estás silenciado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1615.393s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sí.
 Vale, perfecto.
 Gracias.
 Um, gracias por mostrar esto, supongo.
 Primero, te conozco.
 Bueno, primero, lo que es un corte en la acera es tan específico que le gusta el flujo, supongo, de esta propiedad.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1630.277s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, el corte de acera es un corte en las aceras, te decepcionarás, no es un gran término artístico simplemente donde una parcela privada tiene un corte en las aceras, un camino de entrada, básicamente, la capacidad de ser una gran parte de la vía pública.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1645.285s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bien, y sé que mencionaste que, ya sabes, muchas de las ideas de que las personas no necesariamente tendrían que usar sus automóviles y tal vez les gustaría el trabajo desde casa.
 También mencionaste que hay muchas personas del tipo de investigación y desarrollo que sabes que podrían mudarse aquí.
 Boston, ya sabes, es un gran centro para la industria biotecnológica, y mucha gente, ya sabes, parece estar conduciendo.
 Tienen que ir al laboratorio.
 Bien.
 Y sé que mencionaste que aún son las primeras etapas, pero supongo que la pregunta es esa pieza de tráfico correcta.
 ¿Cómo se tiene en cuenta quién podría entrar, verdad?
 No es que solo estés alquilando a personas que podrían estar trabajando desde casa.
 Y creo que hay muchas razones para creer, ya sabes, incluido yo mismo, que trabajo en la industria biotecnológica.
 La gente se va para conducir desde aquí a Cambridge y a Burlington.
 Y, ya sabes, veo un mundo en el que todavía hay un montón de personas en esta industria que tienen que estar en la oficina de sus científicos, que es una gran mayoría de la industria.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1710.315s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, es una buena pregunta.
 Hay un par allí, asegúrate de desembalar esto correctamente.
 Quiero decir, la primera es, ya sabes, estas son estimaciones, puedo decirles quiénes son nuestros mercados objetivo típicos, puedo decirles quién alquila normalmente.
 Pero, por supuesto, estamos construyendo hogares para todos.
 Intentamos adaptar nuestro producto para conocer quién está más interesado en vivir en un espacio.
 Pero tienes toda la razón.
 Quiero decir, quiero decir, el
 Los automóviles son inevitables, como se puede ver en cualquier punto de esa intersección.
 Ciertamente, algunas personas todavía conducen para ir a trabajar, ya sabes, ya sea que estés en biotecnología o en un sector más
 Tengo amigos en el Departamento de Defensa, empresas de I+D, y pueden ser las 2 de la madrugada.
 cuando se completa un determinado proceso o prueba, y todos se suben a Slack o Teams y dicen, está bien, vámonos, y todos se movilizan y se van.
 Entonces mi punto fue más bien que ciertamente no vamos a apuntar ni atender específicamente a quién alquilamos, y daríamos la bienvenida a cualquiera.
 Pero ese es el tipo de personas que normalmente vienen aquí, ya sabes, alguien, alguien podría estar más interesado en ir a nuestro activo de Hingham en la cala si está de acuerdo con conducir mucho más, ya sabes, creo que la idea aquí es que, ya sabes, no necesitas subir a tu auto para tomar un café, o ir a Walgreens o comprarán un rosbif ni nada por el estilo.
 Pero, señor, probablemente esté directamente en nuestro mercado objetivo desde un punto de vista profesional.
 Es un joven profesional, bien educado, ya sabes, para eso exactamente estamos construyendo casas en el área metropolitana de Boston.
 Kathy, te voy a pedir que me ayudes a activar y desactivar el silencio para las manos levantadas, porque ni siquiera estoy seguro de tener la autoridad para hacerlo.
 Así que confío en ti para que me ayudes en eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1843.122s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: ¿Supongo que deberíamos abordar primero el chat aquí?
 Creo que teníamos una pregunta de los vecinos de Wellington Circle.
 ¿Quieren reactivar el sonido si todavía están conectados?</p>

 Supongo que lo haremos desde la parte superior de la pantalla en orden.
 Lauren, parece que tienes la mano levantada ahí.
 Si quieres, puedo activar tu silencio y luego quiero hacer tu pregunta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1899.089s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Guardaremos el chat hasta el final para que podamos saber quién tiene la mano levantada y luego continuar desde allí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1907.962s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Sí, mi única pregunta fue muy rápida: ¿estaría dispuesto a establecer un puente peatonal a través de la intersección para que sea más transitable? Porque siento que al tener tanta gente adicional allí, podría ser beneficioso tener ese acceso a la T porque actualmente no es factible usarlo de manera muy eficiente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1933.541s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, quiero decir, seré sincero contigo, el estado permite cruzar un DC en nuestra carretera para un puente.
 Es decir, probablemente sea una operación para la que necesitaríamos un paquete sustancialmente más grande.
 Simplemente ingrese a las rampas para discapacitados y a las curvas para que cumpla con las normas. Miré una solicitud similar en Cambridge.
 para cruzar el tren de cercanías, por lo que me encantaría decir que veremos todo y lo haríamos, pero desafortunadamente tengo una buena experiencia.
 Sí, eso es probablemente algo que no podríamos incluir como parte de esto, probablemente no quedarían viviendas para después de que se construyera el puente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1980.232s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: No sabía cómo levantar la mano.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1984.054s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Adelante Linda estamos listos para ti.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=1986.19s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Soy Wellington en el consejo de administración del condominio Wellington.
 9th Street no puede soportar un automóvil más de los que ya tiene, especialmente porque el letrero se colocó en la reverenciada Beach Parkway en dirección oeste y ofrece un corte con la marca.
 Mi unidad da a la calle 9 todas las mañanas.
 3 o 4 autobuses escolares todas las tardes.
 He visto autobuses urbanos.
 Esto es una gran preocupación para nosotros.
 Lo sé porque un par de mis vecinos me han escrito.
 Las preguntas que estoy diciendo y también me preocupan.
 Cuidamos nuestro lugar lo mejor que podemos con control de plagas cada 2 meses. Tenemos estaciones de cebo que estás desenterrando a cuántos pisos de profundidad.
 para aparcar coches, este barrio podría convertirse en algo muy indeseable en mi opinión.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2053.406s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: Tampoco sé cómo levantar la mano, pero estoy ahí con Linda.
 Vivo en Parkway Plaza South.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2062.814s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Deborah, si pudiéramos comunicarnos contigo después de los que sí lo hicieron, te mantendré en la lista y te incluiré tan pronto como sepamos quiénes ya están incluidos.
 Pero tengo tu número para que puedas participar después de que revisemos a aquellos con las manos levantadas.
 Tenemos tres frente a ti y lo estoy observando.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2079.292s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Linda, esas son buenas preocupaciones que notarás en el plan conceptual, intencionalmente no incluimos un corte en la acera, de hecho eliminamos una serie de cortes en la acera entre estas parcelas y la calle novena.
 Entonces, ya sabes, sospechábamos que eso iba a ser así.
 un tema candente.
 Otras personas de la ciudad nos habían dicho que la calle 9 estaba teniendo problemas con eso.
 Creo que hay un par de cosas que hicimos a propósito y que estábamos tratando de respetar y mantener nuestros autos fuera del noveno puesto.
 Pero creo que hay algunas cosas que no hicimos a propósito y que también deberían aportar algo de ayuda.
 Los tres cortes de acera a lo largo de Revere Beach Parkway en dirección oeste,
 En este momento, podría fácilmente girar a la derecha y atravesar el estacionamiento de Monroe o atravesar los estacionamientos de Cappies y llegar a 9th Street para cortar la intersección y básicamente eliminar cualquier semáforo en la intersección para ir hacia el norte por Fellsway o Middlesex.
 Así que creo que las cosas que hicimos a propósito ciertamente no agregarán ningún dolor nuevo allí.
 Pero creo que sólo con el programa de desarrollo que estamos proponiendo, esto básicamente impedirá que todas las personas crucen esos cortes de acera hacia la Calle 9 ahora.
 Yo diría que esto debería reducir algo de eso.
 Pido disculpas por no saber dónde están Granite Street y el letrero que mencionaste, lo encontraremos.
 Pero ciertamente cualquiera que esté atravesando estos paquetes ya no podrá hacerlo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2185.727s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Creo que me han cortado.
 Todavía puedo escucharte y, oh, estoy bien, perdí la pantalla con la marca que está al final de la calle 9, que va desde Review Beach Park hasta llegar a las llaves, está bien, claro, y el condominio Wellington posee la marca desde la calle 9 hasta la fábrica de llaves más allá que ha tenido varias cosas diferentes desde que estoy aquí.
 y la ciudad posee la otra mitad.
 Bien, tengo paralelo, es paralelo al medio 6 afuera.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2221.06s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Así que no hay mucho que podamos hacer en ese lado, pero nuevamente, ciertamente se eliminaría el tráfico cortado que la gente salta en las señales de las intersecciones ahora.
 Y tampoco proponemos añadir coches esta noche.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2236.131s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: Sí, porque en realidad quiero decir que ha aumentado. Llevo aquí casi 30 años y no puedo creer cuánto ha aumentado.
 durante ese tiempo.
 Y es preocupante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2249.175s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, te puedo decir que Linda, hemos hecho algunas cosas bastante creativas en el tráfico del área.
 No sé si tengo una solución perfecta para ti. Sé que no podemos.
 Pero ciertamente sería un buen oyente y traería a los mejores especialistas para asegurarme de que nos estamos integrando con esa intersección, la nueva intersección; sin embargo, puede aterrizar en las preocupaciones de la gente de 9th Street.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2273.261s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_33]</a>: ¿Alguna vez habrá una reunión en persona como en el Ayuntamiento o en algún lugar donde podamos, ya sabes a qué me refiero?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2287.492s">[Unidentified]</a>: Bueno.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2288.593s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: La respuesta es que no estoy seguro.
 Parte de lo que estamos planeando ahora, lo que estamos haciendo ahora es estudiar.
 Esto es lo que llamamos un período de viabilidad.
 Estamos analizando todo, desde el título y las escrituras hasta las condiciones ambientales, cómo se necesitarían obtener los permisos y luego cosas como esta, hablando con los vecinos, qué es lo que no sabemos. Nuestro objetivo principal hoy es ser buenos oyentes de las personas que están alrededor de esto para que podamos proceder y entrar en un proceso público en el que habrá reuniones públicas y más formales.
 presentaciones y, sinceramente, probablemente mejores respuestas.
 Lo hacemos informados por lo que escuchamos de ustedes hoy y de los funcionarios de la ciudad, por lo que nos gusta mantener nuestra esquina con eso y no simplemente dejar caer una idea en una nueva aplicación que simplemente no habíamos examinado o aprendido todo lo que podíamos aprender.</p>

 Hola, mi nombre es Kristen y soy propietaria de Parkway Plaza West.
 Estoy a favor de este tipo de desarrollo.
 Siento que las áreas cercanas al transporte público deben tener viviendas más densas.
 Pero tengo dos preocupaciones sobre la construcción.
 Uno de ellos es lo que han dicho otras personas.
 sobre la calle 9, y Linda tenía razón, que incluso si se eliminan esos cortes en las aceras, la gente no tiende a atravesar los estacionamientos porque, francamente, son zonas de desastre, pero sí entran por Brainerd y luego por la calle 9.
 Y es una calle 9 es muy pequeña, así que una de mis primeras preguntas es: ¿su empresa o la tuvo en el pasado?
 Ha hecho algo con las comunidades en las que construye para mejorar la calle, tal vez como un gesto de buena voluntad, porque desafortunadamente Ninth Street es una vía privada.
 Así sería, y necesita mejoras, aceras, bordillos, calles.
 Creo que sería mejor si hubiera, ya sabes, tal vez una forma o.
 Entonces mi primera pregunta es, ¿tendrías alguna?
 ¿Su empresa tendría algún interés o tiene algún historial de ayudar a mejorar la calle?
 Porque incluso sin los cortes en las aceras, los residentes comenzarán a bajar por Brainerd y entrar en la 9th para evitar la intersección.
 Y luego mi segunda pregunta es sobre la mitigación de roedores, porque acabo de leer acerca de pesadillas con personas que tienen problemas con roedores cuando comienza la construcción a gran escala y
 Leí un artículo hoy sobre Somerville y Brookline que comenzaron a usar este sistema de próxima generación llamado cajas inteligentes.
 ¿Y su empresa realiza mitigación básica de roedores en sus trabajos actuales o planea invertir en técnicas de mitigación de mayor nivel?
 Uh, porque tenemos muchos propietarios de unidades en un radio muy pequeño de una cuadra, y creo que sería muy molesto si se creara un gran problema con respecto a los roedores.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2493.5s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Muy bien, hagamos el primero y el último porque creo que leí ese artículo esta mañana, en el que nunca había oído hablar de esa tecnología.
 ¿Y recuerdas cómo se llamaba?
 Fueron las cajas que recibieron.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2505.07s">[Scalise]</a>: Cajas inteligentes anti-Cymex.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2507.612s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Eso es todo.
 Sí, nunca había oído hablar de eso.
 Estoy fascinado.
 De hecho, ya lo busqué en Google esta mañana.
 Entonces, la primera es una especie de tres etapas en la cuestión de los roedores.
 La primera es que durante la construcción, la ley nos exige que hagamos esfuerzos bastante descomunales.
 Y puedo decirles que son tremendamente efectivos.
 De hecho, por ley tenemos que contratar a un especialista en roedores.
 Y esa persona tiene que ser parte de nuestro equipo durante toda la construcción.
 Sé que eso no es todo, pero es el primer paso.
 No sé si esta tecnología es viable o si la utilizan las empresas de control de plagas con las que colaboraríamos.
 Ciertamente estoy dispuesto a pedirles que lo hagan porque parece una tecnología bastante buena.
 La segunda cosa es, ya sabes,
 Construimos casas y tratamos de decirles a todos que construimos casas realmente bonitas.
 Así que lo último que quiero son infestaciones de ratas en mi comunidad o sus alrededores.
 Así que necesito aprender un poco más aquí, y Matt y Greg, al teléfono, se convertirán en especialistas en roedores del área, suponiendo que podamos continuar aquí.
 Y eso es algo por lo que, sinceramente, no me atribuiría ningún mérito.
 Sería un esfuerzo egoísta, porque nosotros tampoco lo querríamos.
 Entonces, y tenemos el control de plagas en nuestros presupuestos operativos, que tienen 150 líneas de largo como se pueden imaginar, ese es uno de los elementos allí, es algo que haremos después de la construcción y de manera continua.
 Entonces sí, eso es.
 Esa es la primera pieza.
 El segundo es sobre las mejoras de la calle novena y lo que hemos hecho en otros lugares.
 La respuesta corta a ambas es sí, casi siempre, sabemos que nuevamente algo de esto es egoísta, así que no voy a atribuirme demasiado crédito por ello, pero queremos tener un vecindario agradable y no construyo en sitios Greenfield.
 Todos los sitios en los que construimos son viejos edificios industriales o viejos edificios de oficinas decrépitos, y sin desprestigiar a Cappy's, sus excelentes instalaciones, y he comprado allí.
 Pero nuestro objetivo no es ir y perturbar algún sitio nuevo.
 Es para mejorar una parcela heredada con mejoras inmobiliarias heredadas.
 Entonces que la calle 9 sea más atractiva nos beneficia.
 Eso es absolutamente algo de lo que queremos hablar con usted.
 Ya tenemos planes para nuestro lado de la Calle 9.
 Ya sabes cómo son las aceras y cómo esos cortes en el asfalto se integran terriblemente.
 Y usted sabe que vamos a tener algunas plataformas nuevas asociadas, suponiendo que, por supuesto, procedamos a mejorar y reconstruir esas zonas de amortiguamiento fronterizas de Parkway, por lo que sabe que también tendrán que integrarse con eso.
 Entonces, la respuesta corta es absolutamente, queremos hablar con usted sobre lo que podemos hacer para mejorar la calle 9.
 Siento que tienes una tercera pregunta. Me estoy olvidando de algo y me pierdo algo.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2696.694s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Y creo que tú eres el siguiente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2700.316s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_30]</a>: Muchas gracias por tu tiempo.
 Dijiste que eres local, así que estás seguro de que sabes que Kathy's se llena increíblemente durante el Día de Acción de Gracias y Navidad.
 ¿Ha habido alguna conversación sobre el uso de datos de las ventas de Cappy o de la policía estatal o local, porque siempre tienen personas estacionadas en las entradas solo para ver la afluencia de automóviles en esa área para ayudarlo a determinar qué tipo de conmoción de tráfico causará un edificio de ese tamaño?
 Porque Cappy probablemente tenga el tamaño de
 Quiero decir que comprador es equivalente a tal vez el residente que estará en ese edificio y que conducirá. Esas dos cosas podrían servir como datos en términos de cuántas personas, cuántos autos más entrarían y saldrían y qué tipo de conmoción causarían, especialmente durante
 tiempos de mucho tráfico.
 Y con eso, ¿hay alguna conversación para intentar recopilar algunos datos la próxima semana?
 Debido a que es Acción de Gracias, lo que significa que esta intersección y Cappy's está abierta y la gente se está reuniendo nuevamente, va a estar increíblemente ocupado.
 Tal vez esos datos podrían servir como algo para determinar qué tipo de flujo de tráfico o problemas causaría una construcción de ese tamaño.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=2785.256s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Claro, un par y solo para asegurarme de que entiendo la pregunta.
 Retroceda con un poco de franqueza, estamos un poco temprano en el proceso de contratar a un consultor de tráfico; normalmente comenzaría a gastar esos dólares una vez que sepa que nos sentimos lo suficientemente cómodos asumiendo los riesgos que tenemos que asumir para continuar.
 Voy a hacer una llamada.
 Pero pero te diré que
 Lo llaman ITE.
 Cuando contratamos a estos profesionales, no les gusta utilizar datos anecdóticos.
 Así que voy a hacer una llamada telefónica y ver si hay alguna manera de incorporar eso porque en nuestro marco de tiempo, ya sabes, de manera realista, no lo haríamos, suponiendo que procedamos, esto sería a principios del próximo año, ya sabes, tenemos muchas casillas que marcar antes del nuevo año para ver si vamos a continuar con esto.
 Desafortunadamente, eso significaría que cuando hagamos esos estudios formales, que toman meses, ya habríamos pasado el Día de Acción de Gracias.
 Entonces, lo que supongo que voy a preguntar es: ¿cómo lo tienen en cuenta o lo adaptan?
 Porque si ese es un momento de impacto único para ustedes, y tiene mucho sentido que lo sea, supongo que probablemente sean similares alrededor de Navidad.
 Sí.
 Ya sabes cómo incorporan eso.
 Entonces, desafortunadamente, la respuesta corta es que probablemente no obtenga tráfico real.
 Entonces, lo que sucedería es que cuando comencemos esto saldría al campo y colocarían esas pequeñas cuerdas de goma que se ven al otro lado de la carretera. A veces, en realidad hacen conteos físicos y tienen un
 Tengo algunos analistas que están trabajando en el equipo y también están verificando que funcione muy bien, así que conocemos ese proceso con franqueza. Dudo que pueda movilizar a alguien para la próxima semana.
 Incluso si fuera a correr un poco más de riesgo con dólares como ese.
 Pero encontraré la respuesta sobre cómo explican eso, porque si hay un par de días realmente difíciles en el año.
 Aprenderemos cómo hacerlo.
 Diré que, como dije, no hemos contratado a algunos de los especialistas que serán necesarios para realizar el trabajo apropiado para una aplicación.
 Pero contratamos sementales reales.
 No nos metemos con grupos secundarios.
 Así que estos son verdaderos científicos, y en realidad son cuantitativos.
 Son personas orientadas al cálculo.
 Así que no vamos a escatimar esfuerzos allí.
 Y creo que parte de eso es la buena noticia: nuestro uso generará menos tráfico que otros usos que alguien podría crear aquí hoy.
 Si nos fijamos en la zonificación correcta, no tengo los números precisos frente a mí, pero alguien podría entrar aquí con un edificio de laboratorio de cuatro pisos acercándose a los 300.000 pies, y no habría un proceso de audiencia pública.
 Simplemente dejarían los planos en el escritorio del inspector de construcción y esperarían a que transcurrieran 30 días.
 Entonces, en comparación con algunos de los usos alternativos aquí, somos bastante suaves.
 No sé cómo nos relacionamos con lo que hace Cappy.
 Sospecho que probablemente sea un poco más.
 Pero sí, podría decirles que este tipo de uso en esta parcela es uno de los usos reductores si se tratara de oficinas minoristas o de laboratorios de espacios de empleo, ese tipo de cosas, esos espacios suelen ser cuatro o cinco automóviles por cada 1000 pies y vamos a ser aproximadamente un automóvil por 1000 pies, así que no lo voy a decir.
 No te voy a decir que nunca habrá un auto aquí con el que estés enojado o que te interrumpa o algo que probablemente vaya a suceder.
 Pero solo desde el punto de vista del volumen.
 Especialmente en esos días festivos será un poco menos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3004.034s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Solo en términos de mantenerlo honesto.
 Habría una audiencia pública, una revisión del plano del sitio y cualquier cosa de esa naturaleza, pero si tiene razón, es un uso correcto y sería simplemente una revisión del sitio.
 Copia también aunque creo que eres el siguiente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3018.156s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Creo que puedes y te agradezco la presentación para realizarlo y si entendí tienes razón.
 Los primeros 3 pisos serán estacionamiento y luego los siguientes 4 pisos serán los espacios habitables correctos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3031.4s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Los próximos 5.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3033.241s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Los próximos 5 serán espacios habitables y serán 250 unidades.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3037.502s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, creo que en este momento son 265, todavía están en, ya sabes, obviamente no hemos diseñado esto todavía, no está tan alto, aproximadamente sí, ya sabes, y cuántos bolsillos totales es posible que haya.
 Creo que estamos proponiendo poco más de un espacio por unidad.
 Estábamos analizando algunos de los otros elementos de zonificación en el área, y parece que la ciudad permite entre 0,85 o más espacios por unidad.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3061.287s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Entonces pensamos que era... Creo que nuestra zonificación va de 0,75 a 1,5.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3065.248s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, pensamos que sería apropiado un poco más de eso, aunque estamos de acuerdo en que esta es una zona de tránsito.
 Entonces, aproximadamente un espacio por unidad es la respuesta.
 Micah, ¿cuántas unidades asequibles habrá aquí?
 Proponemos seguir las reglas y regulaciones de vivienda inclusiva de Bedford, así que creo que el 15%.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3084.169s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: ¿Y tiene un rango de precios de lo que cree que costarán estas unidades?
 No.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3091.353s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Solo diría eso, ya sabes, solo te diría eso.
 No puedo decirte cuál será porque fueron años de trabajo.
 Pero sería coincidente con lo que se ve al otro lado de la calle y algunas de estas otras comunidades más nuevas dentro de una milla de nosotros, que creemos que competirían bastante bien con ellas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3109.89s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Lo sabes, lo sabes, escucho a personas comerciales que buscan venir para hacerlo.
 Una de las preocupaciones es si tenemos suficientes viviendas para sustentarnos.
 El potencial de crecimiento laboral en la ciudad de las personas a las que quiero mudarme.
 Y la pregunta, y la respuesta por el momento, es que no, no lo hacemos.
 Entonces creo que Kristen dejó claro ese punto.
 Pero el lado negativo es que estás construyendo un edificio probablemente en el tramo de carretera más transitado, probablemente en las esquinas más transitadas de la ciudad de Medford.
 Y un genio de DCI decidió que era una buena idea poner un corte en la parte trasera de todas estas unidades.
 Lo cual fue un gran error del día. No sé quién pensó en eso, pero lo único que están haciendo es dirigir el tráfico y la parte trasera de todos estos apartamentos y condominios, lo cual digo, simplemente no puedo ver adónde llegaron estos con el estado.
 Pero fue una buena idea, así que en este estado no es culpa tuya.
 Ya sabes el lado positivo.
 Ya sabes, sacar a los cappies del área y el silenciador Monroe obviamente reducirá una gran cantidad de tráfico.
 Este es un gato que sabes que los taxistas trabajan los 7 días de la semana.
 Usted sabe de 9 a 11 a 11 en punto en un negocio y, como mucha gente dijo, sabe que llega el horario festivo los fines de semana.
 No puedes atrapar a los cappies, no tanto.
 Es una buena parte que harás que sacarás a esos niños de allí.
 Detendrás parte del tráfico, pero hasta que el estado decida admitir que cometieron un error en el desvío de la Calle 9, no sé qué van a hacer estos vecinos en ese sentido.
 Espero que consideres la mitigación, ya sabes, tal vez ayudarlos con, ya sabes, pavimentar la calle.
 Quiero decir, sé que eso no está a tu alcance, pero es un buen gesto de tu parte.
 Mi siguiente pregunta es: ahora bloquearás parte de la vista de algunas de estas otras personas, sobre las cuales he escuchado preocupaciones.
 ¿Cómo abordamos eso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3254.415s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: No tengo una gran respuesta para ti sobre la vista.
 Es simplemente una función de cuando tienes una zona con edificios como este, ya sabes.
 Entonces, ya sabes, algunas personas no tendrán una vista tan buena, ya sabes, supongo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3268.188s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Bueno, no y no en tu propiedad, pero ya sabes, como dije, es un área muy concurrida.
 Y ahora ya sabes,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3276.015s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Es una pregunta justa.
 Es una pregunta justa.
 Quiero decir, creo que, desde el punto de vista de algunas personas, con franqueza, mi objetivo es construir un edificio lo suficientemente atractivo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3283.804s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: El edificio está bien.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3285.786s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mi punto es que mirar la parte trasera de Cappy no es muy bueno.
 Con suerte, mejoraremos algunas vistas y nos aseguraremos de bloquear.
 Estoy seguro de que hay algunas personas que probablemente tengan una opinión.
 Nos conoces en el suroeste y puedes ver la reserva mística del río y aún no los he visto, pero sospecho que hay, espero que nuestra vista sea al menos mejor que la de los cappies en Monroe, pero sabes que habrá algunas compensaciones allí, seguro. No tengo una respuesta perfecta para eso.
 ¿Es la copa? ¿Es lo que digo? Dicen esto correctamente: todos con curvas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3316.688s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Sí, es el corte que atraviesa la actual Calle 9 o es esa vía de servicio que viene y que todos sabemos, es de lo que hablan, así que vienes por la Ruta 16 tan pronto como cruzas el puente.
 Es lo que la gente necesita en el cerebro.
 Bien, que es como lo que dijo el residente de que realmente es una vía privada y las ventas son privadas de la ciudad y yo digo que cuando pusieron eso no pude, no puedo creer que a alguien le pagaran por hacer eso, eso es la estupidez de quitar el tráfico de la Ruta 16, una de las carreteras más transitadas de la zona.
 y sigue detrás de estos y de este barrio.
 Y nuevamente, no es culpa suya ni nadie en la caída, eso es estrictamente culpa del DCR.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3359.618s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Bueno, diré esto: es posible que no podamos solucionar todos esos problemas, pero lo hemos hecho, nuestros especialistas son bastante buenos.
 Entonces tal vez podamos hacer algo que sea al menos positivo.
 Quiero decir, en Westwood he trabajado mucho para calmar el tráfico y cosas muy sutiles, chicanes y rotondas.
 Algunas personas odian todas estas palabras y estas técnicas, pero a veces hay algunas efectivas que podemos, digamos, educadamente, disuadir gentilmente de cortar el tráfico.
 Tenemos herramientas allí y desplegaremos nuestros equipos para gestionarlo lo mejor que podamos y lo que podamos hacer.
 La calle 9 es privada, lo cual es bueno y malo.
 Creo que técnicamente este paquete o estos paquetes pertenecerían a la mitad de la línea media.
 Entonces, hay un poco de gestión de derechos privados, necesitaríamos trabajar con los vecinos y asegurarnos de que todos estén de acuerdo, pase lo que pase en ese camino, lo que todos quieran que suceda.
 Entonces hay un buen proceso democrático en eso.
 Pero podría haber soluciones con eso.
 Sinceramente, el arquitecto que utilizamos para ayudar a crear la mayoría de estas imágenes forma parte del comité directivo para la reconstrucción de esta intersección por parte del MassDOT.
 Así que hay una gran simetría en la que si tenemos la capacidad de aprovechar algo de eso y algunos de los comentarios que recibiremos y las inquietudes que examinaremos con esto, podremos ser capaces de
 Tal vez no lo arregles, pero sí lo impactes positivamente más de lo que crees.
 Y pondríamos a nuestros equipos a trabajar en eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3445.637s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Mike, ¿se consideraría la posibilidad de poner algún tipo de transporte a la estación de tren durante las horas pico de trabajo, tal vez de 7 a 10, de 4 a 6, algo así?
 O tal vez conectarse con
 Porque hemos hablado de algún desarrollo en el futuro.
 Les preguntamos sobre la posibilidad de hacer un servicio de transporte combinado para llevar a la gente a la estación de tren y regresar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3473.179s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sin duda lo miraríamos.
 Sinceramente, creo que si durante la hora punta el autobús de enlace saliera de nuestro sitio para ir a Wellington.
 Está a unos seis minutos a pie desde nuestro sitio y ya no soy un caballero muy rápido ni veloz.
 Entonces, ya sabes, puedes llegar a ese puente aéreo bastante rápido, sin contar el cruce de peatones en la intersección de allí.
 Entonces, pero lo veremos.
 No diría que no, pero sospecho de una de las cosas.
 Pido disculpas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3501.709s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Sólo quiero intervenir por un segundo.
 No es una caminata de seis minutos.
 Son como 15 minutos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3506.753s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Y Mike, te lo estás quitando de las manos al cruzar la Ruta 16.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3511.616s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, no le diría que no a estas alturas, señor Carmelo.
 Creo que tendremos que mirarlo.
 Si hay una TMA en el área, muchas veces se nos ha pedido que nos unamos a la TMA y contribuyamos a ello.
 Así que ciertamente los observaremos al respecto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3523.705s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Pero en cuanto a, ya sabes, dices que probablemente estás construyendo en la esquina más concurrida de la ciudad de Medford.
 Entonces dicen, ya sabes, lo positivo es que estás quitando una cantidad decente de tráfico con cappies y Monroe, especialmente cappies, que opera las 24 horas.
 Y creo que los residentes verán algo, tal vez algo de alivio y tráfico con esto en comparación con lo que hay ahora.
 Entonces,
 Te agradezco tu presentación.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3561.56s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Kathy, creo que estás en silencio.
 Me silencié.
 Debra Carante, tenías una pregunta antes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3568.025s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: Sí.
 Básicamente me estoy aprovechando de otros comentarios aquí.
 La principal preocupación es que vivo aquí en el condominio Parkway Plaza South, que da a la Ruta 16.
 Está muy congestionado aquí.
 Intentar salir de la Ruta 9th Street ahora mismo es muy difícil.
 Si intentas salir a la avenida, el tráfico en la Ruta 16 y Wellington Circle es realmente malo.
 Y me temo que la construcción de un gran complejo como este, en mi opinión, provocará una congestión de tráfico increíble.
 Esa era mi principal preocupación.
 Además, creo que fue Linda quien abordó el tema de los roedores, del que ya habló.
 Pero creo que va a haber un desastre esperando a ocurrir con la excavación y la construcción.
 Y finalmente, ¿este nuevo complejo afectará el valor de nuestra propiedad?
 Quiero decir, no creo que la gente quiera vivir en una zona tan poblada y congestionada.
 Y como acaba de decir Rick, esta zona es la más congestionada de Medford.
 Quiero decir, ¿esto va a disminuir el valor de nuestra propiedad?
 Porque todos somos dueños de condominios aquí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3646.851s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mike, no soy un especialista en tasación de bienes raíces.
 Pero sospecho que está detrás del uso de un automóvil en la parte trasera de una licorería, una vez más, sin descrédito para la excelente institución de Cappy.
 Este es un vecino mucho mejor para ustedes.
 Entonces hay estudios en el MIT.
 eso se hizo, ya sabes, hace 15 años, creo, y estuvieron muy involucrados, y eran dos resmas de papel grueso, y desafortunadamente lo leí.
 Y descubrieron que las comunidades de ingresos mixtos aumentaban casi unilateralmente los valores de sus vecinos.
 Así que solo diré que no soy tasador, pero tengo que imaginarme que tener un vecino agradable de primera clase como este, a diferencia de los usos allí, te ayudará, o ciertamente no dañará tus valores.
 Donde ustedes me están asustando con las ratas poniéndose un poco nerviosas.
 Vamos a analizar esa promesa bastante difícil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3704.461s">[Maria D'Orsi]</a>: Gracias.
 Creo que tenías uno contigo mismo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3716.871s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Es una unidad nueva.
 Bien, ustedes pueden empezar.
 Bien, si en este punto, ¿hay alguna otra mano levantada?
 No creo que veamos ninguno.
 Creo que en este punto probablemente podamos pasar por el chat.
 Muchas de las preguntas son las mismas, pero podemos repasarlas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3738.621s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Entonces, Kathy, es posible que necesite que me eduques sobre cómo abrir el chat aquí para revisarlo.
 Los veo aparecer.
 Bueno.
 Tenemos una pregunta difícil ahí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3749.926s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Si quieres, podemos simplemente
 hacerle la pregunta verbalmente.
 Hola Mike, gracias por la presentación.
 Estamos aquí en Parkway Plaza West.
 Somos un vecino más.
 Qué bueno conocerte.
 Gracias por organizar esto.
 Entonces tuvimos un par de preguntas rápidas.
 Uno, ¿cuánto tiempo crees que llevará una construcción como ésta?
 Y sé que esto es muy temprano, mencionaste, pero ¿cuándo crees que podría comenzar?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3785.098s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí.
 Entonces, la construcción de un proyecto como este probablemente dure 2024 meses.
 Yo diría que la mayoría de eso.
 El edificio ya está enmarcado y construido y nuestros muchachos estarían ocupados adentro.
 Entonces, pero sí, yo diría que son dos desde la inauguración y la demolición; de todos modos, serían dos años aproximadamente en el mercado actual.
 Y en cuanto a cuándo comenzaría la construcción, no me atrevería a decirle a la ciudad cuánto tiempo necesitarían para sus procesos de aprobación, pero normalmente un año o más para los permisos, y luego otros seis a nueve meses para el diseño y la ingeniería.
 Así que ésta es una gran salida, suponiendo que seamos capaces de proceder.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3836.325s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Gracias.
 ¿Y qué pasa con las molestias a los edificios cercanos?
 como nosotros, durante su construcción o, ya sabe, cuando termine la construcción.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3849.11s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Seguro.
 Comenzamos, haremos, haremos, ya sabes, pruebas en todos los edificios que nos rodean y nos aseguraremos de que todos estén, ya sabes, estructuralmente sanos e intactos antes de hacer algo.
 Y ciertamente es un trabajo pesado.
 Pero hoy en día, todos estos edificios se construyen mediante una grúa central.
 Y así, en general, todo se construye de adentro hacia afuera.
 Y entonces
 En cuanto a los impactos en los edificios que nos rodean, es algo en lo que trabajamos en muchas zonas urbanas en sitios muy reducidos como este y, a menudo, junto a usos residenciales.
 Entonces, la idea sería que pusiéramos una valla alta y bonita con una malla opaca, y no tendrías que ver mucho de lo que estamos haciendo detrás de escena.
 Afortunadamente, este tipo de construcción no es un proceso de construcción terriblemente ruidoso.
 Ciertamente trabajaríamos con la ciudad y gente como usted en audiencias públicas para hablar sobre cuáles son los horarios de trabajo apropiados y, ya sabes, ese tipo de cosas.
 No estamos siendo una molestia.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3917.32s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Gracias.
 Y definitivamente apreciamos la oportunidad de conversar porque ha sido muy útil.
 Y una última pregunta rápida es que, más de 260 unidades en cinco pisos, solo por curiosidad, ¿cuál es el tamaño promedio de las unidades?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=3931.2s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Alrededor de 920 spitball está bien.
 945 sí.
 Así que pensamos que la unidad se mezcla conceptualmente aquí, y así es como llegamos de esos grandes cuadros naranjas a lo que significa aproximadamente unidad.
 Creemos que la pieza importante aquí es programar una gama de productos.
 Medford es muy diversa en múltiples frentes, en niveles de ingresos, en educación, en tipos de empleo y en estilos de transporte.
 Por eso creemos que hay una pequeña cantidad de unidades que son adecuadas para estudios y camas junior.
 Estos tienden a ser nuestros inquilinos más principiantes que aún no están casados ​​con una chica o un chico y están en camino a su segunda parada en su carrera.
 Y luego este es un mercado de un dormitorio muy fuerte.
 Parece que estés soltero y más avanzado en tu carrera o quizás un poco menos avanzado, todavía estás en tu primer o segundo trabajo profesional, pero estás casado y tienes novia o novio.
 y te gustan esos.
 Entonces, en nuestros estudios recientes, pensamos que ciertamente hay espacio para dos dormitorios y tipos de unidades más grandes, pero a medida que continuamos estudiando un poco menos de lo que pensábamos.
 Así que gracias.
 Sabes, tenemos que seguir intentando encontrar cuál es la combinación de mercado adecuada aquí para servir a Medford.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4018.142s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Gracias.
 Y quería transmitir aquí una pregunta del presidente de nuestra junta directiva.
 Ella quería que le preguntara,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4024.407s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sí, quería saber si puede decir que revisaría estructuralmente los edificios antes de que comenzara la construcción.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4030.666s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: ¿Puedes oír eso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4032.069s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, todavía no hemos llegado tan lejos en el estudio, en el proceso de estudio.
 Sabes, no creo que necesitemos, ya sabes, por ejemplo, no estamos conduciendo, no creo que vayamos a necesitar clavar pilotes ni nada por el estilo.
 Pero, por lo general, si hay algún proceso importante de alteración del sitio, si estamos cavando un hoyo o colocando pilotes, o si hacemos análisis sísmicos en todas nuestras áreas, hay empresas que se especializan en esto que incorporamos.
 Y especialmente cuando estás cerca de otro edificio,
 Estamos a unos 12 pies de algunos vecinos en un proyecto en Waltham en el que estamos trabajando.
 Entonces, ya sabes, utilizamos monitores sísmicos y todo tipo de material de alta tecnología excelente para asegurarnos de no hacer nada malo con nuestros vecinos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4078.827s">[MCM00001814_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Gracias.
 Y alguien más quería confirmar que todo sería unidades y no habría zonificación para negocios.
 Tiendas minoristas como Starbucks o, ya sabes, etcétera.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4089.758s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, tenemos una buena pregunta.
 Sabes, estábamos mirando al otro lado de la calle en el rellano de la estación y pensamos que podría ser algo que considerar para agregar uso comercial en el primer piso.
 Pero ya sabes, las preocupaciones sobre el tráfico planteadas esta noche eran algo que sinceramente esperábamos.
 Personalmente he visto algunas de las reuniones con MassDOT y cómo están reprogramando esa intersección.
 Y ya sabes, el tráfico adicional afecta la necesidad de
 Pensamos que las cosas que implicaron el impacto adicional del tráfico y el tiempo que el comercio minorista traería aquí serían tan negativas que podrían presentarnos negativamente todo el proyecto.
 Y la otra pieza con la que estamos luchando nos la preguntan mucho.
 Ya sabes, si hay un buen lugar para el comercio minorista, simplemente diría que el comercio minorista que querría estar en esta zona se parece más al que hay al otro lado de la calle en el rellano de la estación.
 Y como por ejemplo ahora, no se puede alquilar un espacio a Starbucks si no es un servicio de autoservicio.
 Y hay muchos minoristas, incluso otras cafeterías, que también van por ese camino.
 Y una especie de cafetería, o cafetería, parecía el uso correcto que se le daría aquí.
 Y cuando tuvimos en cuenta todo eso, los impactos en el tráfico, decidimos eliminar esa parte de nuestro concepto.
 Así que vale la pena discutirlo más, pero, sinceramente, creo que sería peor para el vecindario y para el sitio desde el punto de vista del tráfico y el impacto.
 Y lo último es si no lo haces perfecto y ese comercio no alquila.
 Incluso si lo sabe, incluso si menos, decidimos comercializarlo muy por debajo del mercado.
 Un espacio vacío y arruinado es, desde el punto de vista de la planificación urbana, un problema real que trae todo tipo de resultados negativos, así que me alegra que hayas preguntado que dedicamos mucho tiempo a estudiarlo y hablar sobre ello y que es por eso que llegamos solo a la vivienda y los usos asociados.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4209.242s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Hola, mi nombre es Jean.
 Solo tengo otra pregunta.
 Dijiste que proporcionarías estacionamiento para un automóvil por unidad.
 Ahora, muchas unidades o la mayoría de las unidades tienen dos autos, por lo que no hay lugar en el área para estacionar.
 ¿Qué harías al respecto?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4227.406s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Las 2 cosas.
 Una es que me gustaría no estar de acuerdo contigo.
 La mayoría de nuestros residentes no utilizan automóviles en sus hogares, ni siquiera en nuestro activo, que eran unidades mucho más grandes y un grupo demográfico más anciano y menos profesional.
 No llegamos a un promedio de 2 autos por unidad.
 Pero aunque me equivoque les diré esto, pongo mi dinero en lo que dice mi boca, donde hemos hecho este y otros proyectos.
 ciertamente estamos
 Estamos preocupados por las personas que podrían estacionarse fuera del sitio en las calles del área de impacto, y particularmente en la Calle 9 en este caso.
 Y podemos tener una cláusula simple y hacer que sea ilegal que nuestros residentes estacionen fuera del sitio y obligarlos contractualmente a hacerlo.
 Y ya lo he hecho antes.
 Es algo fácil de hacer.
 Si es algo que el vecindario o la ciudad considera importante, podemos restringirlo con algo así de duro.
 No, no creo que vaya a ser así, creo que una O es un poco cómoda.
 Creo que nuestros competidores están bien con bajar a 0,75 o un automóvil por unidad o 0,85 automóviles por unidad.
 Sinceramente, creo que la zonificación de Medford es bastante progresista en ese sentido.
 No pueden, obviamente han hecho algunos estudios porque hacemos mucho de eso, ese análisis y no puede ser una coincidencia.
 Ellos saben exactamente lo que hace este cliente.
 Entonces, eh, eh,
 Me han presionado para que estacione menos en ciudades como Cambridge.
 Me han empujado a ir más a otros lugares.
 Tenemos muchos estudios sobre esto.
 Sabemos lo que necesitamos desde el punto de vista empresarial.
 Si no tenemos suficiente estacionamiento para nuestros clientes, no alquilarán con nosotros.
 Así que lo último que quiero hacer es limitar innecesariamente el estacionamiento si eso va a perjudicar nuestro negocio.
 Pero si no tienes que creer en mi palabra, pondré mi dinero en lo que digo y lo restringiremos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4346.218s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Lo siento, sólo tengo una última pregunta.
 Este es Jean.
 La entrada al garaje y la entrada al edificio está en Middlesex Avenue, no en Ninth Street.
 ¿Es eso correcto?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4358.503s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: En este concepto, eso es correcto.
 Teníamos el presentimiento de que ustedes no querrían que pusiéramos autos nuevos en la Calle Novena.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4363.785s">[Unidentified]</a>: Gracias.
 Concejal Caraviello.
 Gracias, Cathy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4374.114s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Puedo tener una o dos cosas para usted sobre si se habla de comprar esa pequeña unidad de esquina tan poderosa que solo para cuadrarla de esta manera nuestra propiedad tiene que hacer que se vea un poco más uniforme.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4387.761s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Concejal ¿cómo me aconsejaría que respondiera a esta pregunta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4392.414s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: No sé.
 Quiero decir, obviamente mejoraría su propiedad y la haría lucir mucho mejor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4402.718s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Porque lo tienes todo, ya sabes, diré, diré esto, me casé con una urbanista y ella es dura.
 Y esto ha sido objeto de cierta discusión.
 No lo extraño.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4413.563s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: No quiero dejar la propiedad.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4416.425s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: La respuesta corta es que le he disparado un par de veces sin éxito.
 No, solo tenía curiosidad.
 Preferiría tenerlo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4423.15s">[Richard Caraviello]</a>: Pero está bien.
 Y usted mencionó lo del estacionamiento.
 Si va a Rivers Edge, Moderna o a los apartamentos Rivers Edge, Moderna, su estacionamiento no está lleno.
 Y tampoco lo son las unidades de Rivers Edge con automóviles.
 Creo que el día del estacionamiento para dos autos es, quiero decir, los dos autos están afuera.
 Es posible que haya algunas personas con dos autos, pero básicamente son los más jóvenes, todos los Ubers alrededor, y algunos de ellos ya ni siquiera tienen autos.
 Consulte con Moderna y consulte con Rivers Edge, los nuevos edificios de apartamentos de allí.
 Te dirán que ambos tienen estacionamiento, tienen mucho espacio para estacionar allí.
 Simplemente ya no hay suficientes personas que posean automóviles.
 Gracias por eso vamos a hacer eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4469.202s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Y luego una última pregunta, Mary Harris, y luego iremos a la basura del avión.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4475.105s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Sí, le agradezco mi pregunta sobre el estacionamiento o los automóviles, que son muy válidas y me preocupa que mis preguntas sean un poco diferentes.
 Así que extraño el comienzo de tu de
 Tu presentación, Mike, y no escuché exactamente cuántas historias planeas construir.
 Y mi pregunta es, ¿qué pasa con las sombras que afectarían, digamos, a nuestra piscina?
 Ya sabes, en el verano, cuando estamos sentados tratando de divertirnos un poco, ¿cómo afectaría eso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4511.768s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, la primera es que proponemos una suscripción de ocho pisos y analizamos una comunidad de ocho pisos aquí.
 Muy similar a las cosas que hay en el vecindario en el lado norte y sur de la ruta 16, ciertamente no sentimos que fuera apropiado ir más alto.
 Y luego, desde un punto de vista de los estudios paralelos, quiero decir, francamente, todavía no hemos llegado a ese punto.
 No es una parte inusual del proceso de obtención de permisos.
 Sospecho que estaríamos haciendo eso aquí.
 Así que me disculpo.
 No sé exactamente dónde está tu piscina, pero eso es algo que podemos estudiar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4546.449s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Está frente a la calle novena.
 Está justo detrás de Kathy.
 Cuando no estoy allí, puedo ver la azotea de Kathy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4554.171s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Bueno.
 Sí.
 Quiero decir, la respuesta corta es algo que sin duda estudiaríamos y analizaríamos.
 Y le pido disculpas, no tengo una respuesta buena y precisa para usted que sería parte del proceso de obtención de permisos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4566.864s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: A medida que avanzas.
 Gracias.
 Creo que la mayor parte de lo que tenemos en el chat ha sido respondido, pero repasemos una pregunta que se hizo fue por qué alquileres en lugar de condominios.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4587.23s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Hay un par de buenas respuestas, pero la breve es que Alliance Residential simplemente no construye condominios.
 Somos una empresa privada.
 Eso es algo que nos diferencia de algunos de nuestros competidores.
 Ya sabes, no somos un tipo de grupo respaldado por un banco de inversión.
 Construimos muchas casas cada año, algunos años más que todos los demás, pero en realidad somos cuatro socios principales.
 Somos de propiedad totalmente privada.
 Y eso es algo por lo que nuestros muchachos en Phoenix, donde tenemos nuestra sede, han luchado bastante para mantener a raya a los inversores.
 Entonces, existe una responsabilidad posterior con la construcción de condominios que es algo que simplemente decidieron que no quieren hacer.
 Y entonces es algo estructural y programático, simplemente no lo hacemos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4638.742s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Creo que respondimos las preguntas y tuvimos una discusión sobre la calle 9 y también el número de dormitorios, 1, 2 y 3. Creo que hiciste lo correcto, Mike.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4650.185s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Creo que sí en concepto, ya sabes, una vez más, todavía estamos en algún tipo de cambio, por lo que seguimos diciendo sobre nuestros tipos de unidades, pero ya sabes, este es un mercado interesante y cambiante.
 Así que esa combinación ha ido cambiando, pero lo que pensamos es principalmente una comunidad de una y dos habitaciones.
 Y seguramente también habrá algunas unidades más grandes y más pequeñas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4670.697s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Y luego surge la pregunta de qué pasa con la infraestructura.
 Bueno, nuestra presión de agua bajó con el nuevo edificio.
 Sabes, alguien puede responder que todo lo que se hace tiene que pasar por el departamento de ingeniería y ser examinado.
 a través de ingeniería para garantizar que la infraestructura pueda soportar el edificio agregado.
 No sé si quieres agregar algo a eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4693.424s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Podría añadir un poquito.
 Puedo decirles que la respuesta es casi seguro que no.
 Ya hemos probado el agua como parte.
 Probamos para ver si todas las utilidades que necesitamos están disponibles.
 ciertamente todas las telecomunicaciones y comunicaciones.
 Allí hay mucha agua y buena presión.
 Además, nuestro edificio, al ser un edificio alto, probablemente como el suyo, necesitaría sus propias bombas.
 Si éste fuera un edificio de cinco pisos o menos, no lo sería.
 Este edificio es una propuesta bastante sólida si somos capaces de presentarla.
 No creo que tengas ningún impacto como ese.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4731.129s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Una de las otras preguntas es: ¿habrá mano de obra sindicalizada o no sindicalizada?
 Sé que también es una etapa temprana del proyecto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4739.397s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, solo diré que normalmente es una gran mezcla.
 Eso depende.
 Los camioneros y los chicos del hormigón casi siempre son ascensores y tejados sindicales.
 Y luego algunas operaciones, pero ofrecemos ofertas competitivas en todo.
 Pero la respuesta muy, muy breve es que todavía no lo sabemos.
 Tenemos mucho trabajo que hacer antes de llegar allí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4759.341s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: ¿Pregunta si agregará áreas comunes para los residentes existentes, bancos, árboles de sombra, alguna de esas cosas que estarán disponibles para los residentes existentes?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4771.045s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí.
 Quiero decir, creo que eso es parte del espíritu de lo que estábamos hablando al principio, que es lo que pensamos en devolver algo de ese asfalto en el lado oeste y en el lado sur que originalmente estaban destinados a ser una conexión de la avenida con Mystic.
 reserva en Fellsway.
 Ciertamente, quiero decir, creo que técnicamente será propiedad privada, pero ya sabes, estará conectado a todas las aceras y cruces peatonales del área y todo eso.
 Entonces la respuesta corta es sí.
 En esas áreas, creemos que hay muchas mejoras que podemos aportar en esos espacios.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4805.474s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Y creo que la mayoría de las otras preguntas de verificación fueron respondidas con la excepción de una pregunta sobre enviar por correo electrónico el video de la reunión y ciertamente mi correo electrónico está en la carta que se envió y puedo intentar hacerlo. Sé que tuve algunas dificultades con la última reunión debido al tamaño.
 de hacer llegar eso a la gente, pero generalmente se publica en el sitio web de reuniones de Medford y estará allí.
 Si la gente quiere revisarlo y ciertamente puede enviarme un correo electrónico, haré todo lo posible para conseguirle un enlace para entregárselo.
 Creo que eso es todo por el chat.
 Y las preguntas.
 Entonces, algo así me gustaría agradecer a todos por venir, Mike, quieres decir.
 Preguntaré algunas palabras.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4856.578s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, sólo diré que esta es una participación increíble.
 Y los aprecio a todos ustedes.
 Trajiste preguntas muy avanzadas.
 Ustedes son un grupo bien estudiado.
 Así que gracias por participar.
 Esto es algo que nosotros, ya sabes, hago, mencioné que vivo localmente.
 Esto es algo que me apasiona mucho: la construcción de viviendas en el área metropolitana de Boston.
 Y todas estas son buenas preguntas.
 Estas son cosas que gestionamos en todos nuestros desarrollos.
 Y creo que yo,
 Mantendré el trabajo de utilería que he hecho en el pasado.
 Somos hábiles como cualquiera para resolver todos estos asuntos, así que queremos ser un buen vecino, construimos casas, ya sabes, esto no es un laboratorio que construye una tienda minorista, no es que haya nada malo en que estemos construyendo un lugar donde queremos asegurarnos de que la gente realmente quiera quedarse y disfrutar de lo que todos ustedes disfrutan por aquí.
 Entonces, gracias por invitarnos y decirnos si hubo alguna otra pregunta que nos perdimos, tal vez tengamos una última oportunidad para revisarlas antes de que</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4912.428s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Hubo una pregunta sobre la construcción y dónde se estacionarán los vehículos de construcción durante la construcción, y también sobre las bocas de incendio si pierden espacios de estacionamiento en la calle nueve como resultado de la colocación.
 aparatos contra incendios, etcétera.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4928.465s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Yo diría que probablemente no.
 Eso realmente depende del departamento de bomberos, pero en un edificio como este, tendríamos bastantes conexiones de mangueras en el edificio.
 Entonces, quiero decir, ciertamente, si el jefe de bomberos quiere una boca de riego, lo haría, pero no creo que si ese fuera el caso, afectaría cualquier estacionamiento.
 Y luego la primera, la pregunta anterior sobre el estacionamiento de vehículos de construcción, es una gran pregunta, principalmente fuera del sitio y es la respuesta corta.
 Ya sabes, cuando nosotros,
 Disculpe, cuando entramos en la fase de construcción, necesitamos un estudio logístico completo, estudios de mano de obra, y creo que en cada trabajo que tenemos en construcción en este momento, nuestros contratistas están utilizando un estacionamiento considerable fuera del sitio, y luego cerramos a toda la gente.
 Así que si la preocupación es que van a empezar a obstruir la calle 9, la respuesta es no, vamos a mantener alejados a nuestros muchachos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4982.985s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Y una pregunta, ya sabes, ¿cómo sabrán los vecinos si vas a proceder? Supongo que serán audiencias públicas.
 Si eso llega a buen término.
 Sabes, creo que el siguiente paso es determinar qué es.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=4998.898s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, quiero decir, solo diría que si vamos a continuar, probablemente no será hasta después de las vacaciones.
 Y utilizamos la misma estructura de notificación para esta reunión para notificar a los contiguos que hubiéramos tenido que usar para cualquier otro proceso de audiencia o reunión pública.
 Así que la respuesta corta es: Creo que probablemente se parezcan mucho a esto.
 Si avanzamos, veremos algo en su bandeja de entrada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001497&t=5023.622s">[Kathleen Desmond]</a>: Así que vamos a concluir la reunión y nos gustaría desearles a todos un feliz y seguro Día de Acción de Gracias, cuídense durante las fiestas y gracias por su atención.
 Gracias.</p>
