[SPEAKER_07]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:37,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso for suspension of the rules.

21
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:38,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Camuso?

22
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:41,488
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to suspend rule number 33 to take papers 15-693 and 15-694 out of order.

23
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:43,609
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso, suspension of the rules to take

24
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:52,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Set papers out of order.

25
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:53,565
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

26
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:54,766
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

27
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt is before us.

28
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,112
[SPEAKER_09]: We have, um, we are roll call vote has been requested.

29
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

30
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:10,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

31
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:10,695
Yes.

32
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:27,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we explain what we're voting on?

33
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:28,139
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't hear the council.

34
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:33,884
[SPEAKER_09]: A motion to suspend the rules to take those two papers out of order.

35
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:34,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

36
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:55,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

37
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:03,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Four in the negative, three in the affirmative.

38
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:05,516
[SPEAKER_09]: The rules are not suspended.

39
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:13,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Motions, orders, and resolutions offered by Councillor Alango-Kern.

40
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:19,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that a resident be allowed to speak with regards to three issues

41
00:02:20,117 --> 00:02:32,739
[SPEAKER_09]: a missing stop sign, a painted stop line on Yale Street, the installation of protective metal bollards on Harvard and Yale Street sidewalks at corners of Main Street, and the replacement of a curb cut.

42
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:34,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Lungo Kern.

43
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:46,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, and thank you to my colleagues for allowing this to move forward first, since there's a child that's in the audience, young, who needs to get to bed.

44
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:49,922
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have a couple people here today from this Yale Street

45
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,919
[SPEAKER_17]: neighborhood who have concerns.

46
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,523
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the council hears about the concerns going on in that area on almost a daily basis through email.

47
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:06,607
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know these three are of particular concern, and we'd be happy to hear you discuss, you know, what's been going on.

48
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:07,708
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there's a timeline.

49
00:03:07,748 --> 00:03:14,692
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the city has approved a few things, but as far as moving forward, it's time that we need to discuss it.

50
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,938
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 Harvard Street, overlooking Yale Street.

51
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:27,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And we bring with us today Ryan, who is a four-year-old who lives at 43 Yale Street.

52
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:32,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a question of safety for him and everyone else in the neighborhood.

53
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:37,495
[SPEAKER_04]: You've also received many emails.

54
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:47,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Many emails from me and many pictures from me about sidewalks on Harvard Street, and it's now extending on both sides of Harvard Street.

55
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:53,963
[SPEAKER_04]: The main issue that we have is we can't traverse on a sidewalk.

56
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:55,504
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't walk on a sidewalk.

57
00:03:55,704 --> 00:04:01,530
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot conduct ourselves down Harvard Street, and it's extending over to Yale Street and Main Street as well.

58
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:09,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Neighbors have been asking everyone associated with Medford City Hall for assistance since 2011 with this issue.

59
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:20,013
[SPEAKER_04]: The situation has worsened since Captain Bob closed in 2013, and the advent of online food delivery has exacerbated the situation with Oasis.

60
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:26,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Oasis serves a good product, as does Bocelli's, and together they have 240 seats in a small area

61
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:35,412
[SPEAKER_04]: filled on a Saturday or Sunday night, wreaking havoc on the South Medford Square neighborhood.

62
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:42,318
[SPEAKER_04]: We have about 1,000 residents within a football field of both locations, if you draw a circle around it.

63
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:43,760
[SPEAKER_04]: All of us are impacted.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,666
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take a look at 240 seats divided by an average of three people per car, that brings 80 cars into our neighborhood.

65
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:54,950
[SPEAKER_04]: The Yale Street residents permit parking only is ignored.

66
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:03,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have people carousing in the public parking lot outside our bedroom windows until one in the morning at times.

67
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:19,481
[SPEAKER_04]: The DPW has had open traffic commission work orders for the following protective bollards to be installed at Harvard and Main Street corner, the one corner, which is approved by the traffic commission on January 13th of 2015.

68
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:27,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that was nine months ago, and there are reasons for this that I'll get to in just a moment.

69
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:35,814
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also supposed to replace a curb cut in a driveway entry with the granite full curb at 363 Main Street.

70
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,617
[SPEAKER_04]: That was again approved by the Traffic Commission on January 13, 2015.

71
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:46,465
[SPEAKER_04]: An installation of a second stop sign at the Yale and Dartmouth streets on the south side of Yale was approved

72
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:48,965
[SPEAKER_04]: in October 14th, 2014.

73
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:52,367
[SPEAKER_04]: That has not been installed as of yet.

74
00:05:53,328 --> 00:06:06,976
[SPEAKER_04]: The painted stop lines that were approved on October 14th were installed on Saturday and throughout the neighborhood in addition to the crosswalk on Yale Street being repainted.

75
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:11,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Back on October 7th of 2014,

76
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:20,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Sacco and Councilman Carol Viello and myself spoke with all the businesses on Main Street.

77
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:24,522
[SPEAKER_04]: We walked the entire neighborhood and watched the cars pulling in and out of the driveway.

78
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:26,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, it's not a driveway.

79
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:33,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Pulling in and out of the handicap access ramp at Oasis.

80
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:36,052
[SPEAKER_04]: In here, and they would drive out through the sidewalk.

81
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:40,535
[SPEAKER_04]: This is while people are walking through the business area.

82
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry for the people behind me, you can't see it.

83
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:49,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Medford City school bus drops off children right next to it.

84
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:53,976
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're dodging cars immediately after exiting the bus.

85
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:59,380
[SPEAKER_04]: There are now, you can see one van parked next to the building.

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,784
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always been a van or a truck parked next to that building, no matter who owned it.

87
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:13,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And having been a lifetime visitor to South Medford Square, I can vouch for this, having seen it as a child.

88
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are now as many as six cars parked there at times.

89
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:28,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I've sent you pictures of trucks that have parked there who have driven right across my feet almost and left eight inches of walking space.

90
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:34,535
[SPEAKER_04]: If Ryan wants to take a walk with his mom or come home from school, how does he get there?

91
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a ridiculous, illogical situation.

92
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,396
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got cars driving.

93
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:42,342
[SPEAKER_04]: and parking on sidewalks.

94
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:46,044
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got trailer trucks blocking the entire sidewalk.

95
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:48,806
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in front of the condominium next to Oasis.

96
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:54,009
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a M&M Transport Company van towing a Goodwill Industry bus.

97
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:58,431
[SPEAKER_04]: They left the truck running, and the two guys went in and got breakfast at Oasis.

98
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:01,313
[SPEAKER_04]: This just doesn't make sense to me at all.

99
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:04,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has been going on for years, and it's escalating.

100
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:18,917
[SPEAKER_04]: October 17th of 2014, Jim Silva conducted a safety walkabout with Chief Sacco and Michael Marks, Councilman Carviello, and 40 South Medford Square neighbors.

101
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:27,884
[SPEAKER_04]: The need for bollards became obvious then as the Oasis driver sped through us, drove over the curb, and we were all aghast.

102
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:29,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chief said, we'll deal with it.

103
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:34,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe at that point, Jim and Anita

104
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:45,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And a few other residents approached the traffic commission, and they approved the bollards being installed to prevent cars from accessing this location area.

105
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,261
[SPEAKER_04]: The simple fact is that Oasis is its own worst enemy.

106
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:53,042
[SPEAKER_04]: They've grown huge amounts.

107
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:54,962
[SPEAKER_04]: 240 seats are quickly turned over.

108
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:58,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they take up to an hour and a half to turn, but they're always busy.

109
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:12,458
[SPEAKER_04]: If you walk down Main Street, if you're able to survive the bicycles and now the motorbikes that ride on the sidewalk to be chained up out in front of the restaurant, you'll see that it's busy.

110
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:26,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We, the 110 people that moved into 215 Harvest Street, didn't notice this until the online food industry started growing in our area.

111
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:28,669
[SPEAKER_04]: We found that we were having

112
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:33,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Trailer trucks pull into our property, parking in our fire lanes.

113
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:42,226
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having Oasis residents park in front of our homes and parking in our parking spaces, which is a very small area.

114
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:43,587
[SPEAKER_04]: We have very little green space.

115
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:54,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Main Street customers and business owners use the space next to 363, the jewelers, as a parking lot, constantly zipping out

116
00:09:55,036 --> 00:10:05,180
[SPEAKER_04]: in and out past pedestrians, including the steady stream of Oasis customers who park in the Yale Municipal Lot or illegally park on the permit-required spaces on Yale Street.

117
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:16,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Oasis vehicles, including multiple Grubhub, Foodler delivery or catering trucks, delivery trucks and trailers, and their customers park on Main and Harvard Street sidewalks.

118
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:19,946
[SPEAKER_04]: They access them by driving through the ramps and

119
00:10:20,635 --> 00:10:26,919
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an open invitation for any of us to be hit by the cars, whether you're going into lunch there or you're just trying to get over to Arthur's to get a cannoli.

120
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,380
[SPEAKER_04]: It's as simple as that.

121
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,422
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't even get to La Casha to get a loaf of bread.

122
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:32,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I wrote that to you a year and a half ago.

123
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:34,084
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I cross the street?

124
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:40,749
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't cross the street to go walk on the opposite side of the street because cars are parked on the sidewalks.

125
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:48,334
[SPEAKER_04]: And the simple fact is that because Oasis cars are parking on the sidewalks, driving on the sidewalks, citizens who live there

126
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,242
[SPEAKER_04]: or visit there, feel it's now okay to do that.

127
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:55,905
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's very little enforcement unless we call the police to do so.

128
00:10:56,505 --> 00:11:04,632
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason there is little enforcement is because there are two cars in Sector 8, two Medford police cars that patrol the area.

129
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:17,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Their predominant work is, according to the captains that we've spoken to, is neighbor-to-neighbor calls and domestic abuse calls.

130
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:19,206
[SPEAKER_04]: or traffic accidents.

131
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:27,229
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking at what they would view as a minor parking issue becomes a life-threatening issue for us who live in the area.

132
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It's constant.

133
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:28,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It's chronic.

134
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts at 4 in the morning.

135
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,952
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't get down to the square.

136
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:36,754
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to drive down and then try and fight for a parking space to be safe.

137
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:38,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then, we're still not safe on the sidewalks.

138
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,842
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got an Oasis employee who parks and chains his motorbike out in front of the store.

139
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:50,025
[SPEAKER_04]: He thinks it's okay, and the owner thinks it's okay to have his customers chain their bikes up there as well.

140
00:11:50,425 --> 00:12:08,653
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me that the state said it was okay for him to park there, which is in contradiction to what the state policeman told me Saturday and suggested that we bring in the Medford police to monitor the situation and ticket, as well as the people parking on the sidewalk.

141
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:17,276
[SPEAKER_04]: He moved it across the street to the other side, chained it to a gas pipe, and then the next day changed it to a lamppost.

142
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:25,778
[SPEAKER_04]: The Oasis customers and provision suppliers are now using our driveways and private roads.

143
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:32,740
[SPEAKER_04]: We have toddlers who are out and about in our driveway because it's the only place that they can walk and play.

144
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,480
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one family that walks 24-7 or 18 hours a day.

145
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:41,311
[SPEAKER_04]: constantly walking these two toddlers because they're so very active.

146
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:57,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I got involved again, and I said I was never going to come in front of the council, but I got involved again when I watched one of Oasis's meat delivery trucks back in, as it always does, back into our driveway to do a three-point turn and go back to Route 93 and almost hit this family.

147
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:02,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Just called it a point at that time and just said, this is unacceptable.

148
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:06,786
[SPEAKER_04]: The police department can't do much about people trespassing on our property.

149
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:08,047
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for us to handle.

150
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:15,652
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's pretty difficult when you can't control the entire neighborhood of trucks and deliveries.

151
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:25,439
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Oasis commercial vehicles, huge pickup trucks, their van, and SUVs being stored overnight in the Yale Municipal Lot.

152
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,702
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a little rodeo of cars going through.

153
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:37,032
[SPEAKER_04]: No business permit in the city allows for an overnight commercial vehicle or a business permit vehicle to be parked in the lot overnight.

154
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:42,514
[SPEAKER_04]: There was only one that was allowed in the Yale Street lot, and that was for Mr. Caraviello.

155
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:44,975
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the name of the company that was associated with Barletta?

156
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:46,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Gilbane.

157
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:48,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Gilbane had one truck there.

158
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

159
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, if it's okay with Ms.

160
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:05,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Fritz, um, she knows that this city council has been very active, particularly in the South Medford area to get things done.

161
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:20,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I would suggest we send this to the transportation subcommittee because nine out of 10 of the issues that she's presented our, um, transportation issues, number one, and number two, uh, like the, the spots next to Oasis, we have to get a ruling from the city solicitor.

162
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,512
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's private property, if we can restrict them from parking there,

163
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:25,684
[SPEAKER_13]: and all of these issues.

164
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:30,766
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would say I'd like to make a motion to send this to the Transportation Subcommittee if we could meet within a week or so.

165
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,547
[SPEAKER_13]: What is that feedback?

166
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:34,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question, Mr. President.

167
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:39,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion of Councilor Camuso to send to the Transportation Subcommittee.

168
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:41,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.

169
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:44,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that not have been handled by the Traffic Commission since they've already approved this?

170
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:53,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you've told us, you've testified to us tonight that all of these things have been dealt with in the Traffic Commission and a number of measures have been approved.

171
00:14:54,325 --> 00:15:01,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And though they weren't dealt with in a speedy manner, they continue to be under consideration.

172
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I don't understand.

173
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:15,316
[SPEAKER_04]: If the traffic commission has approved and filled out the work order for the DPW department to install the bollards, does it now have to go to the traffic subcommittee?

174
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:20,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Vice President Margot Kern.

175
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:27,170
[SPEAKER_17]: appropriate places for us to hear the rest of the information she has for us.

176
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:39,399
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you are here because it already went to the Traffic Commission, got approved, whether that was in October of 2014 or January of 2015, and yet we have no resolve.

177
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,944
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's the bollards and signage, what is the reasoning they're giving us?

178
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:46,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, it's... Nothing.

179
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:49,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so I think we need just some answers from the Traffic Commission.

180
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:50,368
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an administrative matter.

181
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:55,529
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd like to continue?

182
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:55,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

183
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

184
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:19,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these issues were created for the abutters and the people that live in the neighborhood by licensing two expansions of Oasis and not completing what seems to be, now in retrospect, necessary analysis to support a second 120 seat restaurant in a densely populated and rapidly expanding neighborhood.

185
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,291
[SPEAKER_04]: We only focused on the growth of Oasis and not the impact

186
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:33,878
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no impact study done despite trying to communicate that before the expansion of the cafe in 2014.

187
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,381
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one of the busiest businesses in South Medford right now, though, by Medford residents.

188
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:42,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, but it's quite too big for our neighborhood, unfortunately.

189
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:49,109
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you talk to the gentleman that runs that business and some of the other businesses, they say maybe the condos were too much for the neighborhood.

190
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:51,310
[SPEAKER_13]: So you hear both.

191
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I understand your concern.

192
00:16:55,805 --> 00:17:00,288
[SPEAKER_13]: But that whole block has predominantly been a C2 and a C1 district, commercial.

193
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:03,270
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do we do?

194
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:03,831
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

195
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:08,314
[SPEAKER_13]: My thing is, if Oasis didn't go in there, it may be another bakery or another business.

196
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:11,936
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going to be a rental unit for housing or something.

197
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:14,458
[SPEAKER_13]: That's zoned, commercial zoned.

198
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Vice President Lugo-Curran.

199
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,953
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there is a business, there are businesses there, there are homes there, there are condos there.

200
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:27,935
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the main issue is enforcement, and I think the main issue is follow-through.

201
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:38,122
[SPEAKER_17]: When the Traffic Commission votes in favor of certain things, work order should be put in place, the signage should be made and put up, or the bollards should be ordered and put up.

202
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,543
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's our problem here.

203
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:46,067
[SPEAKER_17]: Whether, you know, the businesses are the businesses and the condos are the condos, but I think

204
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:53,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Mainly, the concern is the enforcement, which seems to be the lack thereof, and the follow-through.

205
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:56,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Vice President, for your point of information.

206
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:57,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

207
00:17:57,755 --> 00:17:58,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Fritz, if you'd like to continue.

208
00:17:59,336 --> 00:17:59,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

209
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:12,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of us who have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in Medford or have stayed in Medford and lived in the houses we grew up in are deeply impacted by this.

210
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:17,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of us had absolutely no control whether there was a public parking lot put next to us.

211
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:19,062
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't finished.

212
00:18:19,102 --> 00:18:20,963
[SPEAKER_04]: We had no idea what it was going to look like.

213
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:28,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And we certainly had no idea that the growth of Oasis would take over our neighborhood.

214
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:31,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, it's casting a negative pall on us.

215
00:18:31,788 --> 00:18:33,969
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not safe for us to walk on the streets.

216
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:39,625
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done the traffic studies.

217
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,465
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't do a traffic study.

218
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:46,587
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a radar car that works in the city of Medford, nor can we borrow one from another city.

219
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:56,971
[SPEAKER_04]: A new radar speed car would cost us, at a minimum, $6,000 for one that would have the software that we could track cars in the area, the volume, and the speeds.

220
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:04,553
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Yale Street speeders going right through every stop sign that's been posted, even the painted lines.

221
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:05,754
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought that would help.

222
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:06,874
[SPEAKER_04]: It has made it worse.

223
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:15,188
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a 20% compliance over the past year since the stop signs were installed last October.

224
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:23,052
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot get enforcement down at Yale Street during rush hour, nor during the hours from 6 to 9 a.m.

225
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:29,055
[SPEAKER_04]: because there are two cars available and they're at the schools helping crossing children.

226
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:34,658
[SPEAKER_04]: We have at least 25 people who will cross Yale Street at any given time from 8 a.m.

227
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,111
[SPEAKER_04]: to 8.30 a.m.

228
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:39,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tracked them, I've counted them, I videotaped them.

229
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:41,514
[SPEAKER_04]: We have people who walk their dogs.

230
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:45,336
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be 50 dog walkers who cross Yale Street, dodge cars.

231
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:47,417
[SPEAKER_04]: We have cars on Yale Street who can't get out.

232
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:49,559
[SPEAKER_04]: We have speeders all day long.

233
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:51,120
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't get enforcement.

234
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,422
[SPEAKER_04]: We have minimal enforcement of people at stop signs.

235
00:19:54,502 --> 00:20:03,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul Giordano's been great coming down and trying to stop as many cars as they can, but he gets called away for domestic issues or neighborhood issues or an accident.

236
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,560
[SPEAKER_04]: We just don't have enough staff.

237
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:11,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole thing narrows down to Steve Tenagli doesn't have staff.

238
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,044
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't have funding.

239
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:18,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a communication issue where things are decided upon and they don't get to him.

240
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:22,429
[SPEAKER_04]: He just found out about stop signs being painted on the street.

241
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:28,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we may list them or email asking where they are or call, it doesn't get to him.

242
00:20:28,512 --> 00:20:29,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can't bother him.

243
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:33,275
[SPEAKER_04]: He's up to his armpits and trying to put out fires everywhere, literal fires.

244
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:36,365
[SPEAKER_04]: The water department had to cover for him last night.

245
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:43,191
[SPEAKER_04]: They managed to come out, and I want to thank Peter and Brian for coming out and taking care of some major issues that were going on at 10 o'clock last night.

246
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:45,453
[SPEAKER_04]: The police department can't come out.

247
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:46,474
[SPEAKER_04]: They're busy.

248
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:47,315
[SPEAKER_04]: They're busy.

249
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:49,777
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll come out, and they get called away quickly.

250
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:55,081
[SPEAKER_04]: We're stuck there managing and policing our own area.

251
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:56,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 65 years old.

252
00:20:56,863 --> 00:20:59,085
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not how I expected to spend my retirement.

253
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:01,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's something we do just to stay safe.

254
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:04,425
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't even keep our heads above water at this point.

255
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:08,186
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to fund the police department.

256
00:21:08,787 --> 00:21:15,309
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to look at our area and take a look at the traffic studies and work with Oasis and find a way to work together.

257
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Their delivery cars are all over our neighborhood.

258
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:27,214
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a picture of one here, parked right next to the fire hydrant.

259
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:34,150
[SPEAKER_04]: When he's not parked there, he's parked on the sidewalk, across the street, or any sidewalk.

260
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:35,971
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have anywhere to walk.

261
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:37,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's as simple as that.

262
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:43,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm too old and too lame to dodge motorcycles on the sidewalk.

263
00:21:48,998 --> 00:21:50,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, lost my place.

264
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,921
[SPEAKER_04]: We have other concerns.

265
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:58,003
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got DPW lot signs that are secondhand,

266
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:09,679
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes our area match the descriptions that are in the HUD reports, calling our buildings and our South Memphis Square area dilapidated and run down.

267
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:25,084
[SPEAKER_04]: This type of environment that we're promoting by allowing it to continue, the driving on the sidewalks, the parking on the sidewalks, on both sides of that strip of mall, brings down our area, degrades our area, diminishes our value and quality of life.

268
00:22:25,724 --> 00:22:27,625
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't affected our property value,

269
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:30,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't affected my neighbor's property value yet.

270
00:22:31,368 --> 00:22:31,768
[SPEAKER_04]: It will.

271
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:42,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look on some of the Yelp sites, you'll see that the things that they say and the compliments they have about Oasis, it's a rowdy, jumping place.

272
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:48,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that rowdy, jumping place continues down Yale Street into the public parking lot where they park.

273
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:51,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not a safe environment.

274
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:55,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And the owners are focused on taking care of themselves.

275
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:57,207
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not available to talk.

276
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:04,281
[SPEAKER_04]: They did say that they would ask their motorcycle driver to park his bike somewhere else, but he moved it across the street.

277
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:08,323
[SPEAKER_04]: If he moves it across to Bocelli's, I don't think Nick's going to be too happy.

278
00:23:09,383 --> 00:23:10,243
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our neighborhood.

279
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:12,484
[SPEAKER_04]: We need some help, and we have some suggestions.

280
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:22,869
[SPEAKER_04]: We would like to ask that the city council meet with the mayor and contract a company to install the bollards.

281
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:24,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve can't do it.

282
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:25,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you?

283
00:23:27,587 --> 00:23:28,067
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it.

284
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:28,728
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it.

285
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:35,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you do it?

286
00:23:36,294 --> 00:23:39,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I think Councilor Camuso came up with a great suggestion.

287
00:23:39,796 --> 00:23:43,239
[SPEAKER_07]: We refer this matter to the Subcommittee on Transportation for further investigation.

288
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,702
[SPEAKER_07]: These matters that the woman is speaking of have been before this Council before.

289
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:49,323
[SPEAKER_07]: The Council supported them wholeheartedly.

290
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:52,646
[SPEAKER_07]: These three issues that were before the

291
00:23:53,318 --> 00:23:58,942
[SPEAKER_07]: traffic commission relative to the bollards, the stop signs, and the stop lines were as a result of Councilor Moxley's community walkthrough.

292
00:23:58,962 --> 00:24:04,146
[SPEAKER_07]: It came by way of a resolution to the traffic commission from the council, Mr. President.

293
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,648
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think Councilor Longo-Kearns is absolutely right.

294
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:08,269
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a concern.

295
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:12,268
[SPEAKER_07]: relative to enforcement, and there's a concern relative to lack of follow-through.

296
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:19,171
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that it would be appropriate due course for the council's Subcommittee on Transportation to further investigate the matter to determine what's going on.

297
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,232
[SPEAKER_07]: We put a resolution forward.

298
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,633
[SPEAKER_07]: The resolution went through the Traffic Commission.

299
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:23,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're in agreement.

300
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:25,574
[SPEAKER_07]: The Traffic Commission thinks it works, and we think it should work.

301
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:27,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the question is, where is it?

302
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:33,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that the Subcommittee on Transportation would be the appropriate venue for which we can figure that out, find that out, and report back to the body as a whole.

303
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:36,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe not at all, because it might get taken care of before then, Mr. President.

304
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:37,819
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be able to be handled right then and there.

305
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:43,256
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Camuso, Councilor Caravaglio.

306
00:24:43,537 --> 00:24:44,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

307
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,179
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with Councilor Knight and Councilor Camuso about that.

308
00:24:47,219 --> 00:25:05,253
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the meeting, I'd like to have Chief there, Chief of Police, someone from Republic Parking to address the parking concerns of the neighbors, along with somebody from the DPW.

309
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:16,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully, maybe even Luciano from Oasis, so maybe we can all get together in one room and hopefully work out a plan that's equitable to all parties.

310
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:20,801
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, unfortunately, Oasis is a victim of their own success over there.

311
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:23,262
[SPEAKER_11]: They are one of the busiest businesses in Metro right now.

312
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:33,206
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would say maybe if we can get everybody into one room in the next 14 days, we could hopefully work out some type of deal to make everybody happy, Mr. President.

313
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:34,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

314
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:34,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

315
00:25:34,507 --> 00:25:36,247
[SPEAKER_09]: So as amended by Councilor Caviello,

316
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:39,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

317
00:25:39,635 --> 00:25:41,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind there's a child here.

318
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:42,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, if I may.

319
00:25:43,396 --> 00:25:43,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

320
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:52,319
[SPEAKER_04]: We have had a meeting, and you were present at the meeting, as was Mr. Penta and Mr. D'Antonio, with the Oasis Group and some of the other neighbors.

321
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:53,359
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in December of 2012.

322
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing has changed since then.

323
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,201
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only worsened as far as the conditions that we have to live under.

324
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:03,162
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unsafe.

325
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:06,623
[SPEAKER_04]: It's increasingly unsafe as they add delivery trucks, as they add

326
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:11,619
[SPEAKER_04]: more customers bringing in more provision trucks coming through.

327
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It's now a regular thing to find the sideways block.

328
00:26:15,461 --> 00:26:16,341
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not acceptable.

329
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something we can delay on.

330
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:26,106
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to confess that very few counselors have responded to my emails over the last year regarding this.

331
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:29,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So in fairness, thank you.

332
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:31,929
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair recognizes counselor Penta.

333
00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:40,822
[SPEAKER_10]: And with all fairness, I'm going to disagree with my colleagues because the Traffic Commission has already made their decision, and the decision has been made and should be going forward.

334
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:45,104
[SPEAKER_10]: The responsibility is in the Chief Executive Office because he appoints those people to that commission.

335
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:49,086
[SPEAKER_10]: All this council will be doing is delaying it with more time and kicking the ball around.

336
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:50,527
[SPEAKER_10]: You deserve an answer.

337
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:55,789
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been voted upon, and it's the city administration that should figure out when and how to put that thing up.

338
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:01,132
[SPEAKER_10]: It shouldn't take a citizen to keep coming down here and presenting your concerns, public safety,

339
00:27:01,505 --> 00:27:07,028
[SPEAKER_10]: and shouldn't have a lady come down here with her child at nighttime to present this argument or this issue all over again.

340
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:09,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to disagree with my colleagues.

341
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,612
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to move that this matter be referred to the mayor for immediate action.

342
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:16,074
[SPEAKER_10]: And the action should be absolutely immediately.

343
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:22,618
[SPEAKER_10]: If the board of the commission voted for it, and the city has to figure out how to fund it, well, let them figure out how to fund it.

344
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:26,780
[SPEAKER_10]: But they voted for it.

345
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you actually have the minutes with you, Ian, that we can take a look at of the votes

346
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:35,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I know one thing that you stated regarding refurbished secondhand signs.

347
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:40,481
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe that is 100% accurate, because Steve Tanaglia does the signage.

348
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:49,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, if you go down to the head of Main Street, Yale at Main Street.

349
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:53,472
[SPEAKER_13]: They reuse signs and re-letter them, but we don't purchase them secondhand.

350
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Rube Goldberg, and it looks horrible.

351
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's one right under my condo that's horrible.

352
00:28:00,353 --> 00:28:03,094
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got white duct tape on it and letters.

353
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:04,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick on letters.

354
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:06,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have done it after a few beers.

355
00:28:06,415 --> 00:28:09,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but to say that we're using... That's secondhand to me.

356
00:28:10,745 --> 00:28:13,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big recycler.

357
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean to disagree with you, but it's my neighborhood.

358
00:28:16,588 --> 00:28:17,429
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my home.

359
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've asked for a new sign.

360
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,292
[SPEAKER_04]: All it would take is municipal parking with an arrow this way.

361
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:29,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to buy one and Chief Sacco said, no, deal with it through the city.

362
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:32,296
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, my husband and I have spent about $300 on signs.

363
00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:41,570
[SPEAKER_04]: for the public parking lot out of our own pockets because we couldn't wait for signs and we didn't want the fence being damaged.

364
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:45,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So we posted our own signs after we went to the traffic commission.

365
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:50,376
[SPEAKER_04]: After we got the permission, we asked for hash lines to be painted along our fence.

366
00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:51,717
[SPEAKER_04]: That hasn't happened.

367
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:58,442
[SPEAKER_04]: That fell off whatever list was created by the special assistant to the chief of police, Alva Erickson.

368
00:28:58,842 --> 00:29:02,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Alva was kind enough to share me, share these things with me, but any changes,

369
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:04,270
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone through Alva.

370
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We've played things through the way we should.

371
00:29:07,232 --> 00:29:08,513
[SPEAKER_04]: We did not deviate.

372
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:13,396
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't go out and paint stop lines on our own because it's destruction of public property.

373
00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:14,777
[SPEAKER_04]: We're good citizens.

374
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:17,098
[SPEAKER_04]: We deserve better than what we're living with.

375
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:26,985
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor to send this to the subcommittee on transportation and there's a contrary motion before us.

376
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:31,208
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to dispose of the first motion for before we take up the second.

377
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:33,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

378
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:35,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

379
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:45,991
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Anne for coming here tonight and her due diligence over the last couple of years on behalf of her neighborhood, as well as the D'Antonio's and a number of other people from South Method.

380
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:53,592
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree that I don't think at this point, this has been an ongoing issue for several years now.

381
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:58,433
[SPEAKER_12]: And at this point, to send it to the Subcommittee on Transportation, to me,

382
00:29:59,593 --> 00:30:02,915
[SPEAKER_12]: defeats the whole purpose of trying to get some immediate action.

383
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:04,897
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what we need right now.

384
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:06,317
[SPEAKER_12]: We need immediate action.

385
00:30:06,878 --> 00:30:10,700
[SPEAKER_12]: What the neighborhood is asking for, they're not trying to move mountains.

386
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,021
[SPEAKER_12]: They're asking for a painted crosswalk.

387
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,163
[SPEAKER_12]: They're asking for some signage.

388
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:18,264
[SPEAKER_12]: They're asking for bollards that were already approved.

389
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:24,028
[SPEAKER_12]: And I sent an email to Mr. Geer, and I have a lot of respect for Mr. Geer and the work he's done over the years.

390
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:30,503
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the end of July, he told me the balls were going to be installed within a week to 10 days.

391
00:30:31,144 --> 00:30:32,366
[SPEAKER_12]: That was at the end of July.

392
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:36,250
[SPEAKER_12]: I sent him a recent email again, and I have yet to get a response.

393
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:43,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I realize he's a busy man, but I think this is part of the frustration is that if residents knew, hey, this is going to be done,

394
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,521
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were given a date.

395
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,302
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't have to be exact, but a date.

396
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:49,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Say, we'll have this done by October 20th.

397
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:54,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I think the residents and people in the neighborhood would say, at least we know something's going to happen.

398
00:30:54,986 --> 00:31:04,731
[SPEAKER_12]: And part of the frustration that I feel from getting the emails is it's this ongoing that, you know, you never fully get an answer or a full response.

399
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:07,092
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm equally as concerned.

400
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:26,039
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was hoping tonight that this council, rather than send it to subcommittee, and I don't think that's a bad idea, but I think on this particular issue, where it's been bantered around for several years now, we had neighborhood walkthrough with 50 or 60 residents with the chief that were well past sending this to a subcommittee to be reviewed.

401
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:28,260
[SPEAKER_12]: And we want action immediately.

402
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:35,061
[SPEAKER_12]: And if that calls bringing the chief up here to respond, Mr. President, or Mr. Geer up here to respond in front of that podium,

403
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:39,803
[SPEAKER_12]: to the people that are paying his salary, Mr. President, then that's what we need to do.

404
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:45,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, Mr. President, you know, back some years ago, we used to have neighborhood policing.

405
00:31:45,785 --> 00:32:01,792
[SPEAKER_12]: What a great idea to have an officer, maybe Sergeant Carroll, who leads the traffic division, to spend three or four days a week for the next two months walking around that particular business district and let him come up with a list of suggestions on improving public safety.

406
00:32:02,693 --> 00:32:05,455
[SPEAKER_12]: and let him follow through like they should be doing.

407
00:32:05,815 --> 00:32:07,856
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not taking the emphasis off Chief Sackle.

408
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:15,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Chief Sackle, the recommendation from the Traffic Commission, they should be hounding DPW saying, when is this going to take place?

409
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Not the residents, not the council.

410
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:25,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Once something is approved by the Traffic Commission, there should be some standard set in this community that we expect something to happen.

411
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:27,469
[SPEAKER_12]: And I realize they're busy.

412
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:30,411
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know Steve Tanaglia and Mike Nestor, they're working hard.

413
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:32,733
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're doing their right.

414
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:37,196
[SPEAKER_12]: They're putting out fires constantly, and they can't get to the meat of what needs to be done.

415
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:40,819
[SPEAKER_12]: But really, Mr. President, this is extremely frustrating.

416
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,420
[SPEAKER_12]: You know better than anyone else.

417
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:46,804
[SPEAKER_12]: You live directly across the street from all this, so you must see it on a daily basis.

418
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, you must be equally as frustrated.

419
00:32:50,132 --> 00:32:52,974
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, this can't go any further.

420
00:32:52,994 --> 00:32:55,235
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, subcommittee, that's great.

421
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:56,836
[SPEAKER_12]: You can have a subcommittee at another time.

422
00:32:57,216 --> 00:33:03,020
[SPEAKER_12]: This council needs to take a vote tonight to request, Mr. President, as what Anne was coming.

423
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Anne, I think you were giving your list on what you'd like to see.

424
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:09,044
[SPEAKER_12]: And you were cut kind of short on that.

425
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,646
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I think that's what we need to do tonight, Mr. President.

426
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:14,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Make up a list of requests.

427
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:20,120
[SPEAKER_12]: and get action immediately on this, and have responses by next Tuesday.

428
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:25,002
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're unable to come up again, at least we can notify people of what we were told.

429
00:33:25,062 --> 00:33:28,244
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to thank Councilor Alongo-Kern for putting this on.

430
00:33:28,784 --> 00:33:31,045
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's my thought, Mr. President, on this.

431
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:35,187
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do think the community policing would go a long way.

432
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Last week, we heard about Haines Square.

433
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,652
[SPEAKER_12]: The residents that came up here, they weren't angry with the business.

434
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:43,254
[SPEAKER_12]: And these residents aren't angry with the business.

435
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:46,676
[SPEAKER_12]: They're angry with the lack of results they're getting from the city.

436
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:52,700
[SPEAKER_12]: And the residents that were in Haines Square last week, 80 percent of their complaints wasn't with the extended hours.

437
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,704
[SPEAKER_12]: It was with the drug activity and everything else that's going on, the broken sidewalks in their neighborhood.

438
00:33:58,424 --> 00:33:59,265
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what we need.

439
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:00,906
[SPEAKER_09]: We need the outreach, Mr. President.

440
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:02,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if I could, Mr. President.

441
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:05,449
[SPEAKER_09]: The President I'm just concerned for the safety of the child.

442
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:12,298
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to — we need to — I'll be quick, Mr. President.

443
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:13,058
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate that.

444
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:14,518
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be quick, Mr. President.

445
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:18,259
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is extremely frustrating, Mr. President.

446
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,419
[SPEAKER_12]: We have so many things going on in this city.

447
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:29,581
[SPEAKER_12]: And to revisit the same things over and over, like Groundhog Day — you wake up and it's the same thing, day after day after day, gets frustrating.

448
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:38,383
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a wonder why we can't move this city forward, Mr. President, because we keep on revisiting the old issues over and over and over again.

449
00:34:38,823 --> 00:34:44,545
[SPEAKER_12]: And the mayor can have as many dedications in the next two months that he wants, Mr. President, and ground breakings.

450
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:52,587
[SPEAKER_12]: But the issue is that residents are unable to get their answers resolved in a timely fashion, and they're unable to get results.

451
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:55,548
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the answer that the mayor should be looking for, Mr. President.

452
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:56,169
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

453
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:57,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

454
00:34:58,389 --> 00:34:59,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

455
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:12,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I certainly can understand Councilor Mark's frustration, and I think that's why it's important that we work together with the administration, with the residents in the neighborhood, and we bring this issue to the table at the subcommittee.

456
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:19,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that if we have a group and subcommittee that's committed and willing to work on this issue, we have three members of the council that are appointed to the subcommittee.

457
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,781
[SPEAKER_07]: We should take ownership of the issue and get the answers to the questions that we need answered.

458
00:35:22,841 --> 00:35:25,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Point of information, Mr. President.

459
00:35:25,903 --> 00:35:28,305
[SPEAKER_09]: The point of information for Councilor Marks.

460
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:40,738
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how much, with all due respect, I know you're new to the council, but I don't know how much more ownership we can take when we do a neighborhood walkthrough and residents are told that this is going to be done, this is going to be done, this is going to be done.

461
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,940
[SPEAKER_12]: And a year later, nothing is done.

462
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:48,786
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not sure about the fact that it's us that has to take control of this or responsibility.

463
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:55,331
[SPEAKER_12]: It's clear to me that the administration has been unable to impact or affect any of these changes.

464
00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:56,691
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the issue.

465
00:35:57,131 --> 00:36:01,652
[SPEAKER_12]: And whether it's us meeting with them again, I already went through this three or four times.

466
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,073
[SPEAKER_12]: The neighbors went through it a dozen times.

467
00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:06,693
[SPEAKER_12]: So, at what point are we going to say enough is enough?

468
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:09,314
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this has come to a head tonight.

469
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,094
[SPEAKER_12]: I really believe that.

470
00:36:10,414 --> 00:36:15,975
[SPEAKER_12]: And I realize that maybe these issues are somewhat new to you, but they're not new to the rest of us that have been around some time.

471
00:36:16,463 --> 00:36:18,024
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the frustration.

472
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:21,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly think that our job here is to solve problems.

473
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:23,827
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's a problem in the neighborhood, then it's incumbent upon us to take care of it.

474
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:27,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to determine what course of action is best for this council in addressing the issue.

475
00:36:28,149 --> 00:36:36,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, personally, I think bringing everybody to the table and sitting down and hashing out the issues that are of concern is the appropriate approach to take, Mr. President.

476
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:39,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that it's going to take do this and do it now.

477
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,155
[SPEAKER_07]: How about why isn't this happening?

478
00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:42,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a funding issue?

479
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:43,036
[SPEAKER_07]: What can we do to help?

480
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:44,441
[SPEAKER_07]: encourage the funding?

481
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:46,282
[SPEAKER_07]: What can we do to move some pieces around?

482
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:48,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there something that's going to need to come before the council for us to release money?

483
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:50,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we supportive of that?

484
00:36:50,924 --> 00:36:52,704
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the questions that we need answered, Mr. President.

485
00:36:52,764 --> 00:36:53,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Why isn't it happening?

486
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:58,206
[SPEAKER_07]: We can address that in subcommittee, and then we can come up with a course of action as to what we want to do to make it happen.

487
00:36:58,526 --> 00:37:00,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have to solve the problem, Mr. President.

488
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:04,929
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is presenting itself time and time again before this council from at least 2007, according to the Speaker.

489
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:07,209
[SPEAKER_07]: With that being said, it's still not resolved.

490
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:09,530
[SPEAKER_07]: So the course of action that we've been taking isn't working.

491
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,791
[SPEAKER_07]: So why don't we try something different?

492
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:11,751
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I'm saying.

493
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:19,460
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may also are in the transportation subcommittee chaired by council of Penta joined by counselors, Mark and level current.

494
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

495
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor night.

496
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:24,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Ma'am, if you'd like to speak.

497
00:37:24,363 --> 00:37:24,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

498
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:29,907
[SPEAKER_09]: The speaker would like to speak please.

499
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:31,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information.

500
00:37:31,528 --> 00:37:32,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Counsel Penta.

501
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:35,951
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, when we talk about taking ownership, the ownership of the matter has already been taken place.

502
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:38,093
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gone through a public meetings.

503
00:37:38,153 --> 00:37:39,854
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gone through the walking with the chief of police.

504
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,519
[SPEAKER_10]: You have residents.

505
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:42,260
[SPEAKER_10]: They've discussed this.

506
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,020
[SPEAKER_10]: They've talked about it.

507
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,421
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been before this council.

508
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:47,684
[SPEAKER_10]: She's given you a litany, time, dates, and places of what's taken place.

509
00:37:48,044 --> 00:37:49,385
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gone before the Traffic Commission.

510
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:50,906
[SPEAKER_10]: They've taken a vote, and it's gone.

511
00:37:51,747 --> 00:38:03,635
[SPEAKER_10]: It's obvious that the city administration doesn't know what its departments are doing, what its boards and commissions are doing, because if he did, or she did, who's ever running that show over there, this wouldn't be a subject matter that's before us right now.

512
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:05,397
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need—wait a minute.

513
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you mind if I finish, Mr. President?

514
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:16,207
[SPEAKER_10]: The fact of the matter is this, you don't deserve to be here tonight because the problem should have been resolved, or you guys should have been spoken to and given a time, date, and a place.

515
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:17,929
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not a yesterday issue.

516
00:38:18,149 --> 00:38:21,491
[SPEAKER_10]: This goes back for many, many months, if not years, as it relates to it.

517
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:35,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Mrs. Fritz and the folks that she lives with, they've spent hundreds of hours not only cleaning up the place, but trying to work with the city to make that particular spot workable, livable in that particular neighborhood.

518
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:38,714
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't think this is anything that belongs in the city council.

519
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:41,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think, if I'm going to finish it, do you mind, Mr. President?

520
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:44,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this belongs before the council in any subcommittee.

521
00:38:44,596 --> 00:38:45,717
[SPEAKER_09]: This belongs, this belongs.

522
00:38:46,297 --> 00:38:48,498
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair recognizes Ms.

523
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:48,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Fretz.

524
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:51,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not councillor.

525
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:53,179
[SPEAKER_09]: You've overextended a point of information.

526
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I would have continued with what Mr. Pinto was saying because it is valid.

527
00:38:58,141 --> 00:38:59,662
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to continue, then Ms.

528
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:00,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Fretz, thank you.

529
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:05,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to throw out, has anyone asked why when the mayor was doing the

530
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:11,319
[SPEAKER_04]: ALS bucket brigade, he called my name out first and challenged me first.

531
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:15,060
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because I've been in front of him so many times addressing these issues.

532
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:21,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Since 2011, you were a participant in so many of the meetings, one-on-one, where we gathered everyone together.

533
00:39:21,802 --> 00:39:23,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just gone downhill since then.

534
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:34,286
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think any more meetings are going to help meeting with the mayor, meeting with, we conducted meetings with Stephanie Burke, with Lauren DiLorenzo,

535
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:47,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Grumley, and I consulted with Mark Grumley a year ago when I was almost run over, going through the stop, the crosswalk, and a truck came flying through the access ramp.

536
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:50,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something that we want to see continue?

537
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:53,048
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the city's liability if I get hit?

538
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,051
[SPEAKER_04]: since I now have a dog, if my dog gets run over in that area.

539
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:06,474
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't walk with a friend with a stroller, even single file, down either one of the sidewalks at any given point during the day.

540
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:08,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just Oasis.

541
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:12,235
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the lack of enforcement because they don't have the staff or the funds.

542
00:40:12,755 --> 00:40:15,856
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the lack of parking because there are too many people parking.

543
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:18,577
[SPEAKER_04]: There are too many illegal apartments being thrown in.

544
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Bonsignori's place has had two bedrooms added.

545
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:22,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anyone know that?

546
00:40:23,194 --> 00:40:24,875
[SPEAKER_04]: That's brought in four more cars.

547
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,317
[SPEAKER_04]: There's cars all over the place.

548
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,659
[SPEAKER_04]: They're encroaching on each other's lawns.

549
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:31,000
[SPEAKER_04]: They're encroaching in our lives.

550
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:32,542
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're all speeding.

551
00:40:32,882 --> 00:40:33,863
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all flying down.

552
00:40:34,243 --> 00:40:35,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the pictures up of the trailers.

553
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:45,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a collection of panels off the back of the trailer trucks, the flaps, that are left in our driveways, and the ones that are left in from cars going through.

554
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:51,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But I never come before the board without having a solution to the problems we're presenting.

555
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:56,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we would like is exactly what you said.

556
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:08,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, pointing my fingers here, Councilor Mark, and that was to have a detail officer patrolling the South Medford Square, including the Lake Yale Street lot, which no one goes through, not even Republic Parking.

557
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:15,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, all day, and Yale Street, and take a look at what's going on and enforce things.

558
00:41:15,546 --> 00:41:16,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Things will stop.

559
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:17,807
[SPEAKER_04]: The behaviors will stop.

560
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:21,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't have to stand out there and ask people to please lower your voice.

561
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:24,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn your music down as you're driving through.

562
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to be happy.

563
00:41:25,328 --> 00:41:26,109
[SPEAKER_04]: The music's lovely.

564
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:27,469
[SPEAKER_04]: But please close your windows.

565
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:31,730
[SPEAKER_04]: You're awaking 200 people at 7 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday.

566
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,871
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to provide something for Oasis, and that's a designated loading space.

567
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:40,573
[SPEAKER_04]: That means moving the MBTA bus.

568
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:42,474
[SPEAKER_04]: That was discussed a year ago.

569
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:44,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing has happened since then.

570
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:52,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to put a designated parking space for Bocelli's because they will eventually get into delivery of hot food.

571
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:56,243
[SPEAKER_04]: They can see across the street how much it's increased their business.

572
00:41:56,983 --> 00:41:59,064
[SPEAKER_04]: May's needs a place to park their car.

573
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:02,306
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to be able to park it next to the jeweler's building anymore.

574
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And you need to park places for Oasis.

575
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:17,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

576
00:42:17,657 --> 00:42:18,597
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two motions.

577
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:21,439
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we've heard the complaints at this point.

578
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:22,679
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to get action.

579
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,921
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two different ways that people think would be the best possible way to go about doing this.

580
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:36,025
[SPEAKER_13]: One is through the subcommittee process where you can actually have the DPW commissioner in front of us and the city solicitor that can tell us if the bollards are legal.

581
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:39,960
[SPEAKER_13]: The building commissioner can be there as well.

582
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:46,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Because right now, I don't know if the spots next to the jewelers and next to Oasis are legal spots or illegal spots based upon zoning.

583
00:42:48,945 --> 00:42:53,647
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are the questions that I'd like to know, because the traffic commission may have taken a vote on it.

584
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:56,729
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do see that, and I appreciate the minutes of the meeting.

585
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:59,230
[SPEAKER_13]: And they have taken an affirmative vote to put the ballads up.

586
00:42:59,891 --> 00:43:05,954
[SPEAKER_13]: But are we going to get people that are property owners to come after the city now?

587
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:08,812
[SPEAKER_13]: because it's taken up a pocket spot that goes along with the building.

588
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:09,793
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the things I don't know.

589
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:13,814
[SPEAKER_13]: So my recommendation is to still send it to the transportation subcommittee.

590
00:43:14,474 --> 00:43:21,735
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, and, and I know there's another recommendation on the floor, but at this point I suggest we take a vote and whatever way it goes.

591
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:24,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

592
00:43:25,496 --> 00:43:26,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Counsel.

593
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:26,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

594
00:43:27,216 --> 00:43:30,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, no one's worked out of these people than myself.

595
00:43:30,237 --> 00:43:35,178
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've, I've worked with these people since my first, almost my first week on the council.

596
00:43:36,229 --> 00:43:41,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I've helped, I helped craft the deal with, uh, Gilbane to get them the trees and everything down there.

597
00:43:41,591 --> 00:43:51,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I asked councilor Penta, you'll call your committee for next, next, next Tuesday, get every, get all the proper people in the room rather than do the questions back and forth back.

598
00:43:51,914 --> 00:43:54,395
[SPEAKER_11]: What do it this week?

599
00:43:54,475 --> 00:44:05,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, either by the end of the week or by next Tuesday's meeting, get everybody in the room, get everybody in the room and let's get, let's get the questions and answers done now.

600
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:30,363
[SPEAKER_11]: rather than ask, excuse me, just get everybody in the room now, as soon as Councilor Penta wants to call that, he's the chairman of that committee, and rather than even submit them, and we don't know where everything is, all the proper department heads will be there, we can ask the questions, get answers, and I think that's the best way to go about it, rather than send it to the mayor, it's gonna get lost on the mayor's desk once we send it over there.

601
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:36,340
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion for approval by Councilor Knight is seconded by Councilor Camuso.

602
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Vice President.

603
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President De La Ruzo.

604
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,741
[SPEAKER_17]: I look at it a little differently.

605
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:42,841
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to do both.

606
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:53,404
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to ask the administration, you know, why, if so, the Traffic Commission has voted in the affirmative for many of these things.

607
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:55,045
[SPEAKER_17]: What is the deal?

608
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:55,885
[SPEAKER_17]: We've discussed it.

609
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:56,785
[SPEAKER_17]: We've approved it.

610
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:58,646
[SPEAKER_17]: We've talked about it year after year.

611
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:01,229
[SPEAKER_17]: The Traffic Commission has approved it.

612
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,752
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to move forward and ask for a resolution immediately.

613
00:45:05,173 --> 00:45:21,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, with regards to the additional public safety issues that have not been voted on, then yes, let's meet in committee, let's bring the parties together, and let's follow up and see what we can get done to make it even safer than it would be if these things have been implemented that have been voted on.

614
00:45:21,947 --> 00:45:23,448
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we should do both.

615
00:45:23,865 --> 00:45:27,887
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion to send it to committee, Councilor Camuso.

616
00:45:28,387 --> 00:45:34,310
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion before us that's been seconded and amended to send it to committee.

617
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:45,635
[SPEAKER_09]: An easy solution for us is to have an additional amendment that also sends a paper to the mayor asking for swift response and an answer to why it hasn't been done.

618
00:45:46,195 --> 00:45:46,916
[SPEAKER_17]: An implementation.

619
00:45:46,956 --> 00:45:47,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Does the chair have a motion?

620
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:57,813
[SPEAKER_17]: and move for the implementation of everything that's been voted on in the affirmative to be, to be done immediately.

621
00:45:58,194 --> 00:46:00,135
[SPEAKER_09]: As amended by Councilor Lungo-Kern.

622
00:46:00,596 --> 00:46:08,141
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Camuzo, as amended by Councilor Caviello and Vice President Lungo-Kern.

623
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:09,802
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a few.

624
00:46:09,822 --> 00:46:11,644
[SPEAKER_09]: There's two people that would like to speak in.

625
00:46:12,885 --> 00:46:18,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like just to close and then allow my compatriots to speak as well, but this is pretty straightforward.

626
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:20,755
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people driving on our sidewalks.

627
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:22,436
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a safe place to walk.

628
00:46:23,336 --> 00:46:26,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you really want the responsibility of watching someone get hurt?

629
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:27,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Because no action was taken.

630
00:46:28,237 --> 00:46:31,217
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been nine months since the actions were approved.

631
00:46:31,777 --> 00:46:34,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Minimal activities were approved and not done.

632
00:46:35,938 --> 00:46:37,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

633
00:46:38,618 --> 00:46:43,039
[SPEAKER_13]: And over the past, I've been working with you over the past five or six years, I would say.

634
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,699
[SPEAKER_13]: I've only lived in Medford five years.

635
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:45,459
[SPEAKER_13]: So five years.

636
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,400
[SPEAKER_13]: And oftentimes I say, have you called the police?

637
00:46:48,861 --> 00:46:49,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

638
00:46:49,742 --> 00:46:53,584
[SPEAKER_13]: And when the police are notified of a specific situation, they do send someone.

639
00:46:53,604 --> 00:46:57,687
[SPEAKER_13]: It may not be instantaneously based upon other stuff going on in the city, but they eventually do.

640
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they don't.

641
00:46:59,588 --> 00:47:06,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to understand that because I'm the one calling, because I'm the one that can see these things or have any experience.

642
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:14,475
[SPEAKER_04]: and vocal enough and assertive enough to speak up and say this isn't right, this isn't logical, this isn't what I expected, this isn't safe.

643
00:47:15,236 --> 00:47:19,879
[SPEAKER_04]: This is public safety and they don't come or they blow me off the phone.

644
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:21,400
[SPEAKER_13]: I can tell you right now it's not that.

645
00:47:22,181 --> 00:47:24,342
[SPEAKER_13]: They may be tied up with other stuff, they eventually do come.

646
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:26,964
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've had conversations with the chief.

647
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:28,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to disagree with you, Mr. President.

648
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:30,026
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have a truck parked on the sidewalk,

649
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:36,783
[SPEAKER_13]: and they don't come, then I expect you to call one of the members of this council, any of the seven sitting here, or the mayor's office.

650
00:47:37,183 --> 00:47:37,503
[SPEAKER_13]: She has.

651
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:38,283
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can assure you.

652
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:38,783
[SPEAKER_13]: I have.

653
00:47:38,883 --> 00:47:39,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I can assure you.

654
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:40,864
[SPEAKER_13]: I call him.

655
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:43,765
[SPEAKER_13]: If he didn't get a hold of someone to get down there, shame on him.

656
00:47:43,785 --> 00:47:46,426
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've called the chief of the police department and had someone go down there.

657
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the police department has someone go down there.

658
00:47:48,626 --> 00:47:48,786
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

659
00:47:49,507 --> 00:47:50,387
[SPEAKER_13]: They haven't when you called?

660
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:50,587
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

661
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,888
[SPEAKER_11]: They have, but they may not be in the same frame.

662
00:47:53,908 --> 00:47:54,868
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an enforcement issue.

663
00:47:54,908 --> 00:47:59,790
[SPEAKER_13]: If this was going on on my sidewalk, I'd call the police, or anybody else in this city would call the police, and they would be down.

664
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:01,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

665
00:48:01,564 --> 00:48:06,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I was standing next to a car that was parked on the sidewalk, leaving eight inches of space for us to walk.

666
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:07,868
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a problem.

667
00:48:07,908 --> 00:48:08,629
[SPEAKER_13]: We're acknowledging that.

668
00:48:08,649 --> 00:48:09,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And the police came.

669
00:48:11,151 --> 00:48:12,532
[SPEAKER_04]: They spoke to the driver.

670
00:48:12,972 --> 00:48:13,573
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

671
00:48:14,073 --> 00:48:17,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the Mr. Knight.

672
00:48:17,215 --> 00:48:19,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent you the information on that driver.

673
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:21,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

674
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:22,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate your time.

675
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:23,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

676
00:48:24,421 --> 00:48:27,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street.

677
00:48:30,468 --> 00:48:30,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford.

678
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,231
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a year ago we took the walk.

679
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:42,375
[SPEAKER_18]: The issue to me is, you know, in terms of these issues, there are three things.

680
00:48:43,276 --> 00:48:49,460
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to prevent cars from parking against the building on Yale Street, which presents a hazard.

681
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:56,764
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to prevent cars and trucks from parking against the building on Harvard Street, which presents a safety hazard.

682
00:48:57,691 --> 00:49:03,674
[SPEAKER_18]: and we want to get some loading zone for the businesses, and we suggested moving the bus stop.

683
00:49:04,254 --> 00:49:05,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we got the two.

684
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:16,441
[SPEAKER_18]: The council resolved to have the curb restored on Yale Street and the bollards or some form of obstruction put on Harvard Street.

685
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,582
[SPEAKER_18]: That was resolved.

686
00:49:18,902 --> 00:49:20,183
[SPEAKER_18]: The council voted on it.

687
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:21,963
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it was unanimous.

688
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:24,165
[SPEAKER_18]: It went to the Traffic Commission.

689
00:49:24,865 --> 00:49:26,806
[SPEAKER_18]: We went to the Traffic Commission hearing.

690
00:49:27,546 --> 00:49:28,327
[SPEAKER_18]: It was approved.

691
00:49:28,447 --> 00:49:29,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Both things were approved.

692
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:31,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we're here.

693
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:38,695
[SPEAKER_18]: They should have been done at least, if not, it should have been within the year.

694
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:50,124
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't ask them to be done within a week or two weeks, but we're going on almost a year since we started discussing the problem and since January when it was approved by the Traffic Commission.

695
00:49:50,685 --> 00:49:56,830
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would be lovely to have subcommittee upon a subcommittee upon a subcommittee, but we're going

696
00:49:57,544 --> 00:49:58,584
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a merry-go-round.

697
00:49:58,664 --> 00:50:01,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Round and round and round we go, and we go nowhere.

698
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:05,346
[SPEAKER_18]: All we want to know is, when are you putting the curb back?

699
00:50:05,786 --> 00:50:08,086
[SPEAKER_18]: When are you going to put the bollards in?

700
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:13,727
[SPEAKER_18]: And let's move on and get the bus stop moved, if we can do that, and get the business as a loading zone.

701
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:20,269
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we can have a big party at a subcommittee and discuss all the other safety issues in South Medford.

702
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:26,570
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm sure, as with the rest of the city, there are plenty of issues that need to be addressed that haven't been addressed

703
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:31,209
[SPEAKER_18]: for many years, and this has been going on for many years.

704
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:45,296
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a joke when people have to decide whether to go out into the street or try and traverse the sidewalk and avoid cars that may be backing out from against a building.

705
00:50:46,057 --> 00:50:48,058
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, last winter was horrendous.

706
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,199
[SPEAKER_18]: We are now approaching another winter.

707
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:54,001
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get this done before the winter arrives.

708
00:50:54,522 --> 00:50:55,683
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all we're asking.

709
00:50:56,043 --> 00:50:58,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we'll move on and discuss the other issues.

710
00:50:59,185 --> 00:51:06,310
[SPEAKER_18]: But really, to bring it to another committee and delay it a few more days and have another meeting and go here.

711
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,832
[SPEAKER_18]: We've already been approved.

712
00:51:07,912 --> 00:51:09,253
[SPEAKER_18]: It's already been approved.

713
00:51:09,553 --> 00:51:10,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Why are we waiting?

714
00:51:10,554 --> 00:51:17,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I think that there's a certain, I don't know why everyone's so scared of subcommittee.

715
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:22,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why it's such a scary place.

716
00:51:22,255 --> 00:51:25,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, a year ago, certain people came before this body.

717
00:51:25,237 --> 00:51:26,037
[SPEAKER_07]: They asked for something.

718
00:51:26,558 --> 00:51:29,399
[SPEAKER_07]: We responded to those individual citizens that came here.

719
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,400
[SPEAKER_07]: We passed a resolution.

720
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,201
[SPEAKER_07]: We sent that resolution to the Traffic Commission.

721
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,403
[SPEAKER_07]: That resolution went through the Traffic Commission.

722
00:51:34,763 --> 00:51:36,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody behind this rail wants to solve this problem.

723
00:51:36,965 --> 00:51:39,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're just having a disagreement as to what the best way to get it done is.

724
00:51:40,247 --> 00:51:45,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, personally, I think the best way to get it done is to have the subcommittee meet bimonthly until the issues get taken place.

725
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And when issues arise up like this, let's say, why isn't this done yet?

726
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:48,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring them in.

727
00:51:49,054 --> 00:51:49,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Why isn't this done yet?

728
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:50,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring them in.

729
00:51:50,355 --> 00:51:53,157
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's a need not to meet in one month or in two months, that's okay.

730
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,098
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's keep this thing rolling, Mr. President.

731
00:51:55,118 --> 00:51:59,382
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very easy to take a piece of paper and send it across the hall and wait for it to get a response back.

732
00:51:59,682 --> 00:52:00,522
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a response back.

733
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:02,664
[SPEAKER_07]: It said it was going to be done 10 days into July.

734
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:03,205
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not done.

735
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:07,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not throwing it into a black hole, which is a subcommittee.

736
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:19,560
[SPEAKER_07]: It's put into a subcommittee so that we can work on the issue, and we can keep it alive, and we can breathe life into the situation, and we can come up with a resolution for the people that are in this neighborhood, Mr. President, so that not just Ann Fretz and Ms.

737
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:30,367
[SPEAKER_07]: D'Antonio and Mr. D'Antonio and your sister can come up and talk about some of these issues, which you guys have, when there are other people in the neighborhood, too, that might be able to come to a subcommittee meeting once in a while and hear some of these issues that come up, as they're called.

738
00:52:30,687 --> 00:52:34,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying we need bimonthly subcommittee meetings on the Yale Street lot, Mr. President.

739
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,111
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm saying is we have a resolution before us.

740
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:37,432
[SPEAKER_07]: We requested action.

741
00:52:37,772 --> 00:52:39,252
[SPEAKER_07]: The Traffic Commission approved the action.

742
00:52:39,293 --> 00:52:40,773
[SPEAKER_07]: The action hasn't taken place.

743
00:52:41,153 --> 00:52:48,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Why isn't our subcommittee meeting to get the answers to the questions we need answered and to push for implementation on a basis that's quicker than every nine months?

744
00:52:49,116 --> 00:52:52,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that this would work out better, because we'd be meeting more frequently.

745
00:52:52,037 --> 00:52:53,077
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd keep it on the front burner.

746
00:52:53,097 --> 00:52:54,958
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't get buried in a pile of paperwork somewhere.

747
00:52:55,338 --> 00:53:04,100
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I hear that, you know, put it in another subcommittee and nothing's going to happen, the subcommittee is only as effective as the belief that you put in it and the willingness to work that you're willing to put into it, Mr. President.

748
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:05,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

749
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll rest with that.

750
00:53:07,087 --> 00:53:08,848
[SPEAKER_18]: May I just respond?

751
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:21,278
[SPEAKER_18]: It's difficult enough to get people to attend a city council meeting, let alone a traffic commission hearing at 2 PM in the afternoon when people are working, then to ask people to come and appear before a subcommittee hearing.

752
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:27,523
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, this has been resolved as far, you know, as far as we are concerned, we have a resolution.

753
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,105
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a resolution.

754
00:53:29,405 --> 00:53:32,067
[SPEAKER_18]: We are now waiting for the action to take place.

755
00:53:32,453 --> 00:53:36,194
[SPEAKER_18]: So we don't have to revisit this particular problem.

756
00:53:36,234 --> 00:53:38,254
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a very discreet problem.

757
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,795
[SPEAKER_18]: We've presented it to you.

758
00:53:39,915 --> 00:53:44,976
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other issues, perhaps, would be great for subcommittee on safety or whatever.

759
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:52,417
[SPEAKER_18]: But right now, these are the very discreet issues, the restoration of the curb, the installation of the bollards.

760
00:53:52,737 --> 00:53:53,217
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

761
00:53:53,957 --> 00:53:54,197
[SPEAKER_18]: When?

762
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:55,138
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

763
00:53:55,618 --> 00:53:56,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

764
00:53:56,178 --> 00:53:56,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Anita.

765
00:53:57,118 --> 00:53:58,578
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion for approval.

766
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:01,439
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair recognizes the gentleman, citizen, to speak.

767
00:54:01,837 --> 00:54:03,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Please state your name and address for the record.

768
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:04,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

769
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:05,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

770
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:06,520
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

771
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,301
[SPEAKER_14]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

772
00:54:08,741 --> 00:54:12,863
[SPEAKER_14]: The issue of broken roads is endemic throughout Medford.

773
00:54:13,704 --> 00:54:16,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Every single road that I have walked down in this city has serious problems.

774
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:21,228
[SPEAKER_14]: From Evans Street, which hasn't been repaved in any of the neighbors' memories,

775
00:54:21,843 --> 00:54:23,965
[SPEAKER_09]: We're speaking about Yale Street, so.

776
00:54:24,045 --> 00:54:24,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I understand.

777
00:54:24,965 --> 00:54:33,632
[SPEAKER_14]: But the issue of this idea that the committee, oh, if we just bring it to the committee, this issue will be solved, is, at this point, I think we can see that's a failed thought.

778
00:54:34,153 --> 00:54:36,154
[SPEAKER_14]: It has failed throughout the entire city.

779
00:54:36,995 --> 00:54:38,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilman Knight.

780
00:54:38,596 --> 00:54:43,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Can the gentleman tell us when the last time the subcommittee met on this very issue and whether or not there are any results that came out of it?

781
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,463
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe the gentlewoman who just spoke on the issue can clarify that issue.

782
00:54:48,344 --> 00:54:49,785
[SPEAKER_14]: The issue, beyond that.

783
00:54:50,297 --> 00:54:51,577
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't met, Mr. President, is the answer.

784
00:54:51,717 --> 00:54:57,279
[SPEAKER_14]: On the issue with the balls in front of Oasis or the pavement signs that we just go through this?

785
00:54:57,299 --> 00:54:59,299
[SPEAKER_06]: No, our subcommittee on transportation has not met once.

786
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:02,300
[SPEAKER_14]: So beyond this idea that if we just have a committee.

787
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

788
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,541
[SPEAKER_13]: There's also a request to move a bus stop.

789
00:55:09,061 --> 00:55:12,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penta chairs the subcommittee on transportation.

790
00:55:12,202 --> 00:55:14,362
[SPEAKER_13]: There's several items in there that the meeting hasn't been called.

791
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:18,203
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is, a lot more has to be done.

792
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:21,575
[SPEAKER_13]: The bus stop moving has to be done at that level as well.

793
00:55:22,515 --> 00:55:26,276
[SPEAKER_13]: That's our, we said it a few weeks ago about moving the bus stops in Medford Square.

794
00:55:26,576 --> 00:55:28,456
[SPEAKER_13]: That falls under the city council's domain.

795
00:55:29,357 --> 00:55:30,977
[SPEAKER_13]: So if nothing else, we should have the subcommittee.

796
00:55:30,997 --> 00:55:31,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Vote on it right now.

797
00:55:31,597 --> 00:55:33,738
[SPEAKER_14]: If it falls under the city council's domain, do it.

798
00:55:34,178 --> 00:55:34,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Just do it.

799
00:55:34,938 --> 00:55:36,298
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to send in some mystery committee.

800
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:37,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Sir, don't interrupt the council, please.

801
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:43,160
[SPEAKER_13]: So as I said, the chairperson should call a meeting to discuss some of these other issues that are present in itself.

802
00:55:43,894 --> 00:55:49,677
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have a motion for approval on the floor, if we could just tidy things up.

803
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:51,658
[SPEAKER_14]: I've spoken for hardly a minute, sir.

804
00:55:51,738 --> 00:55:52,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

805
00:55:53,098 --> 00:56:03,443
[SPEAKER_14]: The issue, as the city council can remember, we had something like 30 residents from all over Medford talk about this very issue of rotting roads right near their house.

806
00:56:04,104 --> 00:56:12,708
[SPEAKER_14]: If the city had someone who was directly responsible for these issues, like a transportation engineer, then we wouldn't have to continually play this game of hot potato.

807
00:56:13,008 --> 00:56:13,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

808
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:14,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

809
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise I'll be sharp.

810
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:19,673
[SPEAKER_03]: At least Antonio 41 Dartmouth street.

811
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:32,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't understand why any member of the council would be more concerned with a subcommittee meeting when they are thinking about the health, the wellbeing and the safety of people.

812
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would think the most important thing to do would be to unanimously approve.

813
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:37,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information.

814
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Caraviello.

815
00:56:39,725 --> 00:56:43,568
[SPEAKER_11]: What we're trying to do is we're trying to get everybody into the same room at the same time.

816
00:56:43,588 --> 00:56:44,689
[SPEAKER_03]: But that already happened.

817
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So why does it need to happen again?

818
00:56:48,312 --> 00:56:49,032
[SPEAKER_11]: We've never done that.

819
00:56:49,653 --> 00:56:52,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to every meeting that we've had down in South Memphis.

820
00:56:57,078 --> 00:56:58,039
[SPEAKER_11]: And everything's been approved.

821
00:56:58,299 --> 00:57:00,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get everybody into the same room.

822
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:03,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that's a wonderful idea for future problems.

823
00:57:03,763 --> 00:57:05,864
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are two things that need to be done.

824
00:57:06,044 --> 00:57:07,185
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been voted on.

825
00:57:07,205 --> 00:57:09,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's direct our remarks to the Chair.

826
00:57:09,066 --> 00:57:09,247
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

827
00:57:09,487 --> 00:57:10,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, Councilor.

828
00:57:10,387 --> 00:57:10,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

829
00:57:10,888 --> 00:57:11,648
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

830
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:16,592
[SPEAKER_03]: President De La Russo, I don't understand why there is the delay.

831
00:57:17,552 --> 00:57:24,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Since it was already gone through the correct process, it's incredible because

832
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:32,728
[SPEAKER_03]: There must be a different agenda in some people's minds other than representing and providing for the safety of the citizens of Medford.

833
00:57:33,428 --> 00:57:40,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Subcommittees can go on and on, just like people that come to the podium like myself and go on and on.

834
00:57:40,572 --> 00:57:51,477
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a wonderful idea, Councilor Knight, for future, not just for South Medford, but for West Medford, for the Felsway, for Salem Street, wherever.

835
00:57:53,489 --> 00:57:56,270
[SPEAKER_03]: But those two things have gone through the correct process.

836
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,011
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the big deal?

837
00:58:00,071 --> 00:58:00,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Precisely.

838
00:58:01,472 --> 00:58:01,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

839
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you all.

840
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:06,734
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion for approval before us.

841
00:58:06,794 --> 00:58:14,016
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair recognizes on that motion, Chair recognizes Councilor Penta, Chairman of the Subcommittee of Transportation.

842
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:15,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I'd like to move to sever the motions.

843
00:58:16,497 --> 00:58:18,078
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason why I'd like to sever them is

844
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:38,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to take that for which has already been voted and approved upon by the Traffic Commission, which would be the curb cut, the paulets, and the sidewalks as a separate issue and vote that go to the mayor for an immediate response and resolve, an immediate response and resolve in a time that it's going to be resolved.

845
00:58:39,363 --> 00:58:44,166
[SPEAKER_10]: And all the other issues regarding the South Memphis area that are ancillary to that, I've got no problem

846
00:58:44,973 --> 00:58:47,175
[SPEAKER_10]: um, supporting that and a subcommittee meeting.

847
00:58:47,215 --> 00:58:52,359
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, as far as anything else goes that, Oh, okay.

848
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:53,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I read, I'm sorry.

849
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,541
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have seven.

850
00:58:55,902 --> 00:59:05,289
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the main motion by council night, uh, seconded by, uh, councilor Camuso as amended by councilor Caviello on that motion councilor.

851
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,990
[SPEAKER_13]: The role is called.

852
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:13,255
[SPEAKER_13]: I would ask respectfully that chairperson Penta holds a subcommittee meeting to discuss the bus stop

853
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:23,642
[SPEAKER_13]: and the rest of the papers that have been lingering in that transportation subcommittee for some time, uh, fought with so that we can take up the stuff that actually has the domain here at the city council.

854
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:24,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

855
00:59:24,502 --> 00:59:30,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be a C paper on the main motion by counselor night.

856
00:59:30,524 --> 00:59:35,266
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor with severance.

857
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:37,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So the seventh motion comes first.

858
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:38,347
[SPEAKER_09]: My apologies.

859
00:59:38,387 --> 00:59:42,008
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the seventh portion that the, uh, the,

860
00:59:42,853 --> 01:00:01,337
[SPEAKER_09]: previously approved matters from the traffic commission that were forwarded for execution to the executive that those be reported back to the council for a report as to when they are going to be completed and that immediate action be taken on the remaining matters.

861
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:03,838
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, all those in favor,

862
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:05,733
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

863
01:00:06,153 --> 01:00:08,394
[SPEAKER_09]: The C paper passes.

864
01:00:08,974 --> 01:00:15,315
[SPEAKER_09]: On the main motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Camuso, as amended by Councilor Garaviello, all those in favor?

865
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:17,515
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

866
01:00:18,155 --> 01:00:19,096
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

867
01:00:19,676 --> 01:00:23,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all very much for your, the C paper is what?

868
01:00:23,256 --> 01:00:24,697
[SPEAKER_13]: That the chairman holds a meeting.

869
01:00:24,717 --> 01:00:27,037
[SPEAKER_13]: He's stuck lingering in there for a long time.

870
01:00:27,097 --> 01:00:29,698
[SPEAKER_09]: That the chairman, I think that was part of the.

871
01:00:29,718 --> 01:00:30,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a motion, Mr. President.

872
01:00:32,232 --> 01:00:34,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Point of information, Councillor Marks.

873
01:00:35,315 --> 01:00:38,797
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure what stuff the Councillor is talking about.

874
01:00:38,837 --> 01:00:41,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe if he can clarify what he means by stuff.

875
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:48,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I think on the main motion was a request... The ballad issue is not lingering in any subcommittee.

876
01:00:49,086 --> 01:00:50,347
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I'm not quite sure what he's talking about.

877
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:56,052
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Councillor, if I could clarify that in the main motion, in the main motion there was a call for

878
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,401
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not lingering before any subcommittee.

879
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,823
[SPEAKER_09]: The main motion was a call for a subcommittee meeting.

880
01:01:02,103 --> 01:01:04,564
[SPEAKER_09]: So the subcommittee meetings will be called.

881
01:01:05,225 --> 01:01:06,445
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's no need for a seat paper.

882
01:01:06,486 --> 01:01:08,106
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll wait for the president to call for that meeting.

883
01:01:10,308 --> 01:01:11,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, there's nothing lingering in that.

884
01:01:13,249 --> 01:01:16,311
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a call in the main motion for the subcommittee meeting.

885
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:18,632
[SPEAKER_09]: So the matter is all settled.

886
01:01:18,652 --> 01:01:19,773
[SPEAKER_09]: We hope.

887
01:01:20,273 --> 01:01:21,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for coming down.

888
01:01:22,374 --> 01:01:25,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for all your input and all of your help.

889
01:01:25,959 --> 01:01:28,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for suspension of the rules by Councilor Knight.

890
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to take unfinished business off the table relative to the DPW contract, Mr. President.

891
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:40,642
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to take paper out of order for settling the contract.

892
01:01:40,682 --> 01:01:41,522
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

893
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:42,803
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

894
01:01:42,823 --> 01:01:45,683
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion carries.

895
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:51,445
[SPEAKER_09]: 15-693, amendments to chapters 63, personnel, public works revised, and 15-694, transfers

896
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:59,881
[SPEAKER_09]: $71,126 to Public Works and Building Services personnel.

897
01:02:00,022 --> 01:02:10,507
[SPEAKER_09]: The Chair recognizes at the podium Louise Miller, the Director of Budget, Finance, Personnel, Purchasing, et cetera.

898
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:11,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

899
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:13,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And local magistrate.

900
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:15,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon me?

901
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:16,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And local magistrate.

902
01:02:17,411 --> 01:02:19,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's not going to be taking place.

903
01:02:19,232 --> 01:02:19,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

904
01:02:22,192 --> 01:02:37,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you have before you two papers to change the ordinances to reflect the new pay scale for DPW workers, which also includes the two employees in the electrical department.

905
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:42,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition to that, you have a paper before you to transfer the funds.

906
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:45,111
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion.

907
01:02:50,003 --> 01:02:54,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penter asked that an explanation of the process be presented to the council.

908
01:02:54,707 --> 01:02:56,349
[SPEAKER_02]: An explanation, I'm sorry, of the?

909
01:02:57,309 --> 01:02:57,810
[SPEAKER_09]: The contract.

910
01:02:58,791 --> 01:02:59,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the contract.

911
01:02:59,591 --> 01:03:13,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're asking is an amendment to the ordinances for the compensation plan for the Department of Public Works employees, which includes public work employees as well as two electrical department employees.

912
01:03:13,403 --> 01:03:17,367
[SPEAKER_02]: It includes more positions than that, which are set forth in the paper.

913
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:33,614
[SPEAKER_02]: The raises would be the first raise would be effective January 1 2016 and would be a 2% raise effective January 1 2017 would be a 2% raise for each step as well and effective January 1 2018 it would be two and a half percent of each step for each of the grades and

914
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:48,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Louise, real quick.

915
01:03:49,002 --> 01:03:49,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

916
01:03:51,184 --> 01:03:55,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting January 1st to December 31st, 2016, it's 2%.

917
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:56,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

918
01:03:57,008 --> 01:03:59,429
[SPEAKER_10]: And January 1st to December 31st, 2017, it's 2%.

919
01:03:59,629 --> 01:04:03,652
[SPEAKER_10]: And January 1st, 2018, it's 2.5%.

920
01:04:04,313 --> 01:04:06,194
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct.

921
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:06,694
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

922
01:04:07,154 --> 01:04:13,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you said this was for the Department of Public Works and two employees, did you say, of the electrical department?

923
01:04:14,257 --> 01:04:17,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, two employees currently in the electrical department.

924
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:30,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for positions that are grade PW3 through PW21, which are public works job descriptions, and then B2, B4, and B4.5, which are in the electrical department.

925
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:36,214
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a total of many employees altogether that this package encompasses.

926
01:04:37,835 --> 01:04:40,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the grand total is 44 employees.

927
01:04:43,155 --> 01:04:45,177
[SPEAKER_02]: 46 plus 2, sorry.

928
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:54,045
[SPEAKER_10]: And is that the total complement of employees that we have or is that that's all that showed up for the vote on that day?

929
01:04:55,066 --> 01:04:58,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, the number of employees who showed up for the vote on that day were 34 employees.

930
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:58,790
34?

931
01:04:59,210 --> 01:04:59,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

932
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:00,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

933
01:05:05,696 --> 01:05:06,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Move approval.

934
01:05:07,257 --> 01:05:08,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by

935
01:05:09,563 --> 01:05:13,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta as seconded by Councilor Camuso.

936
01:05:15,488 --> 01:05:18,090
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a motion to waive the three readings as well.

937
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:23,254
[SPEAKER_09]: So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll as this is a contractual matter.

938
01:05:25,436 --> 01:05:26,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Camuso?

939
01:05:26,036 --> 01:05:26,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

940
01:05:28,899 --> 01:05:29,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Cavanaugh?

941
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:29,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

942
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Night?

943
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:31,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

944
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:32,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Lanaquer?

945
01:05:33,002 --> 01:05:33,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

946
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:34,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Matz?

947
01:05:34,283 --> 01:05:34,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

948
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:35,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Penta?

949
01:05:35,925 --> 01:05:36,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

950
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:37,551
[SPEAKER_09]: President DelaRusso.

951
01:05:37,591 --> 01:05:37,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

952
01:05:38,151 --> 01:05:43,415
[SPEAKER_09]: With the vote of seven in the affirmative, non-negative and three in the waived, the motion passes.

953
01:05:43,435 --> 01:05:44,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

954
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

955
01:05:47,738 --> 01:05:52,301
[SPEAKER_09]: 15-694, transfers of $71,126 from public works and building services personnel.

956
01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:52,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

957
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:53,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Miller.

958
01:05:54,503 --> 01:06:01,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So this paper is to actually provide for the funding for the raises for the public works employee and the building department.

959
01:06:01,728 --> 01:06:03,890
[SPEAKER_02]: So it requires a transfer

960
01:06:04,763 --> 01:06:11,324
[SPEAKER_02]: from a negotiated salaries account, which was money that was set aside by this council for this very purpose.

961
01:06:11,604 --> 01:06:22,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a transfer of $43,441 from that account, and then a transfer of $16,182 from water retained earnings to cover the water department employees, and $11,503 from sewer retained earnings for the employees who are currently working

962
01:06:33,725 --> 01:06:34,746
[SPEAKER_02]: in the sewer enterprise fund.

963
01:06:35,627 --> 01:06:36,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President?

964
01:06:37,048 --> 01:06:46,155
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Louise, what is the actual increase in cost with this pay raise?

965
01:06:46,395 --> 01:06:53,441
[SPEAKER_10]: To transfer all these monies over, what does that come to in an actual increase in cost for the year?

966
01:06:53,701 --> 01:06:58,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't total it out for all the departments, but I do believe it was on

967
01:06:58,763 --> 01:07:00,444
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the papers that was before you.

968
01:07:00,504 --> 01:07:03,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was 43,441 plus 16,182 plus 11,503.

969
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,549
[SPEAKER_02]: And that includes everything.

970
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:14,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It included all budgeted out-of-grade pay, all budgeted overtime pay, and the snow and ice as well.

971
01:07:15,015 --> 01:07:17,617
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's approximately $71,000 of thereabouts.

972
01:07:17,777 --> 01:07:22,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, is that $71,000 in this year's budget?

973
01:07:22,961 --> 01:07:27,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is that something that's going to have to be found to add the $71,000, because what you did

974
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:29,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you transfer the money?

975
01:07:30,286 --> 01:07:36,030
[SPEAKER_02]: We are transferring just the $43,000, because the water and sewer are separate funds.

976
01:07:36,491 --> 01:07:42,876
[SPEAKER_02]: So those will have to be incorporated into the water and sewer rates, which I believe are being revised currently.

977
01:07:43,296 --> 01:07:50,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as far as the $43,441, that is 2% is well within the revenue growth of the city.

978
01:07:50,202 --> 01:07:57,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this time, I do not have any concern with meeting this appropriation next year.

979
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:02,241
[SPEAKER_10]: So the negotiated salary portion that's in the budget was how much for the year total?

980
01:08:04,723 --> 01:08:02,241
$43,441.

981
01:08:04,883 --> 01:08:06,484
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

982
01:08:07,165 --> 01:08:10,668
[SPEAKER_10]: What was voted upon by the council when they voted for the negotiated salaries?

983
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:13,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't have that number in front of me.

984
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:14,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

985
01:08:15,672 --> 01:08:18,574
[SPEAKER_10]: But this $43,000 would come from that account?

986
01:08:19,055 --> 01:08:19,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it would.

987
01:08:20,316 --> 01:08:23,339
[SPEAKER_10]: And you don't know what the, could you just, you don't have to do it now.

988
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:23,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you just,

989
01:08:24,243 --> 01:08:27,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell us what the dollar amount is and what the balance is now that you've taken the $43,000 out.

990
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:28,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Just report back.

991
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:29,344
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

992
01:08:29,444 --> 01:08:30,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do that.

993
01:08:30,644 --> 01:08:32,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

994
01:08:32,604 --> 01:08:33,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

995
01:08:33,105 --> 01:08:41,986
[SPEAKER_13]: If you refer to our budget on page 13, we funded the negotiated salaries account, which was line item 5110, for $265,000.

996
01:08:42,366 --> 01:08:45,167
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a number that we all should know.

997
01:08:46,227 --> 01:08:47,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that point of information.

998
01:08:48,847 --> 01:08:49,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

999
01:08:49,207 --> 01:08:52,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1000
01:08:53,892 --> 01:08:55,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair awaits a motion of approval.

1001
01:08:55,534 --> 01:08:56,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight for approval.

1002
01:08:56,835 --> 01:09:01,139

01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:02,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello seconded.

1004
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:05,323
[SPEAKER_09]: All those, we need a roll call on this please.

1005
01:09:05,363 --> 01:09:07,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1006
01:09:07,646 --> 01:09:07,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1007
01:09:07,846 --> 01:09:08,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1008
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:08,406
Yes.

1009
01:09:08,687 --> 01:09:08,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1010
01:09:18,638 --> 01:09:20,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, vote is seven in the affirmative.

1011
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,481
[SPEAKER_10]: None in the negative.

1012
01:09:22,841 --> 01:09:24,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1013
01:09:24,402 --> 01:09:25,563
[SPEAKER_10]: One quick question before you leave.

1014
01:09:25,963 --> 01:09:26,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1015
01:09:26,623 --> 01:09:27,324
[SPEAKER_10]: The bids came in.

1016
01:09:27,444 --> 01:09:28,805
[SPEAKER_10]: When are we going to have that ceiling fixed?

1017
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we answer the question, please?

1018
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:34,509
[SPEAKER_02]: The bids didn't come in.

1019
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:39,152
[SPEAKER_02]: The report was forwarded to me last week, which I have reviewed.

1020
01:09:39,272 --> 01:09:41,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Moki, as well, has a copy of it.

1021
01:09:41,673 --> 01:09:46,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are going to be meeting with the mayor regarding the course of action to be taken.

1022
01:09:46,136 --> 01:09:47,417
[SPEAKER_10]: And how much did the bids come in for?

1023
01:09:48,724 --> 01:09:51,785
[SPEAKER_02]: For just this portion was under $50,000 for the council.

1024
01:09:51,825 --> 01:09:52,405
[SPEAKER_02]: How much?

1025
01:09:52,685 --> 01:09:57,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Under $50,000 for the council chambers, but we looked, that was an estimate by the architect.

1026
01:09:57,707 --> 01:10:01,788
[SPEAKER_02]: We would still have to go out to bid, but we were looking at the entire project.

1027
01:10:01,808 --> 01:10:09,710
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other work that needs to be done around city hall and that totaled over $1.5 million approximately.

1028
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:11,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1029
01:10:11,871 --> 01:10:16,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for a council on night to take suspension of the rules to take a 15 dash

1030
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,380
[SPEAKER_09]: 7-0-3.

1031
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,200
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1032
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,301
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1033
01:10:20,321 --> 01:10:20,961
[SPEAKER_09]: 15-7-0-3.

1034
01:10:20,981 --> 01:10:42,454
[SPEAKER_09]: To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body confirm the reappointment of Mr. Alan K. Moderana of 25 Blakely Road, Medford as a member of the Medford License Commission for a three-year reappointment which will expire on June 1st, 2018.

1035
01:10:43,595 --> 01:10:46,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Moderana is in attendance this evening, very truly yours,

1036
01:10:47,387 --> 01:10:55,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Michael J. McGlynn, who we've all received in our packets last week, as is our new custom, a copy of the curriculum vitae.

1037
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval.

1038
01:10:56,971 --> 01:10:58,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Councilor Camuso.

1039
01:10:58,991 --> 01:10:59,972
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion.

1040
01:11:00,252 --> 01:11:02,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair may recognize Councilor Marks.

1041
01:11:03,173 --> 01:11:04,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1042
01:11:04,574 --> 01:11:08,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Alan was kind enough to come up tonight, and I was wondering if he can come to the podium, Mr. President.

1043
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:13,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair invites Mr. Materano to present himself before the podium.

1044
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:28,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, where I was kind enough to come to us tonight, I was wondering if he can just speak on his experience as a commissioner.

1045
01:11:28,891 --> 01:11:34,595
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there's any thoughts that you have, uh, that you'd like to share with the council.

1046
01:11:35,315 --> 01:11:36,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, thank you.

1047
01:11:36,576 --> 01:11:37,376
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, council marks.

1048
01:11:37,797 --> 01:11:44,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, first of all, I can't believe it's been three years, um, that have been on the commission.

1049
01:11:44,938 --> 01:11:55,281
[SPEAKER_16]: I've learned a great deal from Chairman Jim Flynn and my other associate, Maurice Delvando.

1050
01:11:57,721 --> 01:12:04,803
[SPEAKER_16]: We, in the three years, we have seen a number of instances for licenses.

1051
01:12:06,403 --> 01:12:12,605
[SPEAKER_16]: We've also implemented, I don't know if the council remembers, we've instituted a pilot program where we would

1052
01:12:13,267 --> 01:12:17,709
[SPEAKER_16]: have restaurants come before us or looking for entertainment licenses.

1053
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:31,977
[SPEAKER_16]: That, we call it a pilot program and we decided to let that run for a year so we could see all seasons rather than holding it to three months or six months and making a decision.

1054
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:34,058
[SPEAKER_16]: The year has passed.

1055
01:12:35,418 --> 01:12:36,419
[SPEAKER_16]: It is on the table.

1056
01:12:36,779 --> 01:12:38,700
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to discuss whether this is something

1057
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:46,336
[SPEAKER_16]: The city truly needs a body overlooking or issuing licenses for entertainment.

1058
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:51,461
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is something that Jim, who's the chair, will look at.

1059
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:57,426
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, I do thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.

1060
01:12:58,407 --> 01:12:59,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, just if I could.

1061
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Allen, I've known for a number of years.

1062
01:13:03,491 --> 01:13:05,153
[SPEAKER_12]: He's very active in our community.

1063
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,905
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can see, a very qualified person.

1064
01:13:08,506 --> 01:13:11,288
[SPEAKER_12]: And at this point, I would move approval, Mr. President.

1065
01:13:11,468 --> 01:13:15,570
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Musil is seconded by Councilor Marks.

1066
01:13:16,551 --> 01:13:18,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1067
01:13:19,012 --> 01:13:20,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, we can move for approval.

1068
01:13:20,173 --> 01:13:23,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's any need for us to go tell Mr. Maturana how wonderful he is.

1069
01:13:23,956 --> 01:13:24,596
[SPEAKER_07]: He already knows.

1070
01:13:25,436 --> 01:13:27,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be happy to support him this evening.

1071
01:13:27,338 --> 01:13:29,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to do the same.

1072
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:30,360
[SPEAKER_07]: He does a great job.

1073
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair, impartial, qualified, committed.

1074
01:13:33,521 --> 01:13:37,924
[SPEAKER_07]: He rounds out a great board, probably one of the best boards that we have here in the city, Mr. President, so I move for approval.

1075
01:13:38,404 --> 01:13:38,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1076
01:13:39,385 --> 01:13:40,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Fenton, did you have something?

1077
01:13:40,805 --> 01:13:41,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Likewise.

1078
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, quick question.

1079
01:13:42,386 --> 01:13:43,787
[SPEAKER_10]: This is your first time serving on the board?

1080
01:13:44,107 --> 01:13:45,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, my first three years, yes.

1081
01:13:46,048 --> 01:13:51,011
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing that it doesn't say in here, it says it expires on June 1st, 2018.

1082
01:13:52,192 --> 01:13:54,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Did your last term expire on June 1st of this year?

1083
01:13:55,033 --> 01:14:00,056
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I think it was May to May, so we're a little behind.

1084
01:14:00,576 --> 01:14:01,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1085
01:14:02,283 --> 01:14:11,111
[SPEAKER_10]: And just for the purposes of edification, do you notify the board, the city or does the city notify you about for reappointments?

1086
01:14:12,412 --> 01:14:13,633
[SPEAKER_16]: The city notified me.

1087
01:14:13,673 --> 01:14:15,634
[SPEAKER_16]: This was my first time being reappointed.

1088
01:14:15,654 --> 01:14:17,896
[SPEAKER_10]: So how did you get notified to be reappointed?

1089
01:14:18,377 --> 01:14:20,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, the city notified me through email.

1090
01:14:20,258 --> 01:14:20,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1091
01:14:20,519 --> 01:14:21,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Through an email.

1092
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:21,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1093
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:22,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1094
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:26,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, I think you're doing a great job and the board's doing a good job as well.

1095
01:14:26,403 --> 01:14:26,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1096
01:14:26,944 --> 01:14:27,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1097
01:14:27,324 --> 01:14:28,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval.

1098
01:14:28,185 --> 01:14:28,926
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

1099
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:30,427
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

1100
01:14:31,012 --> 01:14:31,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

1101
01:14:32,053 --> 01:14:32,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1102
01:14:32,493 --> 01:14:32,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Approved.

1103
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:33,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1104
01:14:34,455 --> 01:14:38,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll motion the Council of Knight to revert back to the regular order of business.

1105
01:14:39,379 --> 01:14:42,101
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have exhausted our regular business.

1106
01:14:42,161 --> 01:14:43,402
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we haven't.

1107
01:14:43,482 --> 01:14:48,727
[SPEAKER_09]: We invite petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1108
01:14:48,747 --> 01:14:48,987
[SPEAKER_09]: 15-702.

1109
01:14:49,707 --> 01:15:00,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Petition by John Veneziano, 65 Crocker Road, Medford, to announce to the citizens the Medford Chamber of Commerce is hosting the great debate

1110
01:15:00,724 --> 01:15:06,666
[SPEAKER_09]: On Thursday, October 15, 2015, at Chevalier Auditorium, doors will open at 6 p.m.

1111
01:15:07,887 --> 01:15:10,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, John Veneziano, 65 Crocker Road, Medford.

1112
01:15:10,728 --> 01:15:18,811
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, for many years I've heard the passion of this city, and now there's a great opportunity to express that passion at the polls.

1113
01:15:19,752 --> 01:15:30,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very fortunate, and we all should be, that the Medford Chamber of Commerce has allowed the Government Affairs Committee, which I chair with Don Kamara, to have a great debate this Thursday.

1114
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:40,874
[SPEAKER_05]: The doors will open at 6 o'clock to get everybody in their seats so the debate can begin and the introductions can begin at 7 o'clock promptly.

1115
01:15:41,835 --> 01:15:51,702
[SPEAKER_05]: The goal also is to televise this on your local government channel being cable I believe 22 and Verizon is I think it's 43 or 45.

1116
01:15:51,822 --> 01:16:00,088
[SPEAKER_05]: For those folks that cannot make it that evening because of children or for sickness or the elderly,

1117
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:26,138
[SPEAKER_05]: But for those of you that can make it, and those of the people that are watching, it would be great to get you into Chevalier Auditorium, not only to show your support for the candidates who are putting their hard-earned money and time in to do what they feel is necessary to keep the city moving forward, and also to get in to see Chevalier, a great opportunity, a great auditorium that we have in the city that is the sixth largest in the state.

1118
01:16:26,258 --> 01:16:28,099
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to accomplish two goals at once.

1119
01:16:28,943 --> 01:16:30,825
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, 6 o'clock, the door's open.

1120
01:16:31,265 --> 01:16:33,748
[SPEAKER_05]: At 7 o'clock, the program begins.

1121
01:16:34,288 --> 01:16:40,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And the goal is to have it all finished by 9.30 and give everyone a half hour to go home or go to the restaurant.

1122
01:16:40,634 --> 01:16:41,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate the time.

1123
01:16:41,915 --> 01:16:43,176
[SPEAKER_09]: John, thank you very much.

1124
01:16:43,397 --> 01:16:43,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1125
01:16:43,677 --> 01:16:44,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1126
01:16:44,117 --> 01:16:45,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for coming down.

1127
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:51,604
[SPEAKER_09]: We just want to be careful, folks, that we're not delventerious.

1128
01:16:51,644 --> 01:16:52,065
[SPEAKER_09]: We shouldn't.

1129
01:16:52,768 --> 01:16:56,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I just, I just, if you can clarify, John, and I appreciate your participation with this.

1130
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:59,691
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had a lot of people ask about if it's going to be televised life.

1131
01:17:00,271 --> 01:17:02,893
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know you just mentioned that it may be picked up.

1132
01:17:03,413 --> 01:17:04,673
[SPEAKER_05]: It is it right now.

1133
01:17:04,713 --> 01:17:10,656
[SPEAKER_05]: We are scheduled to go live on John Coster and a group have done a great job and making this happen.

1134
01:17:11,356 --> 01:17:18,400
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what happens with live TV and all the other things that's going to take to get it shown from, from here to Chevalier.

1135
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:18,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

1136
01:17:19,883 --> 01:17:27,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want people to be disappointed, but yes, it is scheduled to go live and also it will be taped so it can be rerun for those that miss it that evening.

1137
01:17:28,287 --> 01:17:29,288
[SPEAKER_12]: And on the government channel?

1138
01:17:29,448 --> 01:17:32,529
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.

1139
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:35,331
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be on the government channel, both Comcast and Verizon.

1140
01:17:35,891 --> 01:17:38,753
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're still going to have it webcast live.

1141
01:17:39,573 --> 01:17:41,714
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we're webcasting on a couple of links.

1142
01:17:42,414 --> 01:17:43,615
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is going to be on YouTube.

1143
01:17:44,656 --> 01:17:49,398
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we're working it out is go to the Chamber of Commerce website.

1144
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:54,218
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be two links, a general link and a backup link.

1145
01:17:54,918 --> 01:18:08,005
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did want to watch it on your tablet, your computer, or something, or something should happen to the feed, because we're getting it over here via a live web stream to here, converting it here to send it out the government channel.

1146
01:18:08,826 --> 01:18:15,970
[SPEAKER_00]: So Method of Commerce website, and there will be a link that will take you right to the place you can watch it.

1147
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:16,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

1148
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:18,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all very much.

1149
01:18:18,331 --> 01:18:18,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1150
01:18:18,691 --> 01:18:19,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1151
01:18:19,712 --> 01:18:20,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Counselor?

1152
01:18:21,243 --> 01:18:24,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I'd just like to thank Mr. Veneziano, as well as the chamber.

1153
01:18:25,065 --> 01:18:35,511
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, if we could send a acknowledgment and a congratulations to Margaret Weigel, who was just appointed by the mayor to a three-year term on the Chevalier Auditorium Commission.

1154
01:18:37,032 --> 01:18:37,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

1155
01:18:38,253 --> 01:18:39,954
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could make that as a motion, please.

1156
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:40,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1157
01:18:40,694 --> 01:18:43,416
[SPEAKER_09]: So on that motion of Councilor Camuso.

1158
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:44,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, welcome.

1159
01:18:44,877 --> 01:18:46,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1160
01:18:46,998 --> 01:18:48,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1161
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:50,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1162
01:18:50,557 --> 01:19:00,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Just while we have the folks here for the benefit of those who are here in the audience tonight and those folks who are watching home, I have a question in terms of seating.

1163
01:19:00,982 --> 01:19:06,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the Chevalier going to be opened up fully or is the number of audience members going to be limited?

1164
01:19:06,925 --> 01:19:08,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1165
01:19:11,088 --> 01:19:12,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope I have standing room only.

1166
01:19:12,909 --> 01:19:14,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1167
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:19,532
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, we're going to fill the theater from the front to the back.

1168
01:19:20,452 --> 01:19:23,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we had to open up the balcony, that would be a great issue.

1169
01:19:23,434 --> 01:19:25,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, yes, the whole theater is open.

1170
01:19:27,537 --> 01:19:27,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1171
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:31,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Madam Vice President Lugo-Curran.

1172
01:19:31,139 --> 01:19:32,280
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President de la Rousseau.

1173
01:19:33,481 --> 01:19:36,643
[SPEAKER_17]: The debate is obviously Thursday, and there's also people tonight.

1174
01:19:36,943 --> 01:19:39,925
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Vizina, I'm sorry, I just chopped your name.

1175
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:45,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Veneziano, there's people at your store making signs to get out and vote.

1176
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:48,645
[SPEAKER_17]: And they asked me, I said, oh, I think that's a great idea.

1177
01:19:48,946 --> 01:19:50,687
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish I could be there, but we have a council meeting.

1178
01:19:51,127 --> 01:19:55,970
[SPEAKER_17]: And they said just to publicize it, that make sure people get out and vote on November 3rd.

1179
01:19:56,350 --> 01:20:02,274
[SPEAKER_17]: And to also ask the city, you know, maybe we can ask through the clerk what the city is going to do to publicize the election.

1180
01:20:02,574 --> 01:20:05,036
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a complaint I got for the primary.

1181
01:20:05,096 --> 01:20:07,698
[SPEAKER_17]: People didn't even know that it was, you know, day to vote.

1182
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:14,549
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to obviously do the reverse 9-1-1, but is there any other, we're going to notify the papers, is it going to be in the paper?

1183
01:20:14,569 --> 01:20:16,370
[SPEAKER_17]: How are we going to publicize the election?

1184
01:20:21,353 --> 01:20:21,813
[SPEAKER_08]: The papers?

1185
01:20:21,933 --> 01:20:23,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, online.

1186
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:28,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're on our third robo call, I think, already.

1187
01:20:29,618 --> 01:20:31,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Just went out today.

1188
01:20:32,259 --> 01:20:36,022
[SPEAKER_17]: The Medford Community Coalition's working hard to get the

1189
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,522
[SPEAKER_17]: people are to vote to, so I wanted to make that public.

1190
01:20:40,443 --> 01:20:45,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, on that note, if the clerk would be so kind as to tell us when the last day to register to vote in the municipal election is.

1191
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:48,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Over, correct?

1192
01:20:49,592 --> 01:20:49,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow.

1193
01:20:49,972 --> 01:20:50,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow.

1194
01:20:50,493 --> 01:20:51,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Close of business tomorrow?

1195
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:54,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Close of business tomorrow.

1196
01:20:54,656 --> 01:20:54,977
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 o'clock.

1197
01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:55,237
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 o'clock.

1198
01:20:55,257 --> 01:20:55,717
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 o'clock tomorrow.

1199
01:20:55,757 --> 01:20:56,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1200
01:20:56,538 --> 01:20:59,981
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion by Councilor Camuso, all those in favor?

1201
01:21:07,313 --> 01:21:09,255
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll take matters under suspension.

1202
01:21:09,755 --> 01:21:15,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the hands of the clerk, under suspension, 15-704 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1203
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:27,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council have the Mayor and Office of Community Development contact the management of CVS in regards to its High Street property being put on the market for sale.

1204
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:28,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

1205
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:29,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1206
01:21:30,311 --> 01:21:34,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, what I've been told that the CVS property on High Street

1207
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:39,852
[SPEAKER_11]: is being marketed for sale.

1208
01:21:40,772 --> 01:21:50,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think for that store to close would be a major devastation to Meffitt Square, especially in that part.

1209
01:21:52,058 --> 01:22:06,486
[SPEAKER_11]: I request that the mayor and the OCD office get in touch with CVS to see what their plans are on that property and maybe work with them to, if possible, keep the store open.

1210
01:22:07,447 --> 01:22:09,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know it's a busy store.

1211
01:22:09,188 --> 01:22:10,929
[SPEAKER_11]: The seniors all depend on that store.

1212
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:15,272
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd say that would be a major, major hit to have that close up.

1213
01:22:15,292 --> 01:22:16,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1214
01:22:17,034 --> 01:22:21,136
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Carviello, Mr. Veniziano.

1215
01:22:21,216 --> 01:22:22,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Veniziano, 65 Crock Road, Medford.

1216
01:22:23,158 --> 01:22:29,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought this attention to the Medford Chamber of Commerce for business reasons.

1217
01:22:30,302 --> 01:22:35,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a call in my office from a downtown Boston broker asking me what I thought the highest and best use for

1218
01:22:36,356 --> 01:22:38,297
[SPEAKER_05]: 15,000 square feet on High Street would be.

1219
01:22:38,898 --> 01:22:41,239
[SPEAKER_05]: When I asked him to identify the property, he wouldn't do so.

1220
01:22:41,379 --> 01:22:55,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So through deduction of questions, it turned out to be CVS, because I looked at my computer and saw that it appeared that it just sold on September 15 for $2.5 million.

1221
01:22:56,068 --> 01:23:05,194
[SPEAKER_05]: What I can't figure out is if it's a Berkshire Hathaway Capital Investment Group who packaged a bunch of properties, or CVS bought it themselves.

1222
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:12,376
[SPEAKER_05]: The concern I have is the questions I was asked of what I thought highest and best for the area for that store would be.

1223
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:29,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked the gentleman over the phone that if he has that listing of property to do something with, that he should take a trip to Medford, take a look at what's around, and then speak with the Medford Chamber and the council, and try to get an idea what the highest and best use would be for that corner.

1224
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:34,063
[SPEAKER_05]: They try to speculate maybe a supermarket, another pharmacy,

1225
01:23:35,892 --> 01:23:40,214
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we — you know, there was mention, you know, we could go there.

1226
01:23:40,254 --> 01:23:41,255
[SPEAKER_05]: How about a trade at Joe's?

1227
01:23:41,415 --> 01:23:41,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1228
01:23:41,855 --> 01:23:43,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you got traffic issues as well.

1229
01:23:44,196 --> 01:23:45,377
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's a concern.

1230
01:23:45,417 --> 01:23:50,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to call CVS corporate office today, real estate division, and I left a message.

1231
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:58,064
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you find it imperative, I think that you should get very involved and see what's going to happen with that, Conor.

1232
01:23:58,344 --> 01:23:58,544
Okay?

1233
01:23:59,024 --> 01:23:59,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1234
01:24:04,427 --> 01:24:05,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

1235
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:10,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this is a great resolution, and I thank Councilor Caviello for bringing it forward.

1236
01:24:11,415 --> 01:24:22,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's important for us to also find out that if we're going to be talking about best and highest use, we have a discussion about the arts in our community and the effect that they have on our downtowns and revitalizing them.

1237
01:24:23,305 --> 01:24:29,550
[SPEAKER_07]: If, in fact, CVS is gone and it's going to be an impact to our neighborhood, we might be able to replace that impact with something that's going to revitalize our square.

1238
01:24:29,951 --> 01:24:35,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd ask that a home for the arts would be part of the discussion, Mr. President, moving forward.

1239
01:24:35,878 --> 01:24:38,120
[SPEAKER_09]: As amended by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1240
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:39,861
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1241
01:24:40,261 --> 01:24:41,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

1242
01:24:42,402 --> 01:24:50,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for longtime Medford resident Angelo Serboni on his recent passing.

1243
01:24:50,928 --> 01:25:02,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Angelo was a founding member of the Boston Association of the Carabinieri, which is an elite military police force in Italy.

1244
01:25:05,121 --> 01:25:10,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Serboni is the father of Phyllis, who works in our Department of Public Works office.

1245
01:25:12,587 --> 01:25:15,650
[SPEAKER_09]: If you would all join me in a moment of silence, please.

1246
01:25:27,479 --> 01:25:28,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

1247
01:25:29,301 --> 01:25:30,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1248
01:25:30,502 --> 01:25:31,943
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to announce

1249
01:25:33,165 --> 01:25:51,751
[SPEAKER_13]: This Sunday, October 18th, 2015 at 2 p.m., there's going to be the groundbreaking in the coalition AFTA that's going to feature entertainment, and it's going to be a somber day in memory of Crystal Campbell, but it's also going to be a great day.

1250
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:55,292
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the beginning of keeping her memory alive forever in our community.

1251
01:25:55,752 --> 01:26:00,073
[SPEAKER_13]: The mayor has worked very, very hard to get us to the point we're at.

1252
01:26:00,759 --> 01:26:07,700
[SPEAKER_13]: in collaboration with the Medford City Council, where there were several votes last year that were before us to move the project forward.

1253
01:26:08,281 --> 01:26:17,022
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just going to be a real nice day to keep Crystal Campbell, Lingzi Liu, Officer Collier, and Martin Richard, to keep their memories alive.

1254
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:23,404
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to just announce it's Sunday at 2 PM, right here at the corner of Riverside Ave and Ring Road.

1255
01:26:24,064 --> 01:26:25,984
[SPEAKER_13]: And everyone is invited.

1256
01:26:27,204 --> 01:26:29,205
[SPEAKER_13]: I hear the Givino sisters are going to sing.

1257
01:26:29,465 --> 01:26:29,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, they are.

1258
01:26:30,635 --> 01:26:35,517
[SPEAKER_13]: And they were beautiful the other day at Mr. Scarpelli's funeral up at St.

1259
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:36,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Francis Church.

1260
01:26:36,897 --> 01:26:39,278
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Giovino sisters, they always nail it.

1261
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:41,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Voce Angelorum.

1262
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:44,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilman.

1263
01:26:45,781 --> 01:26:50,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, in the spirit of making some announcements, Saturday the 17th,

1264
01:26:52,598 --> 01:27:00,346
[SPEAKER_07]: At 7.45 AM at the Medford Elks, Team Timothy Brennan is going to be stepping out to fight diabetes.

1265
01:27:00,426 --> 01:27:06,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we all know, Timmy was one of our firefighters here in the city of Medford and we lost him just several months ago.

1266
01:27:07,793 --> 01:27:15,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to announce that if anybody's interested in participating in the walk, to give a call down to the Elks Member Lounge and they'll be happy to sign you up.

1267
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:16,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Be there sharp.

1268
01:27:17,202 --> 01:27:19,764
[SPEAKER_07]: 745, and they'll be hitting the road at 9 o'clock.

1269
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:23,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And about 12, 31 o'clock, everybody will be back there to celebrate Timmy's life.

1270
01:27:23,786 --> 01:27:26,608
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mr. President, with that being said, I'd like to thank you for indulging me.

1271
01:27:27,048 --> 01:27:27,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Counsel.

1272
01:27:28,128 --> 01:27:28,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President.

1273
01:27:29,169 --> 01:27:30,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

1274
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:37,334
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to bring up an issue that we've talked about many times in the past with regards to the planes flying too low.

1275
01:27:37,354 --> 01:27:44,658
[SPEAKER_17]: I've received, I don't know if any other council has received complaints, but three or four complaints over the weekend in the Salem Street area.

1276
01:27:45,401 --> 01:27:49,904
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know we did ask the mayor if he appointed anybody to the board.

1277
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:57,610
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe our one position that we have has been vacant.

1278
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,493
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that a couple of councilors tried to reach out to the old board member.

1279
01:28:01,853 --> 01:28:03,254
[SPEAKER_17]: She no longer sits on the board.

1280
01:28:03,734 --> 01:28:08,298
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we could send that to the mayor's office again with regards to the planes.

1281
01:28:09,172 --> 01:28:21,078
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved on to suspension by Vice President Longo Kern that the mayor appoint someone to the advisory board to Logan Airport in Massport.

1282
01:28:21,638 --> 01:28:26,840
[SPEAKER_09]: And furthermore, that he report back to the council on his progress in that matter.

1283
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:28,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1284
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:34,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think it's creating a disruption of the quiet enjoyment of the Salem Street neighborhood as of lately.

1285
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:37,495
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it was Gaston Street for a while there.

1286
01:28:37,755 --> 01:28:39,616
[SPEAKER_17]: I know my neighborhood got hit.

1287
01:28:40,056 --> 01:28:42,298
[SPEAKER_17]: It wakes you up from a dead sleep.

1288
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:53,903
[SPEAKER_17]: And to go to neighborhood to neighborhood, it's just unfortunate and something that we need to really look into, which would be much help to have somebody that we can talk to from the board.

1289
01:28:54,444 --> 01:29:02,648
[SPEAKER_17]: So hopefully the new mayor or the current mayor will appoint somebody so that we can get some headway on that.

1290
01:29:06,746 --> 01:29:15,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Mr. President, I believe we received inquiries from some citizens as it relates to cats in the city of Medford.

1291
01:29:15,168 --> 01:29:20,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And since we have a dog officer, is it possible that we can get a report back either from him or for the board of public health?

1292
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:33,933
[SPEAKER_10]: If there are any type of audiences that reflect upon responsibility of cats, if in fact they leave their domestic homes and who they're, you know, the people out there to take care of them.

1293
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:38,171
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, could we get a report back on just where are we on the dog park?

1294
01:29:38,191 --> 01:29:41,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we really haven't heard anything as to where we're going.

1295
01:29:42,393 --> 01:29:44,213
[SPEAKER_10]: This has just been months hanging around.

1296
01:29:44,233 --> 01:29:58,418
[SPEAKER_09]: At the administration, we pulled back to the council vis-a-vis efforts by the animal control officer in dealing with cats and- For- Yeah, where are we with the dog park?

1297
01:29:59,287 --> 01:30:00,628
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1298
01:30:00,648 --> 01:30:00,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1299
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:01,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

1300
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:03,771
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

1301
01:30:03,951 --> 01:30:08,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Records handed to September 6th, October 6th, handed to the Vice President.

1302
01:30:09,075 --> 01:30:11,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Vice President, how did you find those records?

1303
01:30:11,377 --> 01:30:12,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I find them in order and I move approval.

1304
01:30:12,878 --> 01:30:15,881
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion for approval by Vice President Legold-Kern, all those in favor?

1305
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:16,581
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1306
01:30:17,702 --> 01:30:18,783
[SPEAKER_09]: The records are approved.

1307
01:30:19,243 --> 01:30:20,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn by Council Night.

1308
01:30:20,865 --> 01:30:21,565
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1309
01:30:21,585 --> 01:30:22,266
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1310
01:30:22,806 --> 01:30:24,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Meeting adjourned.

1311
01:30:24,468 --> 01:30:24,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
