1
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:36,564
We are good to go on the tech side of things.

2
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:03,322
We'll give everyone just like another half a minute here to jump on and then we'll get started.

3
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,320
Okay.

4
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:15,942
Welcome, everybody.

5
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:29,230
Please be advised that there will be a virtual full committee meeting of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee on Monday, December 22nd at 630, held via remote participation only.

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:38,415
The meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools' YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable channel, which is Comcast 98 or 22.

7
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,502
and Verizon Channel 43, 45, or 47.

8
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:47,523
This meeting will be recorded.

00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:53,406
Participants can log in or call in using the following meeting ID and Zoom, which is 941-0559-9107.

10
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:11,531
Okay, before I call the roll, I did just want to make a quick announcement and welcome Paul Malone to the building committee.

11
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:18,956
Paul has joined us by vote of the school committee in our last school committee meeting.

12
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:20,337
Welcome Paul.

13
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,412
And he is replacing Tracy keen, who has stepped down from the committee.

14
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:35,317
So we'll get to learn more about Paul, but he is a theater nerd, much like Tracy and is super excited to be able to lend his theater.

15
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:38,258
and performing arts talents to the group.

16
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:38,918
So welcome.

17
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:44,480
And Paul, I know this will be like a lot for you to take in tonight.

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,141
I don't expect a lot of voting, but you are voting members.

19
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:52,023
So there are times that we'll call on you and ask you to weigh in on something.

20
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:52,724
And if you're not.

21
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:04,989
And we will keep working to get you on boarded despite the holiday season sort of jump jumping into the middle of this process.

22
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:05,749
So welcome.

23
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:11,264
Um, to you, I am going to call the roll to get started.

24
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:15,665
Um, and I think we have a quorum here that I see.

25
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:18,706
So, um, let's go ahead and give it a shot.

26
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:19,866
Jenny Graham here.

27
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,927

28
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:26,968
Dr. Glucy is absent.

29
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:28,968
Marta Cabral here.

30
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,950
Marta here.

31
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:37,036
Am I not coming through?

32
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:37,696
Libby Brown.

33
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:39,398
Oh, there you are.

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:41,840
Hi.

35
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,260
Can you hear me?

36
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:44,302
Hi.

37
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:44,862
Hi, Libby.

38
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:45,623
Hi.

39
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,524
Marissa Desmond.

40
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:51,208
I don't see Marissa yet.

41
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:52,009
OK.

42
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:52,769
Brian Hilliard.

43
00:03:52,789 --> 00:04:01,437
I'm here.

44
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:02,358
Maria Dorsey.

45
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:09,108
Oh.

46
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:21,719
Maria is not here.

47
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:25,783
Emily Lazaro.

48
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:28,385
Here.

49
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:31,208
Emily.

50
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:33,169

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:33,970
Here.

52
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:40,002

53
00:04:40,022 --> 00:05:02,646
We have Aaron.

54
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,007
I mean, I saw him briefly,

55
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,034
But okay, Luke prisoner.

56
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:24,466
I think that I am having a lagging issue.

57
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:26,409
So give me just 1 2nd to see if I can.

58
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:32,787
sort that on my end because I think it's me and not all of you now that I'm realizing what's happening.

59
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:33,908
So give me one second.

60
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:40,132
Jenny, I'm not hearing anybody say yes either except I heard Marta and Libby, but I didn't hear anybody else.

61
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,358
Must be Zoom's new update.

62
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:50,780
They just pushed to the world for our meeting.

63
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,886
Will, I'm going to jump on my phone.

64
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:11,087
OK.

65
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:46,958

120
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:13,130
Okay, thanks for bearing with me.

121
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:18,574
Apparently my internet has decided enough is enough and the holidays are upon us.

122
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:29,142
So with that said, I'm going to turn it over to Matt Galeno to lead us through the agenda since I'm hoping he has better service than I do.

123
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:32,344
Sure, thank you Jenny.

124
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:38,248
Do we have the presentation to pull up?

125
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:39,229
Thank you Matt.

126
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:40,350
Give me one minute.

127
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,051
All right, so we have a few quick administrative items to run through.

128
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:53,052
We should be able to get through these fairly quickly.

129
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:58,053
First will be the approval of the November 24th, 2025 SPC meeting minutes.

130
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:07,496
Can you go to the next slide, Matt?

131
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:08,356
Yeah.

132
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:11,997
All righty.

133
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:20,419
Do we have a motion to approve the meeting minutes from November 24th, 2025?

134
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:29,205
Motion to approve.

135
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:32,847
Second.

136
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:39,812
Member Graham has asked that I take the roll, but I just realized that I don't have the list of who to call.

137
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,531
Chair Graham, excuse me.

138
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:44,413
Sorry, can I just ask a question?

139
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:45,373
Were the minutes sent out?

140
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:50,978
I don't remember receiving them.

141
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:56,062
They were on the agenda, Ken.

142
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:57,123
Oh, you're on the agenda.

143
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:57,643
Okay, thanks.

144
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:02,467
Let me, oh, there we go.

145
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:03,248
I got the list now.

146
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:05,693
Thank you, Paul.

147
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:06,474
That's good.

148
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,240
Matt, this is Jenny.

149
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,162
Were the minutes sent out?

150
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,764
I don't remember receiving them either.

151
00:10:16,786 --> 00:10:18,589
Yes, they were attached with the agenda.

152
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,788
I, I, sorry, I didn't see an agenda either.

153
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:36,769
Unless it was attached to an invite.

154
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,290
Anybody else get it?

155
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,451
Should have gone out last Thursday.

156
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:54,233
If we, if we need to push the approval of the minutes to the next meeting.

157
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:57,954
To give the committee more time to to review.

158
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:04,137
motion to table the minutes until the next meeting.

159
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:05,138
Is there a second?

160
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:06,478
Second.

161
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:09,119
All right.

162
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,620
We're on Zoom, so we're going to do a roll call.

163
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,900
Jenny Graham.

164
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:21,802
And I don't know if she can even vote.

165
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:23,723
But anyways, I'll move on.

166
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:24,543
Mayor Lungo Kern.

167
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:25,563

Okay, Luke Prisner, I think Luke is not here either.

186
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:04,873
Joan Bowen?

187
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:05,734
Yes.

188
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:08,474
Ken Lord?

189
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:10,335
Ken, you're voting, right?

190
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:11,355
Yes, yes.

191
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,075
Okay, good, sorry.

192
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:18,736
And then I'm just scrolling through the folks that are... Okay, that's it, I think.

193
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:26,098
So however many that was, so the minutes are tabled to the next meeting.

194
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:30,542
Okay, thank you, Paul.

195
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:37,664
The next agenda item we have is the approval of the November 2025 invoices.

196
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:48,226
We still only have the OPM services for this month, just based on the timing of the designer contract execution and the kickoff with the MSBA.

197
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:52,887
We will see SMMA's first invoice next month.

198
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:56,188
So we just have the agreed upon $25,000 for left field

199
00:12:58,957 --> 00:12:59,577
month of November 2025.

200
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:10,603
And will the invoice be approved as submitted?

201
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:10,983
Second.

202
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:13,805
Excellent.

203
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:14,925
I'm glad this is recorded.

204
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:19,067
Any other questions or concerns?

205
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:21,429
All right.

206
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:22,369
I'll take the roll.

207
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:22,869
Jenny Graham.

208
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,765
I don't know if Jenny can even, is Jenny here?

209
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,425
Yes.

210
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,927
Oh, she is, sorry.

211
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:31,128
Mary Lynn Goker.

212
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:32,149
Yes.

213
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:33,710
Marta Cabral.

214
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:34,431
Yes.

215
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:35,552
Libby Brown.

216
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:36,713
Yes.

217
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:39,115
Brian Hillion.

218
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:40,015
Yes.

219
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:41,877
Paul Malone.

220
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:43,378
Yes.

221
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:44,559
Emily Lazaro.

222
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:45,940
Yes.

223
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,181
Nicole Morrell.

224
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:47,882
Yes.

225
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:51,165
here.

226
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:52,206
Let me know when you're here.

227
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:55,448
And so I can remember to call you, um, Joan Bowen?

228
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:56,409
Yes.

229
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:57,889
And Ken Lord?

230
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:58,690
Yes.

231
00:13:59,631 --> 00:13:59,891
All right.

232
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:00,851
The ayes have it.

233
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:02,272
The invoice is approved.

234
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:04,313
Next.

235
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:07,775
I wasn't prepared to run a meeting.

236
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:08,096
Sorry.

237
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:10,617
You're doing great, Paul.

238
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:10,997
Thank you.

239
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:15,720
And this is just a quick update on the total project budget.

240
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:29,687
So the only updates from last month, we have now inserted the A&E feasibility study schematic design, executed contract values, including the environmental and site in the other category.

241
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:39,410
So we are submitting just a budgetary correction with the MSBA just to make sure that they have the correct contract values.

242
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,992
And as we continue to build towards these, we'll update this every month.

243
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,884
and obviously we'll see a bit more billing as SMMA starts to send invoices starting in the new year.

244
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:58,687
Any questions on where we stand on total project budget right now?

245
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:06,511
Alrighty.

246
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:14,375
The rest of the meeting that we want to focus on

247
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:22,242
reviewing everything that the project team has been doing over the course of the past month since we met with you last.

248
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:43,814
The team has been working along with the district very quickly, but meeting a lot and really kind of getting through some of the early preliminary investigations, both in the school, around the site, and as well as meeting to talk about the educational program.

249
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:47,868
and how that feeds into the space summary.

250
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:55,873
So tonight, we'll take you through some of the existing conditions investigations that have been ongoing.

251
00:15:56,713 --> 00:16:13,223
And then we'll talk about the current space summary based on our meetings with some of the administration, understanding what the existing school is currently sized to and how that relates to the MSBA guidelines.

252
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:21,136
I will just remind everybody that this space summary that will be seen tonight is very much a work in progress.

253
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:31,620
This will be continued to kind of shift and kind of be pushed and pulled and massaged through the PDP and then into the next phase of PSR.

254
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,281
So just keep that in mind as we start to review some of these documents.

255
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:40,483
They will continue to change as the project continues.

256
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:47,451
I'll hand it over to Matt Rice from SMMA to take a look at the existing conditions.

257
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:54,838
And just before that happens, I just want to note that Aaron Olopade is present for whoever is lucky enough to transcribe the minutes later.

258
00:16:57,895 --> 00:16:58,655
Thank you, Matt.

259
00:16:58,715 --> 00:16:59,235
Thank you, Paul.

260
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,936
And thank you for introducing me, Matt.

261
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:05,237
I was just going to make a quick note at the beginning for Paul's benefit.

262
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:14,900
Paul Malone, new here, just asked that our team maybe introduce themselves before they are speaking.

263
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,961
And just so that everyone can put a name to a face as we go forward.

264
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:22,422
There are some new faces, I think, as well for the entirety of the building committee.

265
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:24,263
So good to just introduce everybody as we go.

266
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:32,434
I will jump in on the architecture building investigation to start with.

267
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:40,838
And before I do that I will mention here that we have been referencing the SOI submission.

268
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:54,005
So I think if we went back to meetings, I recall a comment that was made asking about sort of what benefit the SOI evaluation was and sort of all the effort that went into that was in terms of this overall process.

269
00:17:54,925 --> 00:18:02,670
And I can say that both on the architectural side as well as the engineering disciplines have reviewed that SOI documentation in detail.

270
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:10,174
It was very well done in terms of being comprehensive, in terms of painting the picture of need that exists at Medford High School.

271
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:15,928
and it was very effective in terms of moving the project along at the phase that it was.

272
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:30,253
We have taken it to the next level in terms of evaluation and analysis of those existing conditions, but definitely having a great foundation to build from in terms of that reference information was appreciated and useful in terms of the overall process.

273
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:54,652
So we are going to try and keep things relatively brief here, because we could talk a while about some of the shortcomings in the existing building, but really what we want to do here is just give you an overview of the areas where we have sort of the largest concern, items of note, items that really suggest that the building needs to be addressed in some way, shape, or form.

274
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:56,333
as we move forward.

275
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:10,347
So just starting from the exterior of the building, the fact that the original materials on the exterior, the cast in place concrete, the brick masonry veneer, most of these are original to the building.

276
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:15,593
There are some areas of selective renovations that have occurred on the exterior, such as with the science wing.

277
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:21,235
and some replacement of windows, but the vast majority are existing as they were originally installed in 1970.

278
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:36,600
So as one could expect, there's various challenges there, especially with the thermal performance of those exterior systems, the windows that are non-thermally broken and are transferring a lot of heat out of the building.

279
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:45,288
As well as the cowl wall panels, these are the translucent panels that wrap the exterior of the pool and the gymnasium building.

280
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:46,550
They have yellowed over time.

281
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:55,559
You can see that there are areas where certain panels have actually delaminated off the exterior and you can see the inner construction of those panels.

282
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,681
So a lot of challenges there.

283
00:19:58,662 --> 00:20:01,604
The exterior wall construction does not have any thermal insulation.

284
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:10,471
There's some interesting sand that is called for in between the exterior brick and the concrete, which is not something we've seen before, and I don't think it's a great thermal insulator.

285
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:19,898
So there's really no restriction of heat moving in and out of those exterior walls other than sort of the thermal mass behavior of them.

286
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:37,914
On the roofs, there are areas, large areas of ponding that are present across the entirety of the roof, both that which was re-roofed back in 2001, which is everything aside from the B wing, and then the B wing itself, even where they have the more recent

287
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:40,397
roof membrane installed.

288
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:52,482
There are some still evidence of areas of ponding there as well as leaks and the leaks are present and something that the maintenance department is really working to address on an ongoing basis throughout.

289
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:55,644
So that's an ongoing maintenance issue.

290
00:20:56,684 --> 00:21:17,031
The pool roof membrane and the deck is something that's worth noting in particular because of the interior climate conditions of the pool itself that it generates just from the fact that it is a pool and the fact that there are exhaust challenges in terms of getting that air out of the pool space itself.

291
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:22,636
which has led to some delamination of the roof membrane at the pool.

292
00:21:22,796 --> 00:21:30,423
And very recently, there's had to been put in some mechanical fastener bars to keep that roof membrane from actually blowing off.

293
00:21:31,204 --> 00:21:36,409
And this is sort of an imminent challenge right now that definitely is being patched together.

294
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:45,538
on sort of an emergency basis until we can renovate or demolish the pool building that's yet to be seen.

295
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:50,263
But there's certainly a challenge on the pool roof deck itself and the roof membrane.

296
00:21:51,667 --> 00:22:21,297
And then in terms of the interior of the building, much of that interior construction is, again, original from the 1970s vintage of the building, with the exception of that science lab renovation on the third floor of the B wing, as well as some other smaller scale renovations that have occurred throughout, such as at the Medford Community Media Space, as well as some of the CTE spaces that were renovated over the course of time to adapt to new programs and some of the construction that were done by the actual CTE programs

297
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:21,797
themselves.

298
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:49,615
The condition of the interior finishes is again in sort of a fair to poor condition at the current time just due to the overall wear and tear that occurs on interior finishes in a school environment as well as moisture infiltration on those roof links, pipe leaks as well in terms of various localized areas where mitigation remediation has had to take place.

299
00:22:56,581 --> 00:23:00,184
I think Ellen Swanson is not able to unmute.

300
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:01,946
She is our structural engineer.

301
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:04,147
I don't know if that's something on your end, Will.

302
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,450
You should be OK right about now.

303
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,051
OK, thank you.

304
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:10,752
Ellen.

305
00:23:13,995 --> 00:23:15,937
Hi, I'm Ellen Swanson.

306
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:19,479
I'm the structural engineer for the project from SMMA.

307
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:27,483
Big things to consider with the project is that there are very limited existing structural drawings.

308
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:33,765
Currently right now, we have only been able to have wing B be available to us.

309
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:48,288
Most of our observations or most of our considerations for the project are interpolating information we have seen from the current drawings that we have in hand to potentially apply them to the rest of the wings.

310
00:23:50,100 --> 00:24:01,703
The foundations of the project, they're spread footings on bedrock with conventional slab on grade in the majority of the places and in the majority of the project.

311
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:14,387
We believe there are some isolated locations where there is a framed slab where the bedrock is lower, where there is some original quarry areas that they were infilled.

312
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:19,125
There is a mix of structural systems in the project.

313
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:26,091
Most of the classroom wings you can see in the photo, in the top photo, is a typical concrete framing.

314
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:34,538
It's a one-way concrete slab supported on concrete, exposed concrete beams and concrete columns.

315
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:41,885
There's also steel joist and steel wide flange beams and the gym pool and G&H wings.

316
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:53,003
One big consideration structurally is that there is no conventional lateral force resisting system in the building.

317
00:24:54,203 --> 00:25:04,448
The original drawings indicate a very minimal wind loading that would not meet today's current code prescribed wind loads.

318
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:11,472
The existing drawings also do not indicate that earthquake design was considered

319
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:14,576
as well as no drift loads were not considered.

320
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,901
Each of the wings are separated by three quarter inch expansion joints.

321
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:31,549
This expansion joint would not meet the required gap between isolated buildings with today's current code.

322
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:38,675
During our walkthrough, we also observed a few structural deficiencies.

323
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:41,697
You can see in the middle photo,

324
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:47,635
There's exposed rebar on the underside of the pool deck.

325
00:25:49,036 --> 00:26:01,501
Our understanding is that the majority of the pool deck was redone at some point, but there are still some areas that have significant spalling with exposed rebar.

326
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:09,725
The infill masonry walls in the classrooms, you can kind of see it in the top photo,

327
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:15,736
They do not have any sort of seismic bracing to them at the top of the wall.

328
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:19,558
They're also not positively attached to the concrete beams either.

329
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:36,668
The bottom photo shows one area in wing C where the slab on grade has settled, and there's a pretty significant gap between the slab on grade and the infill wall.

330
00:26:38,843 --> 00:26:45,415
There were also multiple areas where there were miscellaneous cracks in the concrete and the masonry walls.

331
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:51,025
And also there was water damage observed in many of the classrooms.

332
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,464
All right, and I will take the accessibility observations.

333
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:17,256
So challenges on the exterior from an accessibility standpoint that there, even in the accessible parking spaces, the slope of the pavement is, in many cases, noncompliant.

334
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:21,939
And then the signage, also noncompliant in terms of identifying those accessible spaces.

335
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:39,248
Accessible routes while on site have areas of noncompliance, both again in terms of slope or cross slope, and the inclusion of stairs in terms of certain paths to doors.

336
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:42,670
Several of the stairs do lack compliant handrails.

337
00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:51,235
Again, the majority of the public entrances have some amount of barriers in terms of wheelchair access, either with steps

338
00:27:52,355 --> 00:28:02,104
door landings or the doors themselves being too narrow or lacking a proper wheelchair turning radius on the inside or the exterior of the door.

339
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:09,671
And then in terms of the passenger loading zones at drop-off areas being accessible, those are not provided.

340
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:23,590
From the interior of the building from an accessibility standpoint, the stairs all lack currently compliant handrails as well as nosing on the edge of the tread of the stair down to the riser.

341
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:30,155
The majority of the doors on the interior as well are too narrow in terms of wheelchair clearance.

342
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:39,822
They have knob versus lever door hardware, and also that maneuvering clearances to make sure that there's adequate space on the push side and the pull side of the doors.

343
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:48,046
The classroom sinks themselves are inaccessible, so they don't have knee space that would allow wheelchair users to use them.

344
00:28:49,927 --> 00:29:00,297
The batting cages, in particular, portions of the auditorium in one of the classrooms do not have any accessible route to them, so they are inaccessible to users that are in a wheelchair.

345
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:07,417
Most of the toilet rooms are inaccessible, which is something we actually heard walking around the building as well.

346
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:19,105
Even the toilet rooms that are marked as being accessible, the turning dimensions within those toilet rooms do not actually provide sufficient space to deem them compliant and accessible.

347
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:29,651
And in terms of the bathing fixtures, showering fixtures within the locker rooms, there are no compliant options for users.

348
00:29:30,817 --> 00:29:36,259
And then lastly, the auditorium itself does not have enough of the compliant wheelchair spaces.

349
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:42,561
There's not an assistive listening system within that space for users to make use of.

350
00:29:43,522 --> 00:29:46,683
And then the ramp up onto the stage is not compliant.

351
00:29:54,747 --> 00:29:55,327
Hi, everyone.

352
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:56,688
My name is Emily Ehlers.

353
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,249
I'll be the mechanical engineer on the project.

354
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:05,071
So in terms of the existing HVAC system, overall, it's a hydronic system.

355
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:08,793
It's a low pressure steam to hot water distribution.

356
00:30:10,253 --> 00:30:21,598
With exception to select spaces like the TV studio and the recently renovated science wing, there's limited centralized cooling throughout.

357
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:41,371
The overall mechanical control system is all pneumatic, so it's very outdated and it doesn't leave the facilities team with a central control system where they can get access to set points, schedules, and any alerts from the systems.

358
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,084
There's unreliable air quality and ventilation from the existing units that are in place.

359
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:56,550
There have been select upgrades over the past 20 years, but most of the major equipment is still original to the 1970 building.

360
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:06,627
In most of the classrooms and the exterior spaces, there are unit ventilators.

361
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:13,953
These units are pretty antiquated in the industry and they are pretty disruptive from an acoustic standpoint.

362
00:31:14,654 --> 00:31:20,359
And they can also deliver uneven temperatures and uneven ventilation to the classrooms.

363
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:32,531
So in summary, most of the major equipment and the distribution for the HVAC systems is past its operable lifespan and will not meet current codes.

364
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:41,814
Hi, my name is James Joe from McColl Engineering, the plumbing and fire protection engineers.

365
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:50,317
Regarding plumping, especially the cast iron piping is mostly rusted and in poor condition.

366
00:31:51,429 --> 00:32:03,194
Also, the original copper piping is original to the building and it might have the joints where all has lead in it.

367
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:06,095
So that's one thing to look into.

368
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:13,714
Like you heard earlier, the plumbing fissures are mostly outdated and does not meet any accessibility codes.

369
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:23,019
And the other thing we noticed was that the main water supply coming into the building does not have a backflow preventer for cross-contamination protection.

370
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,219
Also,

371
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:34,923
the more preceptors and the janitor thinks they lack a by-pro prevention for soap dispensers, which is a core requirement.

372
00:32:36,444 --> 00:32:45,569
The kitchen, the gas supply requires an automatic shutdown with manual reset, with CO detectors are needed there too.

373
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,451
Also, in the kitchen,

374
00:32:49,195 --> 00:33:03,845
Three-part sink has a grease interceptor, but the floor drains and all that, those things are not connected to any internal grease interceptors, and that's a requirement by code nowadays.

375
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:09,950
Then if you go to fire protection, the building is pretty much

376
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:26,190
Unsprinkled, it's up for the 2015 renovation, science room renovation in the third floor of building B, and the 2016 MATV renovation, especially in the culinary kitchen area, that side.

377
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,891
There is no standpipes in the building.

378
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:34,115
With the building being so huge, standpipes will be required.

379
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,521
Hi, my name is Andrew Barrows.

380
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,963
I am the electrical engineer on the project with SOMA.

381
00:33:48,664 --> 00:34:00,952
The building is equipped with three electrical substations and the majority of the electrical panels within the building, aside from the 2015 renovation, is beyond their useful life expectancy.

382
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:10,298
They are older Westinghouse substations and subsequent distribution panels are in various manufacturers.

383
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:23,155
The electrical services that are actually entering the building are also not surge protected and GFI protected, which is a requirement for the electrical code.

384
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:39,204
The building is also equipped with two emergency generators that are noted to be non-functional, which is a large code violation with the building, and you will not have any emergency backup power.

385
00:34:40,248 --> 00:34:51,814
The building is also not equipped with lightning protection, which is typically a recommendation depending on location and whether it's the highest point, if the building has the highest point in the area.

386
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:58,538
Lighting is a mix of mostly LED and some fluorescent.

387
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:05,101
The light controls also do not meet current codes for energy efficiencies.

388
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:16,503
The fire alarm and smoke detector coverage is also in sparse, especially when the building is mostly unsprinkled, except for in the 2015 renovation.

389
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:25,208
And the fire alarm is not equipped with a voice evacuation system, which is also a requirement.

390
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:29,151
Is Frank here to speak on AV and telecom?

391
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:34,124
It's not, Andrew, but if you'd like to touch on those briefly.

392
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:35,885
Yeah, I can read them off.

393
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:44,989
The instructional AV systems lack standards, rely on mobile solutions, outdated tech, minimal video conferencing, and does not support collaborative learning.

394
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:54,545
The telecom is also outdated and constrained in the MDF, IDF rooms, and the legacy cabling cannot meet current or future bandwidth for today's tech needs.

395
00:35:55,205 --> 00:36:01,228
The Wi-Fi system is also unreliable when used by full student population due to capacity issues.

396
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:20,077
And I think we'll just, yeah, just note here that security system wise, our consultant, Good Harbor Techmark, did also survey the building along with the architects and engineers on the team and made the observations listed on the right side of the slide.

397
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:35,280
And I will say for those of you who are curious about more existing condition information, the back of the slide deck, we have an appendix section where you can dig into some more detail and see some beautiful photos.

398
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,205
Okay, hi everyone.

399
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:47,207
My name is Rosemary Park and I am an educational planner and architect with SMMA.

400
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:55,915
So I'll be reviewing the status of the space summary and program with you.

401
00:36:57,436 --> 00:37:07,281
So, but just before we go over the status on the space summary, we did want to just review the work and process that we followed to help develop it.

402
00:37:08,622 --> 00:37:17,247
So this diagram illustrates that process with each of the steps in green contributing to help shape the overall program and

403
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,611
summary of spaces at MSBA template that we reviewed last time.

404
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:33,713
So along with the existing conditions assessment that our team just went over and the programming meetings that we conducted last month, we've also analyzed the curriculum and schedule.

405
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:39,554
We held visioning sessions and school tours over the past few weeks.

406
00:37:41,654 --> 00:37:47,155
We have been reviewing the Medford High School educational plan, which is still being worked on and developed

407
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,248
And we also held our first set of advisory team meetings.

408
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:56,752
So again, each of those does contribute to the summary of spaces.

409
00:37:58,773 --> 00:38:08,259
And I put a little star there, I guess I should have, I could have made it bigger, I guess, because it's a pretty big milestone that we've completed all of our investigative work and analysis.

410
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:16,264
So since we are still developing a space summary, we are continuing to refine it

411
00:38:17,313 --> 00:38:24,395
And there are arrows that indicate that it's constantly, this is an iterative process.

412
00:38:25,075 --> 00:38:39,278
I've said it before, but it really is not ever, it's not a one and done type process where we just develop the program and just get final sign off.

413
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:45,219
It is a constant discussion and confirmation

414
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:53,012
that cycles through with the district and with the school.

415
00:38:54,412 --> 00:39:10,917
Um, but once we do get, uh, that confirmation to, to move on, um, we do develop these, um, program adjacency diagrams, uh, using the input also from the, um, programming meetings and the visioning sessions.

416
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:21,300
Um, and these diagrams will actually, uh, help the design team in, um, with, uh, by informing the building massing and the space planning.

417
00:39:25,716 --> 00:39:32,242
So last month, we introduced the MSBA template for the program space summary.

418
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:47,998
As I said, we've just recently completed the visioning on the educational goals, and we're currently working through and coordinating all of the various things that we've heard regarding the educational vision.

419
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:55,801
So what, you know, and also again, parsing through the educational plan.

420
00:39:57,181 --> 00:40:18,130
And so as we completed the existing program assessment, we were able to compare the overall existing square footages, net and gross, per space category and how they would compare and line up against what the MSBA and DESE guidelines recommend.

421
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:30,833
And so here and we won't touch on every single category here, but the ones that I really we did want to focus on.

422
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:38,735
So with special education, this is an area that's pretty much always customized to meet the unique needs of the district in the school.

423
00:40:40,095 --> 00:40:46,037
So even though the MSBA and DESE guidelines category appears small.

424
00:40:48,018 --> 00:40:48,838
We know that.

425
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:59,582
this is going to get larger in the proposed just because we're going to be we're going to be providing whatever it is that those programs are going to need.

426
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:10,829
And so typically MSBA or MSBA doesn't really provide much guidance on that because they do look to the district to explain the needs for special education.

427
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,812
Under vocational and technology.

428
00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:15,872
So

429
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:33,973
This includes not only the chapter 74 ACT program spaces, but it also includes these non-chapter, non-chapter 74 programs for STEM and tech labs.

430
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:40,096
So these are things like maker spaces or fab labs, fabrication labs.

431
00:41:40,777 --> 00:41:45,660
And so that is a separate line item pulled out

432
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:48,311
from this category.

433
00:41:49,152 --> 00:42:09,560
And then with the Chapter 74 CTE programs, because DESE assumes the right sizing of the existing shops and the support spaces, like the related classrooms or other types of changing areas, perhaps, and DESE will also assume that the

434
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:22,301
the right sizing of future expansion of not only existing CTE programs, but also the addition and implementation of new CTE programs too.

435
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:32,109
So that's why you can see that category is considerably larger than what is in the existing building today.

436
00:42:34,651 --> 00:42:37,974
Under health and PE, so the existing here,

437
00:42:40,203 --> 00:42:47,646
We know this, that the existing Medford High School gym and the ALT PE spaces, they're large.

438
00:42:49,187 --> 00:43:09,375
And so if you look at that compared to what the MSBA would suggest if you were to build those spaces new, what you have currently today is much larger than what MSBA would

439
00:43:10,144 --> 00:43:11,705
would suggest or allow.

440
00:43:13,326 --> 00:43:23,514
And then with the auditorium and drama, this is the baseline in the MSB and DESI guidelines.

441
00:43:23,754 --> 00:43:28,037
That baseline is for 750 seats in an auditorium.

442
00:43:29,078 --> 00:43:34,322
But we know that from our discussions that

443
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:39,591
Medford is looking for a 1,000 seat auditorium.

444
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:46,232
But that is just the baseline that the MSBA provides in their space summary template.

445
00:43:46,973 --> 00:44:00,896
Under the dining and food service, so per MSBA's guidelines, we have to size the cafeteria to accommodate three lunch seatings.

446
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:05,537
And we know that today there are two lunch seatings currently.

447
00:44:06,127 --> 00:44:07,808
um, at the high school.

448
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:21,056
So you, that does account for, um, the fact that the existing high school's dining, um, square footage is appearing larger than the MSBA one.

449
00:44:23,318 --> 00:44:27,720
With the... Rosemary, can I ask a quick question before you move on from that?

450
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:28,141
Sure.

451
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:34,865
Um, so, I mean, we'd have to redo the entire schedule to

452
00:44:36,155 --> 00:44:36,395
Add.

453
00:44:37,316 --> 00:44:39,758
Yes.

454
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:49,425
Another is that saying is MSBA saying we actually have to change the students schedule and renegotiate every contract to have three seatings?

455
00:44:51,747 --> 00:44:51,967
Yes.

456
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,430
We have to size.

457
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:02,355
We have to size it to three, which makes it smaller and we we know I was I was.

458
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:06,966
I was hesitant to bring it up initially to the staff.

459
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:21,031
I mean, you have to, but to the administration, but yes, the administration is aware and we've been having, I know that, you know, it's, there are just, you know, initial,

460
00:45:23,615 --> 00:45:26,277
initial wonderings about how that's going to work.

461
00:45:26,317 --> 00:45:30,300
But again, we've got four years to work it out.

462
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:35,363
Another override for another expansion of the school day and renegotiating with the teacher.

463
00:45:35,383 --> 00:45:36,183
That just looks great.

464
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:41,187
I'm sorry, I don't want to be the bringer of bad news.

465
00:45:42,457 --> 00:45:45,359
We just spent the longest year of our lives getting that all done.

466
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:47,019
So, okay, I'm sorry.

467
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,041
I really, I really, I really sympathize.

468
00:45:50,121 --> 00:45:50,421
I do.

469
00:45:50,441 --> 00:45:53,303
I was like, I have to be the one to tell them.

470
00:45:53,323 --> 00:46:01,667
At least this will be the new, a new contract, you know, because it'll be three years away or more.

471
00:46:01,687 --> 00:46:04,609
Right.

472
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:17,942
So under administration and guidance, just wanted to note that this is strictly for the high schools administration, not central office.

473
00:46:17,982 --> 00:46:20,923
Central office would actually fall under the other category.

474
00:46:23,344 --> 00:46:33,890
And that other category, in addition to central office, also does include the pool and the other programs that are not

475
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:37,334
not really associated with the high school.

476
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:42,158
So you've got the Medford Family Network, the Kids Corner, Medford Community Media.

477
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:55,170
And so we know that this will expand a little bit because there's another program, MEAP, that'll eventually be moving into the new school.

478
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,052
So that would fall under the other category as well.

479
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:14,947
And so you can see under that other category, we do have the net floor area in totals against the existing, against the MSBA and DESE.

480
00:47:15,027 --> 00:47:20,870
This is all based on the proposed enrollment of 1,395 students.

481
00:47:22,971 --> 00:47:27,973
And then when we look at the overall gross building areas,

482
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:30,370
Um, we know the existing.

483
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:37,092
And so therefore, we were able to figure out the grossing factor of 1.54.

484
00:47:38,593 --> 00:47:52,058
And as we continue, as we continue confirming some of I think there are some some spaces within the existing building that are still being confirmed a little bit because the existing conditions was out doing all the scanning.

485
00:47:52,818 --> 00:47:57,980
So that grossing factor might, you know, shift tiny bit, but it's

486
00:47:58,777 --> 00:48:00,597
it's pretty much at 1.5 for today.

487
00:48:02,198 --> 00:48:11,000
And then MSBA requires us to carry a 1.5 grossing factor for the building.

488
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:27,943
And so if we were to take their net square footage that they are outlining, which we know is not gonna be sufficient for what the school needs, and apply that 1.5 grossing factor, then we will come to that number

489
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:28,920
at the bottom.

490
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:33,402
So smaller, that would be considerably smaller than what you have today.

491
00:48:34,043 --> 00:48:43,127
But again, that is, that's just straight out of the box what MSBA calculates solely based on the enrollment.

492
00:48:45,353 --> 00:49:04,316
with the addition of the DESE chapter 74 spaces that out of the box MSBA school does not necessarily account for any chapter 74 programs which is why we've layered on sort of the DESE requirements given the size of the of the programs as well as the new programs that are being planned.

493
00:49:05,938 --> 00:49:22,348
Rosemary, I just wanted to take a second and do a little bit of a drum roll with the existing building size, because I know as part of the process, we've heard a wide range in terms of assumptions of what that existing building size was, probably anywhere from 400,000 square feet to 600,000 square feet.

494
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:25,130
So somewhere in the middle, which I guess is a good thing.

495
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:32,094
And just reiterate the fact of what Rosemary mentioned, that our existing building scanning

496
00:49:33,455 --> 00:49:37,999
We're expecting the point cloud results from that towards the middle of January.

497
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:47,387
So we may tweak this a little bit, but I would hazard a guess right now that will probably not be more than like a few percentage points off of this at max.

498
00:49:47,427 --> 00:50:00,358
But you may see this number evolve slightly moving forward, but it's definitely in this order of magnitude of where we are based on all of sort of the physical survey walking around that we have done with the combination of the existing drawings and sort of

499
00:50:00,818 --> 00:50:02,819
recreating things to the best of our ability.

500
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,300
So we do have a fair amount of confidence in that number.

501
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,764
And then this was, you know, I'm a visual person.

502
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:25,070
So this was a way to really visualize the program gross area for the existing and the MSBA guidelines.

503
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:25,410
And so

504
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:37,156
All of the colors that are to the left of the dotted line represent the net square footage, and the gray represents that unoccupied space that is determined by the grossing factor.

505
00:50:38,817 --> 00:50:47,322
And so you've got the x-axis representing square footage and the y with the existing versus MSBA.

506
00:50:48,182 --> 00:50:53,565
And so upon first glance, you can see already that the special ed in the dark green

507
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,441
that appears smaller under the MSBA guidelines.

508
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:11,324
Again, we are anticipating that that will grow bigger than what is existing because we know that we need the right size of spaces, but also we know that the Curtis Tufts program is moving in.

509
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:18,225
If you look at another big thing that jumps out is that dark orange.

510
00:51:18,901 --> 00:51:22,803
So that dark orange, those are the CTE chapter 74 spaces.

511
00:51:23,064 --> 00:51:32,009
And so again, MSBA slash DESE guidelines are going to put us at that much larger orange bar.

512
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:40,634
And so we can anticipate seeing seeing the CTE programs grow considerably there.

513
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:46,598
And then the blue we've discussed about how your

514
00:51:46,975 --> 00:51:50,799
your health and PE spaces today are considerably bigger.

515
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:58,046
But I think that it's, you know, to see that comparison visually, it's quite striking.

516
00:51:59,968 --> 00:52:09,177
And then another thing to note is that in the existing, you see that giant pink category, that was that other category.

517
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:17,080
And you'll notice that the MSBA guidelines don't have anything for that category because they just don't provide guidelines on it.

518
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:31,445
Those are the spaces that, as they're not a part of the MSBA guidelines regarding high schools or schools, those are not the square footages that the MSBA will reimburse for.

519
00:52:33,346 --> 00:52:34,726
So hopefully this is a helpful visual.

520
00:52:34,766 --> 00:52:38,788
I think that it really does give that story very quickly.

521
00:52:44,448 --> 00:52:56,994
From a flow standpoint, do we want to pause here for a second and field any questions, or do we want to run through the rest of the presentation, which does include some site analysis information?

522
00:52:58,295 --> 00:52:59,295
Open to either approach.

523
00:53:04,418 --> 00:53:05,118
Keep going, please.

524
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:06,379
All right.

525
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:12,732
I think that's my cue to say hello.

526
00:53:12,752 --> 00:53:15,993
I'm Laura Swan, the civil engineer from SMMA.

527
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:20,274
And I'll be your guide around the exterior of the school and our site investigations.

528
00:53:22,095 --> 00:53:23,815
So this site has an extensive history.

529
00:53:23,835 --> 00:53:29,557
And early maps show it as a town farm where residents would work to earn their keep.

530
00:53:30,497 --> 00:53:33,378
And my understanding is this continued until the 1950s.

531
00:53:33,618 --> 00:53:37,039
In the 1960s, it was identified as the site of the future high school.

532
00:53:40,847 --> 00:53:49,013
You can see these plans show where there was a quarry or some sort of pit or dump that is now underneath the school.

533
00:53:50,034 --> 00:53:53,056
And the new building opened in 1971.

534
00:53:56,443 --> 00:54:08,790
I'm just going to take a second to do a little bit of color commentary here on sort of the pit quarry dump reference that was in there, because we have heard from various sources that the site was a dump at a certain point in time.

535
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:15,894
And part of the fun of these projects is trying to do a little bit of historical research to understand sort of what is sort of the background to things.

536
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:31,762
And so to the best that we understand it, back as late as the 1920s, there was a lot of excavation of various spots throughout Medford in terms of excavation of clay for sort of the brick manufacturing process.

537
00:54:32,243 --> 00:54:36,085
And so there were various spots that were excavated out.

538
00:54:36,165 --> 00:54:46,010
So that's that reference to the quarry, most likely a brick quarry, that once they were used up and bricks stopped being manufactured in Medford,

539
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:53,936
again, around the 1920s, these holes were essentially left all over the city in various locations.

540
00:54:54,616 --> 00:55:01,522
I think the main one, which was prior sort of the official Medford City dump, which I think was down on River Street.

541
00:55:03,405 --> 00:55:04,805
that was sort of the largest one.

542
00:55:04,845 --> 00:55:14,587
This one I don't think was as official as a dump, but essentially these holes ended up getting filled either with rainwater or with sort of trash material.

543
00:55:15,227 --> 00:55:20,168
And so I think that's more or less what happened here, and that's why we see the varying references.

544
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:31,931
The 1967-68 drawings that we found, one of which is up on screen here, actually referred to this as the quarry and sort of that perimeter that was around there.

545
00:55:32,751 --> 00:55:37,414
And you can see that this drawing was actually predates the final layout of the high school.

546
00:55:37,454 --> 00:55:41,977
This had like a separate boiler room over here and some tennis courts that were down the other side.

547
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:49,722
But this outline that we see also reflected on those foundation drawings that Ellen mentioned we found for the B wing pretty much aligns.

548
00:55:49,842 --> 00:55:56,026
So we do have some level of confidence that this was the area on site that was sort of previously

549
00:55:57,627 --> 00:56:06,449
used for that purpose and the reason why they ended up having to put in a structured slab for the foundations of the building over these areas in particular.

550
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:11,450
Thank you, Matt, for all that background.

551
00:56:13,731 --> 00:56:21,533
Yes, so currently the site is mostly paved and impermeable with some very noticeable pockets of bedrock.

552
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:25,410
So over 50% of it is impermeable.

553
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:31,436
The stormwater as it currently stands is not being treated for pollutants.

554
00:56:33,799 --> 00:56:42,188
In addition, there are very few shade trees or any sort of plantings to offer relief from the heat island effect.

555
00:56:49,663 --> 00:57:11,252
Two recent planning initiatives have identified the high school site for special consideration, particularly for the urban heat island effect in this region and some of the need to stabilize the banks from erosion by using plantings.

556
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:23,479
There's also a desire to change the character of this site and use more of the open spaces and facilities and provide for more activities on the site.

557
00:57:29,084 --> 00:57:32,507
Now onto the exciting part, which is how people get to and from school.

558
00:57:35,971 --> 00:57:38,553
Interestingly enough, recent Safe Roads to School

559
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:46,652
poll found that over half the students that live within a mile do walk to the high school.

560
00:57:47,032 --> 00:57:51,894
So there are well-traveled paths, especially through the fells, to the high school.

561
00:57:52,694 --> 00:58:04,098
There are also a lot of different transit routes, public transit routes, through different neighborhoods that will take students directly to the high school.

562
00:58:05,678 --> 00:58:10,360
And in addition, North Medford has the dedicated school bus route

563
00:58:11,177 --> 00:58:13,479
to bring students to the high school as well.

564
00:58:19,884 --> 00:58:24,648
So currently, there is a lot of parking on site.

565
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:30,213
And vehicles and getting vehicles around the site are kind of prioritized.

566
00:58:33,075 --> 00:58:39,220
There are fences between the neighborhood and the school site to the northwest.

567
00:58:39,805 --> 00:58:45,889
which makes it harder for pedestrians to access the school from that direction.

568
00:58:46,909 --> 00:58:55,274
There's a two-way driveway as the only vehicle entrance to the site, as you can see off of Winthrop Street.

569
00:58:56,953 --> 00:59:10,600
And along the outside of the site, there's one exterior road to provide access to back to the pool, to the service entrances, and to the fields.

570
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:24,167
And this can create a bottleneck for emergency vehicles, even just for delivery trucks and student transport services, both trying to use the same driveway at the same time.

571
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:34,615
Currently, there's also 476 parking spaces, and it seems to be an underutilized number.

572
00:59:38,077 --> 00:59:39,658
So there might be opportunity there.

573
00:59:42,939 --> 00:59:46,241
So yes, service and circulation have come to sort of dominate the site.

574
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:54,585
So the athletic entrances, the program spaces, those seem to be taking a backseat to

575
00:59:57,706 --> 01:00:02,467
sort of allowing the vehicles to enter and get around the site.

576
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:18,534
So there are a lot of opportunities to better integrate these outdoor spaces into the learning spaces to provide amenities like seating, shade, bike racks.

577
01:00:18,554 --> 01:00:24,716
And in addition, a lot of these slopes have had significant erosion

578
01:00:25,563 --> 01:00:31,087
can see the damage to some of the stairs on the west side of the site and on that hillside.

579
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:38,853
Thank you.

580
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:41,029
Thanks, Laura.

581
01:00:41,129 --> 01:00:45,351
And I had asked team members to introduce themselves and didn't do so before myself.

582
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:45,812
Hello.

583
01:00:46,252 --> 01:00:46,732
Good evening.

584
01:00:46,792 --> 01:00:49,133
Helen Fantini, project manager with SMMA.

585
01:00:49,153 --> 01:01:06,261
And a real brief recap of the fact that the advisory teams, which is a method we're using to gather more community input on the four topic areas in the intersecting circles on the right side of the slide, those teams have been formed.

586
01:01:08,402 --> 01:01:17,349
you from the SPC have participated, and meeting number one, which was a listening session for each of the four topics occurred.

587
01:01:17,989 --> 01:01:19,010
Was that just last week?

588
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,091
That was just last week.

589
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:26,736
On the 16th and 18th, we have meeting number two coming up in the middle of January.

590
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:30,219
On the 13th and the 15th, I believe those invites went out.

591
01:01:31,123 --> 01:01:35,825
take in what we heard last week and review and respond.

592
01:01:36,565 --> 01:01:43,087
And just to say real briefly that it was really, really engaged conversations on all four topics.

593
01:01:43,987 --> 01:01:51,510
And super exciting to be working with a group of people that are so connected to this incredible project.

594
01:01:59,972 --> 01:02:04,476
Uh, all right, uh, just looking at, uh, next steps, uh, like Helen.

595
01:02:04,496 --> 01:02:10,400
Um, mentioned, uh, we'll continue those advisory team meetings, uh, next month.

596
01:02:11,821 --> 01:02:16,384
Uh, and those will continue to kind of inform, you know, the design as we start to.

597
01:02:16,985 --> 01:02:17,145
Yes.

598
01:02:19,253 --> 01:02:29,759
Hi, I just wondered if anybody had any questions before we went to the wrap up phase here, because they've just taken in a lot of information.

599
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,280
Sure.

600
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:44,848
Yeah, so does anybody have any questions on any of the existing conditions or where we currently stand with the space summary that Rosemary reviewed?

601
01:02:49,703 --> 01:02:50,083
question.

602
01:02:51,544 --> 01:02:56,426
So this is looking at what we have and what's allowed.

603
01:02:58,627 --> 01:03:01,828
And if I had the whole project plan in front of me, I might be able to answer it myself.

604
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:09,271
But when do we discuss all the things the MSBA and DESE are interested in?

605
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:10,352
Central administration,

606
01:03:12,112 --> 01:03:13,693
that kind of stuff.

607
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:17,274
I don't want that to be an add-on or an afterthought.

608
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:30,958
I know that's not the whole point of this project, but I also want to make sure those areas are as functional and, you know, great places to work as possible.

609
01:03:31,218 --> 01:03:35,319
And I'm just worried that they're going to be like, we have a corner over here where you can stuff them in.

610
01:03:36,259 --> 01:03:37,440
And I don't want that to happen.

611
01:03:38,558 --> 01:03:41,139
No, we'll certainly be looking.

612
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:58,564
We're currently looking at everything that we've heard about those spaces, and we will definitely be incorporating those into this phase as we start to look at some high-level massings and ideas on what this project may look like.

613
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:04,806
So it is something that we're actively working on, and we'll be updating the committee

614
01:04:06,368 --> 01:04:10,110
before we submit the PDP at the end of February.

615
01:04:10,991 --> 01:04:24,858
So in the coming months here, this will continue to evolve and you'll see those categories on that space summary start to change as we start to incorporate some of those kind of lesser known areas at this point in time.

616
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:32,802
But it is something that we're working on and it's something that will continue to evolve even beyond the February submission.

617
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,661
that will continue to evolve.

618
01:04:34,681 --> 01:04:37,443
As we work, you know, towards a preferred option in the next phase.

619
01:04:38,424 --> 01:04:42,146
It will continue to kind of evolve through through that phase as well.

620
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:45,609
Um so we can have.

621
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:55,176
And Paul, I just wanted to also add on to that that, um, every single, um, component that fell under the other category, including central office,

622
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:04,858
those programs as well.

623
01:05:05,619 --> 01:05:15,101
So we're going through the same process as we are with the educational programs.

624
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:20,602
So I want to assure you that we are taking a close look at all of that as well.

625
01:05:25,275 --> 01:05:33,226
One of the conversations I've had with school committee members is that we should have a school committee chamber and a school committee office attached to the central administration so that they're not

626
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:45,150
You know, I mean, these people work ridiculous hours as it is, and we have enormous scheduling challenges by using the same place as the City Council and all the other purposes that City Hall has.

627
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:55,395
So, you know, the user group there is the public and the school committee, and I've not really seen how that's

628
01:05:56,275 --> 01:05:59,657
I mean it wasn't part of our SLI because it was never going to be included.

629
01:06:01,038 --> 01:06:19,911
So I just want to make sure we don't like after the fact discover that wait the school committee wants to have an office and a chamber so that we can have and maybe even have our chambers attached to the vocational program for all of the stuff they do and you know there's probably opportunities for

630
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,404
multi-use for such a place.

631
01:06:24,684 --> 01:06:30,989
Right now, like the City Council, like the chambers that we use now at City Hall, like that doesn't make sense as a multi-use for students.

632
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:34,792
Like in the middle of the school day, they're not going to be getting on a bus to go there.

633
01:06:35,332 --> 01:06:43,439
But I think there's a lot of opportunities for a multi-use chambers or whatever they would end up being called or look like.

634
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,322
So I just want to make sure that stuff is

635
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:54,456
Like there's not going to be a work group for that.

636
01:06:56,358 --> 01:07:01,003
I mean, the public doesn't use the chambers the way that the school committee does, for instance.

637
01:07:01,824 --> 01:07:09,053
And I don't know what other administrative spaces are.

638
01:07:10,564 --> 01:07:14,387
I saw those numbers, but then I realized it was not including central admin.

639
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:21,632
And so I think we're sort of free to do what we want with the stuff that's not covered by MSBA in any way, shape, or form.

640
01:07:22,033 --> 01:07:27,296
So I just want to make sure that we're included in that.

641
01:07:29,618 --> 01:07:31,259
And Paul, I think the other thing that

642
01:07:33,075 --> 01:07:47,918
We're not ready to talk about yet, but that this team, like the architects have done a tremendous amount of data collection on is like sort of the difference between how education happens in the building today, and like what.

643
01:07:48,572 --> 01:07:53,056
we'll call it everyone's hopes and dreams might be for what a new space could provide.

644
01:07:53,857 --> 01:08:04,085
And part of them meeting, having hundreds of meetings and doing all these all day sessions is to start to unfold like how all those things fit together.

645
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:14,014
So I think the team has a tremendous amount of that like information already, maybe an exception for the example you just provided.

646
01:08:15,773 --> 01:08:25,825
And we'll get there and be able to share that, but I think it was to the visioning sessions and like how that ties to the educational plan.

647
01:08:26,699 --> 01:08:34,285
has to happen before we can start talking about some of those spaces that are new and interesting and innovative and all of those things.

648
01:08:34,345 --> 01:08:39,369
So I think we're on our way there really quickly, just not there today.

649
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:56,062
But the team has, as Rosemary said, done tons and tons and tons of data collection to understand what the needs and wishes and hopes and dreams are of the people who spend their time in the building, including students.

650
01:09:04,324 --> 01:09:05,385
Hi, this is Lisa Miller.

651
01:09:05,405 --> 01:09:06,166
I have a quick question.

652
01:09:06,327 --> 01:09:08,970
Could you just explain what grossing factor means briefly?

653
01:09:11,653 --> 01:09:20,904
Yeah, so the grossing factor is basically any space that is unoccupied space.

654
01:09:21,145 --> 01:09:23,768
So you're always

655
01:09:24,605 --> 01:09:42,470
your toilets, your mechanical rooms, vertical circulation, so stairs, you know, elevators, closets, all of those things that are not programmed space but are still required for the building.

656
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:49,512
But we're not going to, you know, I'm not going to list like every single

657
01:09:50,680 --> 01:10:02,064
janitor's closet that's going to be in the building because those are things that are required, but we don't put them as program space.

658
01:10:03,684 --> 01:10:04,045
Thank you.

659
01:10:13,068 --> 01:10:13,968
Any other questions?

660
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:29,914
All right, uh, Matt, do you want to go back down to the kind of upcoming?

661
01:10:32,076 --> 01:10:43,584
Uh, so just looking ahead here at, at some of the critical dates, um, for, for this committee to be prepared for, um, you know, many of you are a part of those advisory team meetings.

662
01:10:44,084 --> 01:10:47,767
Uh, so a reminder, we'll be meeting again with them on the 13th and the 15th of January.

663
01:10:50,650 --> 01:11:02,417
We will be meeting with this committee right between those two meetings on January 14th, and we'll continue to kind of keep updating a lot of the existing conditions that we reviewed tonight.

664
01:11:02,457 --> 01:11:05,699
There's still a lot of work for us to continue with there.

665
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:17,846
And the review of alternatives will be really the team's first attempt at looking at the overall square footage of the school and how that may, you know,

666
01:11:18,405 --> 01:11:19,906
work out in an actual building.

667
01:11:20,446 --> 01:11:30,531
We are required by the MSBA to look at different alternatives, an addition renovation, a code upgrade, and a new build.

668
01:11:30,611 --> 01:11:38,515
So these alternatives will cover a wide range of those options.

669
01:11:40,036 --> 01:11:47,120
We've been on, and I'm sure SMMA can speak to this as well, but we've been on projects where we may start out with

670
01:11:47,908 --> 01:12:00,255
20 different options, and you'll start to wheel down those options depending on a range of different factors.

671
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:02,056
It could be the building's too tall.

672
01:12:02,076 --> 01:12:04,758
It could be it's too sprawling.

673
01:12:05,118 --> 01:12:08,580
There's just a lot of different options that we need to get in front of this committee.

674
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:12,802
So we'll start to review those alternatives at the next meeting.

675
01:12:15,545 --> 01:12:20,190
From there, we'll be taking those alternatives and providing them to the cost estimators.

676
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:29,078
SMMA and Leftfield both have two independent cost estimators that we'll provide the documentation to.

677
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:33,282
They will both price them and provide estimates independently.

678
01:12:33,302 --> 01:12:40,509
And then we'll go through a reconciliation to see kind of how those two estimators came to their numbers.

679
01:12:41,548 --> 01:12:47,190
These first alternatives are a very high level cost per square foot estimate.

680
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:53,732
We're not getting down into the nitty gritty on finishes and mechanical systems.

681
01:12:55,013 --> 01:13:00,174
It's a very high level estimate at this point of the project, just to get a sense of where the market is.

682
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:05,656
And then from there, we'll be meeting twice in February.

683
01:13:05,696 --> 01:13:10,277
This is when we'll really start to get some more robust information in front of you.

684
01:13:10,878 --> 01:13:15,159
We will have the PDP estimates in early February.

685
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:27,023
So we'll start to present some numbers, like I said, very high level, but give us a sense of how, not just where the market is, but also how the different alternatives compare to each other.

686
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:27,883
It's really a cost.

687
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:37,655
a comparative cost analysis between the options, not necessarily, you know, this is what the project is absolutely going to cost.

688
01:13:38,296 --> 01:13:45,620
We are quite a ways from understanding that, but we will start to get a sense of it with some of these alternatives.

689
01:13:46,721 --> 01:13:58,068
And then at the end of the month in February on the 23rd, we will be looking for an approval of the first submission to the MSBA, which is the preliminary design program or PDP.

690
01:13:59,397 --> 01:14:08,883
Um, so we'll be, you know, preparing everybody from now until then, uh, with all of the information that we'll be looking for approval on at the end of February.

691
01:14:08,963 --> 01:14:17,588
So, um, and I think with that, uh, Matt, I don't know if you had any other slides or was that the last one?

692
01:14:18,148 --> 01:14:20,590
No, we were, that's a thank you slide.

693
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:25,252
So, uh, does anybody have any final, any final questions, SMA?

694
01:14:25,272 --> 01:14:27,774
Uh, I don't know if you have any final comments.

695
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:35,163
Or Jenny, I'm happy to stick on if anybody has any other, any thoughts.

696
01:14:40,126 --> 01:14:40,966
Matt, this is Jenny.

697
01:14:41,206 --> 01:14:50,771
I know we have sort of a light group here and Matt and I will work to get an email update out to everybody so that people know what is coming.

698
01:14:51,351 --> 01:14:55,814
And in particular that, like, these next meetings are the ones everyone's been waiting for and.

699
01:14:57,094 --> 01:14:59,355
I think people will be really excited to participate.

700
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:05,696
So I just want people to have a bit of a heads up and a reconfirmation of the schedule, which I think has shifted slightly.

701
01:15:05,796 --> 01:15:11,097
So we'll owe you all an email about that in the coming weeks.

702
01:15:11,177 --> 01:15:23,439
So while you are hopefully enjoying some rest and relaxation, you can get out your calendar and put us in pen on those days so that you can plan to participate.

703
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,841
coming attraction for everybody.

704
01:15:28,861 --> 01:15:37,705
I think if there aren't any other questions, there might be a motion to adjourn somewhere.

705
01:15:37,725 --> 01:15:42,207
So moved.

706
01:15:44,568 --> 01:15:44,949
Seconded.

707
01:15:45,009 --> 01:15:46,669
Motion to adjourn by Ken.

708
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:48,410
Seconded.

709
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:54,012
I will call the roll real quick.

710
01:15:54,312 --> 01:15:55,153
Jenny Graham, yes.

711
01:15:55,213 --> 01:15:56,014
Mayor Longo Kern.

712
01:15:56,254 --> 01:15:56,554
Yes.

713
01:15:58,496 --> 01:15:59,577
Dr. Gluski is absent.

714
01:15:59,617 --> 01:16:00,278
Marta Cabral.

715
01:16:00,638 --> 01:16:00,938
Yes.

716
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:03,501
Joan Bowen.

717
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:04,361
Yes.

718
01:16:06,643 --> 01:16:07,124
Ken Lord.

719
01:16:07,204 --> 01:16:07,424
Yes.

720
01:16:08,685 --> 01:16:09,486
Libby Brown.

721
01:16:20,682 --> 01:16:21,402
Did we lose Libby?

722
01:16:22,262 --> 01:16:23,162
Marissa Desmond?

723
01:16:25,003 --> 01:16:25,483
Absent.

724
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:26,803
Maria Dorsey is absent.

725
01:16:26,823 --> 01:16:27,463
Brian Hilliard?

726
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,064
Yes.

727
01:16:30,204 --> 01:16:31,084
Libby Brown was a yes.

728
01:16:31,244 --> 01:16:32,124
Emily Lazaro?

729
01:16:32,984 --> 01:16:33,304
Yes.

730
01:16:33,584 --> 01:16:34,364
Oh, Libby's a yes.

731
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:34,745
OK.

732
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:36,725
Did you hear me?

733
01:16:36,765 --> 01:16:37,505
Paul Malone?

734
01:16:37,525 --> 01:16:39,205
I did.

735
01:16:39,405 --> 01:16:39,705
Yes.

736
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:43,426
Nicole Morrell?

737
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:44,126
Yes.

738
01:16:46,307 --> 01:16:47,067
Erin Olopade?

739
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:47,807
Yes.

740
01:16:49,801 --> 01:16:54,045
Luke Prisner is absent, so 11 in the affirmative for absent.

741
01:16:54,565 --> 01:16:55,626
The meeting is adjourned.

742
01:16:56,567 --> 01:16:58,729
Thank you everyone for bearing with me.

743
01:16:59,169 --> 01:17:03,473
Have a wonderful holiday and we will see you all in January.
