15
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:53,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna go ahead and recognize the chair, Kit Collins, who I am chairing this meeting in lieu of today.

16
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:55,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Kit, take it away.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Councilor Leming, and thank you again for facilitating this meeting in the chambers.

18
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:04,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize that I can't be there in person today.

19
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:07,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for taking up the mantle of calling on people in person.

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I truly appreciate it.

21
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:12,314
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to quickly introduce the topic before us.

22
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:14,395
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an exciting day.

23
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:16,016
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a red letter day, actually.

24
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:29,521
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our first committee meeting about the zoning paper, which I think as most folks here and probably watching are aware, this is something that the Council has advocated for and advocated for funding for over the course of several terms now.

25
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:41,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Late last term, we finalized the zoning consultants that we've been working with longitudinally for this zoning overhaul reconfiguration project, Emily Innis and associates.

26
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:46,088
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to quickly run through, you know, a draft agenda for this meeting.

27
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:51,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping to give Emily and her team a chance to introduce themselves to the committee for the first time.

28
00:01:53,051 --> 00:02:02,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that we can get into kind of an overview of the zoning overhaul that's before us, run over a kind of draft list of our top issues.

29
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:11,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, we have a lot of fertile ground to pull from our comprehensive plan, our housing production plan, our climate action adaptation plan, all of these really thoroughly

30
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:31,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Thoroughly developed, you know, plans that have come out of years of community outreach across various departments of the city that will be really great fodder for the work that we're going to do in the council in terms of making those priorities those goals manifest in an updated zoning code and updated zoning map.

31
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:46,464
[SPEAKER_04]: But the work before us is to take those lofty goals and see how we can break them into themes, into coherent themes, into bite-sized chunks, and then to figure out a timeline so that we can get through as much of that work as possible in this term.

32
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:59,947
[SPEAKER_04]: So after we hear an introduction from Emily Innis and associates, I'm hoping that we can, as a council, start to have that conversation about taking those shared priorities, grouping them into categories,

33
00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:13,941
[SPEAKER_04]: and beginning a conversation about what from our current governing agenda or other priorities fit into the scope of zoning and beginning to sketch out the timeline through which we might approach this work this term.

34
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,884
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, I'll pass it off to Emily and her team.

35
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:17,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

36
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:24,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much and thank you all Councilors for having us join you in this process.

37
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,731
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very excited to be working with you.

38
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:45,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of the comprehensive planning process and since then with agency landscape and planning and since then I've added a few people to my team who are going to be helping us and with your permission, I'd like to share my screen so I can introduce the team and some of the topics that we're discussing today.

39
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:48,617
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will get that moving now.

40
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:54,043
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure I can see you all as well.

41
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:56,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you can see the screen.

42
00:03:57,624 --> 00:04:00,625
[SPEAKER_00]: What we would like to do is introduce the team to you.

43
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:04,226
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got two sets, the project team that you're going to be working with directly.

44
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:06,947
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all except Jonathan on the call.

45
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:12,548
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to introduce Paula Ramos Martinez, who is our newest senior urban designer planner.

46
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,989
[SPEAKER_00]: So new that she doesn't have the requisite brick background behind her yet.

47
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:25,586
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jimmy Rocha, who is our spatial analyst and data scientist, one of the two data scientists on the team, is also a resident of Medford.

48
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:27,951
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're excited to have him on board as well.

49
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:35,672
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that we've got a support team behind us as well, three other people and a fourth joining us soon.

50
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:43,037
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see their names as we move through the project, but it's going to be Paula, Jemmy, and myself that you see most often.

51
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:50,402
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the NS Associates team, we also have Jonathan Silverstein from Blattman, Verbrowski, Haberdee, and Silverstein.

52
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:55,146
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to make sure that we had legal review of the zoning.

53
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:59,230
[SPEAKER_00]: As you all know, once it's in the ordinance, it has the effect of law.

54
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,770
[SPEAKER_00]: It is law.

55
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:02,633
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to make sure that we had that legal eye on it.

56
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:13,003
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, Mr. Borowsky's work on the recodification obviously set the stage for some of the work that we're going to be working with you on this project.

57
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:29,010
[SPEAKER_00]: As Councilor Collins said, we certainly have other documents to pull from the comprehensive plan itself, the client action adaptation plan and the housing production plan, as well as other planning efforts that you have done over the years.

58
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,395
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is exciting to be able to pull these together into something that will have an impact.

59
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:43,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to break down for you the timeline and sort of the high-level components of what we need to accomplish over the next year and a bit, basically.

60
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:51,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I do this, I'm going to make some suggestions about how we can chunk these into different pieces.

61
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:53,364
[SPEAKER_00]: These are only suggestions.

62
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:59,007
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our team is really hoping to hear from you today, see if some of these make sense.

63
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:02,470
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have different order and priorities, we'll take notes of that.

64
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just gets us started.

65
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:10,792
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking at two fiscal years in terms of the contract and therefore the funding.

66
00:06:10,852 --> 00:06:19,254
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd like to accomplish a certain amount before June 30th, 2024, and then the remainder by June 30th, 2025.

67
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:32,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we've been thinking about this is an idea of what can we do before the end of this fiscal year and actually get it completed, or at least the text completed, even if the full city council isn't voting on it until after June 30th.

68
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:40,878
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain things that we'd like to begin now, but probably won't get completed until after June 30th.

69
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:48,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I've suggested we think in terms of quarters for some of these, just to help us keep on track as we start delving into them.

70
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:55,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Each individual piece will have its own timeline, its own piece of the timeline, but if you think of how we complete things in quarter,

71
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:03,108
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some things that are much longer term and are likely to begin post-June 30th.

72
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them might be completed by December of this year.

73
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them might take into June 30th and be completed by June 30th of next year.

74
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:20,210
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we started to break down and talking with Council President Bears and talking with Councilor Collins.

75
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:34,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the overall tasks, some of these we addressed in our initial scope, some of these came out of the comprehensive plan, which started to lay out some different ways of tackling the zoning changes.

76
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:41,430
[SPEAKER_00]: In the comprehensive plan, we talked about grouping them by topic or by geography.

77
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:57,145
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the planning staff has already moved forward with considering, okay, there are some things that we know now need to be changed, smaller things like definitions, things that haven't quite worked out the way we thought they would post recodification.

78
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:08,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Also getting feedback from the Zoning Board of Appeals, the City Board, the Building Department as to what's working, what isn't working, may just be technical changes.

79
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:16,541
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're thinking those, many of those may be a category A, they start now, they get finished by June 30th.

80
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:43,745
[SPEAKER_00]: We then talked about this idea that some of what you need to tackle are really citywide policies that come out of the Climate Adaptation Plan, that come out of thinking of housing production or housing affordability, and critically, that come out of thinking about economic development and business growth, which is certainly something that we saw was of importance in the Comprehensive Plan as well.

81
00:08:44,764 --> 00:09:00,508
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, once we have the overall city policies, starting to think about how those policies might have an impact on different areas of the city, the comprehensive plan thought about them in terms of squares and connecting quarters.

82
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:11,051
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the neighborhood, the residential streets, those pieces that kind of are connected by those squares and those corridors.

83
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:16,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about zoning, we think about what are the land uses?

84
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:23,255
[SPEAKER_00]: How do those clump together in terms of mapping out new districts or change districts?

85
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:28,116
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the dimensional requirements for each of those areas and how those work together?

86
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:30,793
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the overall topics.

87
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:35,695
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be returning to this slide, but just to see how this might follow through with our timeline.

88
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:46,439
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was thinking, again, between now and June 30th, those small plates, those pieces of zoning that are easy to, we know they need to be changed.

89
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,440
[SPEAKER_00]: They're relatively easy to change.

90
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to recognize Jonathan was able to join us.

91
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,602
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jonathan's the other member of our team.

92
00:09:54,823 --> 00:10:08,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Breaking this down into by June 30th, what are the pieces that we can take to city council as a whole, have them easily adopted because there are components that just we know need to be changed, definitions, for example.

93
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:12,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And then start to bite off those citywide policies.

94
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:16,875
[SPEAKER_00]: So, get some of them maybe are done by June 30 of this year.

95
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:23,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them might take into optimistically put September could be some longer term ones take to December.

96
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:25,798
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we're starting to.

97
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:34,727
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on those citywide policies one by one, we can start to now think of the area studies.

98
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:39,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the policies are in place, apply those to the area studies.

99
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:47,322
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of how we would get from here to June 30 in terms of thinking of maybe those three bands of actions.

100
00:10:48,042 --> 00:11:00,273
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of what we need to do between now and June 30th, I've laid out the meetings that we have on our calendar for you for the next couple of months.

101
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:05,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you may see a rotating version of the team, depending on who's talking about what.

102
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:18,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we may be giving you some homework for some meetings, but looking at two meetings a month, April, May, and June, starting with those conflicts with the zoning ordinances, things that need to get smoothed out.

103
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:27,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe starting with zoning policies I put for discussion, economic development and climate resiliency, certainly want to hear from you today.

104
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:32,628
[SPEAKER_00]: but starting to kind of flesh those out and see what those mean.

105
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:39,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, what's possible to sign off on before the end of this year and what's going to take into the next year.

106
00:11:40,402 --> 00:12:01,107
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, just basically laying out the framework, I'm happy to maybe we pop back to the topics for a little bit, but happy to jump to any of the timelines as well, and want to turn it back over to you, Councilor Leming, to maybe see if there's any questions from all of you.

107
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:06,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely recognize Council President Bears.

108
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:08,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

109
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:10,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Emily.

110
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:12,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

111
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

112
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:17,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is a really great start.

113
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:20,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have good buckets for all of the things that we want to talk about.

114
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:20,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of the

115
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,715
[SPEAKER_05]: more specific policies that have come up.

116
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:28,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at Councilor Callahan, some of the green score climate implementation.

117
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:38,261
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have climate resiliency discussion, Councilor Leming, the transportation demand, and some of the other things that Councilor Leming's put forward with transportation section.

118
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:46,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're all really interested in, for the comprehensive plan, looking at major squares, connecting corridors, what our neighborhood residential streets.

119
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:51,935
[SPEAKER_05]: are looking at housing production plan goes into housing production, housing affordability.

120
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:57,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think, you know, leading off with this, what I think in what is sometimes

121
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:02,499
[SPEAKER_05]: a, you know, we don't always have universal agreement on anything.

122
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:15,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the one thing we hear from everybody of every stripe is this economic development and business growth focus and wanting to see more commercial growth, more economic development, more business growth and building that up that part of the tax base.

123
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:24,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think really leading off with that discussion and making it clear that that is one of the pillars of this project and has been and continues to be one of the pillars of the work of this council.

124
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:26,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Is really great.

125
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think that the schedule is good.

126
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:35,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I think setting our goal of June 30th of next year is smart because I think we all know that things might take a little longer than that.

127
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:38,935
[SPEAKER_05]: And that gives us the 6 months at the end of the term.

128
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:46,278
[SPEAKER_05]: for those things that may inevitably take longer than this initial project plan.

129
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,519
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's a really good goal.

130
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have this planning permitting committee meeting regularly, which gives us the venue.

131
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:59,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we have a strong framework here of all of the issues that we want to tackle from the

132
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:17,666
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, fixes and implementation suggestions that have come from the zoning recodification that this council completed two years ago, and then all of the work that we want to do that uses that recodified zoning as a framework to make these policy and zoning changes.

133
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:19,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really excited for this project.

134
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this framework is really helpful.

135
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:26,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the timeline is really helpful, and I'm excited to work with my colleagues and the team

136
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:34,942
[SPEAKER_05]: and associates team to get it done, as well as our planning staff, building department staff, and the community.

137
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:36,803
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

138
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:39,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any questions, but just wanted to put all that out there.

139
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is a really strong start.

140
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:47,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Council President Bears.

141
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:49,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have Councilor Callahan?

142
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:51,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

143
00:14:51,609 --> 00:15:01,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, super excited to be working on this and to have a team of people dedicated to all the research and legal and urban planning work that needs to be done to do this right.

144
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:11,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to hear where specific policies that we have all proposed might fit into here, into the timeline.

145
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:16,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to encourage if it's possible and if this

146
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:27,745
[SPEAKER_02]: that fits into your presentation, feel free to drop in mentioning policies as examples of things that could go in there.

147
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:37,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might also help folks who are in the audience, both on Zoom and here in person, to understand what kinds of things we mean with these more generic buckets that we're talking about.

148
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:37,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

149
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:43,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Council Vice President.

150
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:45,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Did Ms.

151
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:46,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Ennis want to respond to that?

152
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:50,329
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually, I'd like to hear all the questions first, and I'll be happy to respond.

153
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:53,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Vice President Collins.

154
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:55,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

155
00:15:57,455 --> 00:16:11,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate this beginning to the discussion from my fellow councilors and, you know, in the, you know, roughly 40-45 minutes that we have here today, I think that one great use of our time might be to start, of course, you know, we're not going to do anything

156
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:37,883
[SPEAKER_04]: final tonight, but I think it could be a good use of our time to make this concrete for ourselves and also for residents to, you know, we can take a look at our governing agenda, we can pull out specific policies that councillors feel are priorities from the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, from the Comprehensive Plan, and looking at that slide from Emily, we can start to say, okay, green score, this looks like it would fit into the

157
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:43,585
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, climate resiliency, citywide policy, and here's when we're thinking of starting that.

158
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense for that particular policy?

159
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:46,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that fit there?

160
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it have a better fit there?

161
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:54,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a lot that we are trying to do by the end of June 2025.

162
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:58,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to be here before we know it for all of us.

163
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:04,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the more quickly we can get concrete about what we all consent to work on together,

164
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:09,153
[SPEAKER_04]: at what point in the year the better position we'll be in to accomplish our goals.

165
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:24,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So just as kind of an invitation to my fellow councillors, you know, for the time that we have together this evening, if there are specific policies from our governing agenda or new proposals on the brain, I think that we should feel free to voice those and put them on the record.

166
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

167
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:34,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Any more comment from members of the council?

168
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:40,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Any comment from members of the public?

169
00:17:45,754 --> 00:17:46,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, seeing.

170
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:47,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Levee.

171
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:48,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

172
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:58,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'd be great at this time if we could hear maybe from planning staff, maybe the building commissioner, just kind of hear your initial thoughts on what's been outlined.

173
00:17:59,598 --> 00:17:59,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

174
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you have questions, I want to give you space to chat.

175
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:03,339
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

176
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:11,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Bears, and we refer to you as Chair Leming.

177
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,511
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the right titles this evening.

178
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:17,613
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so we're excited to work on this.

179
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:32,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some members of the council know, but maybe not everybody is aware, the planning staff have been compiling lists of things that are inconsistent or unclear or unintended consequences.

180
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:37,115
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have been finding over the past year and a half in the city's zoning.

181
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:41,798
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have provided that list to Emily and her team.

182
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:46,541
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually we have shared it with councillors, bears and Collins as well.

183
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:49,844
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to avoid any open meeting law of it.

184
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:53,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't want to share it with everybody because it's a document that we have been commenting on.

185
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:59,790
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also shared it with the mayor so that she could comment on it and be aware of what were the things that we were seeing.

186
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they talk about the first list,

187
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:13,036
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will share that some of those things are simple and some of them are language and some of them are unintended and just need to be fixed and cleaned up.

188
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:20,918
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some other comments in there that we need to be thinking about when we look at the uses in our use table.

189
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:27,462
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of interesting old uses in there, and some are very unclear.

190
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:38,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And a very easy off-the-cuff example is in terms of restaurants and food services, we have exactly two definitions, restaurants,

191
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,457
[SPEAKER_01]: and restaurants with drive-through.

192
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:46,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, it's technically eating establishments and eating establishments with drive-through.

193
00:19:46,483 --> 00:20:01,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And one might actually think about the fact that we might want to have different zones that would allow coffee shops and different rules for coffee shops, for restaurants, for fast food establishments,

194
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:05,760
[SPEAKER_01]: that there might be, in fact, some number of categories that we should have.

195
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:13,544
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we have had people, there's a building that has come in front of the city that we've been encouraging ground floor commercial.

196
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:20,789
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, well, we want to put an eating establishment in the first floor and a shop.

197
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:31,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality is what they think and what members of the community have talked to me agree is that a coffee shop would be great in that location, but it might not be a great location for a full-blown restaurant.

198
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:36,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, yeah, no, we're all on the same page, but there is no way in our zoning

199
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:43,646
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually give them permission to have a coffee shop, but not a restaurant, for example.

200
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:46,210
[SPEAKER_01]: And that tool should be available, right?

201
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:52,739
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of things like that that are in our use table that we kind of need to look at what are the uses.

202
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,866
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a big structural issue with Medford zoning.

203
00:20:57,267 --> 00:21:03,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be clear, the use table and this structural issue I'm going to mention predate the recodification.

204
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,954
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not new issues that have been introduced.

205
00:21:06,994 --> 00:21:08,835
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the way it's been for a very long time.

206
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:12,198
[SPEAKER_01]: You might think about communities and say,

207
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:27,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in your downtown district, you would want like maybe a zero to five foot setback because you want your area to be walkable and you want the buildings very close to the sidewalk so that it's really very accessible right there.

208
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:33,521
[SPEAKER_01]: but that in your neighborhoods with houses, you want maybe 15 or 20 foot setback.

209
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:43,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford's not actually planned that way so that you say in this district, whatever it is, it's up against the sidewalk and in that area, whatever it is, it's setback.

210
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:49,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Our zoning is that if it's a single family house, these are the dimensions that apply.

211
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,371
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is a commercial building, these are the dimensions.

212
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,173
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's an industrial building, these are the dimensions.

213
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:00,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's regardless of where in the city they are, those dimensions apply.

214
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:10,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes for this very disjointed community where if you have a house next to a commercial building, you might have a commercial building set forward and a house set far back.

215
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:17,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's a tall building, the dimensions that we require, and I always get it wrong, but it's something like,

216
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:24,782
[SPEAKER_01]: height times width divided by length or something like that is the setback from the curb that is required.

217
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:28,825
[SPEAKER_01]: So the taller your building is, the further from the curb it needs to be set back.

218
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:32,287
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might have been a great idea in the 1960s.

219
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:39,472
[SPEAKER_01]: But today, we don't actually want our tall buildings surrounded by a sea of parking lots and open spaces.

220
00:22:39,953 --> 00:22:47,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some of the bigger structural issues that we're really interested in also working through.

221
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:54,845
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not necessarily the most sexy things, but they would make for better planning and better city design and layout.

222
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:59,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the things that are listed, but we don't have all the solutions, right?

223
00:22:59,768 --> 00:23:04,910
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't listed all the uses that we'd like to see in the table, just that we need to evaluate the uses.

224
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,832
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't said which uses are allowed where.

225
00:23:08,632 --> 00:23:12,974
[SPEAKER_01]: We've said we should evaluate which uses are allowed where, but not actually given our

226
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:18,582
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the things that we need to hash out over the next couple of months.

227
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:26,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume we'll need to have some working sessions where we meet with the consultant, we talk offline, and then we'll bring stuff back to the public meetings.

228
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:33,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be clear, I think it's also helpful to make sure everybody understands

229
00:23:33,972 --> 00:23:35,834
[SPEAKER_01]: the legal portion of the process.

230
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:42,380
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to actually change the zoning, there has to be a couple of public hearings.

231
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:47,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these meetings will occur and we'll have some working meetings in our office.

232
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:56,253
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have some meetings in the public here, but then in order for it to actually change the zoning, there must be the exact language has to be proposed.

233
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,936
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to come to the city council to be referred

234
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:00,177
[SPEAKER_01]: to the CD board.

235
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:01,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually an interesting question.

236
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:02,958
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the required referral.

237
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:05,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it just go straight to the CD board?

238
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:13,004
[SPEAKER_01]: But the CD board then has to, the community development board has to have a public hearing that would be publicly noticed.

239
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:20,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have to make a recommendation to the city council, which has to have a public hearing that has to be publicly noticed.

240
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:24,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is at that time that the zoning would actually change.

241
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:26,953
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to make sure everybody's clear that there would be these

242
00:24:27,503 --> 00:24:33,507
[SPEAKER_01]: required steps in public meetings in order to make any actual language changes.

243
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:36,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of rambled a little.

244
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,831
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have our economic development director is very interested in this.

245
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:43,653
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not here tonight because he's at a Chevalier Commission meeting.

246
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:54,960
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working with the Donahue Institute, which is a quasi state agency out of UMass Amherst to look at some economic development studies.

247
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,881
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some funding

248
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:59,940
[SPEAKER_01]: to do some deep dives, particularly around the Wellington area and West Medford.

249
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:06,485
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that we can coordinate that with this process to help facilitate some of the work that we want to do.

250
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:23,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a climate zoning policy planner, who part of her grant funding is to help change, wait, did I say climate policy planner, but part of her grant funding is to help change zoning and policy in the city.

251
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:25,333
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it more green.

252
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:38,728
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody has the green things and they want to consult with professional staff, Brenda Pike on my staff, I think she may be on the Zoom tonight, but she is available to work on climate-related zoning topics.

253
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:42,832
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a third one that I was going to mention.

254
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:53,194
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyhow, I just wanted to let you know, oh, Danielle Evans, our senior planner will be very involved, but we unfortunately had to schedule a community development board meeting tonight.

255
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,976
[SPEAKER_01]: So she is staffing that meeting while I'm here.

256
00:25:57,096 --> 00:26:01,318
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of engagement and excitement from our office on it.

257
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:07,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Scott, our building commissioner is here if you want to have any say.

258
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:20,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, I'm Scott van der Waals name I am the building commission in here about six weeks, but I have been deep into the zoning, because it's something we cannot escape on a daily basis down there with the staff.

259
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:28,458
[SPEAKER_06]: We're always having to understand it interpret read through it back and forth to understand this people come before us looking for.

260
00:26:29,198 --> 00:26:30,399
[SPEAKER_06]: questions to be answered.

261
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,100
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly we understand the minutiae of it, the enforcement of it.

262
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:40,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have started to develop our own list of things we'd like to have conversations about as well.

263
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:42,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So I look forward to doing this.

264
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:53,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to learning how we all put it together so I can best communicate it to my staff so they can ultimately explain it to the folks who come before us and everybody kind of understands, hey, where did it come from?

265
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,748
[SPEAKER_06]: What were we thinking when we got there?

266
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:56,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's how we have to do that.

267
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:57,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to it.

268
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoy zoning.

269
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Many building commissioners don't.

270
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent 10 years doing zoning and enforcement for the community that I came from.

271
00:27:05,231 --> 00:27:10,432
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was on a Danvers zoning board for four or five years prior to that.

272
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:13,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got a lot of background in it from other communities.

273
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:15,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to bringing that to everything.

274
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:19,334
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just kind of enjoy zoning.

275
00:27:19,434 --> 00:27:23,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So I welcome this opportunity to get into it, deep dive.

276
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:34,420
[SPEAKER_06]: and learn and hopefully offer some constructive arguments, plus, for, minus, against, whatever it is, and look forward to see what comes out on the end.

277
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,061
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you.

278
00:27:39,503 --> 00:27:40,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

279
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:45,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions, comments from my fellow, Councilor Callahan?

280
00:27:45,765 --> 00:28:08,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna throw in one thing that I've heard from some constituents, and I think we should also think carefully about because it does seem like a post pandemic request, but folks who have been working from home would, folks that I've heard from would really appreciate having a mini office space that they could go to that's very close to their home.

281
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:14,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's another thing we could think about as a possible zoning is having these micro pockets of,

282
00:28:16,143 --> 00:28:35,095
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, tiny office space, like, you know, one of these spaces where you just rent a desk, tiny micro office space, coffee shop, lunch place, something like that, which would allow people to sort of start getting out of their homes who currently don't have to go to work.

283
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:37,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

284
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:39,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

285
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:48,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have one question, which could either be answered by Scott or Alicia, or perhaps, and his associates.

286
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:56,453
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think would be, how would sort of the projects that individual Councilors brought forward be incorporated into this?

287
00:28:56,493 --> 00:29:04,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So for instance, I have some ADU things I'm working on, as well as the Transportation Demand Management Program in committee.

288
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:06,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you,

289
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:12,501
[SPEAKER_09]: how would you see that sort of being incorporated into this overall process?

290
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:18,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there some things that could be done independently or should it be sort of integrated into these meetings?

291
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:35,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Chair, so if I might, as I'm speaking off the cuff for the group, my thought is that if what you're interested in are items that clearly fit in zoning, right, so we have ADUs in zoning and you want to change what's in there,

292
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:43,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't run this by Emily, but what I'm thinking is that we should shuttle things through the staff.

293
00:29:43,753 --> 00:29:46,034
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should send me a note explaining what you want.

294
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:53,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I pass that on to Emily, or the little sub team of us that's looking at it.

295
00:29:54,317 --> 00:30:02,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody from her team would actually talk to you directly and work through to try and understand what it is and how it could fit into everything.

296
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,562
[SPEAKER_01]: But that we would use city staff as sort of the,

297
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,401
[SPEAKER_01]: gateway introduction to that, if that makes sense.

298
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:15,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would be maintaining a list of what are all the different things that are going on.

299
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:20,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Council President Bears.

300
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:28,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, yeah, and if I could just, I think we, and I think we're gonna make a few motions to this, or I'm gonna make a few motions to this effect once we've had discussion, but.

301
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:31,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I think like pretty much what Alicia just said is right.

302
00:30:31,284 --> 00:30:41,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's like, let's take these buckets and say, you know, there's a lot of people we need to get input from a city team, council, you know, ZBA, people on different commissions.

303
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:45,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's have people communicate back through Daniel and Alicia.

304
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:53,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if there are, I know that for example, Councilor Callahan, you have some climate plan implementation items that you wanna work on.

305
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:57,870
[SPEAKER_05]: You have some things outside of the climate plan related to climate that you're interested in that are related to zoning.

306
00:30:58,735 --> 00:31:17,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the motions that I'll make in a minute is that councilors submit, you know, within a couple of weeks to, and it doesn't mean that we can't come up with new things in the future, or if you think of something when we have the meetings, but submit like the different ideas that you think fall into one of the 10 or so buckets that were outlined earlier to the planning staff.

307
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,754
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as Alicia said, they can all be sorted.

308
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:23,116
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think similarly, I'm gonna make a motion to ask

309
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:35,840
[SPEAKER_05]: the building commissioner to have him and his team, as you're working through it every day, what's the list of specific issues that maybe the planning staff hasn't taken a look at yet or doesn't know about?

310
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:44,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Submit those to them and that can be added into the short, quick fix process.

311
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:50,765
[SPEAKER_05]: As well, I would like to personally send through the council, through the clerk, make a motion to send

312
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:56,248
[SPEAKER_05]: the same request to the zoning board and the community development board.

313
00:31:56,268 --> 00:32:05,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know that the staff of different departments works with those boards, but I think the members themselves may have some similar thoughts, especially around the quick fixes, but maybe in general around, you know,

314
00:32:07,145 --> 00:32:16,369
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't permit a lot of ADUs right now, even though it's part of the zoning, or we run into constantly having appeals on these specific issues that don't really need to be appeals.

315
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of, I think, how the process would be envisioned to work.

316
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:26,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So those discrete items would be incorporated, and then we could schedule out the meetings on those topics, go through.

317
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:28,955
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we have on climate, we have a list of 14 things.

318
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:34,054
[SPEAKER_05]: And his associates team has been able to do some research on it.

319
00:32:34,094 --> 00:32:36,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the feedback, maybe even some draft language.

320
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:44,860
[SPEAKER_05]: We can then have the discussion here, comment, edit, and then eventually create zoning amendments out of each of those discrete items.

321
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:53,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty much how we did, and correct me if I'm wrong, Alicia, how we worked with Mark Wabrowski on the recodification too.

322
00:32:53,546 --> 00:32:56,948
[SPEAKER_05]: We took different major sections of the zoning ordinance.

323
00:32:57,288 --> 00:32:57,989
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we had a,

324
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:00,193
[SPEAKER_05]: talked about different pieces of it.

325
00:33:00,473 --> 00:33:01,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right.

326
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:09,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but one of the, I guess there is some general structure that would remain the same anyhow, even if you completely rewrite a section.

327
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:15,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause some of what I, I should actually say that we welcome questions.

328
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:20,204
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we had talked about was doing, putting out a simple form to the community.

329
00:33:20,804 --> 00:33:27,369
[SPEAKER_01]: that if people have things in zoning that they love, they should tell us what that is so we don't mess it up.

330
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:38,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they have things in zoning that's been their pet peeve that they always wanna see change, they should tell us because maybe there's a sore point out there that we haven't actually picked up on yet.

331
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:39,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, could be.

332
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know everything.

333
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:47,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I have also mentioned this a couple of times to the zoning board and the planning board

334
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:53,410
[SPEAKER_01]: and encourage them to tell us what are things that they would like to see changed.

335
00:33:53,930 --> 00:34:02,298
[SPEAKER_01]: And an example might be that if the zoning board often gets people coming to them for variances,

336
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:16,890
[SPEAKER_01]: We allow building homes that are two and a half stories, which means your third floor can meet half the square footage of your second floor, but people want to bump that out a little bit with some dormers, and they have to go to the zoning board.

337
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:22,775
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it may actually be that we want to allow two and three quarters, or we want to allow certain kinds of dormers.

338
00:34:23,455 --> 00:34:29,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would dramatically cut back the number of people having to go to the zoning board to put a dormer on their house.

339
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:43,931
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the kinds of suggestions that I would really like to see from the zoning board to like, what are the things that would cut down on things that they look at and say, well, of course we should say yes to this.

340
00:34:44,011 --> 00:34:48,395
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely reasonable and it's not gonna cause problem for anybody.

341
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:58,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are bigger things that we need to have community kind of input and conversation on, like allowing two families in single family districts, stuff like that.

342
00:34:58,594 --> 00:35:04,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the controversial things that maybe we don't touch this time, but I want to hear from people.

343
00:35:05,257 --> 00:35:11,299
[SPEAKER_01]: We get that actually at ZBA a lot, people who want to turn their single family into a two family.

344
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:14,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to hear them so we know what the issues are.

345
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,062
[SPEAKER_01]: So I should have done it before now,

346
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:32,008
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll have somebody set up probably a Google form for people to just send us thoughts, not a big survey, just like two or three, two questions and give us your contact information if you want to ever hear back from us about it.

347
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:40,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll probably, Anna, connect you with Brenda, the planning, the climate person.

348
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:46,211
[SPEAKER_01]: She also has a list of things that she wants to send over to us to send to Emily as well.

349
00:35:47,441 --> 00:35:55,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I could, Mr. Chair, just if I could just add, I think something really important to add here is

350
00:35:57,065 --> 00:36:13,798
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of these areas are coming out of and specifically drawn from extensive planning processes that have already occurred that had extensive public process, shredding, focus groups, public meetings, dozens of public meetings, many of which I was part of.

351
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:22,325
[SPEAKER_05]: For Medford Square, we have, as I think Councilor Scarpellino has mentioned, we have several plans over several decades at this point.

352
00:36:22,385 --> 00:36:24,207
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we have a meeting on major squares,

353
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:42,904
[SPEAKER_05]: When we have a meeting on Medford Square, we can finally take those many, many plans that never amounted to anything and turn those into action and take the best pieces of those that exist and put them into action.

354
00:36:42,964 --> 00:36:44,805
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just something really important here too.

355
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:52,812
[SPEAKER_05]: we're taking, I think, the sum of a lot of great work that has been ongoing, that has been worked out.

356
00:36:53,352 --> 00:37:12,988
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Councilor Caraviello and I did a ton of time on the comprehensive plan, and there's very specific zoning recommendations coming out of the comprehensive plan, the housing production plan, the climate plan, especially, and the different bike plans and some of the other more local neighborhood-focused plans, but taking those and

357
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:14,164
[SPEAKER_05]: and.

358
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:17,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Turning them into zoning language, I think is a big piece of this.

359
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:19,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's important to put that out there, too.

360
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:29,172
[SPEAKER_05]: We're outlining an extensive public process with dozens of public meetings ahead of us in this committee in the public hearings in the council, the public meetings of the Community Development Board.

361
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:36,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Building on what I think it's probably fair to say is dozens, if not hundreds of public meetings over the past.

362
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:44,779
[SPEAKER_05]: and making it actionable.

363
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:50,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So this isn't like day one, you know, new idea coming out of nowhere.

364
00:37:50,881 --> 00:38:01,043
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the culmination of extensive work engaging this community and designing the future that we all want to see.

365
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:03,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited to do that work.

366
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:11,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just think it's important to outline all of that here at the start of this piece of the project, because it is not

367
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:21,858
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's just important to outline that now, that this is not just the start right now, today, day one, where we haven't had any conversations.

368
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:32,025
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a ton of process that led up to this point and into what we are in my considering kind of a final phase of a very long project.

369
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:40,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, I think maybe we should build something in here too that future councils reconsider and look at these items in the future, but so that we don't end up waiting

370
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:56,985
[SPEAKER_05]: having plans that sit on shelves for 20 years, or like we did with the zoning recodification with Mark Bobrowski, having it be the first time since the 60s that we actually looked at the structure of the ordinance, or having, you know, I was just reading through the zoning ordinance earlier today looking for some stuff.

371
00:38:57,786 --> 00:38:59,006
[SPEAKER_05]: There's probably some provisions from

372
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:03,437
[SPEAKER_05]: 1925 in there, you know, from the first ever zoning map.

373
00:39:03,777 --> 00:39:12,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's probably not many, but I just think adding that kind of future focus vision too, to say, this is, we've done a lot of process.

374
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:16,129
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what the community today thinks zoning should look like.

375
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:23,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, you know, and certainly in 60 years, but my guess in 10 or 15 years, people might have some different ideas too.

376
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:24,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, you know,

377
00:39:25,387 --> 00:39:25,767
[SPEAKER_05]: that we've done.

378
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:25,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

379
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:33,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Putting this in the context of the work that we've done, and the work that will come ahead is just an important thing to do as we embark on this ambitious project.

380
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:34,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

381
00:39:35,555 --> 00:39:48,124
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mr. Chair, if I might, I just would like to mention that if people wanted to see a lot of these plans, so on the city's website, if you went to departments, planning, planning,

382
00:39:55,723 --> 00:40:01,033
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the ones that we've referenced, and many, many plans about Medford Square.

383
00:40:01,714 --> 00:40:03,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody feels

384
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:07,784
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as if you click open sustainability, there are several plans there.

385
00:40:09,384 --> 00:40:16,127
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody feels that we are missing plans that they can't find and would like to see on there, just email us.

386
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:23,210
[SPEAKER_01]: The easiest way to email my office is the letters OCD at medford-ma.gov.

387
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would go to, if you just, why isn't this plan on the website?

388
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:31,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that would get it up there.

389
00:40:32,154 --> 00:40:32,954
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll add them.

390
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:35,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.

391
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:37,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see that Ms.

392
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:40,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Inez had her hand up prior, put it down and then has her hand up again.

393
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,440
[SPEAKER_09]: So would you feel free to, yeah.

394
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:45,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thank you so much.

395
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:57,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to just touch on a couple of comments that came up first for Councilor Callahan, I think, who'd asked about the policies, specific policies.

396
00:40:57,597 --> 00:41:00,179
[SPEAKER_00]: The segues nicely from what Alicia just mentioned.

397
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:12,331
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, for those of the maybe people who have been watching who are not familiar with the comprehensive plan, page 195 starts off the future land use and zoning section of the plan.

398
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:35,084
[SPEAKER_00]: It established a framework at the time for how this conversation might go about updating the zoning and what that would mean, and it draws at a very high level on the other planning processes, the climate, the housing work that had been done to date, in addition to what had come through the planning process for the comprehensive plan.

399
00:41:35,644 --> 00:41:42,630
[SPEAKER_00]: and starts to highlight geographic areas, but also policy areas for City Council to consider.

400
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:54,540
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll certainly be drawing on that, understanding that you all have had conversations, that we're having a conversation now, and that those conversations are going to continue through this process.

401
00:41:56,101 --> 00:42:02,305
[SPEAKER_00]: To Council President Bears's point, this very much is a public process.

402
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:16,174
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some known things that are coming out of city work to date that has been part of a public process that can move forward, but it still has to go through the City Council's approval process, as Alicia mentioned.

403
00:42:16,574 --> 00:42:23,619
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other things, for example, when we get to the squares, when we get to the corridors, when we get to some of the city policies,

404
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:39,912
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to require further public input and that is very much part of this planning process and this process of bringing forward new zoning for recommendation to City Council and potential approval, again, part of another public process.

405
00:42:40,012 --> 00:42:44,015
[SPEAKER_00]: So, people should feel that throughout this they have a voice.

406
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:46,717
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll work with Alicia and her team to set up

407
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:50,280
[SPEAKER_00]: that Google form and check it regularly.

408
00:42:51,001 --> 00:43:00,891
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the idea of small bites at the beginning, but I would expect those to become peppered throughout the process as new things come forward during the conversation.

409
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:05,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that we're going to do all the small things by June 30th and they'll be done.

410
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:09,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will get done, some of them will get talked about perhaps

411
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,722
[SPEAKER_00]: but incorporated in other components.

412
00:43:13,143 --> 00:43:15,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's something that comes up that's not ready yet.

413
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:16,485
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more input.

414
00:43:16,905 --> 00:43:18,546
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll happen later in the process.

415
00:43:18,586 --> 00:43:24,210
[SPEAKER_00]: So people who are listening in should look at this as the beginning of a long conversation.

416
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:30,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have time to get input in, time to think about things, and respond to questions we may be asking them.

417
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:31,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

418
00:43:34,457 --> 00:43:34,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

419
00:43:35,762 --> 00:43:38,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli, did you wanna speak?

420
00:43:38,169 --> 00:43:41,477
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see your hand up, but you were saying something earlier.

421
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:48,370
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Councilor, thank you very much.

422
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:55,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I just made a smart comment with Councilor Bears about our Medford Square plans.

423
00:43:55,312 --> 00:44:12,638
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to, I think that as we're moving through this process, now that I have the floor for a minute, I think what was important as we've seen, when you see these successful community impacts and sharing, I think that are we going to be putting forward

424
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:22,202
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, community based meetings where we're going from each area of the community to ask, ask for their input.

425
00:44:22,622 --> 00:44:24,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that's something we talked about at the meetings.

426
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:35,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that's something that when I talked to constituents and we talked about what they would like to see their, their, uh, community look like, I think it was important that we, um,

427
00:44:37,284 --> 00:44:44,055
[SPEAKER_07]: we really tried to reach out and have more interactive meetings in their backyards.

428
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:46,439
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that would be important as well.

429
00:44:49,704 --> 00:44:51,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

430
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:56,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chairwoman, I appreciate that.

431
00:44:56,484 --> 00:45:00,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's note just now.

432
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:10,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I think as we get into the more neighborhood-based planning part of this process, certainly we should consider having some of these committee meetings perhaps located in the neighborhoods that they'll be affecting.

433
00:45:11,096 --> 00:45:18,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that that used to be something that before my time on the Council, the Council would occasionally hold committees of the whole out in the real world, outside of the chambers.

434
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:22,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that might be an appropriate thing to consider when we're

435
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:26,607
[SPEAKER_04]: doing neighborhood-specific zoning changes later in the year.

436
00:45:27,367 --> 00:45:41,795
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just wanted to underscore a point that's already been made, but that I think is really important, is that we have so many ideas and high-level policies to go on that are already, you know, the result of these months and months and years of community meetings about

437
00:45:42,775 --> 00:45:46,296
[SPEAKER_04]: what we want to see in the community and what the zoning is that could bring those about.

438
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:55,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Those ideas from community members, those proposals from residents and from business owners, those were not, the point of those ideas is not to live in a plan.

439
00:45:55,999 --> 00:46:01,781
[SPEAKER_04]: The point of those ideas is to be put into our zoning ordinances so that our city can evolve to be more what we envision.

440
00:46:02,502 --> 00:46:08,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just say, I think it's important for us to go into this process and also for residents who are perhaps

441
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:30,018
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, rejoining this effort, you know, for the first time in several months or years to know that, you know, this is the intent of this Council is to take the will of the community that has been expressed in part through these plans that have already been published, you know, and do the good work of making sure that those are actually going to become a reality in our community through the changes that we're going to make.

442
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:53,278
[SPEAKER_04]: With just, you know, about 10 or 15 minutes left here, I know President Bears mentioned that he had a couple motions in mind, so I'll defer to him, but I think for me the most important thing, kind of pivoting to thinking about next steps, we have penciled in that we will revisit this topic again at a couple meetings in October, I'm sorry, in April on the 10th and the 24th.

443
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:11,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be really great progress, if starting on the 10th, we have a better idea of what those kind of smaller tweaks to change in the zoning ordinances are based on feedback from city staff, and I would

444
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:35,977
[SPEAKER_04]: especially support a motion to have Councilors submit their specific proposals, ideas from the governing agenda, from our various plans, new proposals to council leadership and the PBS team so that those can be compiled and we can review that as a team at our next committee meeting on this topic and move forward from there with the timeline.

445
00:47:35,997 --> 00:47:40,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

446
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:42,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any motions from the floor?

447
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:44,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Council President Bears.

448
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:47,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Councilor Callahan.

449
00:47:47,752 --> 00:47:49,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, I just had a question.

450
00:47:50,855 --> 00:48:02,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be really helpful to be able to see the list of minor changes that have been requested from staff and from the Zoning Board, and what is our best way of doing that within open meeting law?

451
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:08,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we request that they send those to us in advance of a meeting and then make those public, or are they ready to do that?

452
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:13,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you feel like we're at a space where that would be useful for the City Council to see that list?

453
00:48:13,772 --> 00:48:18,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so it's just that it's messy and it has like commentary on it.

454
00:48:18,514 --> 00:48:20,775
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have no problem with the councilors seeing it.

455
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:25,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't use that list in that version in a public meeting.

456
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:31,161
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually in fact a few things that we've been using it for a while.

457
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:36,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the changes that were adopted last September are still in there that we need to make sure.

458
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hesitant to mark them off without actually having somebody

459
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:45,627
[SPEAKER_01]: do a side-by-side comparison and make sure we caught them, that we were right as we were knocking them off.

460
00:48:46,487 --> 00:48:55,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sending them the list to the Councilors, and then if they want to bring comments to a public meeting makes complete sense within public meeting law.

461
00:48:56,209 --> 00:49:00,851
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that if you were to comment on the document, then that would be

462
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:04,890
[SPEAKER_01]: circumventing public meeting law, right?

463
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:09,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you were to put your comments in a shared document, that's not allowed.

464
00:49:09,453 --> 00:49:13,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think if you could just download it, if you could download a copy and circulate it.

465
00:49:13,756 --> 00:49:13,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

466
00:49:14,036 --> 00:49:15,517
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd send it to the clerk to circulate.

467
00:49:15,938 --> 00:49:16,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

468
00:49:16,398 --> 00:49:17,098
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

469
00:49:17,138 --> 00:49:17,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

470
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:18,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

471
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:24,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I may remove the whole section on definitions because I am, I just want to double check.

472
00:49:24,323 --> 00:49:28,486
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got all those definitions reinsert correctly now.

473
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:32,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like three pages of actually already done.

474
00:49:32,624 --> 00:49:35,165
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to bother you with things that are done.

475
00:49:35,866 --> 00:49:38,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we did a big, big chunk at the end of the year.

476
00:49:46,357 --> 00:49:49,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, do we have any motions from floor just if I could?

477
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:50,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a couple of things.

478
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:56,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So first, um, just I want to double down on what Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Collins were saying.

479
00:49:56,082 --> 00:49:59,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that Emily was saying as well around the community meetings.

480
00:49:59,304 --> 00:49:59,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I think

481
00:50:00,117 --> 00:50:26,077
[SPEAKER_05]: when we talk about the major squares and corridors, I think it'd be great, not just to have necessarily planning permitting, but also just to have, you know, community meetings, a South Medford meeting, a West Medford meeting, a Hayden Square meeting, a Medford Square meeting, a Wellington meeting to talk about the major squares and the connecting corridors and neighborhood issues as we get more into that piece of the project that's about the neighborhood and district.

482
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:35,263
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what I'm really was saying as well in terms of the public engagement community process, so I think 100% that idea is going to be.

483
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:42,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of what we do, and then we can take that additional feedback and incorporated into the work that we've already, you know.

484
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:47,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Have coming out of the comprehensive plan, so I think those are going to be, um.

485
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:49,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Great meetings to have and an

486
00:50:56,112 --> 00:51:01,814
[SPEAKER_05]: informal session, which I know we all are doing all the time outside of these meetings that happen in this room.

487
00:51:01,874 --> 00:51:13,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're all out in the community, but we have occasionally been able to have on-site meetings, which is always fun, except when it's raining, then it's not so much fun.

488
00:51:14,977 --> 00:51:23,420
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of motions, I think my first motion would be to request feedback from the

489
00:51:24,895 --> 00:51:42,790
[SPEAKER_05]: building commissioner, the chair of the Zoning Board of Appeals and the chair of the Community Development Board on issues that they are seeing with the zoning ordinance that they would like to see amended.

490
00:51:44,892 --> 00:51:47,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And to have that by April 5th.

491
00:51:54,807 --> 00:51:56,967
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we can have that for our April 10th meeting.

492
00:51:56,987 --> 00:51:59,508
[SPEAKER_09]: So is that all in one motion?

493
00:51:59,988 --> 00:52:02,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

494
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:03,389
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

495
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:20,012
[SPEAKER_09]: And while the clerk is typing that out, I see that we have, I'd like recognizing, I see that we have a paddy kaya on Zoom.

496
00:52:20,092 --> 00:52:21,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that our hand up for a while?

497
00:52:21,673 --> 00:52:21,893
[SPEAKER_09]: So just

498
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:27,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just go ahead and recognize her name and address for the record.

499
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:31,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is Patty Kaya, 1 Monument Street.

500
00:52:32,305 --> 00:52:52,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a member of the public observing what is likely to be a quite document-intensive process, I would like to be here to advocate for the council and the consultants to also keep in mind the ease of consumption

501
00:52:53,607 --> 00:52:57,529
[SPEAKER_03]: is critical to facilitating public participation.

502
00:52:58,169 --> 00:53:06,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So I realize there's a balance to be struck between what's legal in a municipal environment and what's ideal in the real world.

503
00:53:06,694 --> 00:53:08,275
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a professional editor.

504
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:21,582
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think in terms of, oh, if I'm interested in what are you going to update for ADUs or two-family dwellings, I want to see a redlined version so that I can understand very quickly without having to reference multiple documents

505
00:53:22,342 --> 00:53:23,462
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the old language?

506
00:53:23,502 --> 00:53:25,163
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the proposed new language?

507
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:32,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So that if I, as a member of the public, want to weigh in, I can easily weigh in and have my voice heard.

508
00:53:33,266 --> 00:53:49,251
[SPEAKER_03]: So all I'm here to say is I hope that that will be kept in high regard as you continue with this planning process, that a lot of people will participate if they're given an opportunity through ease of access and not having to reference

509
00:53:50,439 --> 00:54:01,970
[SPEAKER_03]: what you as a group, obviously you're doing the heavy lifting and I appreciate the effort that's required, but members of the public are more likely to contribute if we facilitate ease.

510
00:54:02,511 --> 00:54:05,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just hope that you keep that in high regard as you move forward.

511
00:54:05,814 --> 00:54:06,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

512
00:54:06,214 --> 00:54:08,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

513
00:54:08,897 --> 00:54:09,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Kaya.

514
00:54:09,217 --> 00:54:12,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I fully agree transparency in this process is

515
00:54:13,129 --> 00:54:13,809
[SPEAKER_09]: very important.

516
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:19,591
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been, this council has been trying to work on that for the entirety of the term.

517
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:23,572
[SPEAKER_09]: It's obviously imperfect, but point taken.

518
00:54:24,272 --> 00:54:25,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Vice President Collins.

519
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:28,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

520
00:54:28,734 --> 00:54:32,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let President Bears complete his motions and then I'll jump in if I have any remaining after that.

521
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Council President Bears.

522
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:36,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

523
00:54:36,684 --> 00:54:40,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to, you know, and this would just be an initial list.

524
00:54:40,707 --> 00:54:55,077
[SPEAKER_05]: We can come back and do it again, but also move to request that councilors submit any specific issues or policies they'd like to see included under the main topic areas as outlined by Emily Innis.

525
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:59,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we should all, maybe we can also do that by April 5th.

526
00:55:01,843 --> 00:55:08,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm writing this out now, Mr. Clerk, I realize I should have thought of written these out in advance so that I could have sent you the language.

527
00:55:09,245 --> 00:55:10,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair Lemaine, I'll second these motions.

528
00:55:15,486 --> 00:55:16,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a second for that motion?

529
00:55:18,187 --> 00:55:18,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second the motion.

530
00:55:20,787 --> 00:55:23,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very sorry, Council Vice President.

531
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:26,589
[SPEAKER_09]: That second was already taken by Councilor Callahan here.

532
00:55:30,768 --> 00:55:32,109
[SPEAKER_09]: My deepest apologies.

533
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:39,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any more motions on the floor?

534
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:45,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think if, you know, it might be helpful.

535
00:55:45,062 --> 00:55:52,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what Emily or Vice President Collins or Alicia, what you think about this.

536
00:55:54,659 --> 00:56:14,805
[SPEAKER_05]: if we want to maybe pick a couple of those citywide policy areas to discuss on the 24th, like maybe we could start with the economic development and business growth and the climate resiliency on the 24th, and we can kind of just be prepared ahead of time that, you know, we'll start with these, the fixes on the 10th, and then we could do that on the 24th.

537
00:56:14,925 --> 00:56:19,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm seeing some nodding heads, but I'm interested as well, those heads that I cannot see.

538
00:56:25,785 --> 00:56:28,046
[SPEAKER_02]: do you think we can do both?

539
00:56:30,066 --> 00:56:30,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Just timing wise.

540
00:56:30,806 --> 00:56:34,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I think economic development and climate put them both on the 24th.

541
00:56:34,447 --> 00:56:37,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we can always, if we don't get them covered, we can always put them up.

542
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:38,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's my thinking.

543
00:56:38,488 --> 00:56:47,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe we could start both or, you know, I mean, again, one of the intents of this is that, you know, the six o'clock meeting can go longer than an hour.

544
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:52,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've been planning these for an hour and I respect that, but really the intent was not to limit these to one hour meetings, I think.

545
00:56:53,763 --> 00:56:59,187
[SPEAKER_05]: if it goes two hours, if it goes two and a half hours, then the second meeting starts late, and that's just how it's gonna be.

546
00:56:59,347 --> 00:57:05,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if we expect it to be long, then we could ask the seven o'clock meeting to think about a reschedule, something like that.

547
00:57:07,753 --> 00:57:09,014
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my personal thought though.

548
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:13,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, was that a third motion?

549
00:57:14,979 --> 00:57:17,400
[SPEAKER_05]: That's up to Vice President Collins, honestly.

550
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

551
00:57:21,043 --> 00:57:21,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

552
00:57:23,408 --> 00:57:31,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it will advantage us to think ahead about what we're going to be talking about when, both in the short term and in the long term, kind of we've been talking long term tonight.

553
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:44,653
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, I imagine it will be to the advantage of Finnis Associates, which is doing most of the research and homework and prep for these meetings, if we came out ahead of time, what we at least intend to work on, even if there's a couple of options, we know that we're going to get to all of it eventually.

554
00:57:46,294 --> 00:58:02,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, especially with these couple of motions on the table, that puts us in good shape to have a more granular discussion on the 10th about what we aspire to work on when, and to have a more specific conversation about, for example, what do we mean when we say we're going to work on commercial development before September 2024?

555
00:58:03,204 --> 00:58:04,325
[SPEAKER_04]: What's involved in that?

556
00:58:04,365 --> 00:58:05,845
[SPEAKER_04]: What framework governing agenda is on that?

557
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:08,147
[SPEAKER_04]: What areas of the city are we talking about?

558
00:58:09,147 --> 00:58:11,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that'll be a really productive discussion.

559
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:14,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think with everything that we're trying to get done before September,

560
00:58:16,172 --> 00:58:20,195
[SPEAKER_04]: We should, we should continue quickly to actually getting into the weeds on those policy areas.

561
00:58:22,176 --> 00:58:32,803
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wonder if, you know, doing all of this work, requesting all this feedback from city staff and Councilors submitting ideas for inclusion on this draft timeline.

562
00:58:33,824 --> 00:58:35,845
[SPEAKER_04]: in time for our April 10th meeting.

563
00:58:38,066 --> 00:58:49,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Jumping off of the discussion that we've had today, which has been pretty high level, I think that we could be ambitious and try to touch both on draft timeline and then start to get into the weeds on economic development on the 10th.

564
00:58:49,671 --> 00:59:02,617
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't get to it, then we can plan to talk about economic development and some climate resiliency goals on the 24th, and perhaps sketch out the top lines for our May meetings as well.

565
00:59:08,029 --> 00:59:08,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

566
00:59:08,429 --> 00:59:12,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, let's tell you that's not a motion or just leave it as an idea.

567
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:12,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

568
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:13,290
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

569
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we still have two motions to be voted on.

570
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, or can you, uh, read up the first one and then we'll take roll call vote.

571
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:26,112
[SPEAKER_08]: President Bears moved to request feedback from the building commissioner at the CBA chair and the CDB chair on issues.

572
00:59:26,132 --> 00:59:32,133
[SPEAKER_08]: They're see they're seeing with the zoning ordinance would like to see amended and to get this feedback by April 5th for the April 10th meeting.

573
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,433
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a second from Councilor Callahan on that.

574
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:36,294
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

575
00:59:36,374 --> 00:59:37,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Clerk, please call the roll.

576
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:40,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan?

577
00:59:40,732 --> 00:59:40,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

578
00:59:41,432 --> 00:59:42,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins?

579
00:59:43,133 --> 00:59:43,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

580
00:59:44,494 --> 00:59:45,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

581
00:59:49,678 --> 00:59:49,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

582
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:51,840
[SPEAKER_08]: President Bears?

583
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:52,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

584
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:53,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair Leming?

585
00:59:53,821 --> 01:00:00,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

586
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:02,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Clerk, would you be able to read out the second motion?

587
01:00:03,168 --> 01:00:03,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Second motion.

588
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:08,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Bears is going to have councilors submit topic areas that they would like to see covered by Ms.

589
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:12,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Innes, and also to have that information by April 5th for the April 10th meeting.

590
01:00:13,122 --> 01:00:14,724
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a second for Councilor Callahan on that.

591
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:16,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

592
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:17,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you please call the roll?

593
01:00:18,007 --> 01:00:18,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

594
01:00:18,988 --> 01:00:20,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got one typo here that I need to fix.

595
01:00:21,671 --> 01:00:27,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have a kind of a slightly same intent, slightly different wording.

596
01:00:27,356 --> 01:00:28,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll email it to you.

597
01:00:29,741 --> 01:00:31,142
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just read it to me right now if you want.

598
01:00:31,703 --> 01:00:43,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll email it to you anyway, but it's just motion to request that councillors on both of its motion requests, the commissioner, chair of the zoning board, chair of the community development board, submit comments on the issues they're seeing with the zoning ordinance and any proposed amendments by Friday, April 5th.

599
01:00:43,972 --> 01:00:47,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other one is motion to request that councillors submit specific policy issues.

600
01:00:49,414 --> 01:00:56,156
[SPEAKER_05]: They would like to see addressed under each major topic area for the zoning project included in the presentation by Innis Associates by Friday, April 5th.

601
01:00:56,917 --> 01:01:04,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think both of these should be that these should be submitted to Director Hunt and Vice President Collins.

602
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:06,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

603
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,801
[SPEAKER_08]: If you email it to me, I'll plug that into the committee report.

604
01:01:08,821 --> 01:01:09,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll change what I have in here.

605
01:01:11,522 --> 01:01:14,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second from Councilor Callahan on that?

606
01:01:16,564 --> 01:01:17,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Please call the roll when you're ready.

607
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:19,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan?

608
01:01:19,271 --> 01:01:19,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

609
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:21,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins?

610
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:22,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

611
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:23,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

612
01:01:24,155 --> 01:01:24,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

613
01:01:25,316 --> 01:01:25,976
[SPEAKER_08]: President Bears?

614
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:29,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

615
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:29,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair Lohmann?

616
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:30,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

617
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

618
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:40,469
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, do we have any further input from members of the public?

619
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:45,093
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, seeing none, Vice President Collins.

620
01:01:46,052 --> 01:01:47,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chair Lehmann.

621
01:01:48,315 --> 01:02:00,528
[SPEAKER_04]: With those motions behind us, I just wanted to thank Innis Associates, the whole team, for the first time joining us in committee to talk about the zoning revocation, sorry, the zoning overhaul.

622
01:02:00,548 --> 01:02:02,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like 2022 over here.

623
01:02:04,946 --> 01:02:09,567
[SPEAKER_04]: As we've all stated, really excited to be continuing this project with you.

624
01:02:09,587 --> 01:02:18,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're going to spend many evenings in the chambers and on Zoom together, putting all of these ideas and proposals and changes into our zoning code.

625
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:24,011
[SPEAKER_04]: We are really glad to have you, speaking for myself, very glad to have you on board, excited to be doing this process with you.

626
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:25,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your time tonight and your preparation.

627
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:37,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you to my colleagues for coming prepared to kick off this project, which will certainly dominate the work of this committee this term.

628
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I would motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn.

629
01:02:40,843 --> 01:02:43,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

630
01:02:44,926 --> 01:02:53,453
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to keep the paper in committee and adjourn, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

631
01:02:54,374 --> 01:02:55,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

632
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:09,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

633
01:03:14,597 --> 01:03:14,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

634
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:16,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

635
01:03:16,699 --> 01:03:17,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

636
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:17,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

637
01:03:18,601 --> 01:03:19,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Meeting is adjourned.

638
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you everyone for coming out tonight.
