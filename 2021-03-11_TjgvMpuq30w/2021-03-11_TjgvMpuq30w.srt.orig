1
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:08,717
[SPEAKER_33]: First of all, I love the historical research and I personally think that is a contender for the name.

2
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:12,121
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't think we should limit our name only to people.

3
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:21,129
[SPEAKER_33]: I think just going ahead and voting on that tonight, we would not be following any of our policies.

4
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:25,093
[SPEAKER_33]: We wouldn't be following our naming policy, which there is actually a naming policy.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:32,266
[SPEAKER_33]: I think we've kind of set people up for expecting that there might be a process for naming.

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:39,412
[SPEAKER_33]: There's a whole lot of me which would like to say yes, but you know, let's just vote it now and over with.

7
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:44,337
[SPEAKER_33]: I will tell you that from all the letters we've received and the discussions we've had,

8
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:52,419
[SPEAKER_33]: there will certainly still be part of our population which disagrees with the change altogether, no matter what we say or do.

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,321
[SPEAKER_33]: And that is because they feel that something is being taken away from them.

10
00:00:57,021 --> 00:01:08,684
[SPEAKER_33]: And of course, all of my efforts have this point have been trying to move us in a direction where we could in fact choose a name, which is good for everybody.

11
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:11,265
[SPEAKER_33]: And I do think your suggestion hits that.

12
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:20,341
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, as vice chair, I need to report that there were more than 100 letters in the school committee account.

13
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:31,407
[SPEAKER_33]: Many of those letters, and if I read all 100, we will literally be here for hours and hours.

14
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,131
[SPEAKER_33]: We could just turn off this and I could read for the next five hours and start our discussion at midnight.

15
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:39,612
[SPEAKER_33]: So I want to mention,

16
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:55,576
[SPEAKER_33]: right now that we had 96 people asking us to supporting the name change and we received one petition from our resolution with 391 Medford residents signing.

17
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:11,299
[SPEAKER_33]: The other last time we did receive a petition from Medford United, which also had, I think it was close to 600 Medford residents signing.

18
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,300
[SPEAKER_33]: And I did read that.

19
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:20,566
[SPEAKER_33]: If I need to go back, I can find that and read it into, all of this will be put into the record though.

20
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:25,510
[SPEAKER_33]: A little tricky because in this particular time, we only have three communications

21
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:30,096
[SPEAKER_33]: opposed to the name change.

22
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:34,679
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, and we know that there are far more letters.

23
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:39,642
[SPEAKER_33]: Some of the letters have come into my private account as opposed to the school committee account.

24
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:51,431
[SPEAKER_33]: We did receive one letter from Mr. Petrella, which I'm just going to mention because he said that he had his hand raised or was, and he didn't get to speak at our last meeting.

25
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:55,734
[SPEAKER_33]: So I want to make sure that we're not overlooking anybody.

26
00:02:56,428 --> 00:03:00,069
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Van de Kloet, if I may, I did get that email as well.

27
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:06,290
[SPEAKER_41]: And I did respond because Dr. Cushing and I, we were going by the raised hand function.

28
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,231
[SPEAKER_41]: So I did respond that we called on everybody, including two people twice.

29
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:20,414
[SPEAKER_41]: So I wanted to confirm with him that he wasn't physically raising his hand, make sure his camera was on, because I'm very cognizant of that as are all the committee members.

30
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:27,305
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, and I would personally like to ask, if people are speaking, please turn on your cameras so we can see you.

31
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:33,267
[SPEAKER_33]: It's just, I know you're not mandated to, but it is much easier for us.

32
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:36,428
[SPEAKER_33]: So if you can, that's a personal request.

33
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,969
[SPEAKER_33]: If you don't want to, that's your option, I guess.

34
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:49,031
[SPEAKER_33]: Anyway, so that's the letters received up to this point, and they've been coming in pretty consistently.

35
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:52,773
[SPEAKER_33]: At this point, I'll just give it as report.

36
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:54,554
[SPEAKER_33]: They'll be all put into the record.

37
00:03:55,755 --> 00:04:00,078
[SPEAKER_33]: And if anybody wishes me to do anything differently, I can.

38
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,641
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm at the it's at the will of the committee.

39
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:10,526
[SPEAKER_41]: I think putting them in the record is the best option for right now, because I know a number of people want to speak as well.

40
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,967
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Member Van de Kloet.

41
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:13,648
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Kratz?

42
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:19,698
[SPEAKER_46]: I just wanted to thank Ms.

43
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,458
[SPEAKER_46]: Stone for sharing that history with us.

44
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,099
[SPEAKER_46]: And I concur with Ms.

45
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:24,619
[SPEAKER_46]: Vanderkoot.

46
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:33,022
[SPEAKER_46]: You know, I'm not ready to make a decision, and I do feel that this process should be a public process.

47
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:37,843
[SPEAKER_46]: You know, from many of the community members that I've heard, you know, since June of 2020,

48
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:56,292
[SPEAKER_46]: You know, we, we've been waiting for this meeting, so that we could have the public engage and, you know, ask questions and share their opinions, but I do think that that name is, you know, would be is a good suggestion.

49
00:04:56,992 --> 00:05:01,295
[SPEAKER_46]: Um, once we come up with the plans for choosing the names process.

50
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:06,198
[SPEAKER_46]: Um, so I just wanted to share that information and I just want to ask the mayor a question.

51
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:13,122
[SPEAKER_46]: So mayor, I just had a question because I had a motion, you know, in regards to the two resolutions.

52
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:17,705
[SPEAKER_46]: Should I hold off and wait till we get to that part of the meeting?

53
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:24,069
[SPEAKER_41]: Well, I think you must, I think you may have amendments to the, to the resolution.

54
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:25,210
[SPEAKER_41]: So I think we should take it

55
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:27,571
[SPEAKER_41]: the resolution in sections.

56
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:39,704
[SPEAKER_41]: So you would make, I would ask that you make the amendments or we discuss each section one at a time and whether we, main thing we need to decide which one we're gonna go off of.

57
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:43,788
[SPEAKER_41]: So that's, it's completely up to you, but I would say we do a section by section.

58
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:50,784
[SPEAKER_46]: So I have a motion that is in regards to the entire timeline.

59
00:05:51,645 --> 00:06:02,937
[SPEAKER_46]: So I'm wondering if I should just read that now and if it could be considered, you know, as a, you know, in a recommendation.

60
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,573
[SPEAKER_46]: It should probably take me about two minutes.

61
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:14,683
[SPEAKER_46]: So, in my opinion, the deadlines in the meeting dates that were outlined in both resolutions are too tight.

62
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:19,209
[SPEAKER_46]: The original resolution on June 15 stated specific dates.

63
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:32,159
[SPEAKER_46]: You know July 121 was when the school was going to be renamed, and then there was supposed to be a committee of the whole on September 1, and that's where we are right now we're, we're at the committee of the whole.

64
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,941
[SPEAKER_46]: And after that, October 1.

65
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:50,427
[SPEAKER_46]: the advisory committee was supposed to be formed, and then they would have been meeting October, November, December, January, and they would have submitted a new name to us by January 1st.

66
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:55,509
[SPEAKER_46]: Because we're in the global pandemic, three of the four deadlines were missed.

67
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,530
[SPEAKER_46]: So I think we should take a step back today.

68
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,332
[SPEAKER_46]: Today marks one year into the coronavirus pandemic.

69
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:12,464
[SPEAKER_46]: And the Commissioner of Education has stated that the schools must be open for full-time in-person learning on April 5, while middle school will be required to do so on April 28.

70
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:23,994
[SPEAKER_46]: Our paramount focus should be planning to get the children, teachers, and staff back to school safely to receive the best education, having a budget to accommodate those things.

71
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,936
[SPEAKER_46]: I think that this should be our priority right now.

72
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:43,507
[SPEAKER_46]: Also, due to the magnitude of the change, I have recommended a slightly different timeline because in the original resolution, it was stated that the advisory committee should have a term of six months.

73
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:54,196
[SPEAKER_46]: So if I go back to the original timeline, the dates were September 1st, October 1st, November, December, January, February.

74
00:07:54,636 --> 00:07:56,117
[SPEAKER_46]: So that was the six months.

75
00:07:56,698 --> 00:08:08,628
[SPEAKER_46]: So here we are today on April, I'm sorry, not April, March 10th, and we are meeting for the rescheduled September 1st meeting, which was the committee of the whole to plan the structure.

76
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,302
[SPEAKER_46]: And we're still in the global pandemic.

77
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:27,599
[SPEAKER_46]: So then the next meeting, which would be the advisory committee would have been formed would be in April this coming April, which was, you know, according to the original resolution was exactly one month after the committee of the whole meeting.

78
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:28,840
[SPEAKER_46]: So that would bring us to April 10th.

79
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:41,044
[SPEAKER_46]: But I happen to think that April 10th is a little too soon to form the advisory committee, so I was thinking like April 30th would be a good time to form the advisory committee.

80
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:51,166
[SPEAKER_46]: And then that would give the advisory committee April, then May, June, July and August are summer months, so we have to exclude those months, September,

81
00:08:52,066 --> 00:09:05,446
[SPEAKER_46]: October happens to be Italian American Heritage Month, and we celebrate, you know, Columbus Day, which is a federal holiday, so I'm not sure if we want to include that month for the research or not.

82
00:09:06,457 --> 00:09:16,305
[SPEAKER_46]: And then that would put our timeline up to November 2021, where the advisory committee would have the full six months, not including the summer months.

83
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:21,910
[SPEAKER_46]: It could be shorter if the committee wanted to meet during the summer months of July and August.

84
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:29,756
[SPEAKER_46]: It all depends on whether or not they would meet, which would mean the advisory committee would be coming to us either if we

85
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:50,323
[SPEAKER_46]: include the summer months they would be coming to us September to bring the new research name or November to bring the new research name and this would give ample time and you know for the advisory committee to have a thoughtful reflective discussions to thoroughly research a new name.

86
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:58,026
[SPEAKER_46]: So this is the motion that I'm making to extend the timeline that was detailed in the in the

87
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:11,571
[SPEAKER_46]: The plan that we're working on right now is still working off of the dates that were in the original resolution, but the three dates have already been missed.

88
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:13,812
[SPEAKER_46]: So that's my resolution.

89
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:26,634
[SPEAKER_46]: My motion is to extend the timeline detailed in forming the advisory committee and pushing out the dates a little further so that the advisory committee can have six months as detailed in the original resolution.

90
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:29,435
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you member Kratz.

91
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:39,292
[SPEAKER_33]: So a couple of different things.

92
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:53,136
[SPEAKER_33]: Mayor, like you, I went down and I distilled from both member Rousseau's and my own resolution key talking points.

93
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:56,697
[SPEAKER_33]: And I asked Peter if he would put them up.

94
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,317
[SPEAKER_33]: I think they're similar to yours.

95
00:10:58,377 --> 00:10:59,498
[SPEAKER_33]: There may be one difference.

96
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:07,399
[SPEAKER_33]: Because I don't really think it's a choice between mine and Paul's so much.

97
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:17,051
[SPEAKER_33]: I think that member Rousseau, because he was dedicated to doing this, sort of got out and laid out a process and giving

98
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:23,378
[SPEAKER_33]: us all the opportunity to say, yep, that works for me.

99
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:24,118
[SPEAKER_33]: No, it doesn't.

100
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:27,902
[SPEAKER_33]: And so I wrote mine down because it was pretty convoluted.

101
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:34,669
[SPEAKER_33]: But the six key talking points really covers the most important things.

102
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:43,676
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, I had mentioned the other day at our meeting on Monday that I do have concerns about the timeline.

103
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:52,802
[SPEAKER_33]: And my concerns about the timeline are because not in the first part, not the, you know, application process,

104
00:11:54,022 --> 00:12:05,686
[SPEAKER_33]: We actually have, member Kretsch suggested April 30th, the meeting is on April 26th, which both member Russo and myself put as the date to choose the advisory committee.

105
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:11,508
[SPEAKER_33]: But it's the time, how much time does the advisory committee have to work?

106
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:18,110
[SPEAKER_33]: And part of that is asking, what are we asking them to do?

107
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:25,693
[SPEAKER_33]: So these are the key talking points that I put forward that you're seeing on the screen right now.

108
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,374
[SPEAKER_33]: One is how is the advisory committee chosen?

109
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:38,918
[SPEAKER_33]: And by the way, the application, I had one additional thing about availability and time, but otherwise mine and member Rousseau's, I think we're pretty close.

110
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:42,388
[SPEAKER_33]: and not particularly complicated.

111
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,212
[SPEAKER_33]: But point number two is what is the makeup of the advisory committee?

112
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:51,357
[SPEAKER_33]: Three, once names are submitted for consideration, what is the next step in the process?

113
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:55,165
[SPEAKER_33]: Four, what is the charge to the advisory committee?

114
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:56,405
[SPEAKER_33]: What are we asking them to do?

115
00:12:57,306 --> 00:12:59,746
[SPEAKER_33]: Five is how is the chair or co-chairs chosen?

116
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:06,828
[SPEAKER_33]: And six, does the advisory committee bring one choice to the school committee for confirmation or up to three for our selection?

117
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:14,291
[SPEAKER_33]: Those are really the key points that member Brousseau and myself look at in different ways.

118
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,155
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's just, I put that out.

119
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:23,377
[SPEAKER_33]: I know there are many hands raised now, so I'm just gonna lay that out right now.

120
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:38,627
[SPEAKER_41]: Yep, we're gonna do public participation, and then we will, mine are similar to yours, Member Van de Kloot, we'll work off of one, maybe Paul's, where you know yours best, and we'll go through it one section at a time, knowing those are the key issues.

121
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:40,329
[SPEAKER_41]: Anne-Marie?

122
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:46,855
[SPEAKER_54]: Could you hear me now?

123
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:47,416
[SPEAKER_64]: Yes.

124
00:13:49,236 --> 00:13:50,437
[SPEAKER_54]: Man, you can hear me.

125
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:55,039
[SPEAKER_54]: Okay, so I do understand where everyone is coming from.

126
00:13:56,439 --> 00:14:00,061
[SPEAKER_54]: I know you have two motions actually on the table, I believe.

127
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:01,422
[SPEAKER_54]: One was from Ms.

128
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:03,122
[SPEAKER_54]: Mostone and the other one is from Ms.

129
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:03,923
[SPEAKER_54]: Kretz.

130
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:09,365
[SPEAKER_54]: But again, I will reiterate it from my standpoint.

131
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,626
[SPEAKER_54]: And my standpoint is that with

132
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:27,422
[SPEAKER_54]: the commissioner of education coming out and giving us all, or giving you guys, the schedule of when our children are supposed to be going back to school, there is so much to be really considered.

133
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:34,924
[SPEAKER_54]: You need to look at your budget, you need to look at, you know, custodians, are you gonna be getting contractors to come in to do it?

134
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:40,025
[SPEAKER_54]: Yes, they've been doing a great job up until today, but that is comparing

135
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:44,347
[SPEAKER_54]: two, three days a week compared to students that are going in five days a week.

136
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:52,249
[SPEAKER_54]: I do know that there's already other cities that have already have responded to the commissioner.

137
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:58,170
[SPEAKER_54]: I know Burlington has actually stated that they might start earlier than the deadlines that he has given.

138
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:02,231
[SPEAKER_54]: I believe there's another city that has also mentioned the same.

139
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:07,913
[SPEAKER_54]: So again, I will reiterate the name change or no name change.

140
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:10,677
[SPEAKER_54]: precedence.

141
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:15,018
[SPEAKER_54]: We need to get our kids in school and time is of the essence.

142
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:22,521
[SPEAKER_54]: Could someone at least explain how many more meetings are going to be invested into this advisory committee?

143
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:31,163
[SPEAKER_54]: From the school committee also, not just the advisory committee, because school committee has to be some part of that.

144
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:34,524
[SPEAKER_41]: Right, that's what we're here to figure out tonight, Anne-Marie.

145
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:42,489
[SPEAKER_41]: this will outline as best we can how many meetings it will take for the school committee, the advisory committee and create a timeline for that.

146
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:50,093
[SPEAKER_54]: Okay, because again, as one of your members had posted, you know, you have a really contagious budget that you have to deal with.

147
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:53,394
[SPEAKER_54]: And that's coming, that should have already been started.

148
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:56,015
[SPEAKER_54]: And the discussion is already should have already started.

149
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,096
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm not aware if it has.

150
00:15:57,696 --> 00:16:01,378
[SPEAKER_54]: But I also do know that right around the corner, we hit June.

151
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:07,489
[SPEAKER_54]: And at the end of June, school committee has to present the budget, has to be accepted by the city council.

152
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,950
[SPEAKER_54]: A lot of people go on vacation.

153
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,651
[SPEAKER_54]: Sorry.

154
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:12,971
[SPEAKER_54]: So it's all right.

155
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:14,511
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Anne-Marie.

156
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:15,472
[SPEAKER_41]: That was it.

157
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:20,573
[SPEAKER_41]: We have, I don't know the name, iPhone X.

158
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:36,459
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm trying to unmute you.

159
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:39,241
[SPEAKER_59]: Hold on one second.

160
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:53,181
[SPEAKER_40]: There you go.

161
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:53,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

162
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:54,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

163
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:54,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

164
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:55,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

165
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:56,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

166
00:16:56,923 --> 00:17:11,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Under the guise that I'm in a time sensitive issue here, I just wanted to go back and revisit the thought process behind why this is so sentimental to the Italian American community and others as well.

167
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:16,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was doing some homework and doing some research and found an article that was printed in June

168
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:18,451
[SPEAKER_05]: 18th 2020.

169
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:31,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It was printed by a Louis Navier and I just want to read a portion of it because it is very very lengthy and I don't want to take everyone through it but it's certainly something that everyone can either look up or I can certainly send it to you.

170
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:42,257
[SPEAKER_05]: So this portion is based off of why the Columbus, it's basically more about Columbus Day but why the name Columbus is important or at least in the psyche.

171
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:43,478
[SPEAKER_05]: In

172
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:53,650
[SPEAKER_05]: New Orleans in 1891, back in March of 1891, a gentleman named David Hennessey was murdered.

173
00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:00,035
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a police chief and he was murdered by people of Italian descent.

174
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:08,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So there were 11 Italians that were brought up on trial and were acquitted, come to find out they weren't even part of what happened.

175
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:23,345
[SPEAKER_05]: But back then, because the Italians were hated so much by the United States as such as Mark Twain would likely predict, an extrajudicial killing and an Italian accused of murder as the outcome more likely than a trial by jury.

176
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Twain was not being provocative.

177
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:27,369
[SPEAKER_05]: He was inspired by true events.

178
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:28,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was one of those events.

179
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:43,992
[SPEAKER_05]: These 11 Italian Americans, which were dock workers, cobblers, food vendors, tin smith, one was even a laborer on a plantation, were all round up after that and they were lynched.

180
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,153
[SPEAKER_36]: They were murdered.

181
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:46,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

182
00:18:46,924 --> 00:19:00,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So in a nutshell, I just want to let you know that this was something that was brought out back in 1891 and President Harrison in 1891 created Columbus Day in recognition of the Italian community.

183
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:06,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I could finish this because it is very, very important to understand the context of this.

184
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:09,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was something that was created that really is very, very important.

185
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:12,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope that everybody can get in touch with me to understand this better.

186
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,150
[SPEAKER_05]: The Italian community deserves to hear about this.

187
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:22,782
[SPEAKER_41]: that you'll have more time to speak on each issue.

188
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:23,442
[SPEAKER_41]: Dave, I'm sorry.

189
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:24,403
[SPEAKER_64]: Okay.

190
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:34,666
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor, I just wanted to... Mayor, I just heard from iPhone X, and I guess he was trying to unmute, but he couldn't unmute.

191
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,427
[SPEAKER_46]: Would you be able to try him again?

192
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:43,189
[SPEAKER_41]: It was the iPhone X. Okay, we'll have... Yep, he's in queue, or she.

193
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,790
[SPEAKER_41]: He or she is in queue.

194
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,091
[SPEAKER_41]: I just unmuted Nadine, and then we'll go...

195
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,897
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Mayor, can you hear me?

196
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:54,919
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, Nadine, hold off one second.

197
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,979
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, go ahead, sir.

198
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:57,360
[SPEAKER_41]: What's your name?

199
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,281
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Miguel Aguiso, 61 Forest Street.

200
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:06,884
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to say off the record, I'm in total opposition of the Columbus School being changed.

201
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:08,545
[SPEAKER_24]: But I just had a quick question.

202
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:13,827
[SPEAKER_24]: I heard earlier that there was 300 and some odd people that were in, that were,

203
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:18,337
[SPEAKER_24]: For the change, for the record, how many people were against it?

204
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:21,239
[SPEAKER_24]: I miss Vanderdijk, I believe her name is.

205
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:24,702
[SPEAKER_24]: She said that there were some sort of people in the 600 name.

206
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:29,827
[SPEAKER_24]: And then second part, how much is a name change going to cost us in Medford, if you don't mind me asking?

207
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:34,891
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, the two petitions we received, one was in favor, that was $350,000.

208
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:49,378
[SPEAKER_41]: 96 people, and then the petition we were given on Monday was from a different group, Medford United, and that was, oh, I think 650 Medford residents.

209
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:52,721
[SPEAKER_24]: 650 for an opposition of the change?

210
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:54,282
[SPEAKER_24]: An opposition, correct.

211
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:56,143
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam Mayor, I appreciate that.

212
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:58,725
[SPEAKER_24]: And you have a number on how much this is gonna cost?

213
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:00,347
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't have a number.

214
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:01,527
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, thank you.

215
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:02,868
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

216
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,211
[SPEAKER_41]: Nadine, are you unmuted?

217
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:11,960
[SPEAKER_60]: I think I am now, Mayor, can you hear me?

218
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:13,161
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, yes, there you go.

219
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:14,462
[SPEAKER_60]: Great, thank you.

220
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:18,425
[SPEAKER_60]: Nadine Moretti, 126 Burgett Ave.

221
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:21,227
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you, Mayor, and good evening, everyone.

222
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:36,098
[SPEAKER_60]: My intent isn't to make this a personal attack, but it is certainly a personal attack on everyone you have listened to about how this is affecting them, our city, and that ultimately their voices, opinions, and feelings mean nothing.

223
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:37,840
[SPEAKER_60]: You've listened to so many people

224
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,980
[SPEAKER_60]: but are you truly hearing us?

225
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:45,889
[SPEAKER_60]: As of Monday night, it still appears the school committee will move forward regardless of the speakers who so eloquently asked you to reconsider.

226
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:51,277
[SPEAKER_60]: Do right by Medford's residents and in light of the workload ahead of you after Desi's recommendations.

227
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:53,941
[SPEAKER_60]: Wondering if any of that resonated with you.

228
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:06,025
[SPEAKER_60]: To quote member Rousseau back in June 2020, I would make this decision and put this forward if literally every person wrote to me and said, do not change the name and I wouldn't bat an eyelash.

229
00:22:06,665 --> 00:22:10,847
[SPEAKER_60]: This statement certainly resonated with a myriad of registered voters and parents.

230
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:15,369
[SPEAKER_60]: My children, along with Paul's, attended Columbus Elementary for nine years.

231
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:19,350
[SPEAKER_60]: We went on field trips together, were on the PTO, hung at the school yard daily.

232
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:22,872
[SPEAKER_60]: I volunteered in my children's classrooms, at events within the school,

233
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,664
[SPEAKER_60]: Never once hearing or heard a word, excuse me, uttered that it was a bothersome or offensive name because it is not.

234
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:32,886
[SPEAKER_60]: Renaming any school is bigger than just the school committee.

235
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:43,553
[SPEAKER_60]: It doesn't matter that an advisory committee was slated to be formed because as we recently learned, those deadlines have passed and more importantly, without proper input or inclusion of the residents of Medford.

236
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:45,634
[SPEAKER_60]: But we're still in a pandemic.

237
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:52,811
[SPEAKER_60]: You now have been tasked with figuring out how to get, at the very least, K-5 back in school, per the latest guidance from DESE.

238
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:59,452
[SPEAKER_60]: In light of so many requests to table it for these reasons, there shouldn't be a rush to complete this unless it's personally driven.

239
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:09,135
[SPEAKER_60]: You are voted in to be the voice of all the parents, not only the ones that agree about the Columbus school name being changed after 90 years.

240
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:17,353
[SPEAKER_60]: This proposal is part of an agenda to change and cancel what they see fit or render offensive and unhealthy culture being driven by our evolution.

241
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:25,820
[SPEAKER_60]: So in closing, you're well aware that I'm 100% against renaming Columbus Elementary, but I'm more against the school- Time's up, Nadine.

242
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,864
[SPEAKER_60]: Making it a priority over normal learning environment for our children during the pandemic.

243
00:23:31,684 --> 00:23:32,045
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

244
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:33,326
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Nadine.

245
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:35,047
[SPEAKER_60]: Bill?

246
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:41,986
[SPEAKER_66]: Hello?

247
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:44,567
[SPEAKER_41]: Bill, yes.

248
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:45,548
[SPEAKER_66]: Can you hear me?

249
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:47,589
[SPEAKER_66]: I'm sorry, okay.

250
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:48,029
[SPEAKER_41]: A little bit.

251
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:49,489
[SPEAKER_66]: Can you hear me okay?

252
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:50,610
[SPEAKER_66]: Hello?

253
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:51,430
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

254
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:52,871
[SPEAKER_66]: You can hear me fine?

255
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:55,512
[SPEAKER_66]: Okay, my name's Bill Giglio.

256
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:58,613
[SPEAKER_66]: My statement is for Paul, and this is not to pick on Paul or anything.

257
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:05,536
[SPEAKER_66]: Paul, you're in your second term, but yet this has never been an issue with you in the past.

258
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:09,018
[SPEAKER_66]: Your platform or anyone else on the committee's platform has never ran

259
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:12,218
[SPEAKER_66]: on the name change being such a high priority.

260
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:25,228
[SPEAKER_66]: Since becoming a member just before the 2019 election of an extreme left progressive group called the Our Revolution, this seems to fall right in line with their ideology of changing history and the national narrative of cancel culture.

261
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:30,913
[SPEAKER_66]: So your resolution to change the name of the Columbus School seems a little sketchy, suspicious, and disingenuous.

262
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:35,757
[SPEAKER_66]: Plus we all know this opens up the floodgates for everything else to be renamed.

263
00:24:36,537 --> 00:24:37,298
[SPEAKER_66]: That's just my first half.

264
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:38,699
[SPEAKER_66]: But my second half is actually a question.

265
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,940
[SPEAKER_66]: This was obviously a go.

266
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:44,473
[SPEAKER_66]: So like the other gentleman had said, what is going to be the cost for this?

267
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:54,856
[SPEAKER_66]: When can we expect the breakdown of who's going to be doing such work, such as the lawyers, contractors, state filing fees, and what they're going to be getting paid to do their work?

268
00:24:55,796 --> 00:25:00,257
[SPEAKER_66]: If this is being funded by some sort of donations, when can we expect a list of who's donating?

269
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:04,878
[SPEAKER_66]: And should a group such as the Our Revolution be allowed to donate?

270
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:10,400
[SPEAKER_66]: Because I can tell you, a lot of us do not want this coming out of

271
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,023
[SPEAKER_66]: school money or tax funded money.

272
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:15,625
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

273
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:18,787
[SPEAKER_41]: I will work on getting a breakdown of how much this will cost.

274
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,489
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm not sure as of tonight.

275
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:32,919
[SPEAKER_66]: I'll ask at this point, why if, if the, if the date would have been July, how come there's none of that is even thought of or, or, you know, research.

276
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,962
[SPEAKER_66]: I mean, that's, that's a, that's a huge factor.

277
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:41,207
[SPEAKER_41]: The school committee has the authority to change the name of a school.

278
00:25:41,268 --> 00:25:42,672
[SPEAKER_41]: That's the only answer I can give you.

279
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:45,309
[SPEAKER_40]: Mayor.

280
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:45,809
[SPEAKER_40]: Can anybody else?

281
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,191
[SPEAKER_40]: Member Van de Kloet.

282
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:50,332
[SPEAKER_33]: I would like to address one thing.

283
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:58,477
[SPEAKER_33]: Many people are speaking about all the different things that the school committee faces, and that's absolutely true.

284
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:00,338
[SPEAKER_33]: We have a lot of work ahead of us.

285
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:07,763
[SPEAKER_33]: However, and part of this is being brought about, well, you need more time to hear us.

286
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:18,279
[SPEAKER_33]: We have heard strongly from the community, and I myself have gone and spoken to some members who are very anti the change.

287
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,920
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's very, very difficult.

288
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:26,344
[SPEAKER_33]: But to say you don't have enough time, well, frankly, we're a pretty dedicated bunch all across.

289
00:26:27,164 --> 00:26:30,887
[SPEAKER_33]: And I don't think that once we get through

290
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:33,888
[SPEAKER_33]: the process and work it out.

291
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:44,291
[SPEAKER_33]: And there will be some things that I speak to, like removing one piece, we'll get to it later, off of a school committee onto a committee of the whole instead.

292
00:26:45,912 --> 00:26:57,216
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, so I do, and the other thing which I think is key for me to say as the longest serving school committee member is, and when this first came up, I spoke to it.

293
00:26:57,856 --> 00:27:04,622
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, when this first came up, I will tell you, and I've said to other people, I wasn't happy with the process, okay?

294
00:27:05,262 --> 00:27:13,770
[SPEAKER_33]: Because at that first meeting, I felt confident in that, yes, I did feel there was a reason to change it.

295
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,473
[SPEAKER_33]: You must remember that there was in light of a very

296
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:30,248
[SPEAKER_33]: a spring of great reckoning and understanding of what was going on in our world and the racism that exists that we all saw with our own eyes.

297
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:32,831
[SPEAKER_33]: And there is a context to this.

298
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:49,943
[SPEAKER_33]: But 20 years ago, when we built the new schools, I can absolutely tell you that there was a discussion in the committee, in the Building the Future Committee of which I was part, about the naming of the schools.

299
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:58,932
[SPEAKER_33]: And at that time, we were well aware that there were people who would much prefer it not to be the Columbus School.

300
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:11,981
[SPEAKER_33]: I've kicked myself sometimes because I let that go, partially in deference to a community member who I had great respect for and who didn't want it to change.

301
00:28:13,162 --> 00:28:17,326
[SPEAKER_33]: But it's been a recurring

302
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:23,111
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, maybe you haven't heard it, but I have over and over again.

303
00:28:24,191 --> 00:28:27,413
[SPEAKER_33]: I've heard it, I've had discussions down at the Columbus School with parents.

304
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:35,397
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's not that this just popped up and there's been, it's not been part of our discussion.

305
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:41,561
[SPEAKER_33]: It has been particularly for parents whose children attend the Columbus School.

306
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:45,963
[SPEAKER_33]: And that certainly isn't to say that everybody agrees, but it's certainly been there.

307
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:55,921
[SPEAKER_66]: So if you're saying you don't have, if you're saying that there was plenty, there was ample time and there's still ample time, then why is Kathy Creeds then asking for more time?

308
00:28:57,013 --> 00:29:05,119
[SPEAKER_33]: So the time has to do with the timeline that she's suggesting is part of the discussion that we'll have.

309
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,241
[SPEAKER_33]: We're sort of talking two different things.

310
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:21,290
[SPEAKER_33]: I too, after I worked out my resolution, believes that it would be great to have more time, which is to say a number of weeks more to come to the conclusion of this.

311
00:29:22,242 --> 00:29:40,467
[SPEAKER_33]: I've built in and will talk to my committee about saying that I think that once we put the advisory council together and they begin their work, that they are the ones who will need to be able to say to us, hey, we need eight more weeks, or we need 12 more weeks, or we think this has to be the timeline.

312
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:44,668
[SPEAKER_33]: But that's a discussion that as we work out the particulars of this.

313
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:50,930
[SPEAKER_33]: The other thing is the reality of it is, and we just have to say this, and it's just blunt.

314
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:55,656
[SPEAKER_33]: When people are saying they haven't been heard, we have heard them.

315
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,532
[SPEAKER_33]: But unfortunately, we don't necessarily agree with them.

316
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:05,373
[SPEAKER_33]: We are not agreeing to change, to not change the name.

317
00:30:06,214 --> 00:30:08,835
[SPEAKER_33]: So people keep on saying, you haven't heard us.

318
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:10,996
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, we are hearing you.

319
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:21,380
[SPEAKER_33]: And quite honestly, I mean, I had some great discussions and I was really moved at one point by one person who told me what Columbus Day meant in his family.

320
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,922
[SPEAKER_33]: And I listened and I heard that.

321
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:26,904
[SPEAKER_33]: I've heard other people say we're erasing history.

322
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:29,746
[SPEAKER_33]: We're still going to teach our kids about Columbus.

323
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:34,470
[SPEAKER_33]: It is part of our education strands.

324
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:40,554
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not like we're just saying, and Columbus had, hey, there were some things that were good about him.

325
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:50,562
[SPEAKER_33]: What we're saying is, is he, is this name the one we want to represent this educational facility in our community?

326
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:53,089
[SPEAKER_33]: You have voted for.

327
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:01,843
[SPEAKER_33]: the committee, six members plus the mayor, this community voted for us to do what we think is best.

328
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:04,144
[SPEAKER_33]: This is not an easy job.

329
00:31:04,524 --> 00:31:06,385
[SPEAKER_33]: It is painful, it is tough.

330
00:31:06,905 --> 00:31:11,147
[SPEAKER_33]: One of my committee members said to me, you know, Paulette, the problem with you is you wanna make everybody happy.

331
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:12,848
[SPEAKER_33]: And that's absolutely true.

332
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:14,649
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't wanna piss anybody off.

333
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:19,471
[SPEAKER_33]: And no matter what I do, I'm going to make some people unhappy in this.

334
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:22,593
[SPEAKER_33]: I am being true to myself,

335
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:25,414
[SPEAKER_33]: I've worked, spent hours and hours.

336
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:31,557
[SPEAKER_33]: And by the way, those hours were not conflicting with the other work that I do, talking to administration, saying, hey, can we work on this?

337
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:32,318
[SPEAKER_33]: Hey, what about that?

338
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:34,419
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, I've got lots of hours in my day.

339
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,501
[SPEAKER_33]: But trying to say, how does this process work?

340
00:31:40,082 --> 00:31:44,484
[SPEAKER_33]: And is there a way that the process can help bring this community together?

341
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:51,288
[SPEAKER_33]: I listened on Monday when Mr. McKillop suggested that we start all over.

342
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,451
[SPEAKER_33]: And for a while back, I was there.

343
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:56,891
[SPEAKER_33]: I was wondering about that.

344
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,911
[SPEAKER_33]: But I came, thought deeply and said, you know what?

345
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:04,012
[SPEAKER_33]: At this point, we have had lots of opportunity.

346
00:32:04,112 --> 00:32:06,292
[SPEAKER_33]: People in Medford are aware of this.

347
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:09,573
[SPEAKER_33]: I walked my dog this afternoon with someone I didn't know.

348
00:32:09,953 --> 00:32:12,634
[SPEAKER_33]: She's not particularly involved at all in the politics.

349
00:32:13,054 --> 00:32:14,894
[SPEAKER_33]: I said, wow, I've got a heavy meeting tonight.

350
00:32:15,154 --> 00:32:18,415
[SPEAKER_33]: And she said, oh yeah, it's the Columbus naming issue.

351
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:19,475
[SPEAKER_33]: People know.

352
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:20,895
[SPEAKER_33]: Anyway.

353
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:29,430
[SPEAKER_66]: Well, and again, you know, I'm not trying to hit below the belt, but you say that, you know, we vote for you and make the decision.

354
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:35,653
[SPEAKER_66]: But I mean, it was also a time, don't forget, where a lot of people in the city did not know Paul is a convicted felon.

355
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:36,494
[SPEAKER_66]: Now they know.

356
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:37,734
[SPEAKER_66]: Do we kick him off the board?

357
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:38,935
[SPEAKER_66]: He still has a chance.

358
00:32:38,955 --> 00:32:39,675
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, please.

359
00:32:40,756 --> 00:32:40,996
[SPEAKER_40]: No.

360
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:42,577
[SPEAKER_41]: Member van de Kloot.

361
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:44,338
[SPEAKER_41]: Is two minutes up?

362
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:45,298
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

363
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:45,959
[SPEAKER_41]: We have Marie.

364
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:54,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, can you hear me all right?

365
00:32:54,737 --> 00:32:54,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

366
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:56,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome, thank you.

367
00:32:56,138 --> 00:32:57,479
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't even find myself on the screen.

368
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,260
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be quick, thank you.

369
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:08,145
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a parent of children at the currently named Columbus School and I am so grateful that we hopefully are now talking about, the name change is happening.

370
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to clarify, the name change is happening.

371
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:12,428
[SPEAKER_14]: The question now is how does that process happen?

372
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:14,229
[SPEAKER_14]: So I hope I'm getting that right.

373
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:20,073
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also just wanna say this, I just wanna push for this name change to happen as soon as possible.

374
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:21,854
[SPEAKER_14]: It is long overdue.

375
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:35,638
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a third grader and a fifth grader and I'd had high hopes that my fifth grader would leave the school knowing that it was no longer going to be the Columbus and have a different name that better represented the Medford that I know and love.

376
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:47,841
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I just want to throw that out that I hope I understand what the pandemic everything's changed with timelines, but I just want to say I hope that we don't put this off too long because as we can see, it's causing fractures and it's causing

377
00:33:49,801 --> 00:34:01,191
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say I am so grateful for Paul Rousseau and all of you who have stood up for this, but I just know you've had to work so hard and do so much and put so much out there, and I think it's time for us to finish this job.

378
00:34:01,752 --> 00:34:08,718
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also just want to put in a plug there for having the students involved at that school, and I think that that would be just an amazing community project.

379
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:13,422
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate all the research everyone else has done, but I think it'd be really nice to have some student involvement here.

380
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:18,145
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just really wanted to come on and say, I'm very excited about the name change and I'm excited to see it move forward.

381
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:23,530
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd be thrilled if my fourth grader starts at that school next year with a brand new name to celebrate.

382
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,552
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Marie.

383
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:32,517
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm going to go down the list, but I'm just, I did see somebody physically raising their hand.

384
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:36,581
[SPEAKER_41]: So we just, on the bottom of your screen, there's a raise hand button.

385
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:38,822
[SPEAKER_41]: If not, I do see you Carol.

386
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:42,505
[SPEAKER_41]: So I will get to you, but let's just go and order Seth.

387
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:44,976
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you.

388
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:46,317
[SPEAKER_63]: My name is Seth Hill.

389
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:47,578
[SPEAKER_63]: My daughter attends the school.

390
00:34:47,658 --> 00:34:48,339
[SPEAKER_63]: She's 10.

391
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:53,502
[SPEAKER_63]: Christopher Columbus would abduct girls her age for his crew to rape.

392
00:34:54,243 --> 00:34:58,286
[SPEAKER_63]: He was a slave trader and committed genocide against the indigenous population.

393
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:02,609
[SPEAKER_63]: We are not erasing history and choosing a new name.

394
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:07,152
[SPEAKER_63]: We are choosing to better represent who we hold up as heroes.

395
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:11,856
[SPEAKER_63]: Columbus brutality was seen as egregious by his contemporaries.

396
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:15,878
[SPEAKER_63]: He was imprisoned and stripped of his titles.

397
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,559
[SPEAKER_63]: I want to make that clear.

398
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:25,062
[SPEAKER_63]: Those that honored him at the time decided he was no longer worthy of that honor.

399
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:32,386
[SPEAKER_63]: All of the school committee members recognized the need for the name change.

400
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:36,068
[SPEAKER_63]: I don't want Columbus name never to be spoken of again.

401
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,243
[SPEAKER_63]: of a fuller history, one that hasn't been erased.

402
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:46,906
[SPEAKER_63]: The school was named to raise up our Italian American community.

403
00:35:47,707 --> 00:35:56,093
[SPEAKER_63]: Italian Americans faced religious discrimination, fear over their politics, belief that they would crowd out others for jobs.

404
00:35:57,294 --> 00:35:58,455
[SPEAKER_63]: Is this sounding familiar?

405
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:06,882
[SPEAKER_63]: These are prejudices that we see expressed today towards other marginalized communities.

406
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:14,102
[SPEAKER_63]: Medford is a, excuse me, Medford is a wonderful melting pot.

407
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:20,668
[SPEAKER_63]: Let's find someone who's emblematic of that and lift up those that might be marginalized today.

408
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:25,212
[SPEAKER_63]: My daughter and I would be happy to help.

409
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:26,373
Thank you.

410
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:28,415
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Seth.

411
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:29,496
[SPEAKER_41]: Brenna.

412
00:36:32,688 --> 00:36:34,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mayor, members of the school committee.

413
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:38,451
[SPEAKER_00]: I submitted a letter to the previous meeting, and I just have a question.

414
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:42,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a plan moving forward to also rename the Columbus Park as well?

415
00:36:45,355 --> 00:36:46,755
[SPEAKER_41]: That's not on the table now.

416
00:36:46,775 --> 00:36:51,518
[SPEAKER_41]: Tonight's discussion is about a process for the renaming of the Columbus School.

417
00:36:51,538 --> 00:36:55,080
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor?

418
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,101
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Rousseau?

419
00:36:58,407 --> 00:36:58,827
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

420
00:36:59,188 --> 00:36:59,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for the question.

421
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:17,700
[SPEAKER_21]: I do know from the previous administration, I asked the question about the Columbus School because I thought that it, even before getting your email, that Crystal Campbell would be an excellent name for the park, which was when I read your letter, I thought that was sort of serendipitous.

422
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:25,565
[SPEAKER_21]: And my understanding is that it's actually a city-side only issue in that it is not a school or school committee

423
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:27,625
[SPEAKER_21]: related matter.

424
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,326
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't believe we have the authority to make that change.

425
00:37:31,187 --> 00:37:36,630
[SPEAKER_21]: And I doubt I doubt Mayor Langeau-Kern has had a chance to look into that necessarily.

426
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:44,094
[SPEAKER_21]: So, but I just wanted to confirm that I don't believe that based on the previous city solicitor, it is not within our authority.

427
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:47,155
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Member Russo.

428
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:47,696
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Brenna.

429
00:37:50,797 --> 00:37:51,578
[SPEAKER_41]: Mr. Carbone.

430
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:57,298
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you very much for allowing me to speak.

431
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:01,342
[SPEAKER_45]: I, as I said, when this issue came up back in June.

432
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:12,852
[SPEAKER_45]: I support changing the name of the school, because Christopher Columbus does not share my values I don't believe he shares any Italian Americans values living in America today.

433
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:30,265
[SPEAKER_45]: I want to say that I find it a little bit disingenuous for this committee to say, well, you know, it just so happened that the same within a few weeks of George Floyd being killed, it just so happens that was the week we decided to change the name of the school.

434
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,146
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't find that particularly compelling.

435
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,847
[SPEAKER_45]: I think that's not just a coincidence.

436
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:37,390
[SPEAKER_45]: It doesn't change my opinion, though, and I hope it wouldn't change anyone else's opinion.

437
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,952
[SPEAKER_45]: Just as it doesn't change my opinion is I don't care how tough your job is.

438
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:45,014
[SPEAKER_45]: I do not care how tough the school committee thinks their job is.

439
00:38:45,294 --> 00:38:47,655
[SPEAKER_45]: And I don't want to, I don't particularly care to hear it again.

440
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,797
[SPEAKER_45]: You are elected to do this job, please do it.

441
00:38:52,126 --> 00:39:13,824
[SPEAKER_45]: I think we have to put this committee together sooner rather than later, that the people who should be given priority are people like myself, whose children have either gone to the Columbus School or are currently going to the Columbus School, that their voices be heard, that before we decide how lovely the Mystic River is and how we should name the school after the mystic,

442
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:17,827
[SPEAKER_45]: that instead we should get their input, that that's actually important.

443
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:20,908
[SPEAKER_45]: I think these discussions should be around one thing.

444
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:22,889
[SPEAKER_45]: We've decided to change the name of the school.

445
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,571
[SPEAKER_45]: Most people likely support it.

446
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:32,915
[SPEAKER_45]: Then we should get people who want to be on this committee so they can actually get about changing the name of this school.

447
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:33,655
[SPEAKER_45]: Let's do it.

448
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:40,899
[SPEAKER_45]: And let's stop the pick the bickering and the petty infighting, which I know at times even I can be a part of.

449
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,100
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you very much for listening to me.

450
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,001
[SPEAKER_45]: That was under two minutes.

451
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:46,941
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

452
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:49,027
[SPEAKER_40]: Candy.

453
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:49,949
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay.

454
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:52,500
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, hi, it's Katie.

455
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,082
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, hi, I'm sorry, my mask.

456
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:56,562
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm at work.

457
00:39:56,682 --> 00:40:05,627
[SPEAKER_26]: But um, I just wanted to say like, while renaming something is like large, as a school is like a really like incredible task to kind of take on.

458
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:09,750
[SPEAKER_26]: I feel like it's important to not delay the vote on renaming.

459
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:18,074
[SPEAKER_26]: I think like people have mentioned it, but schools are the foundation of a community they build, like future citizens, and like, they're really important.

460
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:18,975
[SPEAKER_26]: And

461
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:28,453
[SPEAKER_26]: Like while we aren't like we're not changing history by renaming, but we're kind of bringing a history that has been like often overlooked into like a new light.

462
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:41,521
[SPEAKER_26]: I think a strong community like Medford, somewhere I'm proud to be from, somewhere I'm proud to have gone to school in, shouldn't celebrate such a horrendous historical figure by giving him like the honor of the names of one of our schools.

463
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:46,960
[SPEAKER_26]: um, by doing this, like we, I, like I said, like we're looking at our true history.

464
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:53,463
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think also we just have so many more heroes in our community that we like deserve this type of honor.

465
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:57,966
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, like I was thinking like Amelia Earhart has a house in Medford.

466
00:40:58,006 --> 00:40:58,946
[SPEAKER_26]: She moved in Medford.

467
00:40:58,966 --> 00:40:59,746
[SPEAKER_26]: She lived in Medford.

468
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:05,369
[SPEAKER_26]: Like we, I think there are more important historical figures that we can honor in, um, Medford.

469
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:10,532
[SPEAKER_26]: And yeah, I just wanted to say that, like, I think it's just important to not delay this vote.

470
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:11,032
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

471
00:41:14,494 --> 00:41:14,994
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Katie.

472
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:17,255
[SPEAKER_41]: I know Carol had her hand up.

473
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:18,776
[SPEAKER_41]: Carol, are you still on?

474
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:22,738
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't want to miss you, and you would be next if I went in order.

475
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,481
[SPEAKER_59]: Give me one second.

476
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:33,644
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you hear me?

477
00:41:33,664 --> 00:41:36,105
[SPEAKER_41]: I just unmuted you, Carol, yes.

478
00:41:36,905 --> 00:41:37,285
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, good.

479
00:41:38,006 --> 00:41:39,206
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't live in Medford.

480
00:41:40,686 --> 00:41:42,406
[SPEAKER_25]: But I have written a book about Columbus.

481
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:46,488
[SPEAKER_25]: I spent years doing research and most people know nothing about him.

482
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:50,609
[SPEAKER_25]: He's not the people that people are accusing him of being.

483
00:41:50,629 --> 00:41:53,009
[SPEAKER_25]: He never had slaves.

484
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:54,050
[SPEAKER_25]: He was against it.

485
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,291
[SPEAKER_25]: Read my book, Columbus and the Quest for Jerusalem.

486
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:01,912
[SPEAKER_25]: It won some awards and everything.

487
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:06,873
[SPEAKER_25]: And he's not the man that everybody is claiming that he is.

488
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:09,918
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would be very, I mean, I don't live there.

489
00:42:09,938 --> 00:42:20,448
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd be opposed to the name change until, I think you should be educating people about Columbus because he's not the person that everybody seems to be thinking he is, was.

490
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:22,350
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Carol.

491
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,452
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, that's it.

492
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:25,573
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

493
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:25,833
[SPEAKER_41]: Rocha?

494
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:43,991
[SPEAKER_39]: Ms.

495
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:45,233
[SPEAKER_39]: Rocha, I just want to meet with you.

496
00:42:45,674 --> 00:42:46,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me?

497
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:47,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

498
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:48,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

499
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:56,272
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm here to express my wholehearted support in the establishment of this advisory committee to rename the Columbus Elementary School.

500
00:42:57,686 --> 00:43:05,430
[SPEAKER_15]: The bottom line is that every day that the Columbus name persists is a day where Medford is honoring genocide and white supremacy.

501
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:21,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Many of those who are opposed to the renaming claim that it's a way to honor Italian heritage, but this is a profoundly ahistorical and whitewashing take that really is equivalent to those who defend the existence of Confederate flags and statues.

502
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:35,726
[SPEAKER_15]: There are many figures in Italian history that are deserving of being honored and held up as an example to Medford students because their accomplishments did not amount to one of the most atrocious and barbaric periods of human history.

503
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:45,653
[SPEAKER_15]: The tradition that Medford has to name, to highlight Medford figures is also of great value to the education of our children and should be maintained.

504
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:57,537
[SPEAKER_15]: The bottom line is as last summer's explosion of students coming forward with discriminatory experiences revealed very clearly, Medford has its own racist history and present to reckon with.

505
00:43:58,257 --> 00:44:07,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Renaming the Columbus School is one of the many steps against white supremacy that Medford must take to begin repairing the harm that has been inflicted in this district.

506
00:44:07,804 --> 00:44:13,008
[SPEAKER_15]: And while those opposed to the renaming have expressed that other matters should be prioritized at this time,

507
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:15,941
[SPEAKER_15]: The creation of this committee is long overdue.

508
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:21,985
[SPEAKER_15]: The school should have never bore that name, and this is centuries worth of harm finally being put to a stop.

509
00:44:22,405 --> 00:44:24,686
[SPEAKER_15]: The change needs to happen as soon as possible.

510
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:25,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

511
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,591
[SPEAKER_39]: Anthony?

512
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:37,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Brianna, is that you?

513
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:38,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

514
00:44:38,815 --> 00:44:39,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everyone on?

515
00:44:39,496 --> 00:44:39,536
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

516
00:44:42,085 --> 00:44:49,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I am really upset with hearing some of these people talk about Columbus, okay?

517
00:44:49,872 --> 00:44:51,954
[SPEAKER_02]: He did this, he did that, he did this, he did that.

518
00:44:52,174 --> 00:44:53,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Were these people there 500 years ago?

519
00:44:54,296 --> 00:44:55,878
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're looking at history.

520
00:44:56,178 --> 00:45:00,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the last person up there, I'm sick and tired of hearing this white supremacy baloney, okay?

521
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:04,604
[SPEAKER_02]: The name Columbus should stay because it was an Italian.

522
00:45:04,824 --> 00:45:06,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a discrimination against the Italians.

523
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:10,206
[SPEAKER_02]: You can try to whitewash anything you want, but it's wrong.

524
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:17,269
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm tired of hearing some of the committee members bloviate about, oh, I did this and I tried that and we're busy and this and that.

525
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:19,430
[SPEAKER_02]: It's discrimination, pure and simple.

526
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may be changed, but it's not going to be changed for long.

527
00:45:23,252 --> 00:45:25,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate to say that, but I'm sick and tired of it.

528
00:45:25,674 --> 00:45:30,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we as Italians have been put down for many years, and it stops now.

529
00:45:31,237 --> 00:45:32,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Christ, thank you.

530
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:39,902
[SPEAKER_40]: Galaxy S10 plus.

531
00:45:58,154 --> 00:46:01,777
[SPEAKER_41]: Dr. Cushing, if you could try to unmute too.

532
00:46:01,797 --> 00:46:03,099
[SPEAKER_41]: It doesn't work for me all the time.

533
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:04,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying as well.

534
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:04,980
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

535
00:46:06,422 --> 00:46:06,842
[SPEAKER_41]: Here we go.

536
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:08,323
[SPEAKER_39]: There you go.

537
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:12,407
[SPEAKER_39]: You have two minutes.

538
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:20,494
[SPEAKER_40]: Galaxy, are you there?

539
00:46:20,514 --> 00:46:22,056
[SPEAKER_40]: Did you have anything to say?

540
00:46:30,276 --> 00:46:32,017
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, maybe it's a bad connection.

541
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:35,659
[SPEAKER_41]: Is that I'm sorry.

542
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:36,780
[SPEAKER_41]: It's okay.

543
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,501
[SPEAKER_41]: We can hear you now if you want to go ahead.

544
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:39,581
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, thank you.

545
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:39,962
[SPEAKER_42]: Sorry.

546
00:46:39,982 --> 00:46:41,342
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, I'm Debra Daly.

547
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:45,325
[SPEAKER_42]: And I've been a resident method for 2043 years.

548
00:46:45,965 --> 00:46:50,428
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'm just first of all, Madam Mayor, what you've inherited.

549
00:46:50,448 --> 00:46:57,812
[SPEAKER_42]: I just I you you've done a great job and I don't envy what you've had to do the past year and a half.

550
00:46:58,836 --> 00:47:00,017
[SPEAKER_42]: I am against the change.

551
00:47:00,637 --> 00:47:01,957
[SPEAKER_42]: I just wanna let you know that.

552
00:47:04,798 --> 00:47:16,303
[SPEAKER_41]: We're losing you again.

553
00:47:16,323 --> 00:47:19,864
[SPEAKER_42]: 300 signatures and another 600 signatures.

554
00:47:21,585 --> 00:47:24,346
[SPEAKER_42]: And then we don't even know what the cost is going to be.

555
00:47:24,806 --> 00:47:26,867
[SPEAKER_42]: And after the school, is it a bridge?

556
00:47:26,947 --> 00:47:27,707
[SPEAKER_42]: Is it a square?

557
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,321
[SPEAKER_42]: I just don't know where things are, what's going to change.

558
00:47:31,842 --> 00:47:35,765
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's really bad.

559
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:54,521
[SPEAKER_42]: Would the children back to school and then revisit this a little bit more before definitive decisions are made about the name change and really get a vote in Medford, a good vote.

560
00:47:55,356 --> 00:47:59,979
[SPEAKER_42]: see how many people actually want to change it and invest money there.

561
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:01,940
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's all I need to say.

562
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,682
[SPEAKER_42]: And thank you and keep up the good work.

563
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:05,883
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

564
00:48:08,684 --> 00:48:09,285
[SPEAKER_39]: Jean Nouza.

565
00:48:17,169 --> 00:48:18,470
[SPEAKER_41]: Jean, you should be unmuted now.

566
00:48:20,011 --> 00:48:20,712
[SPEAKER_55]: Can you hear me now?

567
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:22,133
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes, Jean.

568
00:48:22,553 --> 00:48:23,233
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

569
00:48:23,253 --> 00:48:24,434
[SPEAKER_55]: I appreciate the time.

570
00:48:25,294 --> 00:48:25,874
[SPEAKER_55]: A few thoughts.

571
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:36,580
[SPEAKER_55]: First, I wanna just recall for the school committee that in June of 2020, we had an initial response of 180 names.

572
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,521
[SPEAKER_55]: I think you have those on file.

573
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,443
[SPEAKER_55]: I have the receipt of email that you do.

574
00:48:42,123 --> 00:48:44,264
[SPEAKER_55]: So those names still connect with those 600.

575
00:48:44,404 --> 00:48:51,128
[SPEAKER_55]: I'd like to say that I think that it's important that folks consider

576
00:48:52,438 --> 00:48:55,020
[SPEAKER_55]: that affect an impact of a change.

577
00:48:55,941 --> 00:49:00,264
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes, we voted to do it, but we aren't really doing very good change management here.

578
00:49:00,864 --> 00:49:02,626
[SPEAKER_55]: This is really being shoved through.

579
00:49:02,646 --> 00:49:13,113
[SPEAKER_55]: It is painful on both sides of the situation, both for people of color who have been impacted and for the Italian American community.

580
00:49:13,494 --> 00:49:20,639
[SPEAKER_55]: And it does a disservice when people dismiss either side's positions, thoughts, and feelings.

581
00:49:21,363 --> 00:49:22,903
[SPEAKER_55]: And I find that really troubling.

582
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:29,225
[SPEAKER_55]: And I think that's what folks are saying when they're saying it's too fast, we need to slow down and we need to talk about it.

583
00:49:30,186 --> 00:49:33,407
[SPEAKER_55]: You know, it goes beyond this being an election cycle.

584
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:40,349
[SPEAKER_55]: People will remember, people are going to be impacted and simply changing the name isn't going to make it go away.

585
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:42,049
[SPEAKER_55]: Change is a process.

586
00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:47,411
[SPEAKER_55]: Historically, we haven't done a good job of it here in Medford, regardless of what the topic is.

587
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:50,412
[SPEAKER_55]: And this smacks of being another situation

588
00:49:50,902 --> 00:49:56,726
[SPEAKER_55]: where things are just being pushed through for expediency because that's what a handful of people want.

589
00:49:57,367 --> 00:50:00,749
[SPEAKER_55]: Really, I think you need to be careful about how a committee is selected.

590
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:04,992
[SPEAKER_55]: And I think we need to be careful about how people are treated overall.

591
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:14,599
[SPEAKER_55]: After all, the whole point of the argument of the name change is because this individual allegedly has treated people- And you have 15 seconds, 15 seconds.

592
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:20,403
[SPEAKER_55]: And so I wanna just implore people to consider not only their own perspective,

593
00:50:20,862 --> 00:50:25,085
[SPEAKER_55]: but others as well, and let's try to move forward in a way that's positive to folks.

594
00:50:25,626 --> 00:50:31,030
[SPEAKER_55]: But I really think we do have more important things to be dealing with at the moment in the middle of a pandemic.

595
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,251
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you for your time.

596
00:50:33,732 --> 00:50:34,052
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

597
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:46,201
[SPEAKER_41]: I know we said two minutes per person, but you could speak as we go through the policy.

598
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:49,404
[SPEAKER_41]: So Anne-Marie, David, and Nadine, you'll be the first to speak.

599
00:50:51,475 --> 00:50:54,036
[SPEAKER_41]: I think we were gonna take it section by section, so.

600
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:14,943
[SPEAKER_41]: The first section of the policy is with regards to the application form for membership in the advisory committee.

601
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:16,984
[SPEAKER_41]: We have a date here.

602
00:51:18,496 --> 00:51:23,899
[SPEAKER_41]: that the application form will be done by this Friday, the 12th at 5 p.m.

603
00:51:23,919 --> 00:51:32,304
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm just gonna read what the form will include so we can discuss that in its entirety and then obviously have people comment if they'd like.

604
00:51:32,504 --> 00:51:36,266
[SPEAKER_41]: I do have a question on something myself on this one.

605
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:40,969
[SPEAKER_41]: On the form will be the full name, address, contact information.

606
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,791
[SPEAKER_41]: Why do you wanna be on the advisory committee?

607
00:51:44,662 --> 00:51:53,685
[SPEAKER_41]: Suggested new name for the school, including the following name, brief explanation for why you think the name should be considered relationship of the suggestion to Medford.

608
00:51:55,005 --> 00:51:59,106
[SPEAKER_41]: Are you a current or former member of the Columbus Elementary School community?

609
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:01,607
[SPEAKER_41]: Are you related to a school committee member?

610
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:05,108
[SPEAKER_41]: And if so, how will you require an interpreter?

611
00:52:05,568 --> 00:52:09,710
[SPEAKER_41]: Do you have access to a computer and an internet connection to participate in Zoom meetings?

612
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,691
[SPEAKER_41]: Demographics information includes age,

613
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,381
[SPEAKER_41]: gender, sexual orientation, household income, educational attainment.

614
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:20,803
[SPEAKER_41]: What language do you mainly speak at home?

615
00:52:23,105 --> 00:52:24,486
[SPEAKER_41]: Racial ethnic identity.

616
00:52:24,506 --> 00:52:28,269
[SPEAKER_41]: And the superintendent will create a name.

617
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,412
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, so that is the name chain.

618
00:52:38,276 --> 00:52:38,877
[SPEAKER_41]: That is the form.

619
00:52:38,897 --> 00:52:40,798
[SPEAKER_41]: Does anybody have any questions on that form?

620
00:52:40,878 --> 00:52:43,080
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Kretz, member Van de Kloot,

621
00:52:43,933 --> 00:52:48,899
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm going to let the school committee ask questions first, then we're going to go to Anne-Marie, Nadine, David, Nicole, and Kristen.

622
00:52:50,874 --> 00:52:51,394
[SPEAKER_46]: member Kratz.

623
00:52:51,995 --> 00:52:53,016
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, thank you.

624
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:53,856
[SPEAKER_46]: Um, yep.

625
00:52:53,956 --> 00:53:05,164
[SPEAKER_46]: So I wanted to amend that date because I know that the superintendent we are meeting tonight and the superintendent does her weekly updates every Friday.

626
00:53:05,184 --> 00:53:15,091
[SPEAKER_46]: So and she's meeting this week in particular, um, with Jesse, you know, to gather the information, um, you know, and provide updates to the community on

627
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:23,778
[SPEAKER_46]: you know, what's going to be, you know, details for reopening schools and getting the children back into school safely.

628
00:53:24,278 --> 00:53:28,802
[SPEAKER_46]: So I feel as though two days from now is a little too soon.

629
00:53:28,922 --> 00:53:43,073
[SPEAKER_46]: So I wanted to amend that date to at the earliest if possible, like Monday or the following Friday, so that that's my amendment, either Monday the 15th, I believe, or Friday the 19th.

630
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:47,200
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, member Kratz.

631
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,583
[SPEAKER_41]: Member van de Kloot?

632
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:52,354
[SPEAKER_41]: Just unmute yourself, member van de Kloot, please.

633
00:53:53,909 --> 00:54:06,599
[SPEAKER_33]: When member Rousseau created the form, he had on his form that someone applying for the advisory council committee, sorry, would also be submitting a name on the same form.

634
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,661
[SPEAKER_33]: I have severed the forms.

635
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:13,405
[SPEAKER_33]: I have you apply for the advisory committee or you're putting in a name.

636
00:54:14,105 --> 00:54:17,088
[SPEAKER_33]: Anybody who is a member of the advisory committee

637
00:54:17,899 --> 00:54:22,483
[SPEAKER_33]: on the advisory committee can certainly put in a name, but they're two different forms.

638
00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:25,966
[SPEAKER_33]: It'll just be more easy to organize.

639
00:54:26,226 --> 00:54:27,227
[SPEAKER_33]: Here's the list of names.

640
00:54:27,528 --> 00:54:28,869
[SPEAKER_33]: Here's the list who's applying.

641
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:36,475
[SPEAKER_33]: The other difference in our form is I also asked on the one for the advisory committee,

642
00:54:38,357 --> 00:54:40,899
[SPEAKER_33]: I asked when they were available.

643
00:54:41,459 --> 00:54:45,683
[SPEAKER_33]: So there's a line that says, you know, can you tell us when you're available?

644
00:54:45,723 --> 00:54:53,109
[SPEAKER_33]: Because I think we need to know if people are only available one day a week, that might not be sufficient.

645
00:54:53,169 --> 00:54:55,811
[SPEAKER_33]: If they're only available between four and six on Tuesdays,

646
00:54:57,331 --> 00:55:00,753
[SPEAKER_33]: that may be difficult, and so that's why I asked that question.

647
00:55:01,553 --> 00:55:21,020
[SPEAKER_33]: The other thing is when I wrote mine, I put a statement in it as opposed to a question, and member Rousseau knows about this, a statement saying that if people needed interpretation services or computers, whatever, that that would be supplied.

648
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,921
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's a statement rather than asking them if they

649
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:26,162
[SPEAKER_33]: it's just makes it clear.

650
00:55:27,363 --> 00:55:28,344
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, I agree.

651
00:55:28,364 --> 00:55:35,749
[SPEAKER_41]: I believe E, which is the suggested names for the school should be removed from this form.

652
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:43,434
[SPEAKER_41]: We're gonna make sure Susie's taking good notes on this.

653
00:55:43,655 --> 00:55:48,918
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, so you wanna add the availability.

654
00:55:49,098 --> 00:55:51,140
[SPEAKER_41]: What is the availability onto this form?

655
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:54,519
[SPEAKER_33]: Can I ask the question differently, Mayor?

656
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:58,581
[SPEAKER_33]: Instead of adding it on Member Rousseau's, could we just use mine instead?

657
00:56:00,381 --> 00:56:01,842
[SPEAKER_33]: Because I've already written it all out.

658
00:56:02,422 --> 00:56:11,705
[SPEAKER_33]: And since Member Rousseau submitted the other one, I'd like to hear if he's, you know, these are my suggestions.

659
00:56:11,725 --> 00:56:16,527
[SPEAKER_33]: It would just be easier unless there's a lot of controversy about it.

660
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:19,268
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Rousseau?

661
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:25,206
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Member Van de Kloet, for your resolution.

662
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:30,730
[SPEAKER_21]: It certainly helps to move us somewhere so that there's actual movement.

663
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:37,995
[SPEAKER_21]: I completely agree that E should be removed and the form should be severed, so that's, I think there's probably nobody who would disagree with that.

664
00:56:38,616 --> 00:56:46,882
[SPEAKER_21]: I do think it's important to have a statement in there that, on the application form, that if somebody gets picked for the advisory committee, they don't get to show up with their names.

665
00:56:47,506 --> 00:56:55,950
[SPEAKER_21]: that they think that, you know, that was sort of the logic I had was when you're applying, if you have some names you wanna do to suggest, you do it in line as you go.

666
00:56:57,151 --> 00:57:08,296
[SPEAKER_21]: I just worry somebody will apply to the advisory committee thinking when they get picked, that they get to show up to the advisory committee and then start suggesting names, which is not at all what either of these resolutions puts forth.

667
00:57:09,297 --> 00:57:15,480
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I just wanna be careful that we have some language in there to prevent somebody who went through the effort of applying

668
00:57:15,987 --> 00:57:21,370
[SPEAKER_21]: got selected and shows up at the advisory committee and is devastated to find out their names aren't even on the list.

669
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:23,351
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's too late.

670
00:57:23,932 --> 00:57:27,334
[SPEAKER_21]: By the time the advisory committee is meeting with the list, it's too late.

671
00:57:27,534 --> 00:57:36,319
[SPEAKER_21]: So I am fine with removing E. As for whether we should work from one or the other, I'm not really sure.

672
00:57:36,339 --> 00:57:42,083
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, there's a lot of preamble stuff that's different.

673
00:57:43,444 --> 00:57:47,105
[SPEAKER_21]: that I think we also have to kind of discuss.

674
00:57:49,326 --> 00:57:51,567
[SPEAKER_21]: But the, sorry, go ahead.

675
00:57:51,587 --> 00:57:58,789
[SPEAKER_33]: So instead of working from either resolution, can we work from the list of questions that either you or I put forward?

676
00:57:58,869 --> 00:58:07,252
[SPEAKER_33]: Because that then is going to, we can, one of those is addressed in that list of what I said were the key questions.

677
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:16,903
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, so if we if we worked from the key questions, then we would be, then we would have the discussion about each of our different approaches.

678
00:58:18,423 --> 00:58:19,403
[SPEAKER_21]: May I just respond?

679
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:20,664
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Rousseau, then Member Graham.

680
00:58:21,684 --> 00:58:22,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

681
00:58:22,784 --> 00:58:25,825
[SPEAKER_21]: I do agree that that makes the most sense.

682
00:58:26,005 --> 00:58:35,548
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to be careful that we understand that we need to leave this room with the actual language and the approved resolution, not

683
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:44,448
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, we're gonna have another meeting after Susie reads these minutes and tries to cobble together from our conversation what we think that the resolution should look like.

684
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:46,569
[SPEAKER_21]: So then we're another two weeks away from now.

685
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:53,691
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the exact text that is the resolution that we'll vote on, I think needs to be actually written down in this meeting.

686
00:58:54,952 --> 00:59:04,915
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I agree we should take them by the questions, but at the end, we're not gonna, I mean, I certainly feel weird about voting for a resolution that's like 35 amendments

687
00:59:06,564 --> 00:59:08,406
[SPEAKER_21]: that nobody has actually seen the text of.

688
00:59:09,026 --> 00:59:20,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Because one of the main reasons I wrote this was to prevent confusion, errors, and internal conflicts in the actual instructions that we're giving.

689
00:59:21,096 --> 00:59:26,701
[SPEAKER_21]: To tell people to do something, and then in another place, make it so they can't do it, that's not a good look.

690
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:34,947
[SPEAKER_21]: So I agree we should do it in order like you suggested, but I wanna have the exact words before we vote on it.

691
00:59:39,963 --> 00:59:42,784
[SPEAKER_62]: member Graham.

692
00:59:43,184 --> 00:59:44,444
[SPEAKER_62]: Just a couple thoughts.

693
00:59:44,845 --> 00:59:51,207
[SPEAKER_62]: I feel like somebody needs to build this as we are talking so that at the end it can be read in its entirety.

694
00:59:51,227 --> 00:59:58,049
[SPEAKER_62]: Um and I don't know if Susie is able to do that or prepared to do that in a Google Doc.

695
00:59:58,689 --> 01:00:00,210
[SPEAKER_62]: If she's not, I'm happy to do it.

696
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:01,310
[SPEAKER_62]: Um

697
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:12,266
[SPEAKER_62]: I am fine with the two applications being severed, but I am not on board with any date delays.

698
01:00:12,646 --> 01:00:24,993
[SPEAKER_62]: So I do not, I'm not on board with date delays and I would be happy to lend my assistance to create the Google form if that's what it takes to get the forms out the door by Friday.

699
01:00:25,993 --> 01:00:30,556
[SPEAKER_41]: I think the best way to have one of us

700
01:00:31,709 --> 01:00:43,392
[SPEAKER_41]: have a working document to make these changes is to start with one, either member Bandiclute's or member Russo's and make the changes right on shared access.

701
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,213
[SPEAKER_41]: Agree.

702
01:00:48,694 --> 01:00:59,317
[SPEAKER_41]: And if I may ask a question, because I know that you put the motion forward, Dr. Edward Vinson or the admin team, what is the timeframe?

703
01:01:00,387 --> 01:01:00,687
[SPEAKER_41]: for you.

704
01:01:00,727 --> 01:01:06,612
[SPEAKER_41]: I know it's only a few days, so I'm not opposed to a few days extra if you need it.

705
01:01:06,652 --> 01:01:07,853
[SPEAKER_41]: I just wanted to hear from you first.

706
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:24,805
[SPEAKER_11]: With creating a new document, we are working on a specific communication for schools.

707
01:01:25,965 --> 01:01:33,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Monday would be more reasonable if I continue with the original communication that I'm doing for this Friday.

708
01:01:33,067 --> 01:01:43,310
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could have until Monday to send out all communications regarding the advisory council, I should be able to get it done.

709
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:48,259
[SPEAKER_11]: and let it be a separate freestanding communication.

710
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I could do it by Monday.

711
01:01:52,381 --> 01:01:54,202
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

712
01:01:55,262 --> 01:01:58,623
[SPEAKER_41]: So first member Van de Kloet and member Rousseau.

713
01:01:58,963 --> 01:02:07,347
[SPEAKER_41]: Jenny, can you send it to Jenny or I, the word, it in words, so one of us can type this up, please.

714
01:02:07,707 --> 01:02:08,287
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Graham?

715
01:02:09,178 --> 01:02:16,710
[SPEAKER_62]: Yeah, so superintendent I'm fine with Monday, provided that it doesn't change the next date, the next day, it has to stay in place.

716
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:24,422
[SPEAKER_62]: So I'm not I am I am willing to go along for a change that makes the superintendent's life easier.

717
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:29,485
[SPEAKER_62]: but I am not willing to slide the date, slide the date, slide the date, slide the date.

718
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:45,073
[SPEAKER_62]: So I'm just saying that right now, as long as we feel like that's adequate time for people to apply with that shift of the first deadline from Friday to Monday, I am absolutely fine with that, but I am not on board for a slow shift of all of these dates.

719
01:02:46,383 --> 01:02:48,085
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that would be my only request.

720
01:02:48,866 --> 01:02:56,637
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could let this be a freestanding communication and give us till Monday to send it out and the remaining dates can remain.

721
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,861
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you, Debra Vincent.

722
01:03:00,622 --> 01:03:02,485
[SPEAKER_62]: So, Mayor, are you

723
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:05,303
[SPEAKER_62]: do you want me to do this or are you going to do it?

724
01:03:05,443 --> 01:03:07,704
[SPEAKER_62]: I just, we probably can't both do it.

725
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:13,749
[SPEAKER_41]: Would you mind doing it only so that while you're typing, I can let the residents speak and I'll keep track of that.

726
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:16,511
[SPEAKER_41]: And you can type whether you share it at the end or not.

727
01:03:17,272 --> 01:03:20,474
[SPEAKER_41]: And which one am I working from?

728
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:26,853
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Van de Kloet, we were going to do yours because you severed the two forms.

729
01:03:26,913 --> 01:03:27,974
[SPEAKER_41]: So let's start there.

730
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:29,475
[SPEAKER_41]: Let's start with Member Van de Kloet.

731
01:03:30,336 --> 01:03:31,878
[SPEAKER_41]: Kathy has a motion on the floor.

732
01:03:32,198 --> 01:03:37,404
[SPEAKER_41]: Before that motion is called to change the date, we're going to let the residents speak on this issue.

733
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:38,245
[SPEAKER_41]: So Anne-Marie.

734
01:03:42,543 --> 01:04:06,500
[SPEAKER_54]: hold on um i am here except to get myself okay so i do have a couple of things that i want to address and that is with all due respect i know it was brought up that this was a um topic that came up 20 years ago and even though it might be a topic that other people might know is a new topic it's been 20 years for a lot of people that are involved now that's one

735
01:04:07,561 --> 01:04:27,914
[SPEAKER_54]: And as far as, we're gonna be debating this forever, but as far as people thinking that when people were saying that they weren't heard, I believe, just to clarify, is the night of the meeting in June, when there were people that unfortunately were cut off because they weren't able to say what they wanted to say.

736
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:34,859
[SPEAKER_54]: And from what I understand, the motion went basically more in regards to 50 emails.

737
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,742
[SPEAKER_54]: And it wasn't open to everybody else.

738
01:04:39,183 --> 01:04:40,524
[SPEAKER_54]: I just want to clarify that.

739
01:04:40,825 --> 01:04:45,990
[SPEAKER_54]: The other thing is, is that we're sitting here and you guys are talking about a timeline.

740
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:50,394
[SPEAKER_54]: So if I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to have this out by Monday.

741
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:55,339
[SPEAKER_54]: And how long do the people have to fill out and complete them and return them?

742
01:04:58,517 --> 01:05:03,239
[SPEAKER_41]: We're working on that tonight so that there's proposals, we don't have that set in stone.

743
01:05:03,259 --> 01:05:20,788
[SPEAKER_54]: Okay, because at this point here you have a member who's saying that they don't want to delay any other days or dates, and it's really not fair to ever applies to this, that if it's postponed at the beginning, that it shouldn't be postponed in the other dates because it's a domino effect.

744
01:05:21,761 --> 01:05:32,798
[SPEAKER_54]: The other thing is, is that once the applications are in, since people don't think it's going to be cut time consuming, and again, time is of the essence unless people don't want their kids in school.

745
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,604
[SPEAKER_54]: The fact remains is who's going to be interviewing.

746
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:39,812
[SPEAKER_54]: the people that apply.

747
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:41,873
[SPEAKER_54]: Who is selecting the applications?

748
01:05:43,255 --> 01:05:46,317
[SPEAKER_54]: Has the diversity director seen the application before it goes out?

749
01:05:46,657 --> 01:05:51,562
[SPEAKER_54]: Has the city solicitor seen the application before it goes out to make sure that it's live on?

750
01:05:51,582 --> 01:05:52,082
[SPEAKER_36]: 15 seconds.

751
01:05:52,843 --> 01:05:53,123
[SPEAKER_54]: Okay.

752
01:05:53,703 --> 01:05:56,245
[SPEAKER_54]: And I have had a lot of questions of

753
01:05:57,126 --> 01:06:06,614
[SPEAKER_54]: not to be disrespectful to anyone, but why is it so important to put down our sex orientation to find out if you want to be on a committee or not?

754
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:11,638
[SPEAKER_54]: Because I don't think when you go and apply for a job, you're able to do that.

755
01:06:12,058 --> 01:06:15,301
[SPEAKER_54]: Because that is, it's okay.

756
01:06:16,582 --> 01:06:19,404
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, good, good questions.

757
01:06:19,465 --> 01:06:21,766
[SPEAKER_41]: And I think we're here to hash a lot of those out.

758
01:06:21,967 --> 01:06:24,168
[SPEAKER_41]: But thank you for the questions.

759
01:06:24,409 --> 01:06:24,789
[SPEAKER_41]: Nadine.

760
01:06:28,463 --> 01:06:29,685
[SPEAKER_59]: Thank you very much.

761
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:41,709
[SPEAKER_60]: It's not so much a question, just part of what I really didn't get to finish saying before.

762
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:43,050
[SPEAKER_60]: So I'm reading it.

763
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:45,451
[SPEAKER_60]: That's why I'm not even on video because it's just easier to do it this way.

764
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:47,132
[SPEAKER_60]: Bear with me.

765
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:52,894
[SPEAKER_60]: It was mentioned that the school committee has full authority to change the name, which I guess I fully don't understand.

766
01:06:52,954 --> 01:06:57,196
[SPEAKER_60]: But it's not just about, say, at least six of you, OK, or about the seven.

767
01:06:57,216 --> 01:06:59,897
[SPEAKER_60]: It's about a whole city, which I know you keep hearing.

768
01:07:00,342 --> 01:07:10,047
[SPEAKER_60]: I know this is set in stone that it's changed, but the problem is the name Columbus Elementary for the last 90 years represents the people of Medford of all races.

769
01:07:10,747 --> 01:07:14,649
[SPEAKER_60]: And by pushing to change it, you're taking that away from everybody.

770
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:20,852
[SPEAKER_60]: If I'm gonna make this more personal aside from being a former Columbus parent, I'm half Puerto Rican, half Sicilian.

771
01:07:21,132 --> 01:07:24,734
[SPEAKER_60]: Puerto Rican bloodlines and culture evolved through a mix of Spanish, African,

772
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:30,018
[SPEAKER_60]: and indigenous Taino, I think that's how you pronounce it, and Caribbean Indian races.

773
01:07:30,419 --> 01:07:34,482
[SPEAKER_60]: And as a result of my mixed heritage, Columbus still has no negative effect on me.

774
01:07:34,522 --> 01:07:36,264
[SPEAKER_60]: It was 500 years ago.

775
01:07:36,284 --> 01:07:44,811
[SPEAKER_60]: I think if this was chosen 90 years ago, there was all different races back then, and it would have been an issue

776
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:47,711
[SPEAKER_60]: you know, probably back then.

777
01:07:47,771 --> 01:07:49,752
[SPEAKER_60]: We live in the cancel culture right now.

778
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,372
[SPEAKER_60]: And I think this is just a product of that.

779
01:07:51,392 --> 01:07:53,832
[SPEAKER_60]: And I think it's being rushed.

780
01:07:54,132 --> 01:07:56,453
[SPEAKER_60]: I think that there's more important things to deal with.

781
01:07:56,613 --> 01:08:04,954
[SPEAKER_60]: You know, we have children that have been out of school for one year, especially vocational students suffering because they're not in there enough.

782
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:07,315
[SPEAKER_60]: This is just not a priority.

783
01:08:07,355 --> 01:08:09,075
[SPEAKER_60]: And I hope you really think about that.

784
01:08:09,615 --> 01:08:10,875
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you for your time.

785
01:08:13,436 --> 01:08:13,776
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

786
01:08:14,807 --> 01:08:16,527
[SPEAKER_39]: David McKillop.

787
01:08:19,548 --> 01:08:20,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

788
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:29,730
[SPEAKER_05]: So to finish my point, this letter that I was reading was basically talking about exactly what people brought up, which was racism.

789
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:39,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in 1891, the systematic racism against Italians was horrific, just as it was everywhere else in every other situation.

790
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:47,239
[SPEAKER_05]: But President Harrison created the Columbus Day holiday to end that, to bring people into the fold.

791
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:57,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that to sit there and talk about racism and white supremacy, I don't think President Harrison was a white supremacist when he was thinking about this.

792
01:08:57,468 --> 01:09:00,691
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, the Italian consulate in Italy itself

793
01:09:01,187 --> 01:09:10,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Sent over a statue of christopher columbus to forge a union between the two countries And this is why it is so important to the italian culture.

794
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:15,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just Christopher columbus and is in the history of the man.

795
01:09:15,952 --> 01:09:28,217
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a symbol of a way to in to include the italian american community and that's when it was created in 1892 And it was created and after 13

796
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:42,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, generations of people celebrating Christopher Columbus and it morphed into a symbol more so than the name and the person.

797
01:09:42,688 --> 01:09:50,374
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a symbol of inclusiveness and to take that away without anybody being able to vocalize it is taking away that symbol.

798
01:09:50,474 --> 01:09:53,076
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I say to you, like I said to you on Monday,

799
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:58,360
[SPEAKER_05]: people's perceptions are their reality, and you are taking away that reality.

800
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:02,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, I implore you, please do not drive the stake further.

801
01:10:03,024 --> 01:10:11,170
[SPEAKER_05]: The jury is out on the history of Christopher Columbus, as Carol pointed out, and I think there has to be more conversation.

802
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:14,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to leave you there.

803
01:10:14,553 --> 01:10:18,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I implore that you think about it, and I applaud Ms.

804
01:10:18,295 --> 01:10:21,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Vander Kloot for even thinking about it after Monday's conversation.

805
01:10:23,373 --> 01:10:23,934
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, David.

806
01:10:25,456 --> 01:10:25,856
[SPEAKER_41]: Nicole.

807
01:10:35,127 --> 01:10:35,488
[SPEAKER_59]: Hello.

808
01:10:35,588 --> 01:10:35,768
[SPEAKER_59]: OK.

809
01:10:41,365 --> 01:10:42,326
[SPEAKER_57]: Hello, how are you?

810
01:10:42,986 --> 01:10:44,167
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you for letting me speak.

811
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:49,572
[SPEAKER_57]: I just wanted to ask one thing, and this is the major thing that is going around Medford.

812
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:55,337
[SPEAKER_57]: Does anyone care about the division that this is causing Medford right now?

813
01:10:56,678 --> 01:11:02,022
[SPEAKER_57]: That's what I really want you council members to actually think about is what this is doing to Medford.

814
01:11:02,483 --> 01:11:04,364
[SPEAKER_57]: This isn't just actually a Medford thing.

815
01:11:04,504 --> 01:11:06,006
[SPEAKER_57]: This goes way above Medford.

816
01:11:06,326 --> 01:11:09,268
[SPEAKER_57]: This is now a state thing where other people are speaking about this.

817
01:11:10,393 --> 01:11:11,694
[SPEAKER_57]: Have you thought about that at all?

818
01:11:14,836 --> 01:11:16,096
[SPEAKER_41]: Personally, very much so, yes.

819
01:11:17,257 --> 01:11:17,597
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay.

820
01:11:18,098 --> 01:11:22,841
[SPEAKER_57]: So I'm not, none of you really know me, but I come from, I'm an Italian American.

821
01:11:22,881 --> 01:11:27,944
[SPEAKER_57]: My parents and my great grandparents are all, you know, I'm the first to come over here.

822
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:35,969
[SPEAKER_57]: And the thing that Columbus is so important to us, it's not the person, as David said, it's what it is to Italian Americans.

823
01:11:37,009 --> 01:11:41,411
[SPEAKER_57]: South Medford is a very Italian-American community, just like a lot of Medford.

824
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:47,353
[SPEAKER_57]: You are basically taking that away and stomping on all our traditions, everything that we care about.

825
01:11:47,914 --> 01:11:52,596
[SPEAKER_57]: A lot of people that are against this, as you say, they're not really from Medford.

826
01:11:52,896 --> 01:11:55,897
[SPEAKER_57]: They might now live in Medford, but they don't know the culture.

827
01:11:56,157 --> 01:11:59,158
[SPEAKER_57]: No one on the committee is actually Italian-American.

828
01:11:59,518 --> 01:12:02,059
[SPEAKER_57]: So you don't know how we actually feel about this.

829
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,580
[SPEAKER_57]: I have a son.

830
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,241
[SPEAKER_57]: He's in the second grade.

831
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:08,103
[SPEAKER_57]: He came home to me, he doesn't know anything.

832
01:12:08,543 --> 01:12:10,905
[SPEAKER_57]: And he said that Italians are bad.

833
01:12:11,266 --> 01:12:12,887
[SPEAKER_57]: And I said, what are you talking about?

834
01:12:13,508 --> 01:12:14,569
[SPEAKER_57]: Columbus is bad.

835
01:12:14,649 --> 01:12:15,609
[SPEAKER_57]: He's a bad person.

836
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,951
[SPEAKER_57]: Nobody, you don't know what you're talking about.

837
01:12:18,272 --> 01:12:22,375
[SPEAKER_57]: So this is my, my nine year old child is coming home saying this.

838
01:12:22,435 --> 01:12:24,497
[SPEAKER_57]: And he said that someone told him this in recess.

839
01:12:25,338 --> 01:12:29,822
[SPEAKER_57]: So you have to think about not only what you're doing to the Italian community, but what you're doing to our children.

840
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:31,744
[SPEAKER_57]: Nicole, you have 15 seconds.

841
01:12:33,607 --> 01:12:41,912
[SPEAKER_57]: So that's what I just want you to think about is that what this means to time community and what we feel about is not about the person.

842
01:12:42,072 --> 01:12:49,416
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't think Columbus is bad, but it's about what the meeting is, why Columbus was even brought up as David has discussed.

843
01:12:49,796 --> 01:12:51,237
[SPEAKER_57]: It has nothing to do about him.

844
01:12:51,597 --> 01:12:52,738
[SPEAKER_57]: It's made you Nicole.

845
01:12:54,599 --> 01:12:54,899
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay.

846
01:12:55,139 --> 01:12:55,539
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you.

847
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:56,860
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Nicole.

848
01:13:01,463 --> 01:13:01,803
[SPEAKER_43]: Kristen.

849
01:13:09,281 --> 01:13:10,182
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi, am I unmuted?

850
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:11,403
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

851
01:13:12,724 --> 01:13:13,785
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, great.

852
01:13:14,325 --> 01:13:30,398
[SPEAKER_58]: I just felt like I needed to make a very specific point that even though some of my fellow Italian Americans here keep acting as if the Italian American community is united on this matter, I just want to say on the record that this is not the case.

853
01:13:30,678 --> 01:13:32,079
[SPEAKER_58]: I am 100% Italian descent.

854
01:13:33,837 --> 01:13:45,349
[SPEAKER_58]: And I have been arguing against honoring Columbus since the 90s when I refused to apply for a Knights of Columbus scholarship, which made my grandpa not speak to me for a week since he was the grand knight of his chapter at the time.

855
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:54,338
[SPEAKER_58]: And also, despite what some people want us to think, the horror at Columbus's acts is not a modern day phenomenon.

856
01:13:54,759 --> 01:13:56,040
[SPEAKER_58]: There are writings.

857
01:13:56,738 --> 01:14:13,426
[SPEAKER_58]: contemporary writings at the time in the 1500s by people like Bartolomé de las Casas, who was a colonizer, was so horrified by the treatment of the natives that he renounced his land grant, freed his slaves, became a priest, and went back to Hispaniola to try to help the natives.

858
01:14:13,807 --> 01:14:20,290
[SPEAKER_58]: He was not a perfect man himself because it was the 1500s, but he did not believe that people deserve to be tortured and enslaved.

859
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:24,212
[SPEAKER_58]: He wrote contemporary accounts of the torture that the natives

860
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:26,462
[SPEAKER_58]: under the Spanish and the colonizers.

861
01:14:26,643 --> 01:14:35,250
[SPEAKER_58]: And these acts are so diabolically and disgustingly violent that I couldn't even feel comfortable discussing them in front of children.

862
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:39,894
[SPEAKER_58]: So why should they go to a school that honors the person who spearheaded them?

863
01:14:40,615 --> 01:14:48,842
[SPEAKER_58]: And if, frankly, as a culture, if we insist on sticking with Columbus to name the school, a man who didn't even set foot in the United States,

864
01:14:49,548 --> 01:14:55,513
[SPEAKER_58]: just says to me that members of our community can't think of any other Italians or Italian-Americans who have done great things for our country.

865
01:14:55,693 --> 01:14:56,773
[SPEAKER_58]: And to me, that's just sad.

866
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:58,555
[SPEAKER_58]: I think we can do better.

867
01:14:58,575 --> 01:15:02,618
[SPEAKER_58]: We can honor Italians at the same time if we want to.

868
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:17,649
[SPEAKER_58]: I can think of plenty of people off the top of my head who would deserve to be honored as Italian-Americans without having to, you know, name a school after a man who did terrible things that I wouldn't even talk about in front of a kid.

869
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:18,950
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

870
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:21,920
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

871
01:15:23,681 --> 01:15:23,981
[SPEAKER_41]: Jean.

872
01:15:29,204 --> 01:15:29,904
[SPEAKER_41]: Jean, you're unmuted.

873
01:15:33,826 --> 01:15:34,567
[SPEAKER_55]: Can you hear me now?

874
01:15:35,027 --> 01:15:35,267
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

875
01:15:35,867 --> 01:15:36,728
[SPEAKER_55]: Great, thank you.

876
01:15:37,148 --> 01:15:37,808
[SPEAKER_55]: I'll be brief.

877
01:15:38,148 --> 01:15:50,895
[SPEAKER_55]: So I think these conversations and the things that people are talking about illustrate very well what I alluded to earlier, and the fact that the change management process is not a process that needs to be jammed through for expediency.

878
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:54,284
[SPEAKER_55]: for political optics in an election year.

879
01:15:54,784 --> 01:16:01,409
[SPEAKER_55]: And I think that's why looking at these conversations, that's why this needs to be a more longer term conversation, right?

880
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:11,856
[SPEAKER_55]: I think people are still overlooking that for a lot of Italian Americans, it's not about Columbus and what he did in his life.

881
01:16:12,496 --> 01:16:21,382
[SPEAKER_55]: It is about what he became to Italian Americans who used that opportunity under Harris to lift themselves up

882
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:24,670
[SPEAKER_55]: and stop being lynched and beaten and prosecuted.

883
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:34,173
[SPEAKER_55]: Although I will say as someone of Italian descent, Italians are still treated badly in certain circles and people still lock down on them.

884
01:16:34,473 --> 01:16:44,355
[SPEAKER_55]: And there is stereotypical issues that occur specifically in Hollywood and the way Italians are projected and portrayed on television.

885
01:16:44,715 --> 01:16:49,937
[SPEAKER_55]: So this idea that Italian Americans don't suffer anything isn't true.

886
01:16:50,643 --> 01:16:55,324
[SPEAKER_55]: but it's not in the same regard as what's going on in other areas of our culture right now.

887
01:16:55,864 --> 01:17:02,786
[SPEAKER_55]: And so there's a great opportunity here as we move forward to create healing, but that's done over time.

888
01:17:03,206 --> 01:17:11,429
[SPEAKER_55]: It's not done by a three week effort to put together a random committee and decide on a name out of people submit.

889
01:17:11,889 --> 01:17:12,649
[SPEAKER_55]: It's more than that.

890
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:19,451
[SPEAKER_55]: And I agree with the previous speaker, but there are many Italian icons that could be selected instead.

891
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:24,023
[SPEAKER_55]: But again, that's something that Italian Americans should be picking.

892
01:17:24,303 --> 01:17:27,126
[SPEAKER_55]: We shouldn't be told again, like we were told originally.

893
01:17:27,186 --> 01:17:28,306
[SPEAKER_55]: And you have 15 seconds.

894
01:17:28,947 --> 01:17:43,278
[SPEAKER_55]: So again, I would urge you with someone who is a certified project management, change management consultant, and have been doing this type of work for 25 years, that it needs to be measured or it's going to create a deeper rift.

895
01:17:43,418 --> 01:17:46,100
[SPEAKER_55]: It won't be something that will be forgotten.

896
01:17:46,861 --> 01:17:47,281
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

897
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:49,803
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Jean.

898
01:17:53,697 --> 01:17:56,057
[SPEAKER_41]: Mr. Carbone?

899
01:17:56,097 --> 01:17:56,638
[SPEAKER_45]: Yes, thank you.

900
01:17:57,098 --> 01:18:00,698
[SPEAKER_45]: Christopher Carbone, my daughter Sarah actually attends the Columbus.

901
01:18:01,358 --> 01:18:16,561
[SPEAKER_45]: With regards to the application, which is what this segment of the meeting was supposed to be about, I think the application should have a section in there, not just for their address, a party, a person living in Medford at a certain address could still send their children to another school.

902
01:18:17,501 --> 01:18:19,502
[SPEAKER_45]: I think there should be a section in there that says,

903
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:24,323
[SPEAKER_45]: have you or any of your children attended the Columbus School?

904
01:18:24,984 --> 01:18:25,485
[SPEAKER_45]: How many?

905
01:18:26,065 --> 01:18:27,667
[SPEAKER_45]: When they something along those lines.

906
01:18:27,948 --> 01:18:39,001
[SPEAKER_45]: And the reason for that is because I think the people who are most proximate to the school who send their children there or have sent their children there should have a larger voice in this discussion.

907
01:18:39,762 --> 01:18:48,351
[SPEAKER_45]: I think that that I mentioned my first set of comments and I think it's true now because we're going to be the people going to be most affected by the school's name case because we are most proximate to it.

908
01:18:48,731 --> 01:18:49,772
[SPEAKER_45]: And how else do I know that?

909
01:18:50,053 --> 01:19:02,565
[SPEAKER_45]: Well, I know that because when Mr. Rousseau first brought up this issue back in June, the first thing he said was, I sent my kids to Columbus or something to the effect of I couldn't believe they still had the name Columbus.

910
01:19:03,366 --> 01:19:05,226
[SPEAKER_45]: That's saying something important.

911
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:10,648
[SPEAKER_45]: I think the people who send their children to that school should have a greater voice.

912
01:19:10,688 --> 01:19:11,988
[SPEAKER_45]: Now, how will that greater voice be?

913
01:19:12,408 --> 01:19:20,930
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't think there should be a certain number of people on the committee who attended it, but I think it should be something on the effect of a tiebreaker or something along those lines.

914
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:24,051
[SPEAKER_45]: So I believe that the application should be amended

915
01:19:24,691 --> 01:19:31,315
[SPEAKER_45]: to include people who, so that you say, how many, do you live in, do you send your children to Columbus?

916
01:19:31,876 --> 01:19:32,836
[SPEAKER_45]: And if so, when?

917
01:19:33,217 --> 01:19:34,257
[SPEAKER_45]: So that can be part of it.

918
01:19:34,798 --> 01:19:41,722
[SPEAKER_45]: I think that if we're going to ask people, and I strongly oppose asking people their sexual orientation, I think that is, there's no reason for that.

919
01:19:42,342 --> 01:19:46,025
[SPEAKER_45]: But if you were to ask that, I don't want a straight person

920
01:19:46,705 --> 01:19:55,172
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't know why a straight person who lives in West Medford should have a greater voice than a gay couple who send their kids to the Columbus.

921
01:19:55,852 --> 01:20:01,536
[SPEAKER_45]: I think those people should get priority, and I think that's remarkable.

922
01:20:01,716 --> 01:20:04,438
[SPEAKER_41]: Mr. Carboni, we do have the question.

923
01:20:04,519 --> 01:20:07,881
[SPEAKER_41]: Are you a current or former member of the Columbus Elementary School community?

924
01:20:08,161 --> 01:20:10,383
[SPEAKER_41]: If so, how so we can

925
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:16,710
[SPEAKER_41]: potentially make that a question mark if we should ask for the date of when they attended or worked there.

926
01:20:18,291 --> 01:20:18,751
[SPEAKER_41]: So thank you.

927
01:20:20,632 --> 01:20:20,892
[SPEAKER_41]: Martha?

928
01:20:27,196 --> 01:20:31,041
[SPEAKER_41]: Dr. Cushing, you might be muting them and unmuting them.

929
01:20:31,121 --> 01:20:32,603
[SPEAKER_41]: I think we're both playing around.

930
01:20:32,623 --> 01:20:33,344
[SPEAKER_41]: There we go, Martha.

931
01:20:33,364 --> 01:20:35,527
[SPEAKER_28]: I am now unmuted, I guess.

932
01:20:35,987 --> 01:20:36,908
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

933
01:20:37,109 --> 01:20:40,032
[SPEAKER_28]: I am in favor of changing the name of the school.

934
01:20:40,994 --> 01:20:42,836
[SPEAKER_28]: Columbus doesn't represent

935
01:20:44,659 --> 01:20:51,780
[SPEAKER_28]: Medford particularly appropriately, and I don't think he represents the Italian American community for that matter.

936
01:20:53,941 --> 01:20:59,002
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to endorse the application process.

937
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:12,445
[SPEAKER_28]: I think you can separate the, I know I, in my work as a, in a foundation, I often have applications submitted where the, the demographic information, the race and,

938
01:21:14,255 --> 01:21:17,236
[SPEAKER_28]: sexual orientation are put in a separate document.

939
01:21:17,316 --> 01:21:21,818
[SPEAKER_28]: So those do not become part of the application decision.

940
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:30,480
[SPEAKER_28]: They are simply tracked for reasons that the city wants to know the makeup of its participants.

941
01:21:30,821 --> 01:21:32,941
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think that's, excuse my dog.

942
01:21:32,961 --> 01:21:35,422
[SPEAKER_28]: She's pretty restless right now.

943
01:21:36,663 --> 01:21:37,483
[SPEAKER_28]: But I think the,

944
01:21:39,548 --> 01:21:40,948
[SPEAKER_28]: process should be a good one.

945
01:21:41,368 --> 01:21:42,469
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think it needs to be.

946
01:21:42,509 --> 01:21:50,191
[SPEAKER_28]: I think delaying it or claiming that there are other things that are more important are essentially diversion tactics.

947
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:52,091
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think we need to address this.

948
01:21:52,811 --> 01:21:54,031
[SPEAKER_28]: It's been a long time coming.

949
01:21:54,111 --> 01:21:54,532
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

950
01:21:56,052 --> 01:21:56,692
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Martha.

951
01:21:58,012 --> 01:21:58,372
[SPEAKER_28]: Philippe?

952
01:22:02,874 --> 01:22:03,474
[SPEAKER_39]: I will unmute you.

953
01:22:03,494 --> 01:22:06,794
[SPEAKER_39]: Or try.

954
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:07,615
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

955
01:22:07,675 --> 01:22:08,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me now?

956
01:22:08,695 --> 01:22:08,875
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

957
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:10,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

958
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:11,857
[SPEAKER_10]: So good evening everyone.

959
01:22:11,897 --> 01:22:15,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've heard for the past hour and a half people arguing on both sides, right?

960
01:22:15,759 --> 01:22:16,959
[SPEAKER_10]: And everyone's kind of making their own case.

961
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:25,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And so for me, I don't have a horse in the game as Mr. Carbone had mentioned, but my son will be going to Columbus in a couple of years.

962
01:22:25,263 --> 01:22:27,504
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have been kind of looking at the school system.

963
01:22:27,644 --> 01:22:36,929
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things that I was more concerned about is just kind of looking at this objectively is I was a little bit surprised to hear that we still don't have an estimate as to how much this costs.

964
01:22:37,649 --> 01:22:44,912
[SPEAKER_10]: So for example, like if I'm doing work on my house, I'll get you know estimates to figure out how much it is to figure out if I can get into the budget right before I go ahead and do something.

965
01:22:45,813 --> 01:22:48,654
[SPEAKER_10]: But given that I've kind of heard that we've been like $3 million.

966
01:22:50,109 --> 01:22:51,550
[SPEAKER_10]: below the budget for 2020.

967
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:54,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, you guys will have a better idea, just I've heard.

968
01:22:55,031 --> 01:22:57,612
[SPEAKER_10]: But for 2021, we'll have to come up with a new budget.

969
01:22:57,632 --> 01:23:01,373
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm kind of just wondering, like, you know, where does this money come from?

970
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:05,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it have to come from other programs, other materials that we can't give to our students?

971
01:23:06,195 --> 01:23:09,256
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's not that much money, okay, well, you know, whatever the decision is fine.

972
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:13,698
[SPEAKER_10]: But if it's something that's like, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars, and obviously that becomes cost prohibitive.

973
01:23:13,758 --> 01:23:13,878
[SPEAKER_10]: So

974
01:23:14,478 --> 01:23:36,328
[SPEAKER_10]: i'm just trying to understand like how that how those decisions made right because at the end of the day we're trying to get the best education for our kids and now it's the best environment as well so all these things need to come into consideration so just trying to get a better idea of how that how that stuff works and that's it for me thanks thank you remember russo then we'll go to kelly

975
01:23:37,534 --> 01:23:38,094
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor.

976
01:23:38,634 --> 01:23:42,656
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to comment on the demographics question.

977
01:23:42,856 --> 01:23:57,442
[SPEAKER_21]: As with the superintendent search, and it's true that it's not actually set in the, it's not in the resolution, and that's a failure of my own because I, having done the superintendent search survey, that is exactly what we did.

978
01:23:57,542 --> 01:24:05,485
[SPEAKER_21]: There was, you'd finish the whole survey, and at the end, there was a button that says, you know, there would be a demographics survey you could fill out.

979
01:24:05,585 --> 01:24:07,346
[SPEAKER_21]: It was completely unrelated to your,

980
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:12,741
[SPEAKER_21]: actual application and we could not correlate or collate those things.

981
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:18,585
[SPEAKER_21]: So, and the reason was described by Ms.

982
01:24:18,645 --> 01:24:28,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Andres about, you know, getting a sense for, so who in the community are we reaching most importantly, so we can figure out who we're not reaching is the purpose of that.

983
01:24:28,391 --> 01:24:35,675
[SPEAKER_21]: It's certainly not to decide that we want to have a gay person on the committee and, you know, that's not the purpose of that at all.

984
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,442
[SPEAKER_21]: But it does read that way, so I totally own that.

985
01:24:41,363 --> 01:24:45,447
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say about the cost, I don't have a clue what the cost is.

986
01:24:45,607 --> 01:24:47,849
[SPEAKER_21]: I think there are probably many options around cost.

987
01:24:49,029 --> 01:24:57,597
[SPEAKER_21]: And like the Columbus apparently right now, they need new envelopes for their letters, a new letterhead, like they need to order them because they are out.

988
01:24:58,097 --> 01:25:01,820
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's no additional cost to order them with a new name.

989
01:25:02,741 --> 01:25:06,484
[SPEAKER_21]: If they were throwing away 10 years worth of envelopes, then of course,

990
01:25:07,536 --> 01:25:09,558
[SPEAKER_21]: That's totally a different conversation.

991
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:20,965
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I also wanted, Mayor, there's also a member of the public who has been trying to get attention, and now I don't see her.

992
01:25:23,107 --> 01:25:25,748
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't remember her name, because she's been there waving her hand.

993
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:33,694
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was David, I believe, was the first name, although there was a woman in the video.

994
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:37,036
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just wanted to make sure we could get

995
01:25:39,586 --> 01:25:44,470
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm afraid I don't remember the name, but if they could come back on and I see them, I'll raise that again.

996
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:48,172
[SPEAKER_21]: But they've been waving for quite a long time and I think they're just getting this.

997
01:25:48,772 --> 01:25:49,093
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

998
01:25:49,453 --> 01:25:49,993
[SPEAKER_41]: Just let me know.

999
01:25:50,033 --> 01:25:50,373
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1000
01:25:53,996 --> 01:25:54,296
[SPEAKER_47]: Kelly.

1001
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:57,218
[SPEAKER_47]: Hi, my name is Kelly Cooney.

1002
01:25:57,258 --> 01:25:58,019
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm sorry I'm late.

1003
01:25:58,039 --> 01:26:05,564
[SPEAKER_47]: I was at the Human Rights Commission meeting and I didn't intend to speak, but after hearing what I heard when I came on, I felt compelled to as

1004
01:26:06,351 --> 01:26:22,900
[SPEAKER_47]: an Italian American and I don't know I implore this belief that you have to live in Medford for a long time to have your opinion be matter but my mom bought a house my parents bought a house here when I was five so I think 30 years counts but I'm not sure, and I just wanted to kind of speak to Kristen's point as someone who

1005
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:29,604
[SPEAKER_47]: is a long, you know, someone who's lived here a long time and is Italian American that I fully support the name change.

1006
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:46,355
[SPEAKER_47]: I think that it is, you know, my daughter's three and a half and she already knows that Columbus wasn't a good guy and that doesn't take away from my pride in my heritage and my ethnicity and my, you know, my 92-year-old grandmother who I just lost in January who's Italian.

1007
01:26:47,356 --> 01:26:52,920
[SPEAKER_47]: She had a lot of pride in being Italian too and also knew that Columbus is not somebody that we really needed to uphold and

1008
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:56,162
[SPEAKER_47]: I keep hearing repeatedly, it's not about Columbus, it's not about Columbus.

1009
01:26:56,582 --> 01:26:59,485
[SPEAKER_47]: So if it's not about Columbus, then why do we care about changing the name?

1010
01:27:00,705 --> 01:27:01,866
[SPEAKER_47]: And let's move on.

1011
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:05,169
[SPEAKER_47]: And we can still talk about Columbus in context.

1012
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:08,091
[SPEAKER_47]: It doesn't mean that he's gone forever.

1013
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:09,051
[SPEAKER_47]: We can still talk about him.

1014
01:27:09,071 --> 01:27:09,952
[SPEAKER_47]: We can still learn about him.

1015
01:27:10,172 --> 01:27:17,577
[SPEAKER_47]: There is lots to be discussed in historical context that is important, but that doesn't mean that he needs to be lauded on a school name.

1016
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:18,678
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1017
01:27:19,499 --> 01:27:19,939
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1018
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:21,160
[SPEAKER_39]: Bri?

1019
01:27:28,311 --> 01:27:29,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, can everyone hear me?

1020
01:27:30,233 --> 01:27:30,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1021
01:27:31,494 --> 01:27:33,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1022
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:43,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't lived in Medford for very long, and I just want to say I really appreciate all the work and all the discussion that everyone has put into this.

1023
01:27:44,324 --> 01:27:54,692
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to offer a perspective to maybe consider how this looks to our children, specifically the children who attend the Columbus School.

1024
01:27:55,513 --> 01:28:11,979
[SPEAKER_17]: In that I think kids today are growing up in a time of immense racial racial tension Information is more readily available to them than it was even to me when I was in school and These kids are smart.

1025
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:18,902
[SPEAKER_17]: They ask about this stuff and I think it's important that we show our kids that when we know better we do better and

1026
01:28:20,307 --> 01:28:35,710
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't, I don't think it's any of this is meant to detract from what Columbus means to Italian Americans, but it's, you know, when we learn things, I think it's important that our children see that we adapt to new incoming data and that we learn from history.

1027
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:37,991
[SPEAKER_17]: People keep saying, I don't want to erase history.

1028
01:28:38,071 --> 01:28:43,252
[SPEAKER_17]: This name change is erasing history, but why would we also continue to ignore it?

1029
01:28:43,272 --> 01:28:48,013
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, you know, I just, I think it's just,

1030
01:28:50,071 --> 01:28:55,073
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of, and then my second point was around the monetary concerns that folks have been bringing up.

1031
01:28:55,153 --> 01:29:02,335
[SPEAKER_17]: And to that point, I wanted to say, truth be told, there is never a right time to bring about true systemic change.

1032
01:29:02,355 --> 01:29:09,237
[SPEAKER_17]: There's never a right time to confront inconvenient truths and do the right thing.

1033
01:29:09,317 --> 01:29:11,718
[SPEAKER_17]: The right thing is usually the most painful thing.

1034
01:29:12,858 --> 01:29:18,960
[SPEAKER_17]: And if there was a fundraising effort, you know, to make this change happen, I would contribute to it.

1035
01:29:19,844 --> 01:29:23,987
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll come out and say, my kid, when she's school age, is not going to go to the Columbus school.

1036
01:29:24,587 --> 01:29:24,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1037
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:26,288
[SPEAKER_17]: You have 15 seconds.

1038
01:29:26,948 --> 01:29:27,289
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1039
01:29:27,769 --> 01:29:28,749
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't care.

1040
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:30,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford is my home.

1041
01:29:30,571 --> 01:29:35,794
[SPEAKER_17]: I would gladly contribute to see us know better and do better for our kids.

1042
01:29:36,674 --> 01:29:36,914
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

1043
01:29:38,755 --> 01:29:39,116
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1044
01:29:41,317 --> 01:29:41,617
[SPEAKER_39]: Eunice?

1045
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:46,880
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thanks.

1046
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:47,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Caught me off guard there.

1047
01:29:48,696 --> 01:29:50,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for your time.

1048
01:29:50,298 --> 01:29:58,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say that I think this whole process would have gone a lot better if it had been handled better back in June.

1049
01:29:58,367 --> 01:30:02,451
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, this is not a school issue.

1050
01:30:02,471 --> 01:30:04,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a community issue.

1051
01:30:04,854 --> 01:30:05,795
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a difference.

1052
01:30:06,793 --> 01:30:14,276
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're renaming a city building in a neighborhood that affects an awful lot of people.

1053
01:30:15,136 --> 01:30:22,698
[SPEAKER_04]: The entire community should have been notified far ahead of that June meeting, not 48 hours early to meet the letter of the law.

1054
01:30:23,659 --> 01:30:28,140
[SPEAKER_04]: What about all the people who are not regularly on social media or perhaps not at all?

1055
01:30:29,001 --> 01:30:32,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Notification had been done primarily on the Medford Public Schools site.

1056
01:30:33,769 --> 01:30:35,931
[SPEAKER_04]: What about people without kids in the system?

1057
01:30:36,492 --> 01:30:39,234
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't check the MPS site because they have no need to.

1058
01:30:40,155 --> 01:30:47,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize how hard it is to reach people these days, but a far better effort needed to be made for a community issue of this magnitude.

1059
01:30:47,902 --> 01:30:51,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It should have been in the transcript and notification made in other ways.

1060
01:30:53,288 --> 01:30:56,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I take exception to it being said that the community was heard.

1061
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:57,231
[SPEAKER_04]: We have not.

1062
01:30:57,832 --> 01:31:05,997
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave 48 hours notice over a weekend and made a decision for which you will not reverse, and that's why the community is irate.

1063
01:31:06,678 --> 01:31:12,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And at least one of the school committee members states he would make this change even if everyone said not to.

1064
01:31:12,762 --> 01:31:16,945
[SPEAKER_04]: That is arrogant, and that person is not listening to all constituents.

1065
01:31:17,725 --> 01:31:20,246
[SPEAKER_04]: and notification of this particular meeting was no better.

1066
01:31:20,946 --> 01:31:30,888
[SPEAKER_04]: The patch posted notification of tonight's meeting exactly 37 minutes before the meeting began at 5.07 this evening.

1067
01:31:31,468 --> 01:31:32,369
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that right?

1068
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:38,210
[SPEAKER_04]: If we had a couple of June 15th meeting, we'd be in a better place right now.

1069
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:42,531
[SPEAKER_04]: A wedge has been driven in this community that is probably irreversible.

1070
01:31:43,011 --> 01:31:46,572
[SPEAKER_04]: And as others have stated, you have far more pressing issues going on right now.

1071
01:31:47,213 --> 01:31:47,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1072
01:31:50,136 --> 01:31:50,616
[SPEAKER_59]: Thank you.

1073
01:31:50,636 --> 01:31:52,839
[SPEAKER_36]: Eileen.

1074
01:31:52,859 --> 01:31:53,439
[SPEAKER_36]: If I may?

1075
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:55,461
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, yes, Lisa.

1076
01:31:55,641 --> 01:31:57,824
[SPEAKER_36]: I just want to give everybody clarification.

1077
01:31:57,884 --> 01:32:04,490
[SPEAKER_36]: It's up to Medford Patch, Medford Transcript, what they want to print, and when they want to print it, they're private companies.

1078
01:32:05,531 --> 01:32:05,912
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Lisa.

1079
01:32:05,932 --> 01:32:08,774
[SPEAKER_36]: You get the information at the same time everybody else does.

1080
01:32:09,135 --> 01:32:09,555
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1081
01:32:09,575 --> 01:32:11,177
[SPEAKER_36]: Eileen.

1082
01:32:24,918 --> 01:32:25,398
[SPEAKER_41]: Sorry, Aline.

1083
01:32:25,598 --> 01:32:26,259
[SPEAKER_41]: Hold on one second.

1084
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:26,899
[SPEAKER_41]: Trying to unmute you.

1085
01:32:26,919 --> 01:32:28,700
[SPEAKER_41]: Oh my gosh.

1086
01:32:30,801 --> 01:32:31,841
[SPEAKER_38]: Dr. Cushing, are you trying?

1087
01:32:40,025 --> 01:32:40,645
[SPEAKER_27]: There you go.

1088
01:32:40,705 --> 01:32:41,386
[SPEAKER_27]: There we go.

1089
01:32:43,283 --> 01:32:57,052
[SPEAKER_27]: I just want to say, it's so sad that so many people are looking at this as an attack on Italian Americans, who certainly have just, you know, suffered discrimination and oppression.

1090
01:32:57,812 --> 01:33:01,114
[SPEAKER_27]: And even to this day, probably experienced some of that.

1091
01:33:02,095 --> 01:33:08,119
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not about hurting Italian Americans, you know, it's about moving forward.

1092
01:33:09,185 --> 01:33:15,388
[SPEAKER_27]: And I just want to laud all the people that spoke in favor of the name change.

1093
01:33:16,069 --> 01:33:20,851
[SPEAKER_27]: And I wanted to add a historical fact to what others have said.

1094
01:33:22,092 --> 01:33:28,035
[SPEAKER_27]: Even if we don't look at Columbus and say, oh, he did this and he did that.

1095
01:33:29,065 --> 01:33:43,536
[SPEAKER_27]: If we just look at the funding for the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria, where did the money come from that funded those three ships that set out on those voyages?

1096
01:33:44,457 --> 01:33:54,905
[SPEAKER_27]: It came from the confiscated estates of Jews and Muslims in Spain who were

1097
01:33:56,184 --> 01:34:07,669
[SPEAKER_27]: hunted by the Inquisition who either had to convert to Christianity or leave the country or be burned at the stake.

1098
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:12,551
[SPEAKER_27]: So we can see even the voyage of

1099
01:34:13,683 --> 01:34:19,027
[SPEAKER_27]: Columbus was tainted from the start with the spoils of oppression.

1100
01:34:19,688 --> 01:34:23,271
[SPEAKER_27]: And we see how all oppression is linked to each other.

1101
01:34:23,911 --> 01:34:34,900
[SPEAKER_27]: And there is white supremacy and Italians have been subjected to that white supremacy, just like black people, people of color, Jews, Muslims.

1102
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:43,187
[SPEAKER_27]: And I just want to say to the Italian community or some of the Italian community that doesn't understand or wanna

1103
01:34:44,451 --> 01:34:46,052
[SPEAKER_36]: want to progress.

1104
01:34:46,072 --> 01:34:46,573
[SPEAKER_36]: 15 seconds.

1105
01:34:47,133 --> 01:34:48,074
[SPEAKER_27]: Join with us.

1106
01:34:48,694 --> 01:34:52,837
[SPEAKER_27]: Join with the oppressed and fight against oppression for everybody.

1107
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:58,921
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Tony.

1108
01:35:02,264 --> 01:35:02,904
[SPEAKER_39]: Then we'll go to Robert.

1109
01:35:25,324 --> 01:35:25,985
[SPEAKER_39]: I apologize.

1110
01:35:27,245 --> 01:35:28,485
[SPEAKER_56]: You're on.

1111
01:35:28,786 --> 01:35:29,666
[SPEAKER_39]: You're on Tony.

1112
01:35:29,706 --> 01:35:29,966
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1113
01:35:30,486 --> 01:35:40,270
[SPEAKER_56]: So I just wanted to say, um, I was going to read something tonight, but just listening to the meeting and picking up all the different conversations just turned into my list has turned into a bunch of points.

1114
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:45,412
[SPEAKER_56]: And, um, sorry if it sounds that way, but I just want to start by saying I can solve this problem right now.

1115
01:35:46,215 --> 01:35:46,896
[SPEAKER_56]: This is what we do.

1116
01:35:47,436 --> 01:35:50,358
[SPEAKER_56]: Let's start by renaming every school in the district, okay?

1117
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:55,322
[SPEAKER_56]: School A, school B, school C, school D. Let's just have a stale district.

1118
01:35:55,822 --> 01:35:58,224
[SPEAKER_56]: No culture, no nothing for anyone, okay?

1119
01:35:58,244 --> 01:36:00,286
[SPEAKER_56]: That way they will just solve all the problems for everyone.

1120
01:36:00,306 --> 01:36:01,506
[SPEAKER_56]: We'll wipe this right off the board.

1121
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:04,048
[SPEAKER_56]: We can be the most boring city in the universe, okay?

1122
01:36:04,269 --> 01:36:11,534
[SPEAKER_56]: And we'll move along to the city streets and we'll move on to the buildings and all the corners that we name after all the people who have done so much for this city.

1123
01:36:11,774 --> 01:36:12,575
[SPEAKER_56]: Let's just go ahead and

1124
01:36:13,075 --> 01:36:14,556
[SPEAKER_56]: cancel it all right out, okay?

1125
01:36:14,576 --> 01:36:18,379
[SPEAKER_56]: And that way we can all live equally and no one will have any problems with anything.

1126
01:36:19,259 --> 01:36:37,571
[SPEAKER_56]: The next thing I wanted to say is the woman, I'm sorry, I don't know her name, who spoke for the Medford Mercury, it is up to the Medford Mercury and Patch the Patch to post those things, but it's also the responsibility of the city to make sure that those things reach those papers in time so people have the appropriate notification.

1127
01:36:38,452 --> 01:36:40,313
[SPEAKER_56]: 37 minutes is not acceptable.

1128
01:36:42,119 --> 01:36:47,221
[SPEAKER_56]: Does anyone considered it's more than just taking some chisels to a concrete building and changing a name.

1129
01:36:47,702 --> 01:36:55,585
[SPEAKER_56]: You have to think about all the paperwork that goes into it, changing the all the letterheads and the websites and whatnot.

1130
01:36:55,805 --> 01:37:00,307
[SPEAKER_56]: There's a lot more to this than just putting a sign up, you know, and tying it to the building.

1131
01:37:00,627 --> 01:37:02,008
[SPEAKER_56]: This is pretty elaborate.

1132
01:37:02,388 --> 01:37:05,470
[SPEAKER_56]: This is really something that needs to have more thought go into it.

1133
01:37:07,386 --> 01:37:10,128
[SPEAKER_56]: Paula, I'm sorry, Mia, thank you so much for finding that book.

1134
01:37:10,568 --> 01:37:11,929
[SPEAKER_56]: Some of us already have that book.

1135
01:37:12,009 --> 01:37:13,029
[SPEAKER_56]: We know that book.

1136
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:17,252
[SPEAKER_56]: And what that book really states is the city has already spoken.

1137
01:37:17,272 --> 01:37:18,673
[SPEAKER_56]: They've already voted on it.

1138
01:37:18,953 --> 01:37:21,074
[SPEAKER_36]: They chose that name, okay?

1139
01:37:21,314 --> 01:37:22,215
[SPEAKER_56]: They wanted that name.

1140
01:37:22,395 --> 01:37:25,217
[SPEAKER_56]: That's why it was selected 90 years ago.

1141
01:37:26,598 --> 01:37:35,463
[SPEAKER_56]: Just please consider all these things and consider how many people that this is affecting because it really does affect people and people are irate.

1142
01:37:35,483 --> 01:37:37,144
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you for letting me speak.

1143
01:37:39,602 --> 01:37:40,002
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

1144
01:37:43,844 --> 01:37:44,824
[SPEAKER_41]: Robert Galasso.

1145
01:37:45,305 --> 01:37:48,606
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, Paul, you mentioned he was waving.

1146
01:37:48,626 --> 01:38:02,572
[SPEAKER_41]: Let me just... Okay, I don't see that he's on actually anymore.

1147
01:38:03,573 --> 01:38:06,854
[SPEAKER_39]: So, Amy and Mariana.

1148
01:38:11,994 --> 01:38:12,414
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, everyone.

1149
01:38:13,315 --> 01:38:16,277
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to respond to a few things.

1150
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:34,208
[SPEAKER_31]: One thing is, you know, going back to what council committee member said, this name change way back when was the result of the community coming together and wanting a name that had some more social justice and progressive consideration in it today.

1151
01:38:34,589 --> 01:38:36,210
[SPEAKER_31]: And that's all people today are asking for.

1152
01:38:37,723 --> 01:38:40,504
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm sure at the time people were, there were plenty of people opposed.

1153
01:38:41,245 --> 01:38:44,206
[SPEAKER_31]: Plenty of people who had anti-Italian sentiments were opposed to the name change.

1154
01:38:44,666 --> 01:38:53,570
[SPEAKER_31]: They were wrong then, just the way I would say that people who are opposed to more inclusion and social justice today are wrong today.

1155
01:38:54,230 --> 01:38:56,011
[SPEAKER_31]: Segregation wasn't popular in its time.

1156
01:38:56,151 --> 01:38:57,291
[SPEAKER_31]: It divided communities.

1157
01:38:57,752 --> 01:39:01,233
[SPEAKER_31]: People who wanted their schools to stay white felt they weren't heard.

1158
01:39:01,833 --> 01:39:05,015
[SPEAKER_31]: And we look back now and they were totally wrong.

1159
01:39:07,006 --> 01:39:13,670
[SPEAKER_31]: I can think of a number of cultural figures from my cultural background that I wouldn't want to name a school after.

1160
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:15,271
[SPEAKER_31]: I have Romanian relatives.

1161
01:39:15,451 --> 01:39:19,313
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't want to send my kids to Kočescu High School or Middle School.

1162
01:39:19,773 --> 01:39:22,795
[SPEAKER_31]: Not everyone from your culture is worth elevating.

1163
01:39:22,995 --> 01:39:26,197
[SPEAKER_31]: And if we're going to elevate heroes, I want to pick them carefully.

1164
01:39:27,023 --> 01:39:31,566
[SPEAKER_31]: And my last point to this guy who said, let's name all the schools by numbers and have no culture.

1165
01:39:32,187 --> 01:39:35,789
[SPEAKER_31]: New York City has PS1 through, I don't know, 200.

1166
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:43,875
[SPEAKER_31]: And I would highly challenge anyone to say that New York City doesn't have any culture because of how they named their schools.

1167
01:39:44,616 --> 01:39:46,157
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyway, that's it.

1168
01:39:55,684 --> 01:39:55,944
[SPEAKER_39]: Dan?

1169
01:40:00,441 --> 01:40:00,921
[SPEAKER_65]: Can you hear me?

1170
01:40:01,562 --> 01:40:02,062
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, Dan.

1171
01:40:02,523 --> 01:40:02,683
[SPEAKER_65]: Yeah.

1172
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:16,435
[SPEAKER_65]: I just want to say, Mayor, this is not directed at you or member Kretz, but to the other members of the school committee, it's pretty obvious by the signs of the petitions where the citizens of the city stand.

1173
01:40:17,096 --> 01:40:18,277
[SPEAKER_65]: This is an election year.

1174
01:40:19,038 --> 01:40:20,019
[SPEAKER_65]: And let me make it clear.

1175
01:40:20,459 --> 01:40:24,803
[SPEAKER_65]: You have awoken a sleeping giant in this city and be prepared

1176
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,701
[SPEAKER_65]: to suffer the consequences at the next election.

1177
01:40:28,061 --> 01:40:29,262
[SPEAKER_65]: We will vote yous out.

1178
01:40:30,102 --> 01:40:30,702
[SPEAKER_65]: Everyone yous.

1179
01:40:31,123 --> 01:40:32,183
[SPEAKER_65]: So be prepared for that.

1180
01:40:32,363 --> 01:40:33,304
[SPEAKER_65]: That's all I have to say.

1181
01:40:43,869 --> 01:40:44,389
[SPEAKER_39]: Melissa?

1182
01:40:48,031 --> 01:40:49,171
[SPEAKER_52]: Hi, how are you?

1183
01:40:51,400 --> 01:41:00,185
[SPEAKER_52]: I joined the meeting late, so I apologize if things have been brought up that I didn't hear.

1184
01:41:03,427 --> 01:41:09,991
[SPEAKER_53]: I know that this has been passionate on both sides whether we are for the change of the school or not.

1185
01:41:11,338 --> 01:41:23,488
[SPEAKER_53]: My suggestion would be, because this is really taking a toll on the city, people are writing nasty comments back and forth to each other on Facebook and other things.

1186
01:41:23,508 --> 01:41:28,372
[SPEAKER_53]: I think it's doing a disservice to our community as a whole.

1187
01:41:29,473 --> 01:41:35,678
[SPEAKER_53]: Why can't the school committee take a step back and allow the community themselves to vote on it?

1188
01:41:36,018 --> 01:41:45,546
[SPEAKER_53]: Because I think if the community gets to vote, whichever way it goes, at least everybody will feel like they have input and they've actually been heard.

1189
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:49,088
[SPEAKER_53]: And I think it will be a little bit easier to digest

1190
01:41:50,501 --> 01:42:02,527
[SPEAKER_53]: if it was done properly by a vote for the people in the community, they have the opportunity to vote whether they're for or not for the change of the school in the city that they live in.

1191
01:42:03,187 --> 01:42:13,732
[SPEAKER_53]: And then at that point, if it is voted at the name of the school get changed, then we can move on and maybe think of a different name.

1192
01:42:14,133 --> 01:42:16,134
[SPEAKER_53]: But I think this is sort of being done

1193
01:42:16,974 --> 01:42:18,515
[SPEAKER_53]: in a not so great way.

1194
01:42:18,555 --> 01:42:28,322
[SPEAKER_53]: I think this is an opportunity to show the city that we care about what everybody has to say and not push it one way or the other.

1195
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:30,223
[SPEAKER_53]: So thank you.

1196
01:42:32,925 --> 01:42:34,065
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Melissa.

1197
01:42:39,209 --> 01:42:45,173
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Graham, I'm not sure if you want to screen share so we can ask

1198
01:42:48,775 --> 01:42:51,376
[SPEAKER_41]: over the amendments and changes.

1199
01:42:51,436 --> 01:43:07,623
[SPEAKER_41]: I think we're changing the date of the 12th to the 15th for when the application form for membership in the advisory committee will be prepared.

1200
01:43:07,643 --> 01:43:17,847
[SPEAKER_41]: We're moving the suggestion, E on Paul's at least, the suggestion new name for the school, including the following.

1201
01:43:18,257 --> 01:43:23,420
[SPEAKER_41]: while we move to the naming form proposals.

1202
01:43:25,601 --> 01:43:34,026
[SPEAKER_41]: We're gonna add the availability of those applying to be on the advisory committee to the form.

1203
01:43:34,046 --> 01:43:38,229
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, that's already there.

1204
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:47,474
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, and then we have questions about the demographics, including, and I know it's been discussed, so we're gonna take out

1205
01:43:47,932 --> 01:43:50,053
[SPEAKER_41]: Number three, sexual orientation.

1206
01:43:52,034 --> 01:44:00,357
[SPEAKER_62]: So can I just step back and tell you what we have accomplished so far before we go forward?

1207
01:44:00,377 --> 01:44:02,638
[SPEAKER_62]: I think you should screen share it so we could all just take it.

1208
01:44:02,658 --> 01:44:03,418
[SPEAKER_62]: I'm happy to do that.

1209
01:44:03,438 --> 01:44:04,258
[SPEAKER_62]: Thanks.

1210
01:44:04,458 --> 01:44:11,641
[SPEAKER_62]: I just want to point out this is a five-page resolution and we have addressed one paragraph of the five-page resolution.

1211
01:44:11,741 --> 01:44:16,963
[SPEAKER_62]: So cover page one, at least.

1212
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:18,720
[SPEAKER_62]: Nope, not even.

1213
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:23,744
[SPEAKER_62]: We're sort of in the middle.

1214
01:44:23,764 --> 01:44:28,688
[SPEAKER_62]: So this started from Paulette's and I will cobble them together as we talk.

1215
01:44:29,449 --> 01:44:34,813
[SPEAKER_62]: But what we have covered is the application committee, the advisory committee application.

1216
01:44:34,833 --> 01:44:41,539
[SPEAKER_62]: I added a bullet here that says the superintendent will create a form no later than Monday, March 15th.

1217
01:44:41,559 --> 01:44:44,862
[SPEAKER_62]: The form will be translated in a manner consistent with all district communications.

1218
01:44:46,223 --> 01:44:49,144
[SPEAKER_62]: The availability is listed already.

1219
01:44:49,164 --> 01:45:05,191
[SPEAKER_62]: I made this update to clarify when we ask, which was already on the form, if you're a member of the Columbus School community, if so, how and when, student, family, staff, and in what year.

1220
01:45:06,732 --> 01:45:14,137
[SPEAKER_62]: The demographics information, I added a clause that said will be collected but separated from the main body of the application.

1221
01:45:14,157 --> 01:45:23,764
[SPEAKER_62]: I am not in favor of removing sexual orientation because again, the goal of collecting these demographics is to understand who we are reaching and who we are not reaching.

1222
01:45:23,784 --> 01:45:32,350
[SPEAKER_62]: And that is a common best practice question that is put in surveys all the time now because

1223
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:40,393
[SPEAKER_62]: we want to know that we are reaching all members of our community and they are an important portion of the community.

1224
01:45:42,653 --> 01:45:44,174
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, thank you, Member Graham.

1225
01:45:44,574 --> 01:45:48,695
[SPEAKER_41]: So we'll just, if anybody has questions on this or any additional changes, we could comment.

1226
01:45:48,855 --> 01:45:50,616
[SPEAKER_41]: I see Member Rousseau's hand.

1227
01:45:50,816 --> 01:45:51,136
[SPEAKER_41]: Go ahead.

1228
01:45:52,076 --> 01:45:52,677
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor.

1229
01:45:52,997 --> 01:45:55,618
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to comment on the demographics.

1230
01:45:55,818 --> 01:45:56,458
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that it is

1231
01:45:58,191 --> 01:46:00,192
[SPEAKER_21]: sometimes a problem for some people.

1232
01:46:00,572 --> 01:46:15,901
[SPEAKER_21]: These lists of not only the options, but the actual categories within each of the options, but I may have these backwards, sorry, are from the federal government's list.

1233
01:46:17,102 --> 01:46:23,626
[SPEAKER_21]: This work to get this stuff together and what we are tracking as a district for participation in our surveys.

1234
01:46:24,195 --> 01:46:25,997
[SPEAKER_21]: was something we did for the superintendent search.

1235
01:46:26,077 --> 01:46:28,378
[SPEAKER_21]: So this isn't like I just made it up.

1236
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:34,884
[SPEAKER_21]: This is from the federal government and the best practice that I believe member Graham mentioned.

1237
01:46:34,964 --> 01:46:37,986
[SPEAKER_21]: So I too would be opposed to removing any of these.

1238
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:43,851
[SPEAKER_62]: They are all optional though.

1239
01:46:45,112 --> 01:46:47,774
[SPEAKER_62]: You're not obligated to answer any of the demographic questions.

1240
01:46:47,794 --> 01:46:48,995
[SPEAKER_41]: They're all optional.

1241
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:53,159
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, so if there's any other amendments, any members,

1242
01:46:54,005 --> 01:46:57,647
[SPEAKER_41]: would like to make to this section, please let us know now.

1243
01:46:58,768 --> 01:47:08,534
[SPEAKER_41]: Otherwise we can do an all-inclusive motion to amend this section so that it will, or we can do it at the end as well and move on, but.

1244
01:47:09,054 --> 01:47:10,715
[SPEAKER_46]: Can we just go back up a little bit?

1245
01:47:10,755 --> 01:47:12,916
[SPEAKER_46]: I can't see some of the screen.

1246
01:47:13,617 --> 01:47:16,799
[SPEAKER_41]: We can, maybe Memogram could increase the.

1247
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:20,921
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, if you could maybe just try to increase it up to 125 maybe.

1248
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:24,091
[SPEAKER_46]: Perfect, thank you.

1249
01:47:28,202 --> 01:47:30,186
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm just taking a few more moments to read it.

1250
01:47:30,327 --> 01:47:31,610
[SPEAKER_46]: Sorry, I'll be right there.

1251
01:47:32,031 --> 01:47:33,114
[SPEAKER_46]: Take your time, Member Kretz.

1252
01:48:41,125 --> 01:48:42,746
[SPEAKER_46]: I do have a question.

1253
01:48:44,907 --> 01:48:46,187
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor, I just have a question.

1254
01:48:46,688 --> 01:48:47,508
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, Member Kretz.

1255
01:48:47,928 --> 01:49:01,996
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, I know I'm looking at Paulette's, you know, her, her resolution, and she does have the application form and suggestion will be posted and communicated out to usual mechanisms.

1256
01:49:02,805 --> 01:49:04,006
[SPEAKER_46]: including translations.

1257
01:49:04,106 --> 01:49:04,827
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, that's number two.

1258
01:49:04,867 --> 01:49:06,428
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm sorry, I'm just reading the wrong paragraph.

1259
01:49:06,828 --> 01:49:19,317
[SPEAKER_46]: The application will clearly state that interpretation services will be available to any community member who so requests and technology, laptop, camera, microphone will also be provided.

1260
01:49:19,758 --> 01:49:20,838
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not seeing that.

1261
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:23,681
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, so there, okay, there it is.

1262
01:49:23,781 --> 01:49:23,981
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

1263
01:49:36,874 --> 01:49:45,955
[SPEAKER_41]: And if we can all read number four as well to make sure there's no questions on number four can just work our way down to application timeline next.

1264
01:50:14,522 --> 01:50:37,376
[SPEAKER_41]: If there's no further questions, we can go on to the name selection form details.

1265
01:50:53,547 --> 01:50:54,447
[SPEAKER_41]: And I'll read out loud.

1266
01:50:54,507 --> 01:50:55,988
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, I can read out loud as well.

1267
01:50:56,008 --> 01:51:00,428
[SPEAKER_41]: I read from Paul's for the first section.

1268
01:51:00,448 --> 01:51:02,149
[SPEAKER_41]: I'll read from Paul S for the second.

1269
01:51:02,289 --> 01:51:05,369
[SPEAKER_41]: It's submission of names for consideration.

1270
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:12,471
[SPEAKER_41]: The school committee will request the superintendent or her designee to develop a form to be used to submit names for consideration.

1271
01:51:13,231 --> 01:51:17,712
[SPEAKER_41]: The form will include the following name, full name, address, contact information.

1272
01:51:18,372 --> 01:51:21,913
[SPEAKER_41]: Are you a current or former member of the Columbus Elementary School community?

1273
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:24,160
[SPEAKER_41]: We will add, and if so, when.

1274
01:51:25,001 --> 01:51:29,464
[SPEAKER_41]: Name you are suggesting and a brief explanation of why you think the name should be considered.

1275
01:51:30,284 --> 01:51:37,209
[SPEAKER_41]: Relationship of the suggestion to Medford are related to the name you submitted, if so, how.

1276
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:41,932
[SPEAKER_41]: Any other information that you can provide to the advisory committee for their consideration.

1277
01:51:42,753 --> 01:51:45,955
[SPEAKER_41]: Individuals applying to be on the advisory committee may submit names.

1278
01:51:46,796 --> 01:51:50,398
[SPEAKER_41]: Each name submitted for consideration should be listed on separate forms.

1279
01:51:51,684 --> 01:51:54,746
[SPEAKER_41]: the name of Christopher Columbus will not be considered a valid submission.

1280
01:51:59,910 --> 01:52:00,170
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor?

1281
01:52:01,051 --> 01:52:02,111
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, Member Van de Kloot.

1282
01:52:02,512 --> 01:52:08,576
[SPEAKER_33]: Just so you know, on this, as this differs from Paul's in just two ways.

1283
01:52:09,477 --> 01:52:14,040
[SPEAKER_33]: I added the sentence about, are you related to the name you submitted?

1284
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:21,125
[SPEAKER_33]: And I also asked that each name be submitted on a different form.

1285
01:52:22,813 --> 01:52:25,735
[SPEAKER_33]: Otherwise, mine and Paul's are the same.

1286
01:52:27,016 --> 01:52:27,297
[SPEAKER_41]: The same.

1287
01:52:27,317 --> 01:52:36,444
[SPEAKER_41]: And then I just want to make sure there's a timeline so that people have more than enough time to do research and submit names.

1288
01:52:36,524 --> 01:52:39,106
[SPEAKER_41]: So do we want to put a timeline here?

1289
01:52:39,186 --> 01:52:43,510
[SPEAKER_62]: So Mayor, I put all the timelines in a separate section.

1290
01:52:44,091 --> 01:52:47,233
[SPEAKER_62]: So just because the timelines were sort of commingled.

1291
01:52:47,653 --> 01:52:47,834
[SPEAKER_62]: Yep.

1292
01:52:48,634 --> 01:52:49,015
[SPEAKER_62]: That's fine.

1293
01:52:49,295 --> 01:52:49,855
[SPEAKER_62]: That's OK.

1294
01:52:50,055 --> 01:52:50,756
[SPEAKER_62]: We'll do that separately.

1295
01:52:51,345 --> 01:52:53,206
[SPEAKER_21]: So if there's any other questions, Member Rousseau?

1296
01:52:54,406 --> 01:52:54,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor.

1297
01:52:56,307 --> 01:53:07,613
[SPEAKER_21]: I also have a number, I'm trying to figure out if it's actually a different place in Member Vander Kloots about paper versions of the application form being available.

1298
01:53:07,813 --> 01:53:09,033
[SPEAKER_21]: It's number six on mine.

1299
01:53:09,113 --> 01:53:11,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that anywhere in Member Vander Kloots, and if not?

1300
01:53:11,435 --> 01:53:12,935
[SPEAKER_33]: I forgot to add that, Paul.

1301
01:53:13,115 --> 01:53:13,716
[SPEAKER_33]: It should be added.

1302
01:53:15,056 --> 01:53:20,339
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I mean, I don't, I think it's for both the applications and for the,

1303
01:53:21,539 --> 01:53:30,664
[SPEAKER_21]: the names, so I don't care where it gets added, if it gets added twice or not, but it's just saying that there will be paper forms for those.

1304
01:53:31,104 --> 01:53:31,484
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1305
01:53:42,369 --> 01:53:44,150
[SPEAKER_41]: Any other questions or comments from the school committee?

1306
01:53:51,021 --> 01:53:53,103
[SPEAKER_41]: the submission of names for consideration.

1307
01:53:53,123 --> 01:53:54,344
[SPEAKER_41]: I will see if there's any.

1308
01:53:57,226 --> 01:53:57,667
[SPEAKER_41]: Nadine?

1309
01:53:58,568 --> 01:53:58,948
[SPEAKER_41]: Nadine?

1310
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:01,490
[SPEAKER_41]: Did you want to speak?

1311
01:54:03,312 --> 01:54:05,974
[SPEAKER_41]: Did you want to speak on submission of names for consideration?

1312
01:54:06,655 --> 01:54:09,097
[SPEAKER_60]: Well, I just had a quick question about the whole process.

1313
01:54:09,277 --> 01:54:13,861
[SPEAKER_60]: And forgive me if someone answered it already, because I may have missed it.

1314
01:54:14,682 --> 01:54:15,502
[SPEAKER_60]: So is there no

1315
01:54:16,889 --> 01:54:23,171
[SPEAKER_60]: possibility of this being tabled, this resolution, or it was speeding up the process?

1316
01:54:23,211 --> 01:54:25,292
[SPEAKER_60]: Am I understanding that correct, I guess?

1317
01:54:29,333 --> 01:54:32,474
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm trying to wonder why it's being sped up.

1318
01:54:34,155 --> 01:54:40,177
[SPEAKER_60]: This isn't gonna help figuring out how our kids are gonna get back to school or a healthy learning environment.

1319
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:41,577
[SPEAKER_60]: I guess I'm just lost.

1320
01:54:42,177 --> 01:54:44,678
[SPEAKER_60]: So Kathy had brought up

1321
01:54:45,256 --> 01:54:48,999
[SPEAKER_60]: changing the timeline, is that being considered?

1322
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:49,800
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm just curious.

1323
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:52,041
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, we didn't get to the timeline section yet.

1324
01:54:52,101 --> 01:55:00,428
[SPEAKER_41]: The only timeline we've got to was when the form would be complete, which will be, we changed that from this Friday to Monday.

1325
01:55:00,448 --> 01:55:07,413
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, but- Timeline hasn't been discussed yet, and there's no motion on the table to table the matter.

1326
01:55:07,433 --> 01:55:11,136
[SPEAKER_41]: No motion on the floor to table the matter right now.

1327
01:55:11,917 --> 01:55:12,838
[SPEAKER_60]: Can residents do that?

1328
01:55:13,958 --> 01:55:14,579
[SPEAKER_41]: No, I'm sorry.

1329
01:55:15,216 --> 01:55:15,396
[SPEAKER_60]: Thanks.

1330
01:55:15,456 --> 01:55:16,077
[SPEAKER_60]: I figured I'd ask.

1331
01:55:16,457 --> 01:55:16,837
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1332
01:55:17,757 --> 01:55:18,178
[SPEAKER_60]: That's all.

1333
01:55:18,618 --> 01:55:19,158
[SPEAKER_60]: You're welcome.

1334
01:55:20,939 --> 01:55:21,360
[SPEAKER_39]: Ann Marie?

1335
01:55:25,842 --> 01:55:26,222
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm here.

1336
01:55:26,242 --> 01:55:28,584
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm just getting it ready.

1337
01:55:32,286 --> 01:55:35,688
[SPEAKER_54]: I guess I'm the only one banging my head on a wall here.

1338
01:55:36,108 --> 01:55:39,170
[SPEAKER_54]: I asked a few questions before, and that was,

1339
01:55:40,211 --> 01:55:50,795
[SPEAKER_54]: The reason that the question on the application came up is because I know legally you can't do that on your sexual orientation on an employee application.

1340
01:55:50,895 --> 01:55:54,756
[SPEAKER_54]: So I was wondering and I was asking that question on a legal base.

1341
01:55:55,456 --> 01:56:00,778
[SPEAKER_54]: But as of right now, there's still no question, there's still no answers to did the city solicitor see it?

1342
01:56:01,358 --> 01:56:03,879
[SPEAKER_54]: Has the diversity director seen it?

1343
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:09,821
[SPEAKER_54]: You know, I understand that people are saying, you know, people knew about it, people didn't know about it.

1344
01:56:10,402 --> 01:56:14,603
[SPEAKER_54]: Again, we're talking the priority of the school committee.

1345
01:56:15,483 --> 01:56:16,944
[SPEAKER_54]: If there are people right now,

1346
01:56:17,916 --> 01:56:20,919
[SPEAKER_54]: on the committee that feel that the name should be changed.

1347
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:36,173
[SPEAKER_54]: I don't understand why it is such an urgency that if they have the name change done, whether you do it next month or in two months or in four months, it's going to be there.

1348
01:56:36,393 --> 01:56:37,434
[SPEAKER_54]: The change is going to come.

1349
01:56:37,975 --> 01:56:40,097
[SPEAKER_54]: So I don't understand why that's happening.

1350
01:56:40,497 --> 01:56:41,158
[SPEAKER_54]: Second of all,

1351
01:56:42,176 --> 01:56:47,822
[SPEAKER_54]: Again, I don't know if I'm gonna get any answers, but people keep on saying this isn't gonna be time consuming.

1352
01:56:48,603 --> 01:56:57,612
[SPEAKER_54]: You have just mentioned, Madam Mayor, that you're only on the first section of five, and we have been on for close to two hours.

1353
01:56:59,054 --> 01:57:03,378
[SPEAKER_54]: Being involved in the system, I know how much time it takes.

1354
01:57:04,244 --> 01:57:08,905
[SPEAKER_54]: But again, we still have no answers to how much is it gonna cost?

1355
01:57:09,645 --> 01:57:11,406
[SPEAKER_54]: How much time is gonna be put into it?

1356
01:57:11,806 --> 01:57:15,507
[SPEAKER_54]: Who are the ones that are gonna be selecting these applications?

1357
01:57:16,047 --> 01:57:21,568
[SPEAKER_54]: How are you going to put everyone on the same schedule?

1358
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:30,831
[SPEAKER_54]: More importantly, everyone now is going to be looking at their screen to observe what they're voting on within 10, 15 minutes.

1359
01:57:32,907 --> 01:57:38,029
[SPEAKER_54]: I don't know about anybody else, but I hope to God the budget doesn't you guys don't work on the budget like that.

1360
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:39,270
[SPEAKER_36]: I am Murray.

1361
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:40,090
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1362
01:57:40,230 --> 01:57:41,111
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm sorry, Lisa.

1363
01:57:42,071 --> 01:57:43,552
[SPEAKER_40]: Don't be sorry, Ingrid.

1364
01:57:50,984 --> 01:57:53,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I have a question.

1365
01:57:53,626 --> 01:58:02,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I missed if this was answered already, but I want to know who is eligible to apply for the committee.

1366
01:58:02,252 --> 01:58:04,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it all methamphetamines?

1367
01:58:04,133 --> 01:58:08,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we going to check that it's a methamphetamine or can it be anyone?

1368
01:58:08,637 --> 01:58:09,717
[SPEAKER_13]: And also,

1369
01:58:11,398 --> 01:58:28,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, the same with the application for the name change, are we going to ask for residents only or is other people that don't even know if we're going to be have a chance to, to apply and then the other question is what about Columbus kids, or, well, any kids but, um,

1370
01:58:30,256 --> 01:58:34,477
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the, are they gonna, will they be able to give ideas?

1371
01:58:35,257 --> 01:58:44,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the Columbus School gonna have like a different way to submit names, a different process that is gonna involve more their opinions?

1372
01:58:45,779 --> 01:58:46,780
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that will be important.

1373
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:47,720
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just, I don't know.

1374
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:49,700
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Ingrid.

1375
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:57,542
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, you do have to be a Metro resident is what we have on our sheet right now.

1376
01:58:58,641 --> 01:59:01,683
[SPEAKER_41]: So if this is approved, you'd have to be a Medford resident.

1377
01:59:01,783 --> 01:59:17,672
[SPEAKER_41]: And we are down the line going to discuss who will be eligible and definitely want to give some, there's section 10, at least in Paul's and I believe Paulette's has it as well.

1378
01:59:18,613 --> 01:59:26,217
[SPEAKER_41]: That's why we ask on the application, if you're a parent or teacher at the Columbus school, so we can discuss that as we go.

1379
01:59:32,458 --> 01:59:33,559
[SPEAKER_39]: Member van de Kloot.

1380
01:59:39,202 --> 01:59:43,564
[SPEAKER_33]: On mine, I have a separate paragraph devoted to the Columbus School.

1381
01:59:44,044 --> 01:59:50,088
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, the original intent was to have a very lengthy process with students being involved.

1382
01:59:50,908 --> 01:59:52,309
[SPEAKER_33]: The time frame makes it shorter.

1383
01:59:53,459 --> 02:00:02,103
[SPEAKER_33]: and certainly will not be as we intended when the original motion was drawn up.

1384
02:00:03,324 --> 02:00:06,265
[SPEAKER_33]: But there is a piece that's dedicated to it.

1385
02:00:09,127 --> 02:00:09,867
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, thank you.

1386
02:00:11,208 --> 02:00:16,650
[SPEAKER_62]: Mayor, I can share my screen for the... Thank you.

1387
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:17,651
[SPEAKER_62]: For this section.

1388
02:00:19,057 --> 02:00:24,701
[SPEAKER_62]: which is I've titled Application Timelines and Submission Guidelines for Advisory Committee and Name Suggestions.

1389
02:00:25,041 --> 02:00:37,051
[SPEAKER_62]: So the application form and suggestion form will be posted and communicated out through usual mechanisms the district uses, including translations to prominent languages on Monday, March 15th.

1390
02:00:37,091 --> 02:00:44,216
[SPEAKER_62]: And again, on Monday, March 22nd, the application and submission period will open Monday, March 15th and close on Friday, April 16th.

1391
02:00:46,698 --> 02:00:47,559
[SPEAKER_62]: at 5 p.m.

1392
02:00:47,839 --> 02:00:51,563
[SPEAKER_62]: A paper version of both applications will be created by the superintendent's office.

1393
02:00:51,763 --> 02:00:57,349
[SPEAKER_62]: Residents may request a paper version by contacting the superintendent's office at this phone number.

1394
02:00:58,410 --> 02:00:58,651
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor?

1395
02:00:59,552 --> 02:01:04,357
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, Jenny, Member Graham, it's not screen sharing, so maybe, sorry, thank you.

1396
02:01:05,258 --> 02:01:05,978
[SPEAKER_41]: Sorry, sorry.

1397
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:08,261
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Vanderlew, will we screen share?

1398
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:15,344
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, so I think that there was a difference in Paul and mine about the date that the applications were due.

1399
02:01:16,645 --> 02:01:19,667
[SPEAKER_33]: And part of it is that there's a vacation week built in there.

1400
02:01:20,908 --> 02:01:26,191
[SPEAKER_33]: So he had them due on the Friday of vacation week.

1401
02:01:27,452 --> 02:01:33,556
[SPEAKER_33]: So which, Paul, if I recall, originally it was April 26th, 24th, 23rd, right on yours?

1402
02:01:33,576 --> 02:01:33,916
[SPEAKER_33]: Is that correct?

1403
02:01:37,691 --> 02:01:38,392
[SPEAKER_33]: I pushed it.

1404
02:01:39,573 --> 02:01:40,594
[SPEAKER_21]: I have been the 23rd.

1405
02:01:40,634 --> 02:01:40,854
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1406
02:01:41,395 --> 02:01:41,615
[SPEAKER_33]: Right.

1407
02:01:41,715 --> 02:01:42,576
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's the Friday.

1408
02:01:42,616 --> 02:01:44,558
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's the Friday of vacation week.

1409
02:01:45,699 --> 02:01:51,785
[SPEAKER_33]: And that's usually the day when we're then getting our packets of information.

1410
02:01:51,905 --> 02:01:56,109
[SPEAKER_33]: So I gave more time, less time to apply.

1411
02:01:56,129 --> 02:01:57,991
[SPEAKER_33]: I have it done on Friday, April 16th.

1412
02:02:00,665 --> 02:02:04,266
[SPEAKER_33]: which does cut off time, but it's because of vacation week.

1413
02:02:04,606 --> 02:02:17,229
[SPEAKER_33]: I wanted to make sure that our office staff had enough time to collect all the applications, to collect the names, and to prepare them to give them to us as appropriate.

1414
02:02:17,309 --> 02:02:22,450
[SPEAKER_33]: So that was the reason why Paul and I had a different time.

1415
02:02:23,391 --> 02:02:24,731
[SPEAKER_33]: I just wanted to be clear on that.

1416
02:02:25,751 --> 02:02:28,812
[SPEAKER_41]: And what your date was, what member of it include?

1417
02:02:29,452 --> 02:02:30,192
[SPEAKER_33]: April 16th.

1418
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:33,292
[SPEAKER_33]: So in essence, people have four weeks to apply.

1419
02:02:33,312 --> 02:02:40,194
[SPEAKER_39]: To apply in name change.

1420
02:02:41,314 --> 02:02:41,494
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah.

1421
02:02:45,514 --> 02:02:47,775
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, it just had to do with the vacation week issue.

1422
02:02:49,135 --> 02:02:53,756
[SPEAKER_41]: And just if you're applying to be on this committee and you have to submit your application,

1423
02:02:55,814 --> 02:03:00,478
[SPEAKER_41]: by April 16th that you're interested in being on the committee.

1424
02:03:02,179 --> 02:03:07,204
[SPEAKER_41]: Couldn't we open it up to suggested names a little longer?

1425
02:03:08,785 --> 02:03:17,373
[SPEAKER_33]: You could, I just didn't know who was gonna be, since it's vacation week, who was gonna be in the office and they need to be collated and sent out to us.

1426
02:03:18,093 --> 02:03:21,836
[SPEAKER_33]: So you could, but just realize whatever office staff

1427
02:03:23,970 --> 02:03:26,051
[SPEAKER_33]: is in the superintendent's office or whatever.

1428
02:03:26,071 --> 02:03:30,011
[SPEAKER_41]: Well, name changes would be going to the committee, not necessarily to us.

1429
02:03:30,091 --> 02:03:35,473
[SPEAKER_41]: So people could have all of April vacation and then be able to submit a name after that.

1430
02:03:36,613 --> 02:03:37,253
[SPEAKER_33]: Wait, say that again.

1431
02:03:38,433 --> 02:03:38,693
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor?

1432
02:03:40,133 --> 02:03:45,595
[SPEAKER_41]: This is with regards to timeline for the advisory committee and the name suggestions.

1433
02:03:45,775 --> 02:03:50,816
[SPEAKER_41]: So my question is, advisory committee will have to submit by April 16th.

1434
02:03:53,177 --> 02:04:05,007
[SPEAKER_41]: And then the proposed name changes, I'm asking, should we give people a little bit more time, even if it's through April vacation, to have the ability to do some research and write up what name that they are suggesting?

1435
02:04:05,367 --> 02:04:08,030
[SPEAKER_41]: And the name suggestions would then go to the advisory committee.

1436
02:04:08,755 --> 02:04:24,711
[SPEAKER_33]: So Mayor, Paul and I, and this is one of those key talking points that I mentioned to you earlier, we have a big difference between us on the process of what happens to the name submissions.

1437
02:04:25,661 --> 02:04:35,283
[SPEAKER_33]: I have them all going, if we receive 50, I have all 50 going immediately to the advisory committee once it's formed.

1438
02:04:36,563 --> 02:04:40,664
[SPEAKER_33]: Paul has a process where we wheedle them down.

1439
02:04:41,744 --> 02:04:51,566
[SPEAKER_33]: What happens is we would, at our school committee meeting on April 26, which is what he designated, and Paul, if you wanna speak to this, because I'm speaking for you,

1440
02:04:52,126 --> 02:04:56,548
[SPEAKER_33]: But he had it that the school committee would wheedle down the number.

1441
02:04:58,129 --> 02:05:01,051
[SPEAKER_33]: So let's say we got 100, we would each pick four.

1442
02:05:01,511 --> 02:05:04,392
[SPEAKER_33]: And he has a fairly involved process where they're weighted.

1443
02:05:04,412 --> 02:05:06,593
[SPEAKER_33]: And I found that confusing.

1444
02:05:06,613 --> 02:05:12,036
[SPEAKER_33]: And I thought that the whole intent of the advisory committee was, in fact, to vet the names.

1445
02:05:12,556 --> 02:05:19,080
[SPEAKER_33]: I did not feel that I could receive the names on a Friday, April 23, and in our Monday meeting, April 26.

1446
02:05:20,376 --> 02:05:27,419
[SPEAKER_33]: be willing or able to then only send to the committee my top four choices.

1447
02:05:28,339 --> 02:05:32,321
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a very significant difference on how we approach this question.

1448
02:05:33,862 --> 02:05:34,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Russo.

1449
02:05:35,843 --> 02:05:36,423
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor.

1450
02:05:36,603 --> 02:05:45,207
[SPEAKER_21]: And I agree, Paula, that Member Van Der Kooten and I did approach this issue.

1451
02:05:45,407 --> 02:05:47,188
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me OK?

1452
02:05:47,228 --> 02:05:47,388
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1453
02:05:48,933 --> 02:05:50,414
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, okay, thank you.

1454
02:05:50,574 --> 02:05:51,855
[SPEAKER_21]: Approach this issue a little differently.

1455
02:05:51,915 --> 02:05:56,318
[SPEAKER_21]: I sort of see this as very, it's sort of like this three-pronged issue.

1456
02:05:56,338 --> 02:06:05,204
[SPEAKER_21]: If we just give all of the suggestions to the committee, I think 50 is, no offense to member Vanderbilt, but a bit naive.

1457
02:06:05,304 --> 02:06:11,788
[SPEAKER_21]: There will be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of submissions, if for no other reason to make it difficult to accomplish the work.

1458
02:06:12,248 --> 02:06:13,529
[SPEAKER_21]: That is what is going to happen.

1459
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:26,568
[SPEAKER_21]: If we get hundreds and hundreds of submissions and we give all of those to the advisory committee, we have now sort of baked in a requirement that they can't possibly get their work done in any reasonable timeframe.

1460
02:06:28,409 --> 02:06:33,092
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, this is completely indirectly related to how many people are on the advisory committee.

1461
02:06:33,653 --> 02:06:42,820
[SPEAKER_21]: If an advisory committee has 10 people and we give them four choices, we can all imagine they can do a good job of figuring out what their suggestion is.

1462
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:50,794
[SPEAKER_21]: if an advisory is 10 people and we give them 300 names, we need to give them two years to do the work.

1463
02:06:51,894 --> 02:07:09,382
[SPEAKER_21]: So I feel like these three pieces are directly related to each other, because if we do not in any way, shape or form, call the list in some fashion, whether we agree to do it sort of in some blanket way in this or

1464
02:07:12,085 --> 02:07:18,368
[SPEAKER_21]: or do it in the fashion that I had suggested in my resolution, which was again, just a first draft idea.

1465
02:07:19,108 --> 02:07:36,596
[SPEAKER_21]: But I do feel very much that we have an important decision to make, unless we wanna hear back from the advisory committee that they are only 30% of the way through the hundreds of submissions they got when they come to us and say, we just can't do it in this timeframe.

1466
02:07:36,776 --> 02:07:39,157
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can set ourselves up for failure on this,

1467
02:07:39,938 --> 02:07:41,839
[SPEAKER_21]: if we don't do this right, is my opinion.

1468
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:43,559
[SPEAKER_41]: Or mayor.

1469
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:46,340
[SPEAKER_41]: And member Kratz has her hand as well.

1470
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:48,041
[SPEAKER_41]: So member Van de Kloot, if you wanna just.

1471
02:07:48,501 --> 02:07:49,942
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, just to answer that.

1472
02:07:50,542 --> 02:08:02,266
[SPEAKER_33]: Or we can set ourselves up for failure by receiving, if you're a number, Paul, of 300 on Friday afternoon, and expecting me without, I don't have any time to vet them.

1473
02:08:03,087 --> 02:08:05,567
[SPEAKER_33]: And on so what basis am I going from 300 to four?

1474
02:08:07,148 --> 02:08:08,088
[SPEAKER_33]: It's just not real.

1475
02:08:08,128 --> 02:08:10,969
[SPEAKER_33]: The reason you have the advisory committee is to do the work.

1476
02:08:11,470 --> 02:08:33,878
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, part of it will be when they will go through and, you know, the first ones, they'll, you know, but that's not, if you're having us do that initial work selection without establishing what criteria we're using, it's a crapshoot.

1477
02:08:34,118 --> 02:08:36,159
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think that it undermines the whole process.

1478
02:08:38,249 --> 02:08:38,529
[SPEAKER_46]: respond.

1479
02:08:38,889 --> 02:08:39,650
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Kratz?

1480
02:08:40,670 --> 02:08:44,451
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, so I completely agree with Ms.

1481
02:08:44,491 --> 02:08:57,876
[SPEAKER_46]: Vander Kloot and I strongly believe that all the names must go to the advisory committee and that committee will thoroughly research those names.

1482
02:08:58,416 --> 02:09:04,058
[SPEAKER_46]: They're going to have to Google, maybe go to the library, break up into groups,

1483
02:09:05,399 --> 02:09:23,779
[SPEAKER_46]: That's what I believe the committee is being formed to do, to research all the names, to come up with the best name for our community, and it should be the community which is formed via the committee that's researching these names.

1484
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:31,202
[SPEAKER_46]: So I motioned to accept the resolution the way it was put forth by Ms.

1485
02:09:31,242 --> 02:09:36,884
[SPEAKER_46]: Van de Kloot, where the advisory committee will be formed and will receive all the names.

1486
02:09:36,944 --> 02:09:45,967
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, maybe we could get a copy of the names so that we can also just review them and be familiar with the names that were submitted as suggested names.

1487
02:09:46,307 --> 02:09:50,288
[SPEAKER_46]: But the process of researching and thoroughly

1488
02:09:51,969 --> 02:10:12,545
[SPEAKER_46]: you know, reflecting on these names and taking into consideration, you know, everything that's going on in our community, um, just from what we heard this evening, it's, it's very, very important that the community, which is comprised of the advisory committee is part of the process and doing the selection.

1489
02:10:13,345 --> 02:10:20,551
[SPEAKER_46]: You know, the entire, if we get 300 names, I believe, yes, they should get all of those names.

1490
02:10:23,561 --> 02:10:25,922
[SPEAKER_41]: I agree with that too, member Kretz, thank you.

1491
02:10:27,163 --> 02:10:31,585
[SPEAKER_41]: And this is a public committee, so all the records will be public.

1492
02:10:31,665 --> 02:10:34,786
[SPEAKER_41]: Everybody will be able to see all 300.

1493
02:10:35,147 --> 02:10:38,908
[SPEAKER_41]: And I think it's the job of the advisory committee.

1494
02:10:40,149 --> 02:10:41,650
[SPEAKER_41]: So that may be something we have to vote on.

1495
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:42,590
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Rousseau.

1496
02:10:47,572 --> 02:10:49,133
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, I'm happy to second that.

1497
02:10:49,894 --> 02:10:52,975
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think the next section ought to be interesting.

1498
02:10:53,393 --> 02:10:53,693
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1499
02:10:58,214 --> 02:10:59,494
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, so we are gonna change that.

1500
02:10:59,994 --> 02:11:02,815
[SPEAKER_41]: All name suggestions will go to the advisory committee.

1501
02:11:03,875 --> 02:11:07,656
[SPEAKER_33]: So can you use mine, my wording since I worked it out?

1502
02:11:08,836 --> 02:11:11,997
[SPEAKER_41]: We'll work that change in while we take a few more comments.

1503
02:11:12,177 --> 02:11:12,977
[SPEAKER_41]: We have Adam.

1504
02:11:13,837 --> 02:11:16,438
[SPEAKER_37]: Was that, I'm sorry, Mayor, was that a motion and a second?

1505
02:11:16,478 --> 02:11:18,138
[SPEAKER_37]: Because I'm trying to keep the tally.

1506
02:11:19,244 --> 02:11:20,304
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, I did motion.

1507
02:11:20,865 --> 02:11:21,845
[SPEAKER_46]: I didn't hear a second.

1508
02:11:22,725 --> 02:11:24,246
[SPEAKER_46]: That was a second by member.

1509
02:11:25,466 --> 02:11:26,107
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, thank you.

1510
02:11:26,147 --> 02:11:26,427
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1511
02:11:26,467 --> 02:11:27,147
[SPEAKER_46]: I didn't hear it either.

1512
02:11:27,567 --> 02:11:28,268
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, thank you.

1513
02:11:32,529 --> 02:11:34,790
[SPEAKER_41]: We don't necessarily have to take the role.

1514
02:11:34,950 --> 02:11:36,691
[SPEAKER_41]: Well, we can take the role if there's opposition.

1515
02:11:37,171 --> 02:11:40,572
[SPEAKER_41]: So if anybody has opposition, we can do a roll call now.

1516
02:11:40,692 --> 02:11:42,893
[SPEAKER_41]: Otherwise, we're kind of just working with a living document.

1517
02:11:43,854 --> 02:11:44,574
[SPEAKER_41]: You can call the roll.

1518
02:11:45,654 --> 02:11:47,095
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, before the rolls call, then let me

1519
02:11:49,057 --> 02:11:54,619
[SPEAKER_37]: Um, can I also have a wording of the motion just so I can record it in the tally sheet accurately?

1520
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:56,459
[SPEAKER_37]: Please.

1521
02:12:02,001 --> 02:12:03,381
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, I'm just hold on one minute.

1522
02:12:03,921 --> 02:12:12,283
[SPEAKER_41]: It would be it would be Paul Paulets that we accept Paulets wording on on this language.

1523
02:12:12,583 --> 02:12:14,744
[SPEAKER_41]: So why don't we write it in and then screen share it?

1524
02:12:15,182 --> 02:12:17,944
[SPEAKER_41]: and I'm gonna call on the residents that would like to speak on this issue.

1525
02:12:18,604 --> 02:12:19,184
[SPEAKER_41]: Mike Kugno.

1526
02:12:23,207 --> 02:12:25,388
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1527
02:12:26,189 --> 02:12:26,889
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry about that.

1528
02:12:27,509 --> 02:12:36,435
[SPEAKER_19]: We have, I don't understand the process that's going on here, but I believe this should be in a committee, subcommittee, not the committee of the whole.

1529
02:12:37,395 --> 02:12:43,939
[SPEAKER_19]: We're doing so many processes against Robert's Rules of Order that it's just absurd of what's going on.

1530
02:12:45,438 --> 02:12:48,440
[SPEAKER_19]: We're taking address, we're not taking address for people that are calling in.

1531
02:12:48,821 --> 02:12:50,282
[SPEAKER_19]: We're doing this on a zoom meeting.

1532
02:12:50,302 --> 02:12:52,524
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, people can't come in to talk.

1533
02:12:53,284 --> 02:12:55,546
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to know what is going on.

1534
02:12:55,626 --> 02:12:59,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Why are we not in, in chambers discussing this?

1535
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:13,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And prior to that, it should be in a subcommittee to discuss, get the processes down, bring it back to a committee of the whole, let them vote on what they can see, what they can review after weeks of looking at it or days of looking at it.

1536
02:13:13,823 --> 02:13:18,444
[SPEAKER_19]: as opposed to looking at it for 15, 20 minutes on a screen and deciding upon it.

1537
02:13:19,004 --> 02:13:19,864
[SPEAKER_19]: This is flawed.

1538
02:13:20,304 --> 02:13:31,267
[SPEAKER_19]: This should be tabled, put to a committee, subcommittee meeting, then brought back to a committee of the whole, voted upon, then brought to the full committee at some point in time later in the year.

1539
02:13:32,267 --> 02:13:33,867
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't understand what we're doing here.

1540
02:13:34,427 --> 02:13:40,069
[SPEAKER_19]: We're against every process that we've put forth in this city from time and material going forward.

1541
02:13:41,009 --> 02:13:42,229
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why you're allowing it.

1542
02:13:43,123 --> 02:13:46,105
[SPEAKER_19]: My address is 871 Felsway in Medford.

1543
02:13:46,305 --> 02:13:51,169
[SPEAKER_19]: And I haven't heard the last few people coming up since the beginning, giving their addresses at all.

1544
02:13:51,669 --> 02:13:56,633
[SPEAKER_19]: They could be calling it California, Florida or Cambridge or other cities around the city.

1545
02:13:57,013 --> 02:13:59,935
[SPEAKER_19]: We have not identified themselves or they haven't identified themselves.

1546
02:14:00,456 --> 02:14:02,497
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you answer any of those questions?

1547
02:14:02,877 --> 02:14:07,821
[SPEAKER_19]: And going back to what was asked before, if we don't know the cost, we don't know what's going on.

1548
02:14:08,376 --> 02:14:12,978
[SPEAKER_19]: How can we decide tonight on what we're going to do to go forward?

1549
02:14:13,858 --> 02:14:17,880
[SPEAKER_19]: These are all questions that need to be answered prior to taking- Mike, you have 15 seconds.

1550
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:21,421
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, we don't have the answers.

1551
02:14:21,801 --> 02:14:24,322
[SPEAKER_19]: I would suggest someone to step up and table this.

1552
02:14:24,602 --> 02:14:29,924
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have to step down and let your vice chair step up, you put the motion forward.

1553
02:14:30,284 --> 02:14:33,245
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll let someone else put the motion forward to do this correctly.

1554
02:14:33,765 --> 02:14:34,566
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Mike.

1555
02:14:38,995 --> 02:14:39,255
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1556
02:14:39,275 --> 02:14:41,536
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Mike.

1557
02:14:41,556 --> 02:14:45,316
[SPEAKER_41]: My privilege, Mayor Point of privilege member McLaughlin.

1558
02:14:46,056 --> 02:14:46,576
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Mayor.

1559
02:14:46,916 --> 02:14:56,738
[SPEAKER_37]: I just want to let the community know that part of the role of the advisory committee, I believe will be researching the cost or we could include it in the document, so I don't want people to think that.

1560
02:14:57,278 --> 02:15:00,839
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, we won't be aware of what the cost is as we're moving this forward.

1561
02:15:00,899 --> 02:15:02,359
[SPEAKER_37]: And again, I just want to

1562
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:10,902
[SPEAKER_37]: some time ago, and we have been working on this for approximately a year.

1563
02:15:11,703 --> 02:15:15,405
[SPEAKER_37]: So this is not the first time that we've been thinking about this document or looking at this document.

1564
02:15:16,066 --> 02:15:19,988
[SPEAKER_37]: And this is not the first time we've had this long school committee meeting.

1565
02:15:20,628 --> 02:15:29,454
[SPEAKER_37]: And it's not the first time we've heard from a number of people that are here, both publicly, privately, phone calls, emails, letters.

1566
02:15:30,414 --> 02:15:32,936
[SPEAKER_37]: So just so folks know, we have been listening.

1567
02:15:33,756 --> 02:15:40,780
[SPEAKER_37]: for quite some time, and we will be certain to know what the cost is and to make that public as part of our advisory committee.

1568
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:41,420
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1569
02:15:42,921 --> 02:15:43,981
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Member Russo.

1570
02:15:45,402 --> 02:15:51,745
[SPEAKER_41]: And then I see two people with their hands up, so I'm gonna take the three people with their hands up next.

1571
02:15:53,166 --> 02:15:53,906
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor.

1572
02:15:54,006 --> 02:15:58,669
[SPEAKER_21]: I just don't want to get into a back and forth, but

1573
02:15:59,858 --> 02:16:06,762
[SPEAKER_21]: The policy of the Medford School Committee for at least the last 30 years has mandated this process and it has not happened for 30 years.

1574
02:16:07,222 --> 02:16:10,503
[SPEAKER_21]: That is not a reflection of following our procedures.

1575
02:16:11,424 --> 02:16:19,288
[SPEAKER_21]: The fact that we have policies and procedures that are ignored by some folks is within their option.

1576
02:16:19,628 --> 02:16:27,312
[SPEAKER_21]: As a committee, we can sort of ignore our policies, but we also should follow them in my opinion, when they're literally in black and white.

1577
02:16:27,776 --> 02:16:29,357
[SPEAKER_21]: And this policy is in black and white.

1578
02:16:29,557 --> 02:16:38,324
[SPEAKER_21]: This lays out exactly that we as a committee design the advisory committee with graphic detail, frankly, what we should be doing.

1579
02:16:38,524 --> 02:16:43,487
[SPEAKER_21]: So I do recognize that we have not done this as a community perhaps for at least 30 years.

1580
02:16:44,248 --> 02:16:47,971
[SPEAKER_21]: And I look forward to this becoming a regular thing for advisory committees.

1581
02:16:48,011 --> 02:16:53,735
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to have a hunger, making Medford a hunger-free community advisory committee.

1582
02:16:53,775 --> 02:16:55,136
[SPEAKER_21]: We passed the motion to do that.

1583
02:16:55,196 --> 02:16:56,817
[SPEAKER_21]: So we will be going through all of this again.

1584
02:16:57,366 --> 02:17:03,230
[SPEAKER_21]: We also have another advisory committee for the vision committee for the high school.

1585
02:17:03,690 --> 02:17:14,497
[SPEAKER_21]: So those are both going to follow this same format as is the policy of the school committee as passed at least 25, 30 years ago.

1586
02:17:14,977 --> 02:17:18,099
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not making this process up and nobody else here is either.

1587
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:18,680
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1588
02:17:21,382 --> 02:17:23,523
[SPEAKER_41]: We have Sharon and then Lee.

1589
02:17:28,519 --> 02:17:30,340
[SPEAKER_41]: Sharon, you gotta wait till we unmute you, please.

1590
02:17:31,461 --> 02:17:33,081
[SPEAKER_41]: It doesn't do it.

1591
02:17:33,722 --> 02:17:35,663
[SPEAKER_41]: It takes some time for me for some reason.

1592
02:17:40,245 --> 02:17:41,166
[SPEAKER_39]: Oh, geez, where'd you go?

1593
02:17:45,208 --> 02:17:48,509
[SPEAKER_41]: Dr. Cushing, could you maybe try, I'm not able to unmute her.

1594
02:17:48,830 --> 02:17:49,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1595
02:17:49,530 --> 02:17:49,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1596
02:17:49,970 --> 02:17:53,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Sharon, as we click ask to unmute, a symbol should come, there you go.

1597
02:17:53,092 --> 02:17:54,953
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, is that better?

1598
02:17:55,996 --> 02:17:57,617
[SPEAKER_44]: Yeah, it was on my end too, sorry.

1599
02:17:58,017 --> 02:18:07,201
[SPEAKER_44]: I'll just take about a minute of your time because we hear about all kinds of odd things during these months in this country and around the world.

1600
02:18:07,221 --> 02:18:13,804
[SPEAKER_44]: I have one comment about the whole thing, about anyone who really started this movement on Columbus School.

1601
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:16,285
[SPEAKER_44]: It isn't just about being Italian and

1602
02:18:16,809 --> 02:18:18,791
[SPEAKER_44]: taking it away from the Italian community.

1603
02:18:20,232 --> 02:18:21,113
[SPEAKER_44]: It's like a witch hunt.

1604
02:18:22,234 --> 02:18:29,040
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm thinking with some of the Confederate plaques that were taken down, some of the review of different cities, what a name change, et cetera.

1605
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:33,403
[SPEAKER_44]: If somebody must've said, oh, we better start looking at Metro, what can we change here?

1606
02:18:33,984 --> 02:18:41,110
[SPEAKER_44]: You know, we do, as a couple of commentators said, have very important vigilant moves to make during this COVID.

1607
02:18:41,170 --> 02:18:43,432
[SPEAKER_44]: No one really wants to be in a big hot seat.

1608
02:18:44,195 --> 02:18:47,537
[SPEAKER_44]: However, it goes beyond just Italian in Columbus.

1609
02:18:47,997 --> 02:18:49,077
[SPEAKER_44]: Let's take an example.

1610
02:18:49,818 --> 02:18:54,120
[SPEAKER_44]: How many people have been to Rome, you know, to Italy and went to visit the Colosseum?

1611
02:18:55,221 --> 02:18:59,743
[SPEAKER_44]: Being a history humanities minor in college, and I also did teach in Memphis for a while,

1612
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:05,042
[SPEAKER_44]: I had tears in my eyes when I went there because of the architecture in the history.

1613
02:19:05,422 --> 02:19:08,603
[SPEAKER_44]: And I could just imagine the chairs and whatnot.

1614
02:19:08,863 --> 02:19:17,587
[SPEAKER_44]: I didn't leave there that day and go on to the huge triumph of Marcus Aurelius and say, we better get after these Romans.

1615
02:19:17,787 --> 02:19:21,628
[SPEAKER_44]: You know, pagans lived here one time and we need to tear the Colosseum down.

1616
02:19:22,088 --> 02:19:23,509
[SPEAKER_44]: Is that what you want to do next?

1617
02:19:24,153 --> 02:19:25,214
[SPEAKER_44]: Because what's next?

1618
02:19:25,654 --> 02:19:27,215
[SPEAKER_44]: You're just going to stop this now?

1619
02:19:27,495 --> 02:19:29,156
[SPEAKER_44]: Because buyer beware.

1620
02:19:29,696 --> 02:19:35,079
[SPEAKER_44]: There may be people who are so upset about this, not because it's Italian or anti-Italian or anything else.

1621
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:40,182
[SPEAKER_44]: You need to do better constructive, not destructive things with your elected time.

1622
02:19:40,482 --> 02:19:44,845
[SPEAKER_44]: And I know some of your intentions were on a side.

1623
02:19:44,965 --> 02:19:48,667
[SPEAKER_44]: I haven't seen all the history documents yet, so I can't give a full opinion of that.

1624
02:19:49,007 --> 02:19:50,448
[SPEAKER_44]: But you really need to look at that.

1625
02:19:50,768 --> 02:19:52,129
[SPEAKER_44]: And you have 15 seconds.

1626
02:19:53,039 --> 02:19:53,400
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1627
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:55,742
[SPEAKER_44]: So please, please examine this closely.

1628
02:19:55,883 --> 02:19:57,384
[SPEAKER_44]: I am not the change of that name.

1629
02:19:57,745 --> 02:20:05,253
[SPEAKER_44]: I think he was a famous navigator, we would not be having this conversation if it weren't for him going through uncharted waters.

1630
02:20:05,313 --> 02:20:06,755
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you very much and good evening.

1631
02:20:09,678 --> 02:20:10,059
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1632
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:13,403
[SPEAKER_41]: Deanna, and then we're going to go to Grace.

1633
02:20:20,970 --> 02:20:21,630
[SPEAKER_43]: Are we all set?

1634
02:20:22,150 --> 02:20:22,410
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes.

1635
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:27,111
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, I just have a comment and a question.

1636
02:20:27,811 --> 02:20:30,752
[SPEAKER_43]: Why are you trying to erase history?

1637
02:20:40,814 --> 02:20:42,514
[SPEAKER_39]: And maybe you wanna go into your comment.

1638
02:20:44,254 --> 02:20:46,075
[SPEAKER_43]: Well, technically that's my comment.

1639
02:20:46,315 --> 02:20:48,615
[SPEAKER_43]: Why are you trying to erase history?

1640
02:20:51,141 --> 02:20:54,182
[SPEAKER_43]: Why is the school committee trying to erase history?

1641
02:20:58,104 --> 02:21:03,407
[SPEAKER_41]: I think that's one of many, many arguments and there's arguments on both sides.

1642
02:21:03,427 --> 02:21:05,447
[SPEAKER_41]: So I'm not sure if anybody's gonna answer it specifically.

1643
02:21:05,467 --> 02:21:15,252
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh, that's a question to the school committee.

1644
02:21:19,014 --> 02:21:19,634
[SPEAKER_39]: Member Van de Kloot.

1645
02:21:20,339 --> 02:21:29,451
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, um, so in my mind we're not erasing history we're changing a name to what might be a more appropriate name in this day and age.

1646
02:21:30,772 --> 02:21:34,177
[SPEAKER_33]: Columbus will still be taught, like you said he was a famous navigator.

1647
02:21:35,282 --> 02:21:36,583
[SPEAKER_33]: There's much history there.

1648
02:21:37,384 --> 02:21:40,868
[SPEAKER_33]: It's to be appreciated in its totality.

1649
02:21:41,769 --> 02:21:45,874
[SPEAKER_33]: It is part of the Massachusetts strands of education.

1650
02:21:45,934 --> 02:21:51,280
[SPEAKER_33]: I think it's both fourth and then again in middle school where students discuss Columbus.

1651
02:21:51,921 --> 02:21:54,504
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's not in any way a shape to

1652
02:21:55,084 --> 02:21:58,747
[SPEAKER_33]: remove Columbus from the curriculum or not to teach it.

1653
02:21:59,207 --> 02:22:11,615
[SPEAKER_33]: It is a question of saying, what name do we want to put on this building that will embrace and bring our community together?

1654
02:22:12,336 --> 02:22:17,499
[SPEAKER_33]: Unfortunately, Columbus is very divisive, as you can see in this discussion.

1655
02:22:19,975 --> 02:22:21,895
[SPEAKER_43]: Well, I don't agree with it.

1656
02:22:22,296 --> 02:22:26,016
[SPEAKER_43]: Because if you're still going to teach about Columbus, you're going to teach about this.

1657
02:22:26,457 --> 02:22:31,098
[SPEAKER_43]: So why take a name off a building that's been there for umpteen years?

1658
02:22:35,099 --> 02:22:36,019
[SPEAKER_40]: Lee, I'm going to come to you.

1659
02:22:36,599 --> 02:22:37,059
[SPEAKER_40]: I forgot.

1660
02:22:37,379 --> 02:22:37,659
[SPEAKER_40]: Sorry.

1661
02:22:46,201 --> 02:22:47,021
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I on?

1662
02:22:47,822 --> 02:22:48,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Lee.

1663
02:22:49,082 --> 02:22:49,222
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1664
02:22:50,809 --> 02:22:53,710
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to say, thank you, Madam Mayor.

1665
02:22:54,590 --> 02:23:03,051
[SPEAKER_16]: And listening to, I've come in and I have to say my ignorance to a point of listening to all, to everybody.

1666
02:23:03,631 --> 02:23:17,274
[SPEAKER_16]: But I have to say for one thing, I am in shock and totally disappointed in the school committee when this woman asked a question in regards to

1667
02:23:18,716 --> 02:23:22,337
[SPEAKER_16]: the Christopher Columbus and that, and nobody wanted to step forward.

1668
02:23:23,038 --> 02:23:24,778
[SPEAKER_16]: But yet, why?

1669
02:23:24,798 --> 02:23:26,439
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't understand.

1670
02:23:26,679 --> 02:23:31,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Our city is full of history, good history, bad history.

1671
02:23:32,861 --> 02:23:41,844
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're starting with the Columbus School because somebody got that in their brain that that had to be changed.

1672
02:23:42,264 --> 02:23:46,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we could go through the whole city and change every street,

1673
02:23:47,799 --> 02:23:50,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go to the royal house and ban that from going in.

1674
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:52,080
[SPEAKER_16]: That's slavery.

1675
02:23:52,100 --> 02:24:00,841
[SPEAKER_16]: There's so much history, and the Christopher Columbus is history to the people who live and have grown up in Medford.

1676
02:24:01,201 --> 02:24:04,202
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not Italian, but this means a lot to me.

1677
02:24:04,222 --> 02:24:06,242
[SPEAKER_16]: This means a lot.

1678
02:24:06,302 --> 02:24:08,763
[SPEAKER_16]: This is how it has been.

1679
02:24:08,783 --> 02:24:16,304
[SPEAKER_16]: I would really like to know, and my main reason was asking, whose idea was this?

1680
02:24:17,324 --> 02:24:19,285
[SPEAKER_16]: to do this.

1681
02:24:19,945 --> 02:24:26,587
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, like many of our people, many people in the city have been blindsided with it.

1682
02:24:27,527 --> 02:24:27,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1683
02:24:27,748 --> 02:24:30,188
[SPEAKER_16]: McLaughlin said this has been going on a year.

1684
02:24:30,488 --> 02:24:33,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's fine, but it hasn't been going out to the public in a year.

1685
02:24:33,529 --> 02:24:36,791
[SPEAKER_16]: And what is the big rush?

1686
02:24:37,391 --> 02:24:41,032
[SPEAKER_16]: With Mike saying things need to be done correctly.

1687
02:24:41,052 --> 02:24:42,993
[SPEAKER_16]: You have 15 seconds.

1688
02:24:43,513 --> 02:24:43,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1689
02:24:45,488 --> 02:24:53,770
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all, those are my thoughts from just someone who lives in Medford her whole life.

1690
02:24:55,491 --> 02:24:56,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Lee.

1691
02:24:57,051 --> 02:24:58,071
[SPEAKER_41]: This was proposed.

1692
02:24:58,751 --> 02:25:02,552
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, this was proposed in June and was on a school committee meeting.

1693
02:25:04,833 --> 02:25:05,373
[SPEAKER_41]: By who?

1694
02:25:05,593 --> 02:25:06,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, why?

1695
02:25:06,853 --> 02:25:09,354
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a, I don't know.

1696
02:25:10,430 --> 02:25:12,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody wants to give like a straight answer.

1697
02:25:12,431 --> 02:25:20,375
[SPEAKER_16]: To be honest, Madam Mayor, nobody can say, like the person who brought this to and their reasoning why.

1698
02:25:20,395 --> 02:25:23,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything's, you know,

1699
02:25:24,625 --> 02:25:24,765
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

1700
02:25:24,785 --> 02:25:25,666
[SPEAKER_37]: Remember McLaughlin?

1701
02:25:25,686 --> 02:25:26,767
[SPEAKER_37]: Remember Ms.

1702
02:25:26,787 --> 02:25:27,107
[SPEAKER_37]: Stone?

1703
02:25:27,127 --> 02:25:27,928
[SPEAKER_37]: Sure.

1704
02:25:28,969 --> 02:25:31,751
[SPEAKER_37]: Mayor, I will share that myself.

1705
02:25:32,212 --> 02:25:39,719
[SPEAKER_37]: I was one of the people who signed the motion, the original motion, to move this forward for all of the reasons that have been discussed here tonight.

1706
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:46,064
[SPEAKER_37]: And I am sorry that the individual that is speaking feels like this hasn't been discussed.

1707
02:25:46,084 --> 02:25:46,905
[SPEAKER_37]: It has been discussed.

1708
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:48,541
[SPEAKER_37]: and shared and shared out.

1709
02:25:48,581 --> 02:25:49,922
[SPEAKER_37]: It's been on the television.

1710
02:25:50,042 --> 02:25:51,524
[SPEAKER_37]: It's been in the newspaper.

1711
02:25:51,664 --> 02:25:53,125
[SPEAKER_37]: It's been in social media.

1712
02:25:53,646 --> 02:25:55,868
[SPEAKER_37]: It has been, you know, any number of places.

1713
02:25:55,968 --> 02:26:02,153
[SPEAKER_37]: But I, with a few of our colleagues, put this motion forward almost a year ago.

1714
02:26:02,914 --> 02:26:03,314
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1715
02:26:07,138 --> 02:26:07,818
[SPEAKER_39]: Member Stone?

1716
02:26:10,601 --> 02:26:12,983
[SPEAKER_49]: Yes, I also signed on to the resolution with

1717
02:26:13,513 --> 02:26:15,854
[SPEAKER_49]: Member Russo and Member McLaughlin.

1718
02:26:17,054 --> 02:26:32,640
[SPEAKER_49]: And I want to say the reason why we proposed it is because as we've learned of Columbus's legacy in recent times with more research and history, we realized that is not someone that we would like to hold up in a standard for our children.

1719
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:36,061
[SPEAKER_49]: Most people know I have six children, four in Medford Public Schools.

1720
02:26:36,801 --> 02:26:44,904
[SPEAKER_49]: He is not someone that I want my children to think that's who we want to represent a school in the city of Medford.

1721
02:26:45,284 --> 02:26:48,166
[SPEAKER_49]: We've heard a lot of conversation on both sides tonight.

1722
02:26:49,366 --> 02:26:51,967
[SPEAKER_49]: I've had personal conversation with a number of people.

1723
02:26:51,987 --> 02:26:54,308
[SPEAKER_49]: I have thought about it thoroughly.

1724
02:26:54,328 --> 02:27:03,612
[SPEAKER_49]: And I know that there are many other opportunities to name a school and that we're not erasing history.

1725
02:27:05,094 --> 02:27:10,338
[SPEAKER_49]: It's that he is not someone that represents what I wanna teach my children.

1726
02:27:10,358 --> 02:27:21,926
[SPEAKER_49]: I agree that he was a navigator, but other than that, there's nothing that I wanna encourage my children to say, this is someone that we admire and someone that I want you to look up to.

1727
02:27:22,367 --> 02:27:29,212
[SPEAKER_49]: So I think that's how I agreed with my family discussing it that I signed on with Mr. Russo and Ms.

1728
02:27:29,232 --> 02:27:29,792
[SPEAKER_49]: McLaughlin.

1729
02:27:30,413 --> 02:27:30,833
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

1730
02:27:30,853 --> 02:27:32,494
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, member.

1731
02:27:32,514 --> 02:27:32,614
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

1732
02:27:32,634 --> 02:27:32,894
[SPEAKER_41]: Stone.

1733
02:27:38,086 --> 02:27:42,429
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, I just have a couple things to say.

1734
02:27:42,509 --> 02:27:50,214
[SPEAKER_30]: And I first want to say thank you all for doing this and moving with this name change.

1735
02:27:51,215 --> 02:27:57,780
[SPEAKER_30]: It goes on with the overall goal of our community to be more equitable.

1736
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:10,427
[SPEAKER_30]: and as someone whose father is from the Bahamas, where Columbus actually landed, and then he, because of him, decimated the entire Native population.

1737
02:28:10,447 --> 02:28:18,631
[SPEAKER_30]: I, you know, his history is important, but he didn't discover this land.

1738
02:28:18,651 --> 02:28:20,092
[SPEAKER_30]: There was already people here

1739
02:28:20,672 --> 02:28:23,755
[SPEAKER_30]: with rich culture and traditions and religion.

1740
02:28:23,995 --> 02:28:27,898
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's also important to note about that.

1741
02:28:28,158 --> 02:28:33,062
[SPEAKER_30]: And then I do have a question with the overall process that you guys are doing.

1742
02:28:33,803 --> 02:28:42,990
[SPEAKER_30]: Is there any plan or a plan in your current plans to run any of the new names by the school's racial equity task force?

1743
02:28:47,394 --> 02:28:48,015
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Grace.

1744
02:28:49,278 --> 02:28:53,641
[SPEAKER_41]: We're still going through the process, so we can take that into account, absolutely.

1745
02:28:56,343 --> 02:29:00,947
[SPEAKER_41]: Paul, I'm going to people that have not spoken yet at all, and then I will.

1746
02:29:04,389 --> 02:29:06,170
[SPEAKER_34]: Good evening, May, can you hear me?

1747
02:29:06,190 --> 02:29:06,471
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes, Paul.

1748
02:29:07,264 --> 02:29:09,465
[SPEAKER_34]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

1749
02:29:09,545 --> 02:29:11,505
[SPEAKER_34]: I just have a question and a comment.

1750
02:29:12,186 --> 02:29:26,570
[SPEAKER_34]: My question is, and you're probably gonna cover this, I'm sorry if I'm cutting you guys off, but the name change, is it gonna be reserved for somebody who was a resident of the city or had an impact directly on the city of Medford?

1751
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:28,851
[SPEAKER_34]: Is that one of the qualifications?

1752
02:29:29,291 --> 02:29:31,251
[SPEAKER_34]: And if so, I hope it is.

1753
02:29:31,631 --> 02:29:32,772
[SPEAKER_34]: And my comment would be,

1754
02:29:33,912 --> 02:29:41,137
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, I know this is going to, there's going to be a lot of discussion on this, but I think one of the names that should be considered would be Crystal Campbell.

1755
02:29:41,217 --> 02:29:42,578
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't know if she went to the Columbus.

1756
02:29:43,098 --> 02:29:48,962
[SPEAKER_34]: I tried to reach out to her cousin, find out before I got put on here, but I think that'd be a really nice gesture.

1757
02:29:48,982 --> 02:30:03,252
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that'd be, and I think someone like that who, you know, lived in the city, um, or went to the school or had a serious impact on the city should be someone that the school gets named after if that's the route that it seems like that's the route that it's going to go.

1758
02:30:03,272 --> 02:30:03,372
[SPEAKER_34]: So.

1759
02:30:04,072 --> 02:30:04,452
[SPEAKER_34]: That's all.

1760
02:30:05,613 --> 02:30:06,193
[SPEAKER_34]: Have a good evening.

1761
02:30:06,654 --> 02:30:07,294
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Paul.

1762
02:30:07,934 --> 02:30:09,455
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Van de Koot, I'm looking at yours.

1763
02:30:09,495 --> 02:30:20,142
[SPEAKER_41]: I thought yours had that it would be that this preference to naming it after somebody from Medford, but I'm just, can't locate that line.

1764
02:30:20,322 --> 02:30:22,023
[SPEAKER_33]: Member Russo had that.

1765
02:30:22,683 --> 02:30:31,308
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, there is language, Paul, and all that we're gonna debate on this being named after somebody from Medford.

1766
02:30:31,932 --> 02:30:34,394
[SPEAKER_41]: So we wouldn't get to that section yet, but we will.

1767
02:30:35,435 --> 02:30:35,915
[SPEAKER_41]: So thank you.

1768
02:30:40,018 --> 02:30:42,300
[SPEAKER_35]: Jennifer Kerwood, I don't believe you spoke yet.

1769
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:46,023
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi, thank you.

1770
02:30:46,143 --> 02:30:47,885
[SPEAKER_35]: Jennifer Kerwood, 43 Willis Ave.

1771
02:30:48,525 --> 02:30:59,314
[SPEAKER_35]: I apologize for not having my video on this evening, but considering some of the comments I've heard tonight, I think that perhaps the advisory committee should have alternates

1772
02:31:00,444 --> 02:31:07,788
[SPEAKER_35]: or just a larger number than 10, simply because there will likely be people who join in order just to simply disrupt the process.

1773
02:31:08,868 --> 02:31:22,656
[SPEAKER_35]: And if we could possibly put something in there so that once people are on the committee, there is a means of replacing them, should that be, I don't know, I just think it's likely.

1774
02:31:23,276 --> 02:31:25,817
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think it should be something that we consider that.

1775
02:31:29,261 --> 02:31:32,143
[SPEAKER_35]: perhaps even just more than 10 people, a larger number.

1776
02:31:32,183 --> 02:31:37,988
[SPEAKER_35]: So that way, if there is someone who is disruptive, it doesn't have as much of an impact with such a small number.

1777
02:31:38,748 --> 02:31:39,108
[SPEAKER_35]: That's all.

1778
02:31:39,469 --> 02:31:40,149
[SPEAKER_35]: And thank you guys.

1779
02:31:40,750 --> 02:31:41,450
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1780
02:31:42,131 --> 02:31:42,411
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1781
02:31:42,431 --> 02:31:46,134
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, one speaks about 21 people, one, I think 15.

1782
02:31:46,194 --> 02:31:47,495
[SPEAKER_41]: So we didn't get to that yet.

1783
02:31:48,115 --> 02:31:48,896
[SPEAKER_41]: Member McLaughlin?

1784
02:31:51,718 --> 02:31:52,719
[SPEAKER_41]: And we'll discuss alternates.

1785
02:31:53,239 --> 02:31:53,539
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1786
02:31:55,317 --> 02:31:56,257
[SPEAKER_37]: I'd like to make a motion.

1787
02:31:56,277 --> 02:31:58,918
[SPEAKER_37]: I wanna hear from everyone that wants to speak tonight.

1788
02:31:59,279 --> 02:32:04,260
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'd like to make a motion that we move public comment till after we go through the document.

1789
02:32:05,061 --> 02:32:09,682
[SPEAKER_37]: So that, cause a lot of the questions are really relevant to the document and we haven't gotten the opportunity to go through it.

1790
02:32:10,223 --> 02:32:18,266
[SPEAKER_37]: So if we could move public comment till the end of the document so that people can actually see the entirety of the document, I think that would be really helpful.

1791
02:32:18,306 --> 02:32:19,566
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm wondering if I might get a second.

1792
02:32:20,726 --> 02:32:22,087
[SPEAKER_40]: Member Van de Kloot.

1793
02:32:23,092 --> 02:32:35,419
[SPEAKER_33]: I, I think that's problematical Melanie, because so many people have already felt that they haven't had the opportunity to speak to now say that this may take us another three hours to work through the whole document.

1794
02:32:36,019 --> 02:32:38,861
[SPEAKER_33]: So I think the way the mayor's been feeding them in.

1795
02:32:39,741 --> 02:32:50,329
[SPEAKER_33]: As time-consuming as it is and how sometimes questions are being asked that we will answer, I think we just have to be short and say, we'll get to that.

1796
02:32:50,509 --> 02:32:59,915
[SPEAKER_33]: But I think you might make a tough situation even more difficult if you shut down any ability to talk while the meeting is proceeding.

1797
02:33:00,896 --> 02:33:03,718
[SPEAKER_37]: One clarification, I'm not interested in shutting down.

1798
02:33:03,738 --> 02:33:04,939
[SPEAKER_37]: I know you're not.

1799
02:33:08,592 --> 02:33:12,575
[SPEAKER_33]: how some people might perceive it, Melanie, and I know you're always open to hearing from her.

1800
02:33:14,396 --> 02:33:14,817
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1801
02:33:15,817 --> 02:33:16,378
[SPEAKER_62]: Member Graham.

1802
02:33:21,021 --> 02:33:34,950
[SPEAKER_62]: Can I make a suggestion that we complete a round of public comment, we then close public comment so that we can actually work through this document with the comments of the public in mind, and then

1803
02:33:36,177 --> 02:33:54,344
[SPEAKER_62]: we can open for a brief, maybe shorter timeline, public comment when the document is completed, so that we can hear from everybody, we can use that information to react and complete the work of this meeting, and then we can take public comment again.

1804
02:33:55,625 --> 02:34:03,928
[SPEAKER_62]: But this is disrupt, this back and forth, we're not making our way through this document in a productive way, so I'd like to see us try to

1805
02:34:05,359 --> 02:34:07,701
[SPEAKER_62]: be more productive as we get through this document.

1806
02:34:08,301 --> 02:34:09,782
[SPEAKER_62]: Is that an amendment to the motion?

1807
02:34:10,763 --> 02:34:11,703
[SPEAKER_62]: If you would like it to be.

1808
02:34:12,764 --> 02:34:13,444
[SPEAKER_62]: Yes, please.

1809
02:34:14,525 --> 02:34:15,265
[SPEAKER_62]: Then you have a second.

1810
02:34:16,927 --> 02:34:18,307
[SPEAKER_41]: Can you please explain that?

1811
02:34:18,367 --> 02:34:23,831
[SPEAKER_41]: I think the document needs to be screen shared so we can see where we're at and continue to plug through.

1812
02:34:23,931 --> 02:34:25,432
[SPEAKER_41]: I did mention

1813
02:34:26,192 --> 02:34:26,632
[SPEAKER_62]: Yeah.

1814
02:34:27,253 --> 02:34:32,717
[SPEAKER_62]: So the motion is to take a round of public comment starting now.

1815
02:34:33,438 --> 02:34:34,679
[SPEAKER_62]: Everybody gets three minutes.

1816
02:34:34,919 --> 02:34:35,199
[SPEAKER_62]: Two minutes.

1817
02:34:35,219 --> 02:34:39,323
[SPEAKER_62]: And then we close public comment and we work through the document.

1818
02:34:40,243 --> 02:34:50,072
[SPEAKER_62]: When we are done, we can take another round of public comment, but we will not take public comment during the working through of the language.

1819
02:34:50,872 --> 02:34:52,894
[SPEAKER_62]: We are not making forward progress.

1820
02:34:54,108 --> 02:34:58,789
[SPEAKER_41]: As long as we don't vote on the language in its entirety before the second round, I think that's fine.

1821
02:34:58,809 --> 02:34:59,929
[SPEAKER_41]: That's fine.

1822
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:09,411
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, motion on the floor by Member McLaughlin, amended by Member Graham, seconded by Member Graham.

1823
02:35:09,851 --> 02:35:10,371
[SPEAKER_41]: Roll call.

1824
02:35:12,172 --> 02:35:12,832
[SPEAKER_37]: Member Graham?

1825
02:35:13,272 --> 02:35:13,492
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1826
02:35:14,932 --> 02:35:15,612
[SPEAKER_37]: Member Kratz?

1827
02:35:16,612 --> 02:35:16,832
[SPEAKER_37]: No.

1828
02:35:18,253 --> 02:35:19,373
[SPEAKER_37]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1829
02:35:23,453 --> 02:35:24,234
[SPEAKER_37]: Member McStone?

1830
02:35:24,494 --> 02:35:24,734
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

1831
02:35:26,076 --> 02:35:26,737
[SPEAKER_37]: Member Rousseau?

1832
02:35:26,757 --> 02:35:26,857
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1833
02:35:29,179 --> 02:35:30,060
[SPEAKER_37]: Member Van de Kloet?

1834
02:35:30,381 --> 02:35:30,621
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

1835
02:35:32,062 --> 02:35:33,324
[SPEAKER_37]: Member Malango-Kern?

1836
02:35:36,227 --> 02:35:38,189
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1837
02:35:38,469 --> 02:35:40,592
[SPEAKER_41]: So right now public comment is open.

1838
02:35:40,652 --> 02:35:43,435
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm going to go through Mr. Carboni.

1839
02:35:48,817 --> 02:35:51,239
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, so just on the issue that's currently before us.

1840
02:35:51,640 --> 02:35:59,847
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, I agree with the council person can include and Councilperson credits in so far as, um,

1841
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:07,646
[SPEAKER_45]: The committee that is being formed should have access to all the names and have the ability to go through all the names.

1842
02:36:07,686 --> 02:36:11,410
[SPEAKER_45]: And the reason for that is I trust my neighbors to make the best decisions possible.

1843
02:36:11,710 --> 02:36:13,332
[SPEAKER_45]: That's the whole reason we're having public comment.

1844
02:36:13,352 --> 02:36:19,258
[SPEAKER_45]: That's the whole reason why we have these discussions, is because our neighbors are going to be the ones together that can make the best decision.

1845
02:36:19,758 --> 02:36:22,181
[SPEAKER_45]: I believe whether they submit four names or 4,000 names,

1846
02:36:23,582 --> 02:36:37,766
[SPEAKER_45]: The people we put on that committee will be in the best position to actually do what's to choose the best name, not as sort of a rubber stamp to the acceptable ones that our betters give to us, but instead that the people on the committee would make the decision.

1847
02:36:38,206 --> 02:36:40,466
[SPEAKER_45]: I support expanding the committee to be slightly larger.

1848
02:36:40,486 --> 02:36:44,667
[SPEAKER_45]: I think it's a bad idea to cut a couple of comments that they have.

1849
02:36:46,088 --> 02:36:46,228
[SPEAKER_45]: And

1850
02:36:47,688 --> 02:36:57,731
[SPEAKER_45]: Otherwise, I support the continued work of everyone here to try to get through this project, warts and all, no matter how difficult it might be on any of us.

1851
02:36:57,771 --> 02:36:58,431
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you very much.

1852
02:36:59,311 --> 02:36:59,652
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1853
02:36:59,672 --> 02:37:03,893
[SPEAKER_39]: Annemarie.

1854
02:37:07,874 --> 02:37:10,035
[SPEAKER_54]: OK, so if I'm understanding this the correct way,

1855
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:16,543
[SPEAKER_54]: If I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to take a round of questions now.

1856
02:37:16,563 --> 02:37:19,325
[SPEAKER_54]: You're going to go and work on the document.

1857
02:37:19,605 --> 02:37:27,372
[SPEAKER_54]: And then once it's done and you're all finished, you're going to come back to take more questions from the community.

1858
02:37:28,132 --> 02:37:30,054
[SPEAKER_54]: So we're after 8 o'clock now.

1859
02:37:30,715 --> 02:37:33,437
[SPEAKER_54]: So we're going to expect you to come back at 10, 11 o'clock.

1860
02:37:34,938 --> 02:37:35,479
[SPEAKER_54]: That's one.

1861
02:37:36,339 --> 02:37:40,844
[SPEAKER_54]: Second of all is the fact that, you know, everybody keeps on saying everybody's been hurt.

1862
02:37:41,244 --> 02:37:53,335
[SPEAKER_54]: I think everybody forgets the fact that if everybody had been heard in June, you would have had your 600 signatures against the, I don't want to say against, but

1863
02:37:54,375 --> 02:37:56,036
[SPEAKER_54]: versus the 300 signatures.

1864
02:37:56,596 --> 02:38:01,678
[SPEAKER_54]: So I guess my question again, isn't this a mute conversation?

1865
02:38:02,199 --> 02:38:04,940
[SPEAKER_54]: Because everybody keeps on saying that everybody's been hurt.

1866
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:13,144
[SPEAKER_54]: And these questions and concerns from the community started when we finally did hear about what was going on.

1867
02:38:14,521 --> 02:38:18,705
[SPEAKER_54]: And again, it's just frustrating because I've asked questions.

1868
02:38:18,745 --> 02:38:20,887
[SPEAKER_54]: There have been other people tonight that have asked questions.

1869
02:38:21,467 --> 02:38:28,113
[SPEAKER_54]: And out of respect, it would be nice if we got some type of answer because you still don't know.

1870
02:38:28,133 --> 02:38:31,376
[SPEAKER_54]: You don't know any of this.

1871
02:38:31,476 --> 02:38:34,919
[SPEAKER_54]: And as far as the comment on process and policy,

1872
02:38:35,914 --> 02:38:47,328
[SPEAKER_54]: As a former school committee member, we had many processes and policies, we just didn't throw this up and say in one night, we're going to do this, whether people you know agree or disagree with me.

1873
02:38:47,828 --> 02:38:54,236
[SPEAKER_54]: I just think that the process, again, you're going to have people against him for this, but this is a community.

1874
02:38:55,325 --> 02:39:00,770
[SPEAKER_54]: community has been speaking, and it seems like tonight that people are asking questions.

1875
02:39:00,790 --> 02:39:07,155
[SPEAKER_54]: There still has not been one person who has stood up and answered any of them or addressed any of them.

1876
02:39:07,896 --> 02:39:13,841
[SPEAKER_54]: But on June 30th, or whatever the day was, those answers to those questions were all answered.

1877
02:39:16,803 --> 02:39:20,807
[SPEAKER_54]: As a school committee, you're supposed to be representing the community.

1878
02:39:21,527 --> 02:39:22,588
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you, Anne-Marie.

1879
02:39:23,189 --> 02:39:23,529
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

1880
02:39:26,213 --> 02:39:27,114
[SPEAKER_41]: I can just comment to that.

1881
02:39:27,194 --> 02:39:33,177
[SPEAKER_41]: Most of the questions that are coming in relate to answers that we haven't even got to yet.

1882
02:39:33,377 --> 02:39:42,703
[SPEAKER_41]: The amount of people on the committee, how we're gonna submit the applications, who's gonna look at them, are we gonna look at them and then give five to the committee.

1883
02:39:43,263 --> 02:39:47,566
[SPEAKER_41]: We just wanna get through that a little bit so that we can answer those questions.

1884
02:39:47,766 --> 02:39:50,307
[SPEAKER_41]: We don't know how much exactly this is gonna cost.

1885
02:39:50,447 --> 02:39:54,570
[SPEAKER_41]: I believe the main amount is gonna be for signage.

1886
02:39:56,066 --> 02:40:07,896
[SPEAKER_41]: We are trying to answer the questions as best we can and just get through the documents so people know what they wanna comment on after, whether they're for or against something and we can make those changes as needed.

1887
02:40:09,838 --> 02:40:11,599
[SPEAKER_41]: Amy and Mary.

1888
02:40:11,619 --> 02:40:19,266
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, Amy Esperanto, 47 Westville Road.

1889
02:40:19,526 --> 02:40:21,808
[SPEAKER_31]: Sorry, I didn't say my address last time.

1890
02:40:25,588 --> 02:40:30,873
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to respond to the person who said that changing, taking the Columbus name off the school is erasing history.

1891
02:40:32,105 --> 02:40:35,086
[SPEAKER_31]: Once upon a time, as a culture, our history was painted on cave walls.

1892
02:40:35,586 --> 02:40:37,786
[SPEAKER_31]: And if it wasn't on a cave wall, it wasn't history.

1893
02:40:38,466 --> 02:40:43,147
[SPEAKER_31]: And then we developed oral history and writing and other means of preserving our culture and history.

1894
02:40:43,607 --> 02:40:48,408
[SPEAKER_31]: History isn't entirely based on what things are named or what things are called.

1895
02:40:49,329 --> 02:40:55,050
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm sure most of us learned about World War II somewhere in our middle school, high school, college experience.

1896
02:40:56,250 --> 02:41:00,671
[SPEAKER_31]: But there's no Mussolini Elementary School in Italy, and there's no Hitler Elementary School in Germany.

1897
02:41:01,371 --> 02:41:03,492
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's not because people there want to forget history.

1898
02:41:03,912 --> 02:41:12,236
[SPEAKER_31]: It's because they make careful decisions about who they elevate and who they honor with having a school named after you as an honor and a privilege.

1899
02:41:12,977 --> 02:41:14,858
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not bland history.

1900
02:41:14,878 --> 02:41:17,219
[SPEAKER_31]: If it were just history, we could call it anything.

1901
02:41:17,239 --> 02:41:21,421
[SPEAKER_31]: We could call it the War of 1812 Elementary School, if that's what it was about.

1902
02:41:23,682 --> 02:41:27,484
[SPEAKER_31]: But naming things is about imbuing them with a significance and an honor and a privilege.

1903
02:41:28,265 --> 02:41:31,046
[SPEAKER_31]: And if you're really invested

1904
02:41:31,576 --> 02:41:44,490
[SPEAKER_31]: and honoring and elevating a murderer, rapist, thief, genocide, genocide, someone who committed genocide, I really want you to think about what that means.

1905
02:41:44,510 --> 02:41:45,251
[SPEAKER_31]: What is your culture?

1906
02:41:45,451 --> 02:41:47,433
[SPEAKER_31]: If that's your culture, what's your culture?

1907
02:41:47,894 --> 02:41:50,176
[SPEAKER_31]: Because the Italians I know, that's not their culture.

1908
02:41:50,937 --> 02:41:51,918
[SPEAKER_31]: The Italians I know, they,

1909
02:41:53,001 --> 02:42:06,304
[SPEAKER_31]: They honor, you know, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Enrico Fermi, Galileo, all sorts of people who made notable and valuable contributions to the evolution of humanity as a species, who brought us up and not down.

1910
02:42:07,124 --> 02:42:12,785
[SPEAKER_31]: And I would really encourage people to think about, like, if you want to honor our culture- Sorry, you have 15 seconds.

1911
02:42:13,986 --> 02:42:15,146
[SPEAKER_31]: What about it do you want to honor?

1912
02:42:15,686 --> 02:42:16,006
[SPEAKER_31]: That's it.

1913
02:42:20,067 --> 02:42:20,827
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you, Nadine.

1914
02:42:24,500 --> 02:42:25,121
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you again.

1915
02:42:25,141 --> 02:42:27,823
[SPEAKER_60]: I just, I want to reiterate what Deanne had said.

1916
02:42:27,963 --> 02:42:29,664
[SPEAKER_60]: I was actually going to ask the same question.

1917
02:42:30,145 --> 02:42:34,788
[SPEAKER_60]: Why is it okay to still teach about Columbus, but we can't have the name on the school?

1918
02:42:36,530 --> 02:42:40,153
[SPEAKER_60]: I guess none of that makes any sense to me whatsoever.

1919
02:42:40,733 --> 02:42:44,956
[SPEAKER_60]: I think that there's a crowd of people that were pretty, pretty proud to be at that school.

1920
02:42:45,337 --> 02:42:47,999
[SPEAKER_60]: I did mention earlier that I, all my ethnicity.

1921
02:42:48,059 --> 02:42:49,260
[SPEAKER_60]: So I'm a proud Italian.

1922
02:42:50,071 --> 02:42:57,016
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't spend so much time worrying about Columbus, neither did my children, the name, because they were doing other things, more important things.

1923
02:42:57,437 --> 02:43:00,319
[SPEAKER_60]: Not looking at the name and saying, my gosh, why do you send us here, mom?

1924
02:43:00,619 --> 02:43:02,100
[SPEAKER_60]: This is atrocious.

1925
02:43:02,641 --> 02:43:03,801
[SPEAKER_60]: That's not how we roll.

1926
02:43:04,282 --> 02:43:07,724
[SPEAKER_60]: So I guess I can't understand why it's such a big to-do.

1927
02:43:08,265 --> 02:43:12,928
[SPEAKER_60]: But again, if it's OK to teach Columbus history, then it's OK to keep the name on the school.

1928
02:43:13,329 --> 02:43:18,813
[SPEAKER_60]: And this meeting shouldn't be happening, because it's a clear, clear agenda.

1929
02:43:19,841 --> 02:43:25,465
[SPEAKER_60]: you know, from a few people and there's people for that change, but many more against.

1930
02:43:26,126 --> 02:43:28,347
[SPEAKER_60]: And our voices deserve to be heard.

1931
02:43:28,387 --> 02:43:32,931
[SPEAKER_60]: And we're going to keep speaking no matter how long this takes tonight, because it's all right.

1932
02:43:33,991 --> 02:43:36,413
[SPEAKER_60]: So I just, I don't understand that that makes no sense.

1933
02:43:36,433 --> 02:43:41,477
[SPEAKER_60]: If someone wants to tell me how we can still teach it, but take it off the name of the school, then something's wrong.

1934
02:43:41,497 --> 02:43:43,378
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't know if anybody has an answer.

1935
02:43:43,838 --> 02:43:44,419
[SPEAKER_60]: Member Russo.

1936
02:43:46,087 --> 02:43:49,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I think at this point, I guess it's time for me to answer some of these questions.

1937
02:43:50,291 --> 02:43:51,452
[SPEAKER_21]: We teach about the Holocaust.

1938
02:43:51,472 --> 02:43:52,773
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't name shit after it.

1939
02:43:52,853 --> 02:43:53,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Excuse my language.

1940
02:43:54,495 --> 02:43:55,656
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know what?

1941
02:43:55,756 --> 02:44:01,081
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really hard to come up with a curriculum for third grade girls to explain how they were sold into sex slavery.

1942
02:44:01,141 --> 02:44:02,503
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not a real curriculum.

1943
02:44:02,603 --> 02:44:06,246
[SPEAKER_21]: I would send my kids to Columbus Elementary School if that was what we were teaching them.

1944
02:44:06,626 --> 02:44:09,910
[SPEAKER_21]: And that is what we would have to teach them if we taught them the truth.

1945
02:44:10,390 --> 02:44:11,331
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not teaching them

1946
02:44:12,004 --> 02:44:17,245
[SPEAKER_21]: because there is no valid way to teach little kids the kind of truth that is involved.

1947
02:44:17,605 --> 02:44:24,867
[SPEAKER_21]: When we teach kids about the Holocaust in our education system, I don't think we actually teach our first graders about the ovens.

1948
02:44:25,167 --> 02:44:29,288
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm hoping that that's not what's happening in our first grade classrooms, but we do teach it.

1949
02:44:29,788 --> 02:44:31,829
[SPEAKER_21]: And we also don't name anything after those people.

1950
02:44:32,229 --> 02:44:33,309
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so that's that.

1951
02:44:33,689 --> 02:44:40,731
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, you know, I keep being accused of being the person that led all of these women on the committee to slaughter.

1952
02:44:41,812 --> 02:44:45,615
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so obviously sexism, it's beyond comprehension.

1953
02:44:46,116 --> 02:44:50,159
[SPEAKER_21]: Each one of these people voted their own way.

1954
02:44:50,579 --> 02:44:57,085
[SPEAKER_21]: They have the exact same capacity to decide and vote, just like I do.

1955
02:44:57,525 --> 02:45:06,353
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I appreciate that I've led them all to slaughter, but it's just an obscene level of sexism that is so disgusting, frankly.

1956
02:45:06,773 --> 02:45:07,634
[SPEAKER_21]: It is disgusting.

1957
02:45:08,655 --> 02:45:10,236
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Graham, Member Van Der Kloet,

1958
02:45:11,741 --> 02:45:19,648
[SPEAKER_21]: Every single one of these members made a decision to vote the way they did based on what they had heard from the community and what they had read and thought.

1959
02:45:20,269 --> 02:45:20,890
[SPEAKER_21]: So Ms.

1960
02:45:20,930 --> 02:45:24,093
[SPEAKER_21]: Coppola is shaking her head crazy like, yeah, no, they didn't.

1961
02:45:24,293 --> 02:45:24,633
[SPEAKER_21]: You're right.

1962
02:45:24,733 --> 02:45:28,076
[SPEAKER_21]: I have some blackmail on each one of them and that's why they voted.

1963
02:45:28,256 --> 02:45:34,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Or better yet, they don't have minds of their own because this is the 14th century and these are women who do whatever I tell them.

1964
02:45:35,083 --> 02:45:35,423
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

1965
02:45:35,843 --> 02:45:37,565
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't tell any of them how to vote.

1966
02:45:38,021 --> 02:45:43,224
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would not tell them how to vote because I respect them as independent people that can decide this themselves.

1967
02:45:43,824 --> 02:45:47,306
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was one of three people that put this forward.

1968
02:45:47,666 --> 02:45:52,949
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm more than happy to keep taking all the crap for it because why share it, frankly.

1969
02:45:53,990 --> 02:45:58,472
[SPEAKER_21]: But the fact is that they decided this, a majority.

1970
02:45:58,672 --> 02:46:01,294
[SPEAKER_21]: I am one member with zero authority by law.

1971
02:46:02,154 --> 02:46:07,477
[SPEAKER_21]: Not one person here, not even the mayor in her role as chair has any authority

1972
02:46:08,328 --> 02:46:08,749
[SPEAKER_21]: None.

1973
02:46:09,950 --> 02:46:12,612
[SPEAKER_21]: We only have authority when four of us vote for something.

1974
02:46:13,072 --> 02:46:13,653
[SPEAKER_21]: So I get it.

1975
02:46:13,713 --> 02:46:17,336
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't know the law about school committee and what our authority is and isn't.

1976
02:46:17,776 --> 02:46:25,062
[SPEAKER_21]: And I understand that it's ridiculously complicated, but you know, some of this stuff is just so ridiculous.

1977
02:46:25,403 --> 02:46:28,805
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just feel like at this point you've worn me down.

1978
02:46:28,886 --> 02:46:30,627
[SPEAKER_21]: So now I'm going to answer your questions.

1979
02:46:30,647 --> 02:46:30,907
[SPEAKER_21]: Ready?

1980
02:46:31,348 --> 02:46:32,909
[SPEAKER_21]: I look forward to your Facebook posts.

1981
02:46:41,618 --> 02:46:41,998
[SPEAKER_40]: Tony.

1982
02:46:43,198 --> 02:46:46,579
[SPEAKER_40]: Mayor point of privilege when a privilege member McLaughlin.

1983
02:46:47,299 --> 02:46:48,119
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, thank you.

1984
02:46:48,899 --> 02:46:53,060
[SPEAKER_37]: Um, I just have to say that I'm sure that everyone is, um.

1985
02:46:53,900 --> 02:47:06,362
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, feeling really riled up now and a lot of energy around this and I am, you know, I personally want to apologize to our bipoc community that has been on this call for all of this time.

1986
02:47:06,402 --> 02:47:09,943
[SPEAKER_37]: I think that this is really, um, hurtful and, um.

1987
02:47:10,863 --> 02:47:13,604
[SPEAKER_37]: and embarrassing, frankly.

1988
02:47:13,904 --> 02:47:19,266
[SPEAKER_37]: And, you know, I do feel that I'm voting my values here.

1989
02:47:19,807 --> 02:47:22,368
[SPEAKER_37]: And for people that know me, I think you know what my values are.

1990
02:47:23,508 --> 02:47:26,970
[SPEAKER_37]: What I learned about Columbus was, you know, akin to

1991
02:47:28,370 --> 02:47:28,931
[SPEAKER_37]: pedophilia.

1992
02:47:29,731 --> 02:47:33,734
[SPEAKER_37]: In my opinion, they were rapists of, you know, rapes of children and what have you.

1993
02:47:33,834 --> 02:47:37,616
[SPEAKER_37]: And people say it's 15th century compared to 21st century.

1994
02:47:37,817 --> 02:47:39,198
[SPEAKER_37]: And I don't think that was ever vogue.

1995
02:47:39,218 --> 02:47:41,779
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't think cutting people's hands off was ever vogue.

1996
02:47:41,919 --> 02:47:43,941
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, these are the things that I've learned.

1997
02:47:44,041 --> 02:47:46,362
[SPEAKER_37]: And in good conscience, I felt that.

1998
02:47:47,083 --> 02:47:57,570
[SPEAKER_37]: And also, and most importantly, listening to people who have gone to the school and who feel really disenfranchised and left out and upset about someone who enslaved people

1999
02:47:58,210 --> 02:48:00,291
[SPEAKER_37]: being named on one of the buildings in our school.

2000
02:48:00,391 --> 02:48:02,012
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's where I'm at.

2001
02:48:02,172 --> 02:48:10,116
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's why I agreed to put this motion forward, because I think it is a reflection of my values.

2002
02:48:11,497 --> 02:48:12,698
[SPEAKER_37]: And thank you.

2003
02:48:12,718 --> 02:48:18,741
[SPEAKER_56]: Tony.

2004
02:48:19,481 --> 02:48:20,182
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

2005
02:48:20,202 --> 02:48:21,443
[SPEAKER_56]: Tony Pucci, 11 James Street.

2006
02:48:22,811 --> 02:48:33,520
[SPEAKER_56]: So, I hate to be the one to follow up committee members those posts because I'm going to be the one who has to comment on it but that's what we have in our school committee thank you for showing your character yet once again.

2007
02:48:34,481 --> 02:48:41,808
[SPEAKER_56]: So I don't want to attack him, and I don't want to sit here and spend the rest of the night defending Columbus but the same people who are saying Columbus spread disease.

2008
02:48:42,328 --> 02:48:47,233
[SPEAKER_56]: and all that on America, the one stating that he never set foot on the soil of America.

2009
02:48:47,253 --> 02:48:48,714
[SPEAKER_56]: I just want to clarify that as well.

2010
02:48:48,734 --> 02:48:51,497
[SPEAKER_56]: There's other books out there that you can read, everyone.

2011
02:48:52,098 --> 02:48:58,304
[SPEAKER_56]: You don't have to be the one that follows just your narrative, okay, because there are other historians that promote other views.

2012
02:48:58,704 --> 02:49:01,247
[SPEAKER_56]: Anyways, what I really wanted to get into was

2013
02:49:02,250 --> 02:49:14,146
[SPEAKER_56]: Mia and committee person Kretz both started the meeting off with important points and those were never addressed and we're moving along to Mr. Cuno's point which was

2014
02:49:14,761 --> 02:49:15,661
[SPEAKER_56]: What's going on here?

2015
02:49:16,702 --> 02:49:20,042
[SPEAKER_56]: This city has basically lost faith in you.

2016
02:49:20,142 --> 02:49:22,543
[SPEAKER_56]: You have divided us, the school committee, okay?

2017
02:49:22,843 --> 02:49:29,265
[SPEAKER_56]: So we don't trust you when you're gonna get involved and start making this committee to rename.

2018
02:49:29,945 --> 02:49:34,066
[SPEAKER_56]: We don't want you guys involved in that because we don't trust you anymore now.

2019
02:49:34,126 --> 02:49:35,087
[SPEAKER_56]: You have lost out.

2020
02:49:35,167 --> 02:49:36,467
[SPEAKER_56]: We don't have faith in you anymore.

2021
02:49:36,907 --> 02:49:37,728
[SPEAKER_56]: Do you understand this?

2022
02:49:37,748 --> 02:49:41,009
[SPEAKER_56]: You keep saying you're listening, you're listening, but you're not hearing us.

2023
02:49:41,249 --> 02:49:44,191
[SPEAKER_56]: You're really not understanding what we're trying to say here.

2024
02:49:44,651 --> 02:49:48,973
[SPEAKER_56]: Okay, you're listening, but really listen and understand and act upon what we're saying here.

2025
02:49:49,333 --> 02:49:53,255
[SPEAKER_56]: There's a lot of people that have a lot to say about this.

2026
02:49:53,335 --> 02:49:55,636
[SPEAKER_56]: And you guys just want to push this through and ignore everyone.

2027
02:49:55,676 --> 02:49:57,277
[SPEAKER_56]: And that's how we all feel right now.

2028
02:49:57,677 --> 02:49:58,798
[SPEAKER_56]: We all feel ignored.

2029
02:49:59,158 --> 02:50:01,999
[SPEAKER_56]: Like this is just something you're going to do, whether we like it or not.

2030
02:50:02,659 --> 02:50:03,840
[SPEAKER_56]: That's how we feel right now.

2031
02:50:04,220 --> 02:50:05,841
[SPEAKER_56]: And it's agitating and aggravating.

2032
02:50:06,937 --> 02:50:08,738
[SPEAKER_56]: maybe even on both sides of the agenda.

2033
02:50:09,658 --> 02:50:10,739
[SPEAKER_56]: It's not cool.

2034
02:50:11,979 --> 02:50:16,121
[SPEAKER_56]: Real quick, Paulette, again, thank you, committee person.

2035
02:50:16,361 --> 02:50:18,002
[SPEAKER_36]: Sorry, Tony, 15 seconds.

2036
02:50:18,142 --> 02:50:18,822
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you, Lisa.

2037
02:50:20,123 --> 02:50:23,084
[SPEAKER_56]: You stated that you had a problem with this 20 years ago when it was brought up.

2038
02:50:23,484 --> 02:50:25,205
[SPEAKER_56]: Why are you making an issue now?

2039
02:50:25,605 --> 02:50:30,968
[SPEAKER_56]: You had 20 years to deal with this, but now all of a sudden, well, we'll just throw it in there because everyone else is on board.

2040
02:50:31,688 --> 02:50:33,429
[SPEAKER_56]: There's so many bad things going on about this.

2041
02:50:33,449 --> 02:50:34,269
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you, Tony.

2042
02:50:34,289 --> 02:50:36,490
[SPEAKER_56]: Table this, push this, not tonight.

2043
02:50:51,970 --> 02:50:52,270
[SPEAKER_26]: Eric.

2044
02:51:07,981 --> 02:51:08,741
[SPEAKER_23]: Eric, are you there?

2045
02:51:09,382 --> 02:51:09,962
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, hi.

2046
02:51:11,243 --> 02:51:14,365
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, I did get out of an unstable internet connection.

2047
02:51:16,025 --> 02:51:20,568
[SPEAKER_23]: Mostly, I just want to say I applaud the school committee for the action they are taking.

2048
02:51:21,108 --> 02:51:26,712
[SPEAKER_23]: It's something that is, from my understanding, something that has been building up for a while.

2049
02:51:26,832 --> 02:51:27,992
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just one of those things.

2050
02:51:28,332 --> 02:51:35,056
[SPEAKER_23]: It started off, you know, regardless of who brought it up in a school committee meeting first, a germ of an idea to

2051
02:51:36,724 --> 02:51:53,122
[SPEAKER_23]: with the school of this horrible man's name started a long time ago and has slowly, slowly, slowly been building up momentum until finally, earlier this year or earlier last year, it finally got to the point where, okay, this makes sense.

2052
02:51:54,284 --> 02:51:57,347
[SPEAKER_23]: And more people are on board and are for it.

2053
02:51:57,808 --> 02:51:57,948
[SPEAKER_23]: And

2054
02:51:58,658 --> 02:51:59,538
[SPEAKER_23]: or moving forward.

2055
02:52:01,299 --> 02:52:13,885
[SPEAKER_23]: I also just recently learned the history of the name of the Andrews school, and how the person who the Andrews middle school was named after was deeply involved in the Medford community was a person of color.

2056
02:52:14,924 --> 02:52:20,591
[SPEAKER_23]: And once I learned that it really made sense to me that is the type of person you want to name a school after.

2057
02:52:21,131 --> 02:52:23,394
[SPEAKER_23]: So in as we go through this process.

2058
02:52:23,774 --> 02:52:27,718
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it would be excellent if you know there's more examples out there.

2059
02:52:27,738 --> 02:52:31,803
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sure there's plenty of other people deeply involved in the Medford community.

2060
02:52:32,335 --> 02:52:45,639
[SPEAKER_23]: maybe they're a person of color, maybe they're not, but who are really shining examples of who this and what this community can be and who deserve to have a school named after them and not someone who has absolutely no connection to Medford at all.

2061
02:52:45,679 --> 02:52:47,599
[SPEAKER_23]: Christopher Columbus never came to Medford.

2062
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:59,402
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm happy to see this process moving forward as a person who is raising biracial kids and who was married to a person of color.

2063
02:53:02,011 --> 02:53:02,591
[SPEAKER_23]: Move forward.

2064
02:53:02,892 --> 02:53:04,153
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all I have to say.

2065
02:53:04,333 --> 02:53:04,653
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

2066
02:53:07,435 --> 02:53:07,775
Thank you.

2067
02:53:08,496 --> 02:53:08,956
[SPEAKER_39]: Diane.

2068
02:53:16,218 --> 02:53:16,638
[SPEAKER_51]: Unmute.

2069
02:53:16,919 --> 02:53:17,379
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

2070
02:53:17,579 --> 02:53:19,020
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm unmuted now.

2071
02:53:19,640 --> 02:53:23,263
[SPEAKER_51]: My name is Diane Abramson, Diane Galeno Abramson.

2072
02:53:23,523 --> 02:53:25,284
[SPEAKER_51]: I grew up in South Medford.

2073
02:53:25,724 --> 02:53:29,667
[SPEAKER_51]: I was an educator in the Medford public school system for 35 years.

2074
02:53:30,207 --> 02:53:34,610
[SPEAKER_51]: I was honored by the Anti-Defamation League on many occasions.

2075
02:53:34,710 --> 02:53:39,694
[SPEAKER_51]: I rewrote the curriculum for multicultural education in the city of Medford.

2076
02:53:40,354 --> 02:53:45,638
[SPEAKER_51]: What I am hearing tonight is beyond comprehension.

2077
02:53:46,618 --> 02:54:04,628
[SPEAKER_51]: We have come to a point in the Medford School Committee where the issue of education seems to be a secondary issue in comparison to the rabble rousing that is going on now over the name of the Columbus School.

2078
02:54:05,228 --> 02:54:07,990
[SPEAKER_51]: I grew up around the corner from the Columbus School.

2079
02:54:08,150 --> 02:54:10,291
[SPEAKER_51]: I am a proud Italian American.

2080
02:54:10,751 --> 02:54:14,793
[SPEAKER_51]: My family lived in Medford and continues to live in the city of Medford.

2081
02:54:15,474 --> 02:54:25,699
[SPEAKER_51]: I do not know who the new people are on the school committee, but I can tell you one thing, how upset and how horrible this is.

2082
02:54:26,039 --> 02:54:29,121
[SPEAKER_51]: We are not a revisionist history community.

2083
02:54:29,601 --> 02:54:33,163
[SPEAKER_51]: We are pulling things out of our hats in a way to

2084
02:54:33,823 --> 02:54:55,467
[SPEAKER_51]: to denigrate the memory or denigrate the school and denigrate the Italian-American population by saying, Columbus is this, Columbus is that, and here's the history, and I vote my conscience, and using all kinds of language which is totally unequivocally inappropriate from a school committee member.

2085
02:54:55,727 --> 02:54:57,707
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm talking to you, Mr. Rousseau.

2086
02:54:58,087 --> 02:55:02,808
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm talking to you because I find your behavior reprehensible.

2087
02:55:03,448 --> 02:55:14,115
[SPEAKER_51]: and I just simply cannot understand what is going on in the city of Medford, what is happening to the common sense of the school.

2088
02:55:14,155 --> 02:55:15,657
[SPEAKER_51]: You have 15 more seconds.

2089
02:55:15,877 --> 02:55:17,718
[SPEAKER_51]: And that's absolutely fine.

2090
02:55:18,038 --> 02:55:26,064
[SPEAKER_51]: I rest my case, but you can be sure that everyone on the school committee and Madam Mayor, you will be receiving a rather lengthy

2091
02:55:26,904 --> 02:55:39,254
[SPEAKER_51]: treatise from me about my opinions about this whole nonsensical situation that is killing time that should be devoted to addressing the needs of the children.

2092
02:55:39,654 --> 02:55:39,974
[SPEAKER_51]: Done.

2093
02:55:41,595 --> 02:55:42,016
[SPEAKER_51]: Rachel?

2094
02:55:46,339 --> 02:55:47,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, Rachel Rockenmacher.

2095
02:55:48,430 --> 02:55:51,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm a parent in Medford.

2096
02:55:52,013 --> 02:55:55,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in South Medford, a couple blocks from the Columbus School.

2097
02:55:55,915 --> 02:55:58,857
[SPEAKER_07]: My child went to the Columbus grades K through 12.

2098
02:55:59,158 --> 02:56:01,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been here for decades.

2099
02:56:02,800 --> 02:56:04,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that that should matter.

2100
02:56:04,101 --> 02:56:15,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was a very active member of the PTO throughout all my child's time there and was an officer as well in the PTO and certainly did my

2101
02:56:16,618 --> 02:56:22,739
[SPEAKER_07]: do's in that hall of 12-hour shifts and bake sale on election day, et cetera.

2102
02:56:22,759 --> 02:56:28,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna applaud the school committee for taking on this important issue.

2103
02:56:28,460 --> 02:56:41,663
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanna say that when my child was an elementary school student, I know there were other children too who did take issue with the name Columbus being used for their school and refused to buy school t-shirts and stuff because they didn't wanna

2104
02:56:42,183 --> 02:56:42,944
[SPEAKER_07]: applaud that person.

2105
02:56:42,984 --> 02:56:47,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important not to honor people who don't deserve to be honored.

2106
02:56:47,126 --> 02:56:51,028
[SPEAKER_07]: It does nothing against Italians or Italian-Americans.

2107
02:56:51,669 --> 02:56:59,133
[SPEAKER_07]: There are plenty, and like other people have said, there are plenty of other Italian-Americans or Italians to honor with the name of the school.

2108
02:56:59,153 --> 02:57:01,054
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many other options.

2109
02:57:01,934 --> 02:57:10,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really hope that people can see that and realize that not everyone agrees with

2110
02:57:10,854 --> 02:57:17,219
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes people who oppose this change have been saying, oh, everybody who lives here opposes this.

2111
02:57:17,259 --> 02:57:18,840
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's absolutely not true.

2112
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I live here and I support it heartily.

2113
02:57:21,301 --> 02:57:29,447
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm horrified at the kind of vitriol that's coming at our school committee members by the people who oppose it.

2114
02:57:29,487 --> 02:57:32,369
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope we can re-engage in some more civil discourse.

2115
02:57:32,790 --> 02:57:33,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2116
02:57:37,313 --> 02:57:37,633
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2117
02:57:40,205 --> 02:57:40,625
[SPEAKER_39]: Eliza?

2118
02:57:40,645 --> 02:57:46,806
[SPEAKER_48]: Hi.

2119
02:57:46,826 --> 02:57:49,667
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm a South Medford resident.

2120
02:57:49,787 --> 02:57:55,248
[SPEAKER_48]: I actually voted the Columbus School and an educator, though not in Medford.

2121
02:57:56,969 --> 02:58:00,989
[SPEAKER_48]: And I think people seem to be really confused about what this meeting is for.

2122
02:58:01,089 --> 02:58:03,110
[SPEAKER_48]: So I thought maybe I was confused.

2123
02:58:04,011 --> 02:58:19,264
[SPEAKER_48]: I'd like to clarify if this is about stopping the renaming of the school or is it about focusing our efforts onto best representing the community in the renaming that's already been decided upon?

2124
02:58:20,646 --> 02:58:22,627
[SPEAKER_48]: Can somebody field that question for me?

2125
02:58:23,708 --> 02:58:26,811
[SPEAKER_41]: This is the policy on how to rename.

2126
02:58:27,512 --> 02:58:34,856
[SPEAKER_48]: Okay, so what we're trying to figure out is how to do it, who's gonna be involved in it and how we can move forward.

2127
02:58:36,217 --> 02:58:37,197
[SPEAKER_48]: Is that accurate?

2128
02:58:37,217 --> 02:58:37,538
[SPEAKER_38]: Correct.

2129
02:58:38,238 --> 02:58:38,478
[SPEAKER_48]: Okay.

2130
02:58:39,799 --> 02:58:43,901
[SPEAKER_48]: The comments that I've been hearing seem to confuse me that maybe I came to the wrong meeting.

2131
02:58:44,081 --> 02:58:50,024
[SPEAKER_48]: So thank you for clarifying and thank you for all of your hard work.

2132
02:58:50,085 --> 02:58:53,006
[SPEAKER_48]: I think that this is an important issue and I'm glad that we're doing this.

2133
02:58:54,407 --> 02:58:54,967
[SPEAKER_48]: Have a good evening.

2134
02:58:55,207 --> 02:58:56,308
[SPEAKER_48]: You too, thank you.

2135
02:58:57,389 --> 02:58:57,741
[SPEAKER_39]: Nadia.

2136
02:59:06,368 --> 02:59:10,389
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, I'm Nadia Purifory, a longtime resident of Medford.

2137
02:59:10,429 --> 02:59:12,589
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Madam Mayor and school committee members.

2138
02:59:13,270 --> 02:59:15,850
[SPEAKER_22]: I just had just a couple of comments.

2139
02:59:16,050 --> 02:59:21,371
[SPEAKER_22]: I just, I feel like honestly, no matter what I'm going to say is really not going to change anyone's mind.

2140
02:59:21,391 --> 02:59:28,413
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel that almost with any issue, unfortunately, with the school committee, and I've never felt that way raising all eight of my children in Medford.

2141
02:59:29,122 --> 02:59:31,804
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a nurse at hospital in Medford.

2142
02:59:32,744 --> 02:59:34,065
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm involved with PTG.

2143
02:59:34,626 --> 02:59:38,408
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just, since this happened, I don't even know when it was June, I guess.

2144
02:59:38,968 --> 02:59:44,212
[SPEAKER_22]: I just feel such a distrust towards all the members except for Ms.

2145
02:59:44,232 --> 02:59:45,312
[SPEAKER_22]: Kratz.

2146
02:59:45,372 --> 02:59:49,695
[SPEAKER_22]: But otherwise I feel, you know, I am against the name change.

2147
02:59:51,590 --> 02:59:53,132
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm proud Italian American.

2148
02:59:53,332 --> 02:59:58,618
[SPEAKER_22]: My parents came from Italy and Columbus does mean a lot to my family, you know, growing up.

2149
02:59:58,978 --> 03:00:03,784
[SPEAKER_22]: And, um, I just feel the way it was done was just very sneaky.

2150
03:00:04,485 --> 03:00:10,832
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish that the community was involved and I felt we weren't, I felt it was hidden that the name change was done.

2151
03:00:12,051 --> 03:00:12,872
[SPEAKER_22]: in a sneaky way.

2152
03:00:12,952 --> 03:00:18,517
[SPEAKER_22]: And now I'm concerned with the new, you know, decision for the name change.

2153
03:00:18,817 --> 03:00:20,218
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think we'll really be involved.

2154
03:00:20,258 --> 03:00:31,288
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the school committee will just make the name change on their own without any community involvement, or at least the part of Medford that wants the Columbus name removed.

2155
03:00:31,328 --> 03:00:35,051
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think they'll listen to the members who don't wanna change.

2156
03:00:37,073 --> 03:00:37,833
[SPEAKER_22]: I just feel hurt.

2157
03:00:39,074 --> 03:00:39,194
[SPEAKER_22]: And,

2158
03:00:41,994 --> 03:00:44,135
[SPEAKER_22]: doesn't seem like the Medford that I grew up in.

2159
03:00:46,257 --> 03:00:46,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2160
03:00:47,778 --> 03:00:48,478
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Nadia.

2161
03:00:49,158 --> 03:00:49,919
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Van de Kloet.

2162
03:00:50,519 --> 03:00:51,660
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, Nadia.

2163
03:00:52,220 --> 03:01:10,031
[SPEAKER_33]: The question for me is, and I've said this all along, is there no one else that we could honor from the Italian community that might in fact bring a great deal of pride

2164
03:01:12,313 --> 03:01:24,202
[SPEAKER_33]: I understand people have very different feelings about Columbus, but part of the issue is, is there any way to move forward?

2165
03:01:24,922 --> 03:01:27,104
[SPEAKER_33]: We are saying we need to move forward.

2166
03:01:28,225 --> 03:01:34,690
[SPEAKER_33]: We understand, and I think a lot of this meeting is because we want everybody to speak, but again, part of the,

2167
03:01:36,206 --> 03:01:40,089
[SPEAKER_33]: the need at some point is to say, is there anybody else?

2168
03:01:40,169 --> 03:01:40,609
[SPEAKER_33]: Who else?

2169
03:01:41,229 --> 03:01:47,054
[SPEAKER_33]: And we're trying to say, if you want a voice in this, apply to the advisory committee.

2170
03:01:47,474 --> 03:02:04,786
[SPEAKER_33]: We're working out the nuts and bolts so that, and certainly all the work I did on the resolution was to make sure that no one person could slant the committee in such a way that a final name was predetermined.

2171
03:02:05,760 --> 03:02:12,948
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, so that's just a, you know, that's part of what I was looking at is to make sure the process was clean.

2172
03:02:13,369 --> 03:02:15,471
[SPEAKER_33]: I understand you don't like the back process.

2173
03:02:15,591 --> 03:02:17,253
[SPEAKER_33]: I understand that it's painful.

2174
03:02:17,633 --> 03:02:18,214
[SPEAKER_33]: I hear it.

2175
03:02:18,835 --> 03:02:23,820
[SPEAKER_33]: But going forward, how can we make sure that we are doing the best job?

2176
03:02:23,900 --> 03:02:26,123
[SPEAKER_33]: And I encourage you to please apply for the committee.

2177
03:02:27,625 --> 03:02:36,251
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I just think if it was, you know, from the beginning, if it was done differently, I would, it's not even mostly about the name.

2178
03:02:36,351 --> 03:02:37,552
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just the way it was done.

2179
03:02:37,752 --> 03:02:45,258
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, if it was, if, if the community could have been fully involved in the decision, I just suddenly heard it, I think on social media and I was like, what is going on?

2180
03:02:45,278 --> 03:02:47,779
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I just feel like this is one thing.

2181
03:02:47,799 --> 03:02:48,940
[SPEAKER_22]: And then what's going to be next.

2182
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:50,261
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's change the Brooks school.

2183
03:02:50,681 --> 03:02:52,923
[SPEAKER_22]: Could my church suddenly the name get changed?

2184
03:02:53,003 --> 03:02:54,004
[SPEAKER_22]: I just feel like this is,

2185
03:02:54,604 --> 03:02:56,045
[SPEAKER_22]: what's happening throughout the country?

2186
03:02:56,065 --> 03:02:57,746
[SPEAKER_22]: And is this like a trend that's going on?

2187
03:02:57,806 --> 03:03:03,608
[SPEAKER_22]: And suddenly I'm here and my kids are learning about white privilege at school or Black Lives Matter.

2188
03:03:04,649 --> 03:03:09,911
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what direction Medford's going in, but it's definitely not the Medford, like I said, that I raised.

2189
03:03:10,291 --> 03:03:12,192
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm the youngest of nine that we grew up in here.

2190
03:03:12,232 --> 03:03:13,072
[SPEAKER_22]: There was never an issue.

2191
03:03:13,112 --> 03:03:13,973
[SPEAKER_22]: My husband's black.

2192
03:03:14,153 --> 03:03:17,094
[SPEAKER_22]: My kids are half black American, half native American.

2193
03:03:18,975 --> 03:03:21,276
[SPEAKER_22]: I've never seen race as an issue in Medford.

2194
03:03:24,804 --> 03:03:26,586
[SPEAKER_22]: And suddenly there's just more problems.

2195
03:03:27,126 --> 03:03:30,048
[SPEAKER_22]: We should be focusing on education and kids' mental health.

2196
03:03:31,470 --> 03:03:32,490
[SPEAKER_22]: They should be back in school.

2197
03:03:32,531 --> 03:03:33,551
[SPEAKER_22]: That should be the focus.

2198
03:03:34,514 --> 03:03:38,117
[SPEAKER_22]: There should be more, we should be having our community more pulled together.

2199
03:03:38,137 --> 03:03:39,158
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't even see anyone.

2200
03:03:39,578 --> 03:03:40,879
[SPEAKER_22]: My children don't see anyone.

2201
03:03:41,279 --> 03:03:44,682
[SPEAKER_22]: That should be the focus, not on the Columbus school change name right now.

2202
03:03:44,722 --> 03:03:53,469
[SPEAKER_22]: We should be focusing on, I've been in contact with Marie Cassidy numerous times at the Medford Network because I feel like I don't see any other parents.

2203
03:03:53,569 --> 03:03:55,210
[SPEAKER_22]: My children don't see any other children.

2204
03:03:58,753 --> 03:04:00,354
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm concerned for their mental health.

2205
03:04:01,383 --> 03:04:02,584
[SPEAKER_22]: Not about the Columbus School.

2206
03:04:02,904 --> 03:04:07,366
[SPEAKER_22]: We shouldn't be wasting all this time on this right now or the money on that.

2207
03:04:07,426 --> 03:04:11,688
[SPEAKER_22]: It should be money for programs for our children to be connected.

2208
03:04:13,368 --> 03:04:13,849
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2209
03:04:15,529 --> 03:04:16,070
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Nadia.

2210
03:04:16,590 --> 03:04:16,990
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2211
03:04:21,252 --> 03:04:21,772
[SPEAKER_39]: Joanna?

2212
03:04:21,792 --> 03:04:28,935
[SPEAKER_67]: Am I unmuted?

2213
03:04:29,816 --> 03:04:30,016
[SPEAKER_67]: Yes.

2214
03:04:31,340 --> 03:04:36,441
[SPEAKER_67]: Hi, I just wanted to thank you all for voting to change the name, the time is now.

2215
03:04:37,022 --> 03:04:40,203
[SPEAKER_67]: And I feel bad, I feel bad for Nadia that she's heard.

2216
03:04:41,003 --> 03:04:45,704
[SPEAKER_67]: I think that the other, the people that oppose the change, well, the change is done.

2217
03:04:45,724 --> 03:04:50,405
[SPEAKER_67]: The people that oppose it should have a big say in the renaming.

2218
03:04:50,766 --> 03:04:53,586
[SPEAKER_67]: There's plenty of heroes to name the school after.

2219
03:04:54,146 --> 03:04:55,307
[SPEAKER_67]: Columbus was not a hero.

2220
03:04:55,767 --> 03:04:59,408
[SPEAKER_67]: I'm Italian American, Mi'kmaq, which is Native American,

2221
03:05:00,203 --> 03:05:05,764
[SPEAKER_67]: Irish, I mean, I'm a hodgepodge, but that's not even important.

2222
03:05:06,184 --> 03:05:12,225
[SPEAKER_67]: What's important is at the beginning of the meeting, you said there would be some decorum.

2223
03:05:12,765 --> 03:05:20,326
[SPEAKER_67]: And I think that the people that have shown a little disrespect, not a little, but they shouldn't be attacking you.

2224
03:05:20,827 --> 03:05:21,827
[SPEAKER_67]: And I just want to thank you.

2225
03:05:21,947 --> 03:05:23,167
[SPEAKER_67]: Thank you for changing the name.

2226
03:05:23,747 --> 03:05:24,027
[SPEAKER_67]: Thank you.

2227
03:05:25,587 --> 03:05:25,967
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2228
03:05:28,788 --> 03:05:29,228
[SPEAKER_39]: Hendricks?

2229
03:05:33,613 --> 03:05:36,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Hendrick Gideons, North Medford.

2230
03:05:38,094 --> 03:05:39,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

2231
03:05:42,816 --> 03:05:45,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved to Medford in 1990.

2232
03:05:47,277 --> 03:05:52,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I got here, it was really quite unfriendly.

2233
03:05:53,619 --> 03:05:56,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't feel welcome.

2234
03:05:59,028 --> 03:06:12,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand that many other people that are newcomers, like I am only being here 30 years, we have felt like our opinion wasn't valued.

2235
03:06:13,733 --> 03:06:20,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is happening now is that Medford is changing because people are moving here.

2236
03:06:21,596 --> 03:06:26,278
[SPEAKER_03]: The population is changing, the values are changing, and

2237
03:06:29,079 --> 03:06:37,044
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, this is very much like making a mistake around people that come to visit you at your house.

2238
03:06:37,144 --> 03:06:43,448
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have somebody come over to your house and you say, well, my boss gypped me out of this.

2239
03:06:43,888 --> 03:06:46,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turns out that they're Roma.

2240
03:06:46,750 --> 03:06:48,291
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they're offended by that.

2241
03:06:48,731 --> 03:06:51,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say, do you know where that comes from?

2242
03:06:51,853 --> 03:06:55,615
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes from the expression, gyp is from gypsy.

2243
03:06:56,196 --> 03:07:01,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And that hurt my feelings because it made me feel like you were pointing the finger at me.

2244
03:07:02,939 --> 03:07:10,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you do something like that, you say, I'm really sorry that I hurt your feelings and I'm not going to do it again.

2245
03:07:10,204 --> 03:07:12,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And what can I do to make it right?

2246
03:07:13,394 --> 03:07:23,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm hearing from the people that say how Medford is changing and they don't wanna change, to me, this is about being polite.

2247
03:07:23,780 --> 03:07:28,603
[SPEAKER_03]: If you find out that something hurts people- Enrique, 15 seconds.

2248
03:07:29,364 --> 03:07:29,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2249
03:07:30,745 --> 03:07:33,866
[SPEAKER_03]: You change what you're doing so you stop hurting people.

2250
03:07:34,767 --> 03:07:36,228
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what good people do.

2251
03:07:37,489 --> 03:07:42,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you find out that calling a school the Columbus hurts people,

2252
03:07:43,188 --> 03:07:43,828
[SPEAKER_03]: You change it.

2253
03:07:44,648 --> 03:07:46,529
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what cities are supposed to do.

2254
03:07:46,609 --> 03:07:55,671
[SPEAKER_03]: They're supposed to respond and act the way that morality dictates, which is to stop hurting people.

2255
03:07:56,111 --> 03:07:56,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2256
03:08:01,552 --> 03:08:02,213
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2257
03:08:05,833 --> 03:08:07,994
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm trying to go to people who haven't spoke yet, Erica.

2258
03:08:16,738 --> 03:08:16,858
[SPEAKER_50]: Hi.

2259
03:08:16,878 --> 03:08:17,658
[SPEAKER_50]: Can you hear me?

2260
03:08:18,499 --> 03:08:20,160
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

2261
03:08:20,180 --> 03:08:20,220
[SPEAKER_50]: Hi.

2262
03:08:20,260 --> 03:08:21,240
[SPEAKER_50]: My name is Erica Hunt.

2263
03:08:21,460 --> 03:08:27,763
[SPEAKER_50]: I live on Fulton Street, and I'm a proud Italian American and mother of three biracial children in metropolitan schools.

2264
03:08:28,603 --> 03:08:35,806
[SPEAKER_50]: The pushback to this foregone conclusion only highlights the need for massive change for racial justice in our schools and community.

2265
03:08:36,747 --> 03:08:46,251
[SPEAKER_50]: People saying they are not being listened to are repeating the same racial tropes heard over and over in any situation of progress or change in the city.

2266
03:08:47,031 --> 03:08:54,757
[SPEAKER_50]: I don't tie my worth as an American to Christopher Columbus, and actually it perpetuates the hidden caste system in America.

2267
03:08:54,777 --> 03:09:02,003
[SPEAKER_50]: I am completely in agreement with the change of the name of the Columbus school, and that's all I have to say.

2268
03:09:04,765 --> 03:09:05,065
[SPEAKER_33]: Mayor.

2269
03:09:05,966 --> 03:09:06,687
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Erica.

2270
03:09:06,787 --> 03:09:07,507
[SPEAKER_39]: Member van der Kloet.

2271
03:09:07,808 --> 03:09:15,534
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, I just wanted to mention that Ron Giovino has had his hand up for a long time, but he doesn't have one of the regular little hands.

2272
03:09:16,078 --> 03:09:17,559
[SPEAKER_33]: So just to make sure he's on your list.

2273
03:09:18,619 --> 03:09:18,839
[SPEAKER_41]: Sure.

2274
03:09:19,459 --> 03:09:20,320
[SPEAKER_41]: Ron can go next.

2275
03:09:20,520 --> 03:09:21,620
[SPEAKER_41]: We haven't heard from Ron yet.

2276
03:09:21,640 --> 03:09:22,881
[SPEAKER_41]: Let me just unmute you, Ron.

2277
03:09:24,681 --> 03:09:25,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2278
03:09:25,302 --> 03:09:27,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have two points, procedural points.

2279
03:09:27,883 --> 03:09:32,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see this get moved towards a decent end here, but two points.

2280
03:09:32,904 --> 03:09:38,807
[SPEAKER_01]: The beginning of this meeting three hours ago, one of the rules was that everybody has to give their address.

2281
03:09:39,867 --> 03:09:52,039
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mentioned by Mr. Cook know a little while ago, given the fact that there are so many organizations outside the city involved in this process, I think it's extremely important that people are mandated to give their address.

2282
03:09:52,259 --> 03:09:54,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Second point is the language that's been used.

2283
03:09:55,822 --> 03:09:57,143
[SPEAKER_01]: We were asked to be respectful.

2284
03:09:57,423 --> 03:10:10,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of citizens haven't, but not one committee person admonished their colleague when he used that language, language which in the 62 years I've lived in the city, I've never heard an elected official use.

2285
03:10:10,950 --> 03:10:13,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give him an opportunity to apologize for that.

2286
03:10:14,152 --> 03:10:19,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that it should come from me, it should have come from one of his colleagues, but very, very disappointed.

2287
03:10:20,015 --> 03:10:20,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2288
03:10:21,035 --> 03:10:21,856
[SPEAKER_33]: Ron, what's your address?

2289
03:10:22,754 --> 03:10:26,635
[SPEAKER_01]: 326 East Porter Road, and I've lived in Medford since 1959.

2290
03:10:27,015 --> 03:10:29,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for asking.

2291
03:10:31,616 --> 03:10:35,496
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Ron.

2292
03:10:37,737 --> 03:10:49,439
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure if you don't watch a lot of political activities in Medford, but I heard a lovely story about how the governor of Massachusetts used Medford City Council meetings as entertainment

2293
03:10:50,586 --> 03:10:55,588
[SPEAKER_21]: This is not a community where we are all polite in our political discourse, right on TV.

2294
03:10:55,928 --> 03:10:58,648
[SPEAKER_21]: And that has a history going back long before I was born.

2295
03:10:59,489 --> 03:11:09,231
[SPEAKER_21]: We also just had a president for four years that thought words I would never utter in front of polite company was front page news every day.

2296
03:11:09,611 --> 03:11:14,313
[SPEAKER_21]: So I use the word crap a couple of times and I'm not gonna apologize for it.

2297
03:11:14,513 --> 03:11:15,113
[SPEAKER_21]: It was,

2298
03:11:15,689 --> 03:11:25,218
[SPEAKER_21]: If you think that that was offensive language that you've never heard from a politician, then you haven't listened to a lot of city council meetings, because I have heard it many times much worse.

2299
03:11:25,358 --> 03:11:28,881
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you for the admonishment, and I don't apologize.

2300
03:11:29,742 --> 03:11:38,350
[SPEAKER_41]: Please, if we could just work through comments, if everybody could choose kindness and just be respectable.

2301
03:11:39,831 --> 03:11:42,013
[SPEAKER_41]: Please, please, let's get through this.

2302
03:11:46,385 --> 03:11:46,865
[SPEAKER_39]: Jessica.

2303
03:11:52,947 --> 03:11:54,788
[SPEAKER_61]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and committee members.

2304
03:11:56,108 --> 03:12:12,354
[SPEAKER_61]: I did not plan to talk this evening because I knew it was going to be this three or four hour long situation where most of the people supporting OR and Mr. Comeau would be, you know, battling back and forth.

2305
03:12:16,820 --> 03:12:17,080
[SPEAKER_61]: Okay.

2306
03:12:17,340 --> 03:12:19,981
[SPEAKER_41]: Point of personal privilege member Russo.

2307
03:12:21,442 --> 03:12:23,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay speaking, but I'd like to know their maiden name.

2308
03:12:24,983 --> 03:12:26,243
[SPEAKER_61]: Jessica, your name and address.

2309
03:12:27,124 --> 03:12:28,064
[SPEAKER_61]: I'll give you my address.

2310
03:12:28,084 --> 03:12:29,044
[SPEAKER_61]: 6 22 Boston.

2311
03:12:29,184 --> 03:12:31,385
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know your maiden name, Mayor.

2312
03:12:31,565 --> 03:12:36,407
[SPEAKER_21]: If my maiden name is considered appropriate, then I would like to know this person's maiden name as well.

2313
03:12:37,607 --> 03:12:39,968
[SPEAKER_41]: Well, if you want to know, you can't ask for the maiden name.

2314
03:12:40,028 --> 03:12:40,108
[SPEAKER_41]: You

2315
03:12:45,296 --> 03:12:50,781
[SPEAKER_21]: Rousseau for 15 years, I don't understand the disrespect, but it's an unacceptable level of disrespect.

2316
03:12:52,382 --> 03:12:56,206
[SPEAKER_21]: I expect that she will either use my correct name or she will be asked to not speak.

2317
03:13:00,009 --> 03:13:07,316
[SPEAKER_41]: If we could address Mr. Rousseau as Mr. Rousseau, you name and address the record, and then you have two minutes, you have the rest of your two minutes, please.

2318
03:13:08,317 --> 03:13:09,498
[SPEAKER_61]: Jessica Ravicchio, 622 Boston Ave.

2319
03:13:11,189 --> 03:13:18,935
[SPEAKER_61]: I'll be happy to give Mr. Russo whatever he thinks he deserves, but I really think he needs to put his felony records up so that we could all see who he actually is.

2320
03:13:19,496 --> 03:13:20,297
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

2321
03:13:20,337 --> 03:13:20,917
[SPEAKER_61]: Have a good night.

2322
03:13:22,919 --> 03:13:30,505
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor, if anybody wants to directly address a member, I'm fairly certain that's against the violation of Robert's rules, and I think they should be ejected from the meeting.

2323
03:13:30,785 --> 03:13:32,046
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there a second from a member?

2324
03:13:35,189 --> 03:13:36,910
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, everything needs to be addressed through the chair.

2325
03:13:38,071 --> 03:13:38,292
[SPEAKER_41]: Please.

2326
03:13:39,864 --> 03:13:40,424
[SPEAKER_41]: through the chair.

2327
03:13:41,125 --> 03:13:42,846
[SPEAKER_21]: It's no longer.

2328
03:13:42,866 --> 03:13:52,273
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a committee of the whole, as I understand it, and the public actually does not have a right to participate and speak.

2329
03:13:52,573 --> 03:13:53,614
[SPEAKER_21]: They have a right to watch.

2330
03:13:53,974 --> 03:13:54,655
[SPEAKER_21]: That is the law.

2331
03:13:55,936 --> 03:14:03,901
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that if we can't maintain decorum, then I think we should consider ending all public participation.

2332
03:14:06,443 --> 03:14:08,625
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm not in favor of ending participation,

2333
03:14:09,696 --> 03:14:12,238
[SPEAKER_41]: If we could just stop with the insults.

2334
03:14:12,298 --> 03:14:13,799
[SPEAKER_41]: We need to move on.

2335
03:14:13,839 --> 03:14:14,820
[SPEAKER_41]: We need to get through this.

2336
03:14:15,100 --> 03:14:16,461
[SPEAKER_41]: And we wanna hear from people.

2337
03:14:16,481 --> 03:14:18,902
[SPEAKER_41]: We just, if everybody could please be respectful.

2338
03:14:19,523 --> 03:14:19,803
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor.

2339
03:14:20,503 --> 03:14:21,544
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Van de Kloet.

2340
03:14:21,784 --> 03:14:26,648
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, I think people should also only have one last chance to talk.

2341
03:14:26,728 --> 03:14:35,174
[SPEAKER_33]: I think that we've allowed ample opportunity for people to, you know, and many people have spoken several times and,

2342
03:14:36,354 --> 03:14:40,416
[SPEAKER_33]: So I think that we've been more than generous with time.

2343
03:14:40,856 --> 03:14:44,238
[SPEAKER_33]: If there's people who haven't spoken, they should get a chance to speak.

2344
03:14:45,399 --> 03:14:50,942
[SPEAKER_33]: But we're getting tired and the commentary is dissolving.

2345
03:14:51,342 --> 03:14:54,523
[SPEAKER_41]: I think we've heard from everybody that has their hand raised.

2346
03:14:54,864 --> 03:14:56,364
[SPEAKER_41]: We can always take a motion.

2347
03:14:56,504 --> 03:15:00,587
[SPEAKER_41]: If we get through another paragraph or two, we can always take a motion to hear more public comment.

2348
03:15:02,031 --> 03:15:03,092
[SPEAKER_41]: and not wait till the end.

2349
03:15:03,732 --> 03:15:10,477
[SPEAKER_41]: Let's just get through another paragraph or two at least, and we will hear more public participation.

2350
03:15:12,319 --> 03:15:12,579
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2351
03:15:13,160 --> 03:15:22,767
[SPEAKER_33]: So one of the questions is I've seen principal K here and some level of question was around the Columbus participation.

2352
03:15:24,388 --> 03:15:27,671
[SPEAKER_33]: And I wondered if we should,

2353
03:15:29,497 --> 03:15:30,337
[SPEAKER_33]: Talk about that.

2354
03:15:31,098 --> 03:15:34,180
[SPEAKER_33]: Paul and I do have the Columbus participation in a different way.

2355
03:15:36,582 --> 03:15:43,807
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, it is part of the bigger question of who's going to be on the advisory council, membership on the advisory council.

2356
03:15:45,408 --> 03:15:52,254
[SPEAKER_33]: Perhaps, you know, when you have multiple devices and then they close on you.

2357
03:15:55,536 --> 03:15:56,817
[SPEAKER_33]: This one's Paul's, sorry.

2358
03:15:58,740 --> 03:16:01,563
[SPEAKER_33]: Anyway, would that be acceptable?

2359
03:16:02,884 --> 03:16:05,326
[SPEAKER_33]: Mayor, can I talk about that for a minute?

2360
03:16:06,207 --> 03:16:06,947
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, please do.

2361
03:16:07,048 --> 03:16:08,409
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, thank you.

2362
03:16:08,889 --> 03:16:12,993
[SPEAKER_33]: First, I have a paragraph about participation by the Columbus School staff and students.

2363
03:16:13,843 --> 03:16:21,291
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's a separate paragraph says in recognition that the staff and students of the Columbus school are dedicated to their school.

2364
03:16:21,771 --> 03:16:28,318
[SPEAKER_33]: The school committee requests the principal to create a representative group of staff to solicit input from their colleagues.

2365
03:16:29,039 --> 03:16:31,902
[SPEAKER_33]: Additionally, student input is highly desirable.

2366
03:16:32,620 --> 03:16:43,965
[SPEAKER_33]: And if it is feasible, student participation will be encouraged in any way the principal deems to be workable in this very short period of time.

2367
03:16:44,765 --> 03:16:52,928
[SPEAKER_33]: The goal of both staff and student input is to come up with three to five names to submit for consideration to the advisory committee.

2368
03:16:53,488 --> 03:16:55,589
[SPEAKER_33]: The names will be submitted by April 26th.

2369
03:16:56,790 --> 03:16:57,630
[SPEAKER_33]: So we're saying

2370
03:16:58,257 --> 03:17:03,661
[SPEAKER_33]: to the principal, there's only four weeks.

2371
03:17:04,662 --> 03:17:12,748
[SPEAKER_33]: We had originally envisioned a much greater, longer period where we were gonna get student education and input.

2372
03:17:14,212 --> 03:17:22,939
[SPEAKER_33]: Therefore, in recognition of that, I'm saying, oh my gosh, you know, principal, I don't know what you're going to be able to do.

2373
03:17:22,999 --> 03:17:29,464
[SPEAKER_33]: And I don't, I understand to me, it's not, this is one of the problems with a very tight timeline, I believe.

2374
03:17:29,865 --> 03:17:35,149
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not giving a great opportunity for student input.

2375
03:17:36,229 --> 03:17:36,930
[SPEAKER_33]: Furthermore,

2376
03:17:39,747 --> 03:17:45,631
[SPEAKER_33]: the principal of the Columbus or her designee, as well as two staff members selected by their peers.

2377
03:17:46,171 --> 03:17:48,692
[SPEAKER_33]: And then I have, or appointed by the principal.

2378
03:17:48,812 --> 03:17:49,913
[SPEAKER_33]: I didn't know which way to go.

2379
03:17:49,933 --> 03:17:53,775
[SPEAKER_33]: I wanted committee input and I wanted the principal's input.

2380
03:17:54,236 --> 03:17:59,159
[SPEAKER_41]: We'll be appointed as- If I may, before you finish, will you please screen share that?

2381
03:18:00,860 --> 03:18:04,122
[SPEAKER_41]: Or I don't know if member Graham has that right in her document.

2382
03:18:04,142 --> 03:18:05,342
[SPEAKER_62]: I can do that.

2383
03:18:06,283 --> 03:18:07,464
[SPEAKER_41]: We're gonna need to screen share.

2384
03:18:08,325 --> 03:18:27,229
[SPEAKER_62]: Yeah, I would just ask that member Vander Kloot describe her intent and then member Rousseau do the same thing because we need to understand the intent so that we can then understand the details of the words.

2385
03:18:27,749 --> 03:18:32,150
[SPEAKER_62]: And we have not had an opportunity to talk about this as a group until now.

2386
03:18:32,310 --> 03:18:34,191
[SPEAKER_62]: So can we just start with,

2387
03:18:35,296 --> 03:18:53,386
[SPEAKER_33]: overall intent, Columbus participation, the overall intent was that we originally said we wanted some student participation, and we were recognizing that the Columbus family if you would, including staff members should have some role.

2388
03:18:59,253 --> 03:19:05,378
[SPEAKER_33]: Member Rousseau will speak to this, but he identified six members as being on the advisory council.

2389
03:19:05,939 --> 03:19:09,682
[SPEAKER_33]: I thought that was a lot to ask for six members.

2390
03:19:10,122 --> 03:19:21,372
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm suggesting that the school have an internal process, however way they want to do it, to collect names that they want to submit, hopefully with some student input, but I don't know if the time allows, honestly.

2391
03:19:22,573 --> 03:19:34,080
[SPEAKER_33]: and that there would be three members from the Columbus community, and that is the staff, okay, that would serve on the advisory committee.

2392
03:19:34,361 --> 03:19:40,885
[SPEAKER_33]: And they would be elected either by their peers or appointed by the principal, depending on what we decided.

2393
03:19:42,006 --> 03:19:43,027
[SPEAKER_33]: So that was my thinking.

2394
03:19:45,969 --> 03:19:49,391
[SPEAKER_41]: And if I just may comment again, if we put the,

2395
03:19:49,841 --> 03:19:56,584
[SPEAKER_41]: principal and the two staff, that's gonna depend a great deal on how large, for me, the committee is, whether it's 11 people, 15, 21.

2396
03:19:56,644 --> 03:20:03,188
[SPEAKER_33]: Right, but that was less than the six people that Member Rousseau suggested.

2397
03:20:03,708 --> 03:20:04,068
[SPEAKER_41]: Correct.

2398
03:20:04,889 --> 03:20:05,169
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

2399
03:20:06,649 --> 03:20:07,290
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Rousseau?

2400
03:20:08,630 --> 03:20:12,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Member Randall-Kluge, for summarizing yours.

2401
03:20:13,313 --> 03:20:15,114
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually don't think they're actually that far apart.

2402
03:20:18,613 --> 03:20:35,921
[SPEAKER_21]: one of the reasons that mine is the way it is, is that later in the process, we were going to be reducing the number of names and that their names that they were suggest name or names that they were going to come forth with as a Columbus community would just automatically make it to the list.

2403
03:20:36,901 --> 03:20:40,563
[SPEAKER_21]: And if a list was four, then it was going to become six names long, for instance.

2404
03:20:41,843 --> 03:20:43,184
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess I

2405
03:20:45,609 --> 03:20:50,092
[SPEAKER_21]: since we've already decided that we're going to allow any and every name that comes forth to be in the pile.

2406
03:20:52,093 --> 03:20:56,175
[SPEAKER_21]: And all names will get the same amount of deliberation and consideration by the advisory committee.

2407
03:20:56,215 --> 03:20:57,956
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, of course, they're gonna go through the list.

2408
03:20:58,756 --> 03:21:00,457
[SPEAKER_21]: So then I guess I'm confused.

2409
03:21:04,339 --> 03:21:14,385
[SPEAKER_21]: I think Columbus doing the work to come up with a couple of names or however many names they want to is good work that I think would be great.

2410
03:21:15,383 --> 03:21:21,346
[SPEAKER_21]: But at the end of the day, their names just get tossed on the pile on what will actually be a heap.

2411
03:21:22,727 --> 03:21:31,511
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think if they wanna do the work to come up with names and to provide a good defense of like, here's why we think this name should be the name.

2412
03:21:32,292 --> 03:21:41,316
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that we may get a lot more at the starting point from the Columbus community because they won't have entered a couple of sentences on a submission form.

2413
03:21:41,696 --> 03:21:43,217
[SPEAKER_21]: They may have an actual like,

2414
03:21:43,752 --> 03:21:46,593
[SPEAKER_21]: document our presentation on the names that they've come up with.

2415
03:21:47,333 --> 03:21:49,174
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's still important and good work.

2416
03:21:50,274 --> 03:22:01,178
[SPEAKER_21]: But the number of members from the Columbus staff that will be on the advisory committee, I think I can go any which way you want.

2417
03:22:01,238 --> 03:22:03,999
[SPEAKER_21]: And I see Dr. Hay has her hand up.

2418
03:22:04,560 --> 03:22:11,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Two, three, six, I honestly feel that because we've already decided if there are a thousand names that show up on our table,

2419
03:22:11,752 --> 03:22:12,633
[SPEAKER_21]: they're gonna go through them.

2420
03:22:12,853 --> 03:22:18,177
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a big fan of more people, divide and conquer that work to get it so that they can get through it.

2421
03:22:18,197 --> 03:22:29,946
[SPEAKER_33]: Mayor, can I just, one thing, Paul, I just don't know, and when Kathy can, Principal Kaye can advise us on this.

2422
03:22:30,366 --> 03:22:33,529
[SPEAKER_33]: I just don't know with teachers being at the end of the school year,

2423
03:22:34,329 --> 03:22:35,790
[SPEAKER_33]: and it's such a busy time.

2424
03:22:35,810 --> 03:22:44,577
[SPEAKER_33]: A part of it was I was trying to lessen the obligation, even though I totally understand they may be fully invested or want to be invested.

2425
03:22:45,017 --> 03:22:51,703
[SPEAKER_33]: This is part, you know, this is why I've said from the outset, oh my gosh, I've got a problem with the timeline.

2426
03:22:51,743 --> 03:22:52,563
[SPEAKER_33]: It's really tight.

2427
03:22:52,924 --> 03:22:55,526
[SPEAKER_33]: We're not being able to achieve some of our goals.

2428
03:22:55,906 --> 03:22:59,929
[SPEAKER_33]: So, you know, that's my concern.

2429
03:23:08,191 --> 03:23:08,952
[SPEAKER_40]: Mayor?

2430
03:23:10,095 --> 03:23:11,016
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes, Member Graham?

2431
03:23:12,178 --> 03:23:13,100
[SPEAKER_62]: Can we hear from Ms.

2432
03:23:13,140 --> 03:23:14,663
[SPEAKER_62]: Kaye before I speak?

2433
03:23:16,226 --> 03:23:16,426
[SPEAKER_62]: Ms.

2434
03:23:16,466 --> 03:23:17,247
[SPEAKER_39]: Kaye, yes.

2435
03:23:23,959 --> 03:23:26,001
[SPEAKER_39]: should be able to press unmute, yeah.

2436
03:23:26,561 --> 03:23:27,482
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi everybody, good evening.

2437
03:23:27,743 --> 03:23:30,965
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much for being here and thank you for giving me this opportunity.

2438
03:23:32,187 --> 03:23:37,351
[SPEAKER_29]: I have first a question and then I guess depending on what the answer would be, then a comment.

2439
03:23:38,392 --> 03:23:48,682
[SPEAKER_29]: If in fact as a school, we're gonna work together to come up with some names, would that then negate the students from submitting any names individually

2440
03:23:49,744 --> 03:23:53,985
[SPEAKER_29]: if I understood correctly as part of the process laid out earlier this evening?

2441
03:23:55,585 --> 03:24:00,146
[SPEAKER_41]: That would not negate the students from doing an individual name with their family's help.

2442
03:24:00,226 --> 03:24:01,667
[SPEAKER_41]: No, they could still submit a name.

2443
03:24:02,327 --> 03:24:10,048
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, so that could make a very big difference as to how we would move forward if the students' names will be accounted for anyway.

2444
03:24:10,869 --> 03:24:17,630
[SPEAKER_29]: Are we doing work that maybe we don't need to do as a school because those names will come forward anyway?

2445
03:24:19,466 --> 03:24:34,402
[SPEAKER_29]: And then the other comment would be in that regard, given that we are coming back to school so soon and there's a lot of work to be done with that, having a smaller group of teachers to be on the advisory committee probably would be more palatable.

2446
03:24:38,717 --> 03:24:52,212
[SPEAKER_29]: And then, therefore, we would be part of the team that helps vet and decide on a name, as opposed to coming together as a school and getting the school excited that, yay, we picked a name, and now that name might not be the one that's chosen.

2447
03:24:52,232 --> 03:24:54,735
[SPEAKER_29]: Does that make sense?

2448
03:24:55,976 --> 03:24:56,136
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah.

2449
03:24:57,858 --> 03:24:59,220
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, Mayor.

2450
03:24:59,983 --> 03:25:01,604
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Van de Kloot and then Member Graham.

2451
03:25:02,105 --> 03:25:10,751
[SPEAKER_33]: For me, Principal Kaye, what I really want to be is respectful to the time, the limitations of time that you have.

2452
03:25:11,552 --> 03:25:16,536
[SPEAKER_33]: I wanted to make sure that there was some place where your school was represented.

2453
03:25:16,556 --> 03:25:24,282
[SPEAKER_33]: I personally understand completely that there may, you know, doing a big school project just doesn't necessarily make sense.

2454
03:25:25,903 --> 03:25:27,825
[SPEAKER_33]: unfortunately, right now.

2455
03:25:28,005 --> 03:25:50,264
[SPEAKER_33]: So if you thought that, you know, if it was making everybody aware that they could submit names from your school and making, you know, that maybe would be what's really possible right at this point, making forms available, letting kids know, you know, whatever, that might be just, you know, what's real.

2456
03:25:51,725 --> 03:26:01,032
[SPEAKER_33]: And if the, do you think that, so originally I think it was that you and, you know, there were five members all together.

2457
03:26:01,052 --> 03:26:09,558
[SPEAKER_33]: I suspect strongly there'll be some interest so that you'll be able to have staff members who will want to participate.

2458
03:26:09,838 --> 03:26:10,358
[SPEAKER_33]: Am I correct?

2459
03:26:10,999 --> 03:26:11,879
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, I do think so.

2460
03:26:11,999 --> 03:26:19,945
[SPEAKER_29]: And originally, you know, in my head kind of milling this around, more people was to try and have representation from like the upper

2461
03:26:21,335 --> 03:26:31,000
[SPEAKER_29]: elementary staff and the lower elementary staff so that they could be the representatives for the special education group and the support services, the specialists.

2462
03:26:31,700 --> 03:26:35,142
[SPEAKER_33]: Did you see those though as members of the advisory committee?

2463
03:26:35,502 --> 03:26:46,248
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, that was my original thought, but I think now if we were to certainly educate the students as to why this is moving forward and if they are interested in

2464
03:26:47,088 --> 03:26:51,849
[SPEAKER_29]: putting their names, we could then as a school help the children through that process.

2465
03:26:51,889 --> 03:27:02,012
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that would be something we should do quite strongly for those kids who are interested, make sure that they are able to go through the process and fill out the application.

2466
03:27:03,273 --> 03:27:06,894
[SPEAKER_29]: And then if we had less people on the advisory committee, at least as a school,

2467
03:27:07,987 --> 03:27:23,959
[SPEAKER_29]: we would be able to have those discussions if, in fact, myself and, if it is me, and the two teachers who might be on that, if they could go back and talk to their constituents and be representative of that, then that to me seems like it would be a very fair process for the school input.

2468
03:27:30,163 --> 03:27:30,864
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Kathy.

2469
03:27:32,085 --> 03:27:33,006
[SPEAKER_62]: Are you- Member Graham?

2470
03:27:36,770 --> 03:27:50,196
[SPEAKER_62]: As I was sort of listening and trying to reconcile all of these pieces around the Columbus School's participation, I was sort of thinking through a model where we would let Ms.

2471
03:27:50,256 --> 03:28:04,723
[SPEAKER_62]: Kay move through a process within her building and put forward some number of, we can just call them finalists for the moment, to say that the Columbus School is going to,

2472
03:28:08,411 --> 03:28:12,192
[SPEAKER_62]: work within their building and recommend some number of finalists, like call it four.

2473
03:28:13,072 --> 03:28:21,434
[SPEAKER_62]: And then that the larger advisory committee is, in addition to those four, going to add six more finalists.

2474
03:28:21,474 --> 03:28:31,296
[SPEAKER_62]: So perhaps part of the process is getting from the list of potentially thousands, if we're going down this road of passing everything off to the subcommittee,

2475
03:28:32,020 --> 03:28:53,212
[SPEAKER_62]: maybe their first step is to get to a culled list of finalists before they do the rest of their work, where the finalist list can be published to the community, there can be some excitement about it, but that Miss Kay and the Columbus building could

2476
03:28:54,685 --> 03:29:00,493
[SPEAKER_62]: seed some number of finalist choices to that to that sort of population.

2477
03:29:00,513 --> 03:29:07,282
[SPEAKER_62]: So that was something I was thinking about, I guess for me, knowing how busy the end of the year is.

2478
03:29:09,545 --> 03:29:18,234
[SPEAKER_62]: The school building and the calendar and the schedule sort of operates differently than what I expect the rest of the advisory committee to operate like.

2479
03:29:20,036 --> 03:29:22,878
[SPEAKER_62]: And there may be more flexibility for Ms.

2480
03:29:22,918 --> 03:29:31,127
[SPEAKER_62]: Kay if we give her the latitude to operate in the confines of the school schedule, which is going to be completely different.

2481
03:29:32,356 --> 03:29:34,939
[SPEAKER_62]: then how the advisory committee is going to operate.

2482
03:29:35,039 --> 03:29:50,897
[SPEAKER_62]: So I want to make sure that we are not losing the Columbus's participation due to like schedule issues, which I think is a real possibility if we just ask teachers to

2483
03:29:52,194 --> 03:29:58,138
[SPEAKER_62]: participate in the advisory committee, which is just going to operate on a completely different schedule than their use than they operate on today.

2484
03:29:58,238 --> 03:30:01,640
[SPEAKER_62]: So I feel like it could be a prohibitive amount of time.

2485
03:30:02,181 --> 03:30:16,470
[SPEAKER_62]: If you're a teacher, you're going back to school, you're trying to get your vaccine, you're trying to get MCAS off the ground, you're trying to do the end of the year stuff like to ask them also to meet 567 some number of times with an advisory committee that

2486
03:30:16,910 --> 03:30:28,218
[SPEAKER_62]: is largely going to be made up of people with jobs elsewhere who aren't going to be able to meet at 2.30 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and it's going to be nights and weekends.

2487
03:30:28,698 --> 03:30:31,380
[SPEAKER_62]: I think there may be some value, but I will defer to Ms.

2488
03:30:31,440 --> 03:30:43,449
[SPEAKER_62]: Kay of putting a structure in place that gives her some autonomy to recommend finalists and makes that a feature of the advisory committee that the very first step is a list of finalists.

2489
03:30:44,994 --> 03:30:45,794
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Member Graham.

2490
03:30:45,834 --> 03:30:48,396
[SPEAKER_41]: And we also have Dr. Edward Benson who'd like to comment.

2491
03:30:49,456 --> 03:30:54,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I just wanted to comment in regards to what Dr. Kay just shared.

2492
03:30:55,939 --> 03:30:59,281
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be in support of her recommendation.

2493
03:31:01,402 --> 03:31:11,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I think with the school name being changed, I would like to see the involvement of Dr. Kay and maybe two members of her staff

2494
03:31:13,388 --> 03:31:27,272
[SPEAKER_11]: So even if there is some kind of smaller group that would be school based, I think that it would be in their best interest to be able to be actively involved in the advisory process.

2495
03:31:28,012 --> 03:31:36,695
[SPEAKER_11]: And so to give Dr. K some flexibility with her staff in terms of who would be willing to make

2496
03:31:37,996 --> 03:31:40,541
[SPEAKER_11]: the commitment to the meetings that are going to happen.

2497
03:31:41,362 --> 03:31:49,877
[SPEAKER_11]: They are currently at the building and I just feel that it's critically important that they are actively involved in the process.

2498
03:31:50,458 --> 03:31:50,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2499
03:31:55,384 --> 03:31:56,524
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

2500
03:31:56,945 --> 03:31:57,085
[SPEAKER_29]: Ms.

2501
03:31:57,105 --> 03:31:57,345
[SPEAKER_29]: Kay.

2502
03:31:58,045 --> 03:31:59,946
[SPEAKER_29]: Mayor, I just wanted to add one thing.

2503
03:32:01,226 --> 03:32:24,236
[SPEAKER_29]: Listening to everything that's being discussed this evening and going through a process, I just wanna voice a little tiny concern that I have inside, well, one of many, but if in fact we as a school submitted some names and then there were other names that came from wherever, be they children at my school through a different venue,

2504
03:32:25,686 --> 03:32:36,278
[SPEAKER_29]: I would fear that it might be taken that we didn't take the work we did in the school seriously if we were to submit a certain number of names to the advisory committee.

2505
03:32:37,219 --> 03:32:37,900
[SPEAKER_29]: Does that make sense?

2506
03:32:39,147 --> 03:32:40,287
[SPEAKER_33]: So Dr. Kaye?

2507
03:32:40,908 --> 03:32:41,108
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

2508
03:32:41,668 --> 03:32:49,711
[SPEAKER_33]: Are you saying that it would be better for the school not to submit names specifically from the school?

2509
03:32:50,751 --> 03:33:03,496
[SPEAKER_29]: I am thinking that maybe if we want it really to be a transparent and a genuine process that any single child from the Columbus, if they wanted to submit a name and we're saying we're taking names from everybody,

2510
03:33:04,554 --> 03:33:08,076
[SPEAKER_29]: and that might be a more fair, a less.

2511
03:33:09,877 --> 03:33:26,967
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, so if you look at the paragraph that I wrote, which is on the screen, if we take away in the first large paragraph, if we take away the last sentence, the goal of both the staff and student input is to come up with three to five names.

2512
03:33:27,547 --> 03:33:28,528
[SPEAKER_33]: If we just take that out,

2513
03:33:30,310 --> 03:33:43,750
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, remove that, then you have in recognition that the staff and students of the Columbus school are dedicated to their school, the school committee requests the principal to create a representative group of staff to solicit input from their colleagues oh um.

2514
03:33:45,905 --> 03:33:47,306
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, no, okay, that doesn't work.

2515
03:33:49,707 --> 03:33:57,052
[SPEAKER_29]: But it could in that we're going to be encouraging the students as teachers to be involved.

2516
03:33:57,612 --> 03:33:57,892
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

2517
03:33:58,452 --> 03:34:09,579
[SPEAKER_29]: And we would have whatever form it is the committee decides to use for submission, the teachers can help support the children as a class or as an individual to then submit those applications.

2518
03:34:10,219 --> 03:34:13,762
[SPEAKER_29]: And then if we had representation, whether it be two or three or four,

2519
03:34:14,742 --> 03:34:25,625
[SPEAKER_29]: from the Columbus School on the advisory committee, then we're involved in the process and then everybody's name has the equitable likelihood of being chosen.

2520
03:34:25,645 --> 03:34:26,145
[SPEAKER_33]: Right.

2521
03:34:26,526 --> 03:34:30,567
[SPEAKER_33]: So my next sentence is, additionally, student input is highly desirable.

2522
03:34:31,007 --> 03:34:39,369
[SPEAKER_33]: And if it is feasible, student participation will be encouraged in any way the principal deems to be workable in this very short period of time.

2523
03:34:40,330 --> 03:34:41,350
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, that would work for me.

2524
03:34:41,823 --> 03:34:52,748
[SPEAKER_33]: And then the last sentence to that paragraph is further the principal of the Columbus or her designee, as well as two staff members selected by their peers or appointed by the principal.

2525
03:34:52,828 --> 03:34:55,129
[SPEAKER_33]: And I have a question mark there because I don't know which is better.

2526
03:34:55,670 --> 03:35:03,793
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know whether you prefer to say that you'll appoint them or whether you say, oh yeah, doing a vote is the better way.

2527
03:35:06,349 --> 03:35:12,793
[SPEAKER_29]: I would love for it if it could go for a vote and then the people who are really interested are the ones who the staff would then choose.

2528
03:35:13,233 --> 03:35:13,453
[SPEAKER_33]: Great.

2529
03:35:14,114 --> 03:35:15,875
[SPEAKER_33]: So we'll take about that.

2530
03:35:19,297 --> 03:35:24,560
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's like a fair process to me as well from the teacher representation point.

2531
03:35:25,080 --> 03:35:25,280
[SPEAKER_33]: Right.

2532
03:35:25,821 --> 03:35:27,602
[SPEAKER_33]: So thank you.

2533
03:35:28,342 --> 03:35:33,025
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, again, that's what I'm kind of suggesting to working through from what I heard Jenny say and whatever.

2534
03:35:33,485 --> 03:35:35,066
[SPEAKER_33]: Jenny, does that meet your?

2535
03:35:37,318 --> 03:35:49,231
[SPEAKER_62]: Yeah, I just want to make sure that we don't make it so hard for the Columbus teachers and community to participate in the advisory committee that they don't.

2536
03:35:49,872 --> 03:35:52,715
[SPEAKER_62]: And then we have sort of left that voice out.

2537
03:35:53,191 --> 03:36:04,041
[SPEAKER_62]: Yeah, so that I think, Dr. Kaye, if you feel like there will be volunteers and excitement to do this work, I am totally comfortable with that.

2538
03:36:04,161 --> 03:36:15,311
[SPEAKER_62]: I just don't want it ever to be said that this committee did not value the input and thought leadership of the community at the Columbus School.

2539
03:36:16,232 --> 03:36:19,075
[SPEAKER_62]: So I just wanna make sure you're comfortable that this will work for you.

2540
03:36:20,505 --> 03:36:28,029
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I am certainly committed, and I hope that we will have teachers who would be interested in being on this committee as well.

2541
03:36:29,830 --> 03:36:35,273
[SPEAKER_33]: Do you think there should be more than the three representatives, or do you think that's a realistic number?

2542
03:36:37,835 --> 03:36:44,698
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, it's hard to tell because I don't know how many other committee members you have tossed around that you'd like to have involved.

2543
03:36:45,619 --> 03:36:49,461
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, it would be nice to have a teacher representation, a specialist representation,

2544
03:36:50,182 --> 03:36:54,643
[SPEAKER_29]: perhaps the supports of providers, as well as an administrator.

2545
03:36:55,404 --> 03:36:56,544
[SPEAKER_29]: So that would make four.

2546
03:36:58,865 --> 03:37:05,347
[SPEAKER_29]: But if that then makes the advisory committee too large, I certainly see the value in not having as many as well.

2547
03:37:05,887 --> 03:37:14,689
[SPEAKER_33]: So why don't we just put the principal and as well as two to four staff members, and we can come back to that piece after we figure out the other members of the committee.

2548
03:37:15,830 --> 03:37:16,470
[SPEAKER_33]: That works for me.

2549
03:37:17,970 --> 03:37:19,071
[SPEAKER_29]: Dr. Edward Vincent, how about you?

2550
03:37:19,091 --> 03:37:19,871
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you think that's fair too?

2551
03:37:22,270 --> 03:37:24,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'd be comfortable with two to four members.

2552
03:37:25,211 --> 03:37:27,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what the total number is going to be.

2553
03:37:27,332 --> 03:37:31,114
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, we can revisit it if it's too large.

2554
03:37:31,594 --> 03:37:31,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2555
03:37:36,336 --> 03:37:38,097
[SPEAKER_29]: Kathy, we appreciate you being here tonight.

2556
03:37:38,697 --> 03:37:40,157
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, and I appreciate everyone being here too.

2557
03:37:40,197 --> 03:37:41,478
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much for the support.

2558
03:38:04,639 --> 03:38:20,126
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, so by April 16, 2021, a Medford High School student who attended the Columbus School is a member of the CCSR and who is able to make the time commitment will be selected by his, her, their peers to be a member of the advisory committee.

2559
03:38:22,127 --> 03:38:28,870
[SPEAKER_41]: So make it a little bit more broad so that, I mean, what if we have a great student that is not part of CCSR?

2560
03:38:29,400 --> 03:38:32,202
[SPEAKER_33]: You can take off the CCC.

2561
03:38:33,003 --> 03:38:38,728
[SPEAKER_33]: I use that only because it was an easy way for students to be elected by their peers.

2562
03:38:39,388 --> 03:38:42,411
[SPEAKER_33]: And so that's why I limited it that way.

2563
03:38:42,711 --> 03:38:49,777
[SPEAKER_33]: And also because I know that they're a service organization interested in community participation.

2564
03:38:51,719 --> 03:39:03,588
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, I'm just throwing out some of these things by saying there is having a high school student rep on any committee that we have is, I think, an appropriate thing to have.

2565
03:39:03,868 --> 03:39:07,892
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm absolutely fine with however people want to amend it.

2566
03:39:08,652 --> 03:39:11,074
[SPEAKER_41]: I think you could leave it in, but you could say preferably.

2567
03:39:11,154 --> 03:39:19,381
[SPEAKER_41]: So a Medford High School student, preferably one who attended Columbus School and or is a member of CCSR.

2568
03:39:23,890 --> 03:39:32,854
[SPEAKER_62]: I think when I read this what I liked about it was that we are like again under the umbrella of

2569
03:39:34,169 --> 03:39:36,812
[SPEAKER_62]: making sure our Columbus school community is involved.

2570
03:39:37,472 --> 03:39:53,526
[SPEAKER_62]: I do, like, I think we shouldn't shy away from having additional members of the high school on the committee, but I would like to see us ensure that there is a member of the Columbus community that is currently in high school that can participate in this.

2571
03:39:55,427 --> 03:40:01,853
[SPEAKER_41]: My concern is with the timeline that is being suggested to fulfill every single

2572
03:40:03,319 --> 03:40:28,356
[SPEAKER_33]: slot that we want to may take a lot more time than, I mean, maybe there's a lot more interest than... So Mayor, that's why I designated the CCSR because they have, you know, meetings and they have, you know, it's just organizationally, it's a really easy way that kids can get together and vote and say who's from Columbus, who's interested.

2573
03:40:29,517 --> 03:40:37,579
[SPEAKER_41]: That's assuming you're gonna have more than one person interested that even fits that non-broad category.

2574
03:40:38,340 --> 03:40:50,163
[SPEAKER_41]: That's my concern that we'll get to the last day and we say, we're supposed to have a committee today, but we have three slots that aren't filled by the exact specifications listed in the policy we set.

2575
03:40:50,963 --> 03:40:52,884
[SPEAKER_41]: So that's a concern of mine.

2576
03:40:53,701 --> 03:40:57,964
[SPEAKER_41]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Staff Members Meeting, Page 2 of 13

2577
03:41:20,308 --> 03:41:21,429
[SPEAKER_41]: Miss Kay, would you like to speak?

2578
03:41:21,569 --> 03:41:25,792
[SPEAKER_41]: And before you speak, I cannot see Member Rousseau, Member McLaughlin, or Member Kretz.

2579
03:41:25,832 --> 03:41:30,315
[SPEAKER_41]: So if you'd like to speak and chime in, please just- Member Kretz has had her hand up, Mayor.

2580
03:41:30,835 --> 03:41:32,316
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, yeah, I can't see everybody.

2581
03:41:32,996 --> 03:41:34,097
[SPEAKER_41]: So please just chime in.

2582
03:41:35,518 --> 03:41:35,858
[SPEAKER_41]: Miss Kay.

2583
03:41:36,759 --> 03:41:39,961
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so I just wanted to ask- Actually, Member Kretz has had her hand up, Mayor.

2584
03:41:40,041 --> 03:41:41,162
[SPEAKER_37]: Sorry, point of privilege.

2585
03:41:41,862 --> 03:41:44,964
[SPEAKER_37]: She's had her hand up and she just unmuted and tried to start talking, excuse me.

2586
03:41:45,945 --> 03:41:47,766
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Kretz then, Miss Kay, if you don't mind.

2587
03:41:48,286 --> 03:41:48,626
[SPEAKER_37]: Not at all.

2588
03:41:49,307 --> 03:41:49,567
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

2589
03:41:50,731 --> 03:41:51,891
[SPEAKER_37]: Kathy, we can't hear you.

2590
03:41:51,911 --> 03:41:59,332
[SPEAKER_06]: She is unmuted.

2591
03:42:03,673 --> 03:42:06,554
[SPEAKER_37]: She should be able to unmute herself, member Kretz.

2592
03:42:06,994 --> 03:42:08,814
[SPEAKER_37]: She's unmuted, but we can't hear her.

2593
03:42:08,854 --> 03:42:10,274
[SPEAKER_37]: There's no, there's no.

2594
03:42:16,675 --> 03:42:19,436
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Kretz, if you press the little arrow next to the mute button,

2595
03:42:21,598 --> 03:42:27,084
[SPEAKER_41]: It says test speaker and microphone sometimes, and then you hit yes if you can hear it.

2596
03:42:27,264 --> 03:42:29,947
[SPEAKER_41]: Sometimes that happens on my work computer.

2597
03:42:33,571 --> 03:42:36,574
[SPEAKER_41]: You can also change the option in there and that sometimes.

2598
03:43:10,990 --> 03:43:19,015
[SPEAKER_33]: Member Graham, while they're trying to figure that out, bullet one and two essentially are the same and need to be condensed.

2599
03:43:28,262 --> 03:43:29,943
[SPEAKER_41]: Why don't we allow Ms.

2600
03:43:29,983 --> 03:43:33,986
[SPEAKER_41]: Kaye, if you could make your comment while Member Kratz tries to unmute.

2601
03:43:34,486 --> 03:43:34,746
[SPEAKER_41]: Sure.

2602
03:43:35,627 --> 03:43:37,188
[SPEAKER_29]: I just wanted to ask for clarity

2603
03:43:38,109 --> 03:43:41,411
[SPEAKER_29]: let's say there are three people from the Columbus who are on the advisory committee.

2604
03:43:42,351 --> 03:43:55,779
[SPEAKER_29]: Are they like sworn to secrecy or are they allowed to come back to the Columbus to speak to the other constituents and staff to sort of get input for them and then be representative of more people without having the people actually on the committee?

2605
03:43:58,940 --> 03:44:06,825
[SPEAKER_62]: Elsewhere in this document, we talk about all the meetings being posted via compliance with the open meeting law.

2606
03:44:08,001 --> 03:44:13,802
[SPEAKER_62]: there would, if that carries, there would be no concern about that discussion happening.

2607
03:44:14,383 --> 03:44:14,583
[SPEAKER_62]: Okay.

2608
03:44:14,863 --> 03:44:18,584
[SPEAKER_29]: So they could then, you know, talk to the teachers at school and they get, Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

2609
03:44:18,604 --> 03:44:19,464
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm bringing it back forward.

2610
03:44:19,504 --> 03:44:21,324
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's good to know.

2611
03:44:21,364 --> 03:44:28,526
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that, that, that allows more people to have a voice as well, I think, without having so many people actually in the room.

2612
03:44:34,979 --> 03:44:38,992
[SPEAKER_46]: Hi, can you hear me because it is work I can hear it on my test.

2613
03:44:39,915 --> 03:44:40,856
[SPEAKER_46]: We can hear you now.

2614
03:44:40,876 --> 03:44:42,197
[SPEAKER_46]: We're back.

2615
03:44:42,837 --> 03:44:44,018
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, all right.

2616
03:44:44,118 --> 03:44:49,982
[SPEAKER_46]: So I had, when Paulette had shared her resolution, I reached out to Ms.

2617
03:44:50,002 --> 03:44:56,747
[SPEAKER_46]: Van de Kloot to just let her know that I felt the same way, that I don't think it should be exclusive to the CCSR.

2618
03:44:56,767 --> 03:44:59,488
[SPEAKER_46]: I think it should be open to high school students.

2619
03:45:00,229 --> 03:45:08,455
[SPEAKER_46]: And I felt the same way, and possibly maybe a backup student, whereas we do have two,

2620
03:45:09,535 --> 03:45:14,560
[SPEAKER_46]: high school students that serve on our committee and they take turns.

2621
03:45:15,101 --> 03:45:26,853
[SPEAKER_46]: So what if, because where it is high school and it's the end of the year and there's finals and things like that, it might be busy with the schedules that they might have.

2622
03:45:26,893 --> 03:45:30,816
[SPEAKER_46]: So I feel like it might, even if we picked two students,

2623
03:45:31,957 --> 03:45:42,243
[SPEAKER_46]: they might not be able to make all the meetings, but they might, you know, one of them might be able to make a meeting and they could, you know, kind of like go back and forth or come up with a schedule that works for both of them.

2624
03:45:47,526 --> 03:45:48,766
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, thank you.

2625
03:45:49,407 --> 03:45:49,707
[SPEAKER_39]: Thanks.

2626
03:45:53,189 --> 03:45:53,449
[SPEAKER_39]: Mayor.

2627
03:45:54,069 --> 03:45:54,549
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry.

2628
03:45:54,569 --> 03:45:55,390
[SPEAKER_39]: Member Russo.

2629
03:45:56,390 --> 03:45:56,711
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2630
03:45:56,751 --> 03:45:57,371
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never

2631
03:45:58,112 --> 03:45:58,853
[SPEAKER_21]: sure if you can see me.

2632
03:45:58,893 --> 03:46:00,334
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's why I spoke apologies.

2633
03:46:00,935 --> 03:46:05,459
[SPEAKER_21]: We could just change language to up to four and then not have to keep revisiting it.

2634
03:46:07,300 --> 03:46:15,187
[SPEAKER_21]: And any of these things where we're concerned that there will not be enough where we are not actually doing the selecting I think solves the problem.

2635
03:46:16,869 --> 03:46:22,414
[SPEAKER_21]: I certainly don't want us to be in a situation where we have all agreed hardcore on a single detail.

2636
03:46:23,331 --> 03:46:25,893
[SPEAKER_21]: And then at the end of the day, we can't comply with it.

2637
03:46:25,933 --> 03:46:28,554
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we're all stuck wondering, well, what does that mean?

2638
03:46:29,134 --> 03:46:31,516
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's my recommendation.

2639
03:46:32,296 --> 03:46:50,367
[SPEAKER_21]: As for the student representatives, I certainly, for the CCSR, the exact same logic that I think member Vander Kloot used about, you know, there's a group, there's somebody to talk to and ask about, you know, we have to run a full-blown student government.

2640
03:46:51,334 --> 03:46:52,835
[SPEAKER_21]: election to accomplish this.

2641
03:46:52,915 --> 03:47:00,481
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm guessing that Mr. Skorka or whoever could, you know, email the whole group and probably have an answer to this in very short order.

2642
03:47:01,201 --> 03:47:08,646
[SPEAKER_21]: I do think alternates and people not being the person is problematic.

2643
03:47:09,447 --> 03:47:14,651
[SPEAKER_21]: Missing out on, you know, it'd be like as if there was school committee members who swapped in for each other.

2644
03:47:15,031 --> 03:47:17,233
[SPEAKER_21]: It would make the conversations very difficult to,

2645
03:47:19,862 --> 03:47:21,163
[SPEAKER_21]: to maintain continuity.

2646
03:47:21,403 --> 03:47:28,605
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would certainly be opposed to having alternates or having two people where one attends one meeting and one attends the other.

2647
03:47:34,407 --> 03:47:34,747
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2648
03:47:34,767 --> 03:47:45,730
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, let's go through one more section.

2649
03:47:45,750 --> 03:47:48,191
[SPEAKER_41]: And then I know there's hands up

2650
03:47:49,753 --> 03:48:05,357
[SPEAKER_41]: from the community, so let's... Okay, on April 26th, 2021, a committee of the whole be held to select and confirm the 15 voting members and one ex officio member as follows.

2651
03:48:06,217 --> 03:48:09,478
[SPEAKER_41]: So the question is, is 15 a good number for everybody?

2652
03:48:09,558 --> 03:48:10,958
[SPEAKER_41]: Can we agree on that?

2653
03:48:11,616 --> 03:48:18,540
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, why don't we put, let's work through each of the lines and then figure out how many it comes up to, okay?

2654
03:48:19,541 --> 03:48:30,788
[SPEAKER_33]: The number one said the up to four names are, so it says the two names selected from the Columbus School and Principal Kathy Kay.

2655
03:48:32,148 --> 03:48:33,950
[SPEAKER_33]: So we had put the up to four.

2656
03:48:38,280 --> 03:48:42,946
[SPEAKER_33]: individuals selected from the, it should say up to four individuals, not names, sorry.

2657
03:48:47,131 --> 03:48:48,252
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you for doing this, Jenny.

2658
03:48:49,493 --> 03:48:49,974
[SPEAKER_33]: No problem.

2659
03:49:02,358 --> 03:49:12,247
[SPEAKER_33]: So on number two, it says each school committee member will select a member of the advisory committee from the valid applications received and will state the names publicly.

2660
03:49:14,024 --> 03:49:23,032
[SPEAKER_33]: In the event that an application is selected by more than one school committee member, the members will continue to name applicants until a total of seven advisory committee members have been named.

2661
03:49:23,612 --> 03:49:27,215
[SPEAKER_33]: Now that was a member Russo had done it.

2662
03:49:27,515 --> 03:49:30,638
[SPEAKER_33]: He had suggested that every school committee select two.

2663
03:49:31,679 --> 03:49:35,062
[SPEAKER_33]: That put together a committee of 14 already.

2664
03:49:35,542 --> 03:49:37,644
[SPEAKER_33]: I was concerned about the overall size.

2665
03:49:38,465 --> 03:49:40,587
[SPEAKER_33]: The process is the same that we each name

2666
03:49:41,247 --> 03:49:49,751
[SPEAKER_33]: One, so we can look once we sort of figure out the total number of people, we can decide whether it should be one person or two people.

2667
03:49:54,313 --> 03:49:56,994
[SPEAKER_33]: The next thought to any thought to allow.

2668
03:49:57,054 --> 03:49:57,694
[SPEAKER_46]: I have a question.

2669
03:49:59,605 --> 03:49:59,825
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2670
03:50:00,306 --> 03:50:14,557
[SPEAKER_46]: So, I, I actually think that, you know, we should really amend this to be more of like number two specifically, and we're at the end, you know, having a lottery selection.

2671
03:50:14,577 --> 03:50:16,478
[SPEAKER_46]: I feel that, you know,

2672
03:50:17,719 --> 03:50:21,340
[SPEAKER_46]: we shouldn't be involved in selecting the applicants.

2673
03:50:22,200 --> 03:50:38,566
[SPEAKER_46]: It should those applicants in that section there with the other section at the end should be done via the lottery system where when the applications are sent in there would be a box where somebody could check off

2674
03:50:39,286 --> 03:50:51,199
[SPEAKER_46]: the Racial Equity Task Force, South Memphis Community, Memphis Historian or Historical Society, CPAC, Italian Alliance, Italian American.

2675
03:50:51,600 --> 03:50:52,561
[SPEAKER_46]: So I feel like

2676
03:50:54,005 --> 03:51:04,870
[SPEAKER_46]: you know, the lottery is the most equitable process where it's not going to be a human, you know, looking at that application.

2677
03:51:04,970 --> 03:51:10,672
[SPEAKER_46]: There could be room for bias making those selections, you know, to that advisory committee.

2678
03:51:11,012 --> 03:51:14,294
[SPEAKER_46]: So I just, I felt as though there needs to be

2679
03:51:15,134 --> 03:51:43,542
[SPEAKER_46]: a larger number for the lottery selection and in order to do that we would you know have to remove the school committee making a selection for the applicants similar to what we do for the middle school lottery selection where um where the students are put into a lottery and it's it's selected you know via the lottery selection process i think that's worth um

2680
03:51:44,258 --> 03:51:48,399
[SPEAKER_41]: discussing, I too have concerns about each of us picking two people.

2681
03:51:48,419 --> 03:52:01,284
[SPEAKER_41]: And I'm questioning if it should be someone from, I'm sorry, but somebody from our administration to do it, to make sure it's a diverse group of whatever that may be, 13, 15, 21 people.

2682
03:52:02,304 --> 03:52:05,285
[SPEAKER_41]: So that's just a thought I wanted to throw out there.

2683
03:52:05,305 --> 03:52:06,065
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Russo?

2684
03:52:07,426 --> 03:52:08,126
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor.

2685
03:52:08,206 --> 03:52:11,527
[SPEAKER_21]: You bring up a very important point that I also have concerns about.

2686
03:52:12,597 --> 03:52:17,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Our current policy, however, is explicit that we must select the members.

2687
03:52:18,122 --> 03:52:19,983
[SPEAKER_21]: The word is select is in the policy.

2688
03:52:20,484 --> 03:52:22,826
[SPEAKER_21]: So a lottery to me is a violation of our policy.

2689
03:52:24,908 --> 03:52:35,657
[SPEAKER_21]: Achieving a advisory committee that in fact is representative of the community, I think based on our current policy is only gonna happen if we actually select them.

2690
03:52:37,094 --> 03:52:48,543
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, it's not, I think we need to look to other communities and amend this policy and do some work to figure out how on earth do communities do exactly what I think we are all saying we want.

2691
03:52:49,024 --> 03:52:50,745
[SPEAKER_21]: But our current policy is explicit.

2692
03:52:50,865 --> 03:52:56,049
[SPEAKER_21]: We must, we, the members, must select the members of the advisory committee.

2693
03:52:56,310 --> 03:52:57,551
[SPEAKER_21]: A lottery is not a selection.

2694
03:52:58,671 --> 03:53:01,714
[SPEAKER_21]: I also have grave concerns about a lottery

2695
03:53:03,339 --> 03:53:09,702
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I think that when we're looking through the applicants, I'm looking for people who are making it crystal clear, they want to do the work.

2696
03:53:10,863 --> 03:53:14,044
[SPEAKER_21]: A lottery could be anybody who just throws their name in.

2697
03:53:14,345 --> 03:53:21,528
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't believe that we're only going to have applicants that are good actors, that are interested in doing the work and finding a new name.

2698
03:53:22,369 --> 03:53:27,731
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we have to build this to defend against disruption.

2699
03:53:29,912 --> 03:53:33,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Otherwise, this advisory committee is gonna either fall apart

2700
03:53:33,820 --> 03:53:38,342
[SPEAKER_21]: or at the end of the day, they're gonna come back to us and say, we couldn't do it, not possible, here's why.

2701
03:53:38,362 --> 03:53:44,165
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't know if anybody here wants to continue doing this for a whole nother year, but I certainly don't.

2702
03:53:44,825 --> 03:53:48,587
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would literally vote against the entire resolution.

2703
03:53:49,187 --> 03:53:54,249
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also think it's a violation of our policy to have a lottery.

2704
03:53:56,370 --> 03:53:56,830
[SPEAKER_33]: So mayor.

2705
03:53:58,891 --> 03:54:00,292
[SPEAKER_40]: Member van der Klook.

2706
03:54:00,874 --> 03:54:09,396
[SPEAKER_33]: So again, I have two different committee members who have very different feelings about this.

2707
03:54:12,217 --> 03:54:20,379
[SPEAKER_33]: One wants each of us to pick two, and one wants everything to be done by lottery.

2708
03:54:21,019 --> 03:54:23,860
[SPEAKER_33]: I was looking for a middle road because I

2709
03:54:27,905 --> 03:54:32,169
[SPEAKER_33]: The and to me the middle road and was do three by lottery.

2710
03:54:32,209 --> 03:54:34,531
[SPEAKER_33]: So there was some totally random piece.

2711
03:54:35,051 --> 03:54:44,359
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, and And then do have each of the committee members pick one To be honest with you.

2712
03:54:44,380 --> 03:54:47,302
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm very open to whatever the majority of the committee wants to do.

2713
03:54:48,143 --> 03:54:49,664
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not stuck on any of this.

2714
03:54:49,824 --> 03:54:50,505
[SPEAKER_33]: I just wanted to

2715
03:54:51,045 --> 03:54:57,748
[SPEAKER_33]: explain where I was coming from and knowing Kathy had already said to me, I think everybody should be by lottery.

2716
03:54:57,788 --> 03:54:59,109
[SPEAKER_33]: And I knew what Paul said.

2717
03:54:59,569 --> 03:55:03,391
[SPEAKER_33]: So I was trying to bring everything together to a middle place.

2718
03:55:03,811 --> 03:55:11,295
[SPEAKER_33]: I personally believe that when it says select, if we decide that part of that selection should be by lottery, I'm not uncomfortable with it.

2719
03:55:12,095 --> 03:55:17,778
[SPEAKER_33]: But clearly I didn't say we should select the whole committee to try and bring people together.

2720
03:55:23,700 --> 03:55:24,040
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2721
03:55:24,060 --> 03:55:30,646
[SPEAKER_33]: Paul, can you go along with any piece of the, can you go along with three lotteries?

2722
03:55:31,987 --> 03:55:36,731
[SPEAKER_21]: I cannot go along with any lottery, but I mean, I don't, I'm not, you know, it's not a dictatorship.

2723
03:55:36,851 --> 03:55:47,800
[SPEAKER_21]: As I mentioned earlier in my moment of losing control, I don't have to be in the majority and I can lose the vote, but I think a lottery is setting ourselves up for failure.

2724
03:55:47,940 --> 03:55:52,884
[SPEAKER_21]: And I do think that's not a very nice thing to do to the people that are going to volunteer their time.

2725
03:55:54,128 --> 03:55:55,709
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I think I see other hands up.

2726
03:55:56,269 --> 03:55:58,349
[SPEAKER_33]: I think I'm looking to bring people together.

2727
03:55:58,449 --> 03:56:00,430
[SPEAKER_33]: So Mm.

2728
03:56:03,711 --> 03:56:04,191
[SPEAKER_33]: Member Graham.

2729
03:56:08,333 --> 03:56:11,374
[SPEAKER_62]: Um I do think we need to

2730
03:56:21,027 --> 03:56:29,852
[SPEAKER_62]: totally torpedo this process, because that will be the very definition of not bringing people together.

2731
03:56:30,072 --> 03:56:49,044
[SPEAKER_62]: So we need to take active measure to ensure that we are putting people on the committee who not only want to do the work, but are committed to moving the school community forward.

2732
03:56:52,366 --> 03:56:58,691
[SPEAKER_62]: I do believe that we need to select people to do that.

2733
03:57:00,873 --> 03:57:14,945
[SPEAKER_62]: I don't think we can leave that to chance because the lottery, literally you can be completely against the name change and submit an application, which is fine.

2734
03:57:15,859 --> 03:57:24,464
[SPEAKER_62]: But if the lottery produces an entire group of people who are there to oppose the name change, the committee will not be able to move forward.

2735
03:57:25,005 --> 03:57:29,387
[SPEAKER_62]: And that is not actually helping us accomplish the work that we're doing.

2736
03:57:29,487 --> 03:57:41,035
[SPEAKER_62]: So I have major hesitations about the lottery, but I don't mind the notion of a small number of people

2737
03:57:42,601 --> 03:57:43,722
[SPEAKER_62]: being picked by lottery.

2738
03:57:43,742 --> 03:58:03,374
[SPEAKER_62]: I would be fine with three, but I also think the committee needs to each pick two because we have put all of the work of reviewing and vetting names on the committee and it will be a considerable amount of work.

2739
03:58:03,454 --> 03:58:05,276
[SPEAKER_62]: So I think the committee should

2740
03:58:06,457 --> 03:58:15,381
[SPEAKER_62]: I think the school committee should each select two, and I think there should be three additional names pulled via lottery.

2741
03:58:15,401 --> 03:58:21,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor?

2742
03:58:21,983 --> 03:58:22,603
[SPEAKER_40]: Member Rousseau?

2743
03:58:23,884 --> 03:58:27,105
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually, I'll walk back that I would not agree to this.

2744
03:58:27,205 --> 03:58:33,047
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just, if we could add language where the chair and,

2745
03:58:34,876 --> 03:58:47,300
[SPEAKER_21]: I think if we can add some kind of a language where somebody who has been selected by us or the lottery is not being a good faith actor in the effort, that they can be removed.

2746
03:58:49,261 --> 03:58:56,924
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's just not fair to ask people to volunteer, come to a meeting and have somebody who spends the entire time trying to make sure that it can't happen.

2747
03:58:56,944 --> 03:59:00,265
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, what kind of a, that's just horrible.

2748
03:59:00,485 --> 03:59:02,346
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that's sort of like running for office.

2749
03:59:04,147 --> 03:59:06,129
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, it just doesn't make sense.

2750
03:59:06,389 --> 03:59:15,938
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we could add something where there is an out, and I think we need to be careful, because I'm not interested in an out where people can be kicked off because they're just disagreeing.

2751
03:59:16,579 --> 03:59:18,400
[SPEAKER_21]: That's definitely not my goal here.

2752
03:59:19,661 --> 03:59:28,810
[SPEAKER_21]: But some language where the chair has the authority, maybe with consultation of, you know, a majority of the members,

2753
03:59:30,586 --> 03:59:35,229
[SPEAKER_21]: of the advisory committee can decide to remove somebody for bad faith effort.

2754
03:59:36,210 --> 03:59:38,331
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know what language sounds good.

2755
03:59:39,632 --> 03:59:43,414
[SPEAKER_41]: What about allowing the admin to fully vet and pick the committee?

2756
03:59:45,855 --> 03:59:47,216
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a violation of our policy.

2757
03:59:47,777 --> 03:59:48,957
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, but so isn't a lottery.

2758
03:59:51,559 --> 03:59:55,401
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, the language in the policy is, I have it right here.

2759
03:59:59,389 --> 04:00:02,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Appointments to such committees will be made by the committee.

2760
04:00:06,035 --> 04:00:08,216
[SPEAKER_21]: So I said that the word select was in there and I was wrong.

2761
04:00:09,257 --> 04:00:10,578
[SPEAKER_21]: I brought it up after I said that.

2762
04:00:11,119 --> 04:00:15,262
[SPEAKER_21]: So, but it is by the committee.

2763
04:00:15,622 --> 04:00:21,968
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we also could go back by the way, and each of us could just do our own personal lottery of all of the names.

2764
04:00:22,068 --> 04:00:28,313
[SPEAKER_21]: So there isn't a chance if any member is totally uncomfortable with the notion of picking members, well then just,

2765
04:00:29,704 --> 04:00:32,086
[SPEAKER_21]: throw them up in the air and pick the first two that you grab.

2766
04:00:32,146 --> 04:00:35,308
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you know, there's other ways to accomplish that.

2767
04:00:35,428 --> 04:00:52,159
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think that putting it on the admin or has historically happened in Medford, putting it on the mayor or her office, those are not valid ways and they're a violation of our policy that I think, you know, if this was a rule, we could suspend the rules.

2768
04:00:52,319 --> 04:00:54,001
[SPEAKER_21]: This is not a rule, this is a policy.

2769
04:00:54,401 --> 04:00:55,882
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't just suspend the policy.

2770
04:00:56,042 --> 04:00:59,044
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't wanna delay while we consider rewriting the policy.

2771
04:01:00,819 --> 04:01:03,681
[SPEAKER_41]: The lottery is not part of our policy, so that's where it's.

2772
04:01:04,722 --> 04:01:06,222
[SPEAKER_62]: And we can just remove it.

2773
04:01:06,243 --> 04:01:07,924
[SPEAKER_62]: It's fine.

2774
04:01:09,284 --> 04:01:16,969
[SPEAKER_41]: But I think the administration, not that I want to put anything on the administration, but should be responsible for picking this committee.

2775
04:01:19,231 --> 04:01:21,032
[SPEAKER_33]: How does the administration feel about that?

2776
04:01:24,494 --> 04:01:30,218
[SPEAKER_41]: Need to make sure this is a diverse committee, and I'm not sure how we do that if we're each picking two members.

2777
04:01:33,430 --> 04:01:36,817
[SPEAKER_62]: Aren't we all capable of looking out for that if that is important to us?

2778
04:01:39,202 --> 04:01:39,463
[SPEAKER_62]: I am.

2779
04:01:39,483 --> 04:01:41,367
[SPEAKER_27]: I am.

2780
04:01:45,799 --> 04:01:47,500
[SPEAKER_46]: I would just like to make a point of information.

2781
04:01:48,301 --> 04:01:54,905
[SPEAKER_46]: There is still potential room for some bias in the process.

2782
04:01:54,925 --> 04:02:05,912
[SPEAKER_46]: In order to make it equitable, I feel as though removing the school committee from the process is the most equitable way to ensure it's a diverse committee.

2783
04:02:06,253 --> 04:02:09,174
[SPEAKER_46]: So if it's not going to be done via the lottery, there has to be

2784
04:02:11,576 --> 04:02:16,380
[SPEAKER_46]: Somebody that's overseeing or ensuring that it's a diverse committee.

2785
04:02:16,440 --> 04:02:29,091
[SPEAKER_46]: I'll just give an example um, we just recently in september disbanded the vision committee because it wasn't a diverse committee, so That's something that could happen.

2786
04:02:29,272 --> 04:02:37,299
[SPEAKER_46]: We're all going to be going through these applications and We have all the same applications and you know

2787
04:02:38,712 --> 04:02:50,480
[SPEAKER_46]: you know, there's room for human error, making that selection, you know, there's room for emotion, making that selection, you know, choosing that candidate.

2788
04:02:51,581 --> 04:03:05,450
[SPEAKER_46]: I just think, you know, it should be, if it's not gonna be done via the lottery, then I agree with the mayor, it would be part of the administration team, you know, to review the applications.

2789
04:03:10,259 --> 04:03:10,879
[SPEAKER_40]: Member Rousseau?

2790
04:03:12,600 --> 04:03:16,342
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, being an elected official is supposed to be hard, I thought.

2791
04:03:16,982 --> 04:03:20,504
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not interested in putting this responsibility on somebody else.

2792
04:03:21,204 --> 04:03:24,766
[SPEAKER_21]: And yes, I'm not going to pick just anybody of the applications.

2793
04:03:25,206 --> 04:03:35,891
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to pick people whom I think, based on their reason they want to be on it, reflect what I imagine they may in fact decide on when they come to selecting a name.

2794
04:03:36,392 --> 04:03:37,352
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not going to just

2795
04:03:37,842 --> 04:03:38,823
[SPEAKER_21]: randomly pick somebody.

2796
04:03:38,903 --> 04:03:44,267
[SPEAKER_21]: And by the way, with random, with a lottery, we could literally end up with 14 white women.

2797
04:03:45,227 --> 04:03:46,548
[SPEAKER_21]: That's totally possible.

2798
04:03:46,708 --> 04:03:55,074
[SPEAKER_21]: The lottery does not guarantee in any way, shape or form a distribution of anything, because it has everything to do with the applicant pool.

2799
04:03:55,494 --> 04:04:01,919
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we fail to reach out to anybody from a certain sub community,

2800
04:04:02,751 --> 04:04:11,955
[SPEAKER_21]: that we're interested in having representation to, if we don't get applications for them or we get one application from them, well, they're not gonna end up on this committee.

2801
04:04:12,315 --> 04:04:16,977
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the lottery in no way, shape or form provides actual representation.

2802
04:04:17,397 --> 04:04:28,622
[SPEAKER_21]: It did for the schools, for the middle school, because we had a set group to start with that we knew and that we knew where we wanted to go.

2803
04:04:29,183 --> 04:04:32,164
[SPEAKER_21]: So, but we will not know who the applicants are.

2804
04:04:32,751 --> 04:04:36,952
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's an impossible thing to use a lottery to accomplish any level of equity.

2805
04:04:38,653 --> 04:04:41,914
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that that's really important.

2806
04:04:44,154 --> 04:04:50,256
[SPEAKER_21]: So, and I, again, I don't wanna beat the dead horse here, but our policy is very clear that we'd select it.

2807
04:04:50,356 --> 04:04:51,836
[SPEAKER_21]: It's explicit language here.

2808
04:04:52,076 --> 04:04:58,458
[SPEAKER_21]: Appointments to such committees will be made by the committee, not or their delegate or the superintendent or anybody else.

2809
04:04:58,498 --> 04:05:01,279
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't believe we have an option to give it to somebody else.

2810
04:05:03,479 --> 04:05:03,820
[SPEAKER_37]: Mayor.

2811
04:05:03,840 --> 04:05:05,905
[SPEAKER_39]: Member McLaughlin.

2812
04:05:07,448 --> 04:05:11,357
[SPEAKER_37]: Another option for this could be that we do like we did with the

2813
04:05:13,399 --> 04:05:20,704
[SPEAKER_37]: with the superintendent search, where we basically made the applications blind, for lack of a better word.

2814
04:05:21,884 --> 04:05:27,848
[SPEAKER_37]: And so we didn't see, you know, the individual's name necessarily, what have you, but we could see the narrative around it.

2815
04:05:27,988 --> 04:05:37,014
[SPEAKER_37]: And we could sort of, you know, go from that perspective, if you're thinking about, if people are thinking about the implicit bias piece.

2816
04:05:37,154 --> 04:05:42,177
[SPEAKER_37]: And to, I mean, I'm hearing both sides of the argument right now, to member Rousseau's point,

2817
04:05:43,177 --> 04:05:47,661
[SPEAKER_37]: it has to be pointed in terms of being diverse, and the lottery won't do that.

2818
04:05:47,881 --> 04:05:56,288
[SPEAKER_37]: To member Retz's point, it can remove the implicit bias, but again, doesn't account for the diversity.

2819
04:05:56,388 --> 04:06:04,154
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm wondering if there's some compromise there for the, you know, to have a blind application.

2820
04:06:04,174 --> 04:06:10,940
[SPEAKER_41]: A blind application, or we could pick our top five or 10 and we are,

2821
04:06:12,810 --> 04:06:17,851
[SPEAKER_41]: picking the names, but the administration can finalize the committee?

2822
04:06:21,372 --> 04:06:25,833
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, I think to member Rousseau's point, also we are selecting, but the administration can finalize.

2823
04:06:25,853 --> 04:06:32,234
[SPEAKER_37]: Cause I was going to say to member Rousseau's point, it's not part of the policy, but if we're selecting and they finalize, it could be another workaround.

2824
04:06:33,375 --> 04:06:33,555
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2825
04:06:33,575 --> 04:06:35,275
[SPEAKER_41]: It's all in the wording.

2826
04:06:36,875 --> 04:06:38,856
[SPEAKER_41]: So I don't know.

2827
04:06:38,956 --> 04:06:40,056
[SPEAKER_41]: That would be my suggestion.

2828
04:06:42,521 --> 04:06:46,764
[SPEAKER_33]: I guess, yeah, I need, I need you to say that again.

2829
04:06:46,784 --> 04:06:55,450
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, I'm troubled because I think that we as school committee members do, um, uh, have the ability to pick a person.

2830
04:06:55,991 --> 04:07:05,437
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think that we'll pick a person that will each have a criteria, um, that will not be the same, um, you know, uh, necessarily.

2831
04:07:05,777 --> 04:07:07,699
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, but that's why there's seven of us.

2832
04:07:08,679 --> 04:07:10,020
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, you know, uh,

2833
04:07:12,190 --> 04:07:41,071
[SPEAKER_41]: know to pick blind I don't I don't know um maybe you could just say yours again mayor because I really didn't get we pick a number so say 50 applications come in we each pick our top 10 we give those top 10 to the administration and they have they have a tough task on their hands but they're going to see seven people's top 10 and they're going to be able to make sure it's a diverse they're going to finalize a committee of diverse members so

2834
04:07:41,684 --> 04:07:50,790
[SPEAKER_41]: If seven of us pick seven Italian-Americans because we heard loud and clear how they feel, that's not a diverse committee.

2835
04:07:51,131 --> 04:07:56,634
[SPEAKER_41]: But the administration would have the ability to do that out of our top selections, like the policy says.

2836
04:07:56,694 --> 04:07:57,575
[SPEAKER_41]: We have to select.

2837
04:07:58,015 --> 04:07:59,356
[SPEAKER_41]: They will finalize.

2838
04:08:00,337 --> 04:08:04,600
[SPEAKER_33]: And what if we don't like the committee that the superintendent or her designee comes up with?

2839
04:08:05,855 --> 04:08:07,716
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, that's the problem.

2840
04:08:07,776 --> 04:08:14,177
[SPEAKER_41]: Administration, some of them don't live here, they're not gonna have biases.

2841
04:08:14,477 --> 04:08:23,499
[SPEAKER_41]: I feel like it would be a better way moving forward to build the trust in the community that we so badly need to try to restore.

2842
04:08:24,079 --> 04:08:29,601
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, I'm open to hearing my colleagues, if everybody thinks that's gonna work, I don't know.

2843
04:08:32,498 --> 04:08:33,699
[SPEAKER_33]: Kathy, how do you feel about that?

2844
04:08:35,020 --> 04:08:39,002
[SPEAKER_46]: I would be okay with that resolution, what's proposed by the mayor.

2845
04:08:39,022 --> 04:08:45,646
[SPEAKER_46]: I just really think that there is too much room for bias in the process.

2846
04:08:45,926 --> 04:08:59,454
[SPEAKER_46]: It would be okay if we went through and we gave our top 10 and then the final decision would come from the administration so that, you know, I didn't handpick, you know, X, Y, Z, you know, to fit my, you know,

2847
04:09:00,154 --> 04:09:01,534
[SPEAKER_46]: you know, what I wanted.

2848
04:09:01,855 --> 04:09:15,759
[SPEAKER_46]: I just, you know, I just really, and I want to have a diverse committee because we recently just disbanded the visionary committee and we haven't begun that process to start the application process for that committee.

2849
04:09:15,839 --> 04:09:25,302
[SPEAKER_46]: So I just feel it's really important that we get a diverse group of candidates, equitable.

2850
04:09:26,314 --> 04:09:31,936
[SPEAKER_33]: So I guess we just have to ask a superintendent, is that something which is comfortable for you?

2851
04:09:32,896 --> 04:09:33,616
[SPEAKER_37]: May I excuse me?

2852
04:09:33,656 --> 04:09:35,017
[SPEAKER_62]: Member Graham has had her hand up.

2853
04:09:35,217 --> 04:09:35,497
[SPEAKER_62]: Sorry.

2854
04:09:36,157 --> 04:09:36,717
[SPEAKER_62]: Member Graham?

2855
04:09:38,818 --> 04:09:43,360
[SPEAKER_62]: I am completely opposed to giving this responsibility to the administration.

2856
04:09:43,380 --> 04:09:47,241
[SPEAKER_62]: I think one thing that we have heard

2857
04:09:47,677 --> 04:09:59,345
[SPEAKER_62]: from everybody, no matter what their perspective on the renaming of the Columbus school is, is that the administration has a very big task ahead of them to get kids back to school.

2858
04:10:00,005 --> 04:10:01,346
[SPEAKER_62]: And this was our decision.

2859
04:10:03,832 --> 04:10:08,453
[SPEAKER_62]: Six out of the seven of us said yes to this vote in June.

2860
04:10:08,954 --> 04:10:16,236
[SPEAKER_62]: We need to own the consequences of that decision, and we need to own the completion of the task.

2861
04:10:16,976 --> 04:10:25,118
[SPEAKER_62]: And pushing the dirty work onto the administration because it's uncomfortable is not what we're here to do.

2862
04:10:25,578 --> 04:10:27,179
[SPEAKER_62]: We made a decision

2863
04:10:27,839 --> 04:10:34,524
[SPEAKER_62]: and it's up to us to carry that decision forward, not to make other people do the work that we don't wanna do.

2864
04:10:34,545 --> 04:10:39,989
[SPEAKER_62]: So I'm completely opposed and it has nothing to do with trust before anybody goes there.

2865
04:10:40,009 --> 04:10:43,011
[SPEAKER_62]: It has nothing to do with trusting the superintendent.

2866
04:10:43,392 --> 04:10:45,674
[SPEAKER_62]: It has nothing to do with trusting the administration.

2867
04:10:45,694 --> 04:10:51,158
[SPEAKER_62]: It has to do with our responsibility and ownership as this school committee for this decision.

2868
04:10:51,178 --> 04:10:55,742
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair.

2869
04:10:58,567 --> 04:11:00,507
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2870
04:11:00,607 --> 04:11:02,928
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you to everyone who's spoken on this.

2871
04:11:02,988 --> 04:11:08,509
[SPEAKER_21]: It's obviously a difficult point and I kind of expected this to be the most difficult point of the whole thing.

2872
04:11:10,530 --> 04:11:22,312
[SPEAKER_21]: I do think that the word bias, it has to be unpacked.

2873
04:11:22,392 --> 04:11:26,873
[SPEAKER_21]: If I am insistent that I will only pick two members who are women,

2874
04:11:27,665 --> 04:11:29,787
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that is absolutely biased, of course.

2875
04:11:30,868 --> 04:11:33,330
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would openly own that and be fine with that.

2876
04:11:34,311 --> 04:11:46,221
[SPEAKER_21]: I think bias does not imply that there's, you know, bias just means a selection based on anything, frankly, just not random is bias.

2877
04:11:47,782 --> 04:11:55,068
[SPEAKER_21]: And the vision committee, I think, you know, we know that the pool was not a big, it was not a good,

2878
04:11:55,578 --> 04:11:56,819
[SPEAKER_21]: was not a good pool to start with.

2879
04:11:56,919 --> 04:11:59,260
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the people that were in it were great, but we didn't have the right people.

2880
04:11:59,400 --> 04:12:01,061
[SPEAKER_21]: We didn't ask and get more people in it.

2881
04:12:01,761 --> 04:12:08,485
[SPEAKER_21]: So there was no chance for that random lottery, which is what I believe what the mayor used to some extent to work.

2882
04:12:08,845 --> 04:12:15,689
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, in that case, there was a lottery and we didn't get a good result of a representation that we were hoping for.

2883
04:12:16,810 --> 04:12:20,552
[SPEAKER_21]: So, but I think that the other point though of the

2884
04:12:21,360 --> 04:12:23,160
[SPEAKER_21]: that we need to own the dirty work.

2885
04:12:23,240 --> 04:12:40,104
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't necessarily think this terribly dirty actually, but I do feel like it would be very uncomfortable if I submit 10 names, Kathy submits 10 names and then Dr. Edward Vincent says, here's the list and there's not one of Kathy's name on.

2886
04:12:40,685 --> 04:12:42,005
[SPEAKER_21]: One of her 10 is not on the list.

2887
04:12:43,085 --> 04:12:44,305
[SPEAKER_21]: How's Kathy gonna feel about that?

2888
04:12:44,545 --> 04:12:51,007
[SPEAKER_21]: I know I would be pretty shocked and uncomfortable and think what the heck happened.

2889
04:12:52,078 --> 04:13:07,410
[SPEAKER_21]: But if we're going to do that, then we are literally saying, here's the pile, you figure out what the right group is, and I would hope they're not going to be like, okay, well, this is member Rousseau's pile, and this is member Kretz's pile, because that would be biased also.

2890
04:13:10,168 --> 04:13:13,590
[SPEAKER_21]: To me, we should do the hard part of selecting the committee.

2891
04:13:13,791 --> 04:13:27,280
[SPEAKER_21]: And absolutely, we should do the hard part of figuring out how to update this policy so that we can figure out a way to ensure that advisory committees going forward have a robust mechanism for this exact point.

2892
04:13:27,500 --> 04:13:30,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it does just say, we'll select them.

2893
04:13:30,442 --> 04:13:31,643
[SPEAKER_21]: We literally could all just say,

2894
04:13:32,299 --> 04:13:36,400
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, you know, if we all had siblings in Medford, we could just all pick our siblings.

2895
04:13:36,700 --> 04:13:38,440
[SPEAKER_21]: And then boom, that's the advisory committee.

2896
04:13:38,460 --> 04:13:40,981
[SPEAKER_21]: And that'd be perfectly legal, following our policies.

2897
04:13:41,181 --> 04:13:43,182
[SPEAKER_21]: And hopefully we would all get screamed at for it.

2898
04:13:44,342 --> 04:13:53,764
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that we have to live with the policy we have, even though I think there's nobody who seems to be happy with what we have.

2899
04:13:54,924 --> 04:13:56,525
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's a different set of work.

2900
04:13:57,905 --> 04:14:01,726
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think we should pick the names because I think we should own it.

2901
04:14:03,086 --> 04:14:11,451
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, I certainly am not going to take the pile and just like flip it and then stick my finger in and say, there's the person I'm picking.

2902
04:14:11,691 --> 04:14:13,872
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not, I'm going to read each applicant.

2903
04:14:14,352 --> 04:14:17,694
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't matter if they're, what their race is, their gender.

2904
04:14:17,774 --> 04:14:19,795
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I used women a moment ago, but it doesn't matter.

2905
04:14:19,855 --> 04:14:20,936
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to read everyone.

2906
04:14:20,996 --> 04:14:24,918
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause I want to read the statement that they write as to why they want to be on it.

2907
04:14:25,038 --> 04:14:26,139
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to hear the stories.

2908
04:14:26,599 --> 04:14:27,840
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a fourth generation.

2909
04:14:28,380 --> 04:14:31,942
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I, I went, you know, my grandmother went to Columbus or whatever.

2910
04:14:32,369 --> 04:14:56,043
[SPEAKER_21]: And I want to hear these stories and connect to the people that I think, you know, this person, they care a lot and they're going to really be able to take both the history and maybe they have an interest in, you know, and maybe they literally have a history degree or something, you know, and figuring out how to get people that I think will fit the goal.

2911
04:14:56,924 --> 04:15:00,926
[SPEAKER_21]: The goal is that nobody's going to show up with a name and say, here's our name and

2912
04:15:02,853 --> 04:15:04,974
[SPEAKER_21]: they just randomly selected a name from the list.

2913
04:15:05,014 --> 04:15:05,954
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be terrible.

2914
04:15:06,334 --> 04:15:09,855
[SPEAKER_21]: We want them to be able to, you know, proudly announce the name.

2915
04:15:10,216 --> 04:15:16,538
[SPEAKER_21]: And then also like all of us to be in awe, like, Oh my God, this is such a good name.

2916
04:15:16,698 --> 04:15:26,581
[SPEAKER_21]: And I do expect the advisory committee to wow us with their presentation about why is this the person or, well, we haven't done that part yet, but here's the three.

2917
04:15:27,061 --> 04:15:31,823
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I mean, I'm very excited, but I also think it's critically important that we recognize that

2918
04:15:33,343 --> 04:15:35,945
[SPEAKER_21]: right people have to get together to get the work done.

2919
04:15:36,065 --> 04:15:43,789
[SPEAKER_21]: We've all, many of us have worked on teams, and when the team isn't the right team, it's terribly challenging to get the work done.

2920
04:15:44,010 --> 04:15:50,734
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not so much that I think having a random representation is a bad thing.

2921
04:15:50,754 --> 04:15:52,815
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think that it's not going to work here.

2922
04:16:06,087 --> 04:16:06,427
[SPEAKER_37]: Mayor?

2923
04:16:06,447 --> 04:16:08,067
[SPEAKER_39]: Member McLaughlin?

2924
04:16:09,808 --> 04:16:18,709
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I just wanted to echo Member Graham's sentiment around not putting this on school administration.

2925
04:16:18,949 --> 04:16:33,212
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it's both unfair and I think to the point that we've heard from many individuals is they are focused on other things right now as they should be with the commissioner's requirements and

2926
04:16:35,609 --> 04:16:42,011
[SPEAKER_37]: the specifics of what is being requested of them in terms of getting kids back to school.

2927
04:16:42,091 --> 04:16:47,652
[SPEAKER_37]: And a lot of people, I think, think that the school committee is in the weeds with that, and we do that, but we do not.

2928
04:16:47,752 --> 04:16:54,274
[SPEAKER_37]: The administration does that, and we set policy, which is what we're doing tonight.

2929
04:16:54,754 --> 04:16:55,154
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2930
04:16:56,655 --> 04:16:58,235
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

2931
04:17:00,116 --> 04:17:00,676
[SPEAKER_41]: So, Mayor.

2932
04:17:01,363 --> 04:17:03,284
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, and people's hands are raised.

2933
04:17:03,324 --> 04:17:11,329
[SPEAKER_41]: So, I mean, I feel like we need to... I don't know if we all... We'll go through a few paragraphs.

2934
04:17:11,589 --> 04:17:20,815
[SPEAKER_41]: I would move to... Somebody wants to make a motion to take those hands that are raised before we make a final decision on this one.

2935
04:17:23,356 --> 04:17:24,937
[SPEAKER_33]: I think you can just go ahead and do that, Mayor.

2936
04:17:25,778 --> 04:17:26,478
[SPEAKER_33]: We don't need a motion.

2937
04:17:30,230 --> 04:17:38,217
[SPEAKER_62]: Didn't we have a motion that we were going to take public comment, then we were going to finish the document, and then we were going to take public comment again?

2938
04:17:38,317 --> 04:17:39,738
[SPEAKER_62]: Didn't we pass that as a motion?

2939
04:17:41,360 --> 04:17:43,261
[SPEAKER_41]: We passed the motion, yes, and now it's 10.15.

2940
04:17:43,702 --> 04:17:47,925
[SPEAKER_41]: It's been probably another hour and there's hands raised and people want to speak.

2941
04:17:48,085 --> 04:17:55,472
[SPEAKER_41]: So I'm asking if somebody will move, I'm in the chair, I'm asking if somebody will move the motion to make that change and allow people to speak.

2942
04:17:56,392 --> 04:17:57,914
[SPEAKER_41]: Motion to allow the people to speak.

2943
04:17:59,505 --> 04:18:00,206
[SPEAKER_40]: Is there a second?

2944
04:18:00,466 --> 04:18:02,087
[SPEAKER_40]: Seconded by Member Van de Kloet.

2945
04:18:02,147 --> 04:18:02,628
[SPEAKER_40]: Roll call.

2946
04:18:08,252 --> 04:18:09,093
[SPEAKER_37]: Hold on one second.

2947
04:18:11,135 --> 04:18:11,875
[SPEAKER_37]: Member Graham?

2948
04:18:13,456 --> 04:18:13,717
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

2949
04:18:15,158 --> 04:18:15,798
[SPEAKER_37]: Member Kretz?

2950
04:18:16,259 --> 04:18:16,479
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes.

2951
04:18:17,840 --> 04:18:18,841
[SPEAKER_37]: Member McLaughlin?

2952
04:18:18,881 --> 04:18:19,221
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

2953
04:18:19,521 --> 04:18:20,302
[SPEAKER_37]: Member McStone?

2954
04:18:20,542 --> 04:18:20,762
[SPEAKER_51]: Yes.

2955
04:18:22,003 --> 04:18:22,764
[SPEAKER_37]: Member Russo?

2956
04:18:24,345 --> 04:18:26,988
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

2957
04:18:27,128 --> 04:18:28,048
[SPEAKER_37]: Member Van de Kloet?

2958
04:18:28,329 --> 04:18:28,529
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2959
04:18:29,724 --> 04:18:30,465
[SPEAKER_37]: My longer current.

2960
04:18:31,186 --> 04:18:32,988
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, 70 affirmative zero in the negative.

2961
04:18:34,249 --> 04:18:43,820
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, we're gonna stick to the two minutes and one time one time each so that we can move on to the next page, and then we'll do public comment again at the end.

2962
04:18:45,061 --> 04:18:45,662
[SPEAKER_41]: Mike Kugner.

2963
04:19:00,265 --> 04:19:01,006
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear me now?

2964
04:19:04,588 --> 04:19:04,849
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2965
04:19:07,691 --> 04:19:15,838
[SPEAKER_19]: My question is, I don't think anybody in the committee wants to be biased in any way, equitable.

2966
04:19:15,858 --> 04:19:19,741
[SPEAKER_19]: We're at a point now where we're at nauseum.

2967
04:19:20,361 --> 04:19:21,682
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going through this whole process.

2968
04:19:22,223 --> 04:19:29,909
[SPEAKER_19]: But my question is, does anyone on this committee feel that they'll be biased in their process of selecting members for this

2969
04:19:33,307 --> 04:19:34,727
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a task force.

2970
04:19:35,108 --> 04:19:37,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Because if we had a committee, we wouldn't be going through this.

2971
04:19:38,670 --> 04:19:43,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Does anyone feel that they are biased?

2972
04:19:46,795 --> 04:19:47,695
[SPEAKER_41]: You're breaking up, Mike.

2973
04:19:47,715 --> 04:19:48,376
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm sorry.

2974
04:19:52,458 --> 04:19:53,018
[SPEAKER_41]: You're breaking up.

2975
04:19:54,039 --> 04:19:55,120
[SPEAKER_41]: Will we be biased?

2976
04:19:55,180 --> 04:19:57,081
[SPEAKER_41]: No, I'll do my best not to.

2977
04:19:57,221 --> 04:19:58,962
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just trying to get the word across.

2978
04:19:59,312 --> 04:20:02,973
[SPEAKER_19]: Does anyone on this committee feel that the process is biased?

2979
04:20:06,654 --> 04:20:07,895
[SPEAKER_41]: We don't even have a process yet.

2980
04:20:07,935 --> 04:20:08,875
[SPEAKER_41]: We're working on that.

2981
04:20:09,355 --> 04:20:10,355
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Russo?

2982
04:20:11,716 --> 04:20:16,877
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to say exactly that, that we don't have a process yet, so I don't know how to answer the question.

2983
04:20:25,940 --> 04:20:26,240
[SPEAKER_40]: Ingrid?

2984
04:20:29,867 --> 04:20:31,828
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, this is technical.

2985
04:20:37,169 --> 04:20:37,389
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2986
04:20:38,089 --> 04:20:38,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it my turn now?

2987
04:20:39,510 --> 04:20:39,710
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2988
04:20:40,610 --> 04:20:40,830
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

2989
04:20:42,190 --> 04:20:43,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a few comments.

2990
04:20:44,391 --> 04:20:51,773
[SPEAKER_13]: One was about the Columbus School involvement, because I am part of the Columbus School, and I'm part of the PTU, and I'm very involved.

2991
04:20:51,873 --> 04:20:58,615
[SPEAKER_13]: So I feel a little bit sad and a little bit conflicted that the timeline doesn't work out

2992
04:21:00,195 --> 04:21:07,481
[SPEAKER_13]: having projects on the school so the kids can work on this name change.

2993
04:21:08,541 --> 04:21:12,264
[SPEAKER_13]: The kids haven't been told that this is happening by the school.

2994
04:21:12,805 --> 04:21:18,509
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, my kids know it because we've been talking about it for years, but the kids haven't been told by the administration.

2995
04:21:19,449 --> 04:21:25,634
[SPEAKER_13]: And so there's gonna have to be a process to get the kids have to speak and excited about the name change.

2996
04:21:25,654 --> 04:21:28,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think it's very important that the kids are excited.

2997
04:21:28,736 --> 04:21:37,318
[SPEAKER_13]: that they're picking a new name, that they can be part of the process, that, you know, make them think, what does it mean to have a name?

2998
04:21:37,478 --> 04:21:39,598
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you value on a name?

2999
04:21:39,738 --> 04:21:40,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is it important?

3000
04:21:40,599 --> 04:21:43,519
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so many things that kids, it's good for kids to think about.

3001
04:21:43,539 --> 04:21:44,359
[SPEAKER_13]: And I trust that Ms.

3002
04:21:44,399 --> 04:21:45,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Kay will do a good job with that.

3003
04:21:46,320 --> 04:21:48,400
[SPEAKER_13]: But I feel like it's so little time.

3004
04:21:48,480 --> 04:21:51,081
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know this has to be done and I'm totally,

3005
04:21:53,280 --> 04:21:59,662
[SPEAKER_13]: supporting the name change and it has to be done now, but I feel sad about that, that we don't have time to do a process there.

3006
04:22:00,422 --> 04:22:11,985
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm wondering if we can do something about having the kids somehow have more participation in the being involved at some point in the decision.

3007
04:22:12,245 --> 04:22:14,545
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how to do that.

3008
04:22:15,345 --> 04:22:17,166
[SPEAKER_13]: And the second thing that I wanted to talk about was

3009
04:22:18,456 --> 04:22:36,393
[SPEAKER_13]: do you have don't you have another diversity committee in the schools is that hasn't been selected can that be involved into this process at all or somebody like Neil Osborne who's the director of diversity can he be involved in this decision to make sure that the committee is actually diverse

3010
04:22:36,954 --> 04:22:40,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I do trust the school committee members to choose.

3011
04:22:40,577 --> 04:22:42,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Ingrid, you have 15 seconds.

3012
04:22:42,779 --> 04:22:46,221
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think you should involve the administration because they're really busy with other things.

3013
04:22:46,562 --> 04:22:56,389
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think you might be able to bring an external advisor to make sure that the committee that you end up with is actually diverse and is actually the right people.

3014
04:22:57,190 --> 04:22:57,550
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

3015
04:22:58,471 --> 04:22:59,472
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Ingrid.

3016
04:23:00,593 --> 04:23:00,773
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

3017
04:23:00,793 --> 04:23:04,696
[SPEAKER_41]: Kay, I'm sure you'll be working on a plan in the next week to get the students involved.

3018
04:23:04,756 --> 04:23:06,237
[SPEAKER_41]: So I know you probably don't have

3019
04:23:06,516 --> 04:23:07,697
[SPEAKER_41]: We'll work hard on that.

3020
04:23:08,097 --> 04:23:08,478
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

3021
04:23:10,559 --> 04:23:12,421
[SPEAKER_41]: And then I'm blanking on the second question.

3022
04:23:17,865 --> 04:23:18,725
[SPEAKER_41]: Student involvement.

3023
04:23:18,806 --> 04:23:20,767
[SPEAKER_41]: I know that was her main point, but okay.

3024
04:23:22,608 --> 04:23:23,029
[SPEAKER_41]: Jessica.

3025
04:23:26,672 --> 04:23:27,372
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you, Mayor.

3026
04:23:28,453 --> 04:23:32,416
[SPEAKER_61]: I just wanted to address the issue of bias in the selection.

3027
04:23:35,453 --> 04:23:46,736
[SPEAKER_61]: I have a recollection of Member Rousseau saying at the meeting in June that he would absolutely not allow Italian Americans on the committee and it's actually on the tape.

3028
04:23:47,116 --> 04:23:58,199
[SPEAKER_61]: So I feel like there's no possible way he could sit there and say he's not biased when clearly he's stated for the record that he has a bias.

3029
04:23:59,872 --> 04:24:11,098
[SPEAKER_61]: There needs to be I mean the committee on majority of the committee has voted for this silly name change, and a majority of the committee will vote for people who are in support of what they're doing.

3030
04:24:12,279 --> 04:24:15,681
[SPEAKER_61]: So I feel like it's very interesting that the tail is wagging the dog here.

3031
04:24:16,702 --> 04:24:20,504
[SPEAKER_61]: The members are supposed to be serving this community, not the other way around.

3032
04:24:21,504 --> 04:24:21,864
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

3033
04:24:26,172 --> 04:24:27,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I certainly did not say that.

3034
04:24:28,372 --> 04:24:37,614
[SPEAKER_21]: I certainly may have said something along the lines that I do not think that it is appropriate to limit the possible names to the Italian community.

3035
04:24:38,054 --> 04:24:41,635
[SPEAKER_21]: The school does not belong to the Italian community, it belongs to the Medford community.

3036
04:24:42,335 --> 04:24:53,757
[SPEAKER_21]: And while I recognize that there was an assertion that this was on tape, please do send in the link and the timestamp and we can all watch it together, thank you.

3037
04:24:56,104 --> 04:24:59,848
[SPEAKER_41]: We'll get Michael, Mari, Seth, Marie and Marie.

3038
04:25:01,570 --> 04:25:06,875
[SPEAKER_41]: We're only allowing people to speak once and then we're moving on and then we can have more public participation.

3039
04:25:06,916 --> 04:25:07,436
[SPEAKER_41]: So Michael.

3040
04:25:07,456 --> 04:25:08,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

3041
04:25:08,898 --> 04:25:09,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Michael Burns.

3042
04:25:13,422 --> 04:25:14,363
[SPEAKER_41]: Michael, hold on one second.

3043
04:25:14,464 --> 04:25:14,764
[SPEAKER_41]: Go ahead.

3044
04:25:15,084 --> 04:25:15,625
[SPEAKER_41]: Sorry, Michael.

3045
04:25:16,385 --> 04:25:16,785
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

3046
04:25:16,945 --> 04:25:18,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Michael Bernstein, Lyman Avenue, Medford.

3047
04:25:19,126 --> 04:25:20,066
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a Columbus parent.

3048
04:25:20,486 --> 04:25:26,668
[SPEAKER_12]: When I was a kid, my own elementary school went through a process like this for the elementary school to choose a new school mascot with student input.

3049
04:25:27,248 --> 04:25:30,448
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to make a suggestion for ensuring student input in this process.

3050
04:25:31,209 --> 04:25:35,350
[SPEAKER_12]: The advisory committee is going to sort through lots of suggestions for a new name for the Columbus school.

3051
04:25:36,010 --> 04:25:40,011
[SPEAKER_12]: That committee will come up with a short list of finalists, and those finalists will all be good names.

3052
04:25:40,831 --> 04:25:48,014
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want students at the Columbus to have a voice and feel like they were a key part of this process, let the school committee reduce that list to three names.

3053
04:25:48,034 --> 04:25:49,174
[SPEAKER_12]: It would all be great choices.

3054
04:25:49,714 --> 04:25:53,816
[SPEAKER_12]: And then let the kids at the school have the final vote among those top three finalists.

3055
04:25:54,496 --> 04:25:57,417
[SPEAKER_12]: The school can do a short lesson on all three finalists to educate the kids.

3056
04:25:57,877 --> 04:26:03,579
[SPEAKER_12]: The kids can feel involved in the process of naming their school, and they can see how democracy works by truly participating in it.

3057
04:26:03,959 --> 04:26:04,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

3058
04:26:05,480 --> 04:26:06,120
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Michael.

3059
04:26:08,841 --> 04:26:09,101
[SPEAKER_39]: Mari?

3060
04:26:15,671 --> 04:26:16,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, everyone.

3061
04:26:16,712 --> 04:26:18,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for having me.

3062
04:26:19,652 --> 04:26:29,915
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of things, you know, I've been in the city a long time and everyone knows that, but, you know, I just listened to this gentleman to have the kids involved.

3063
04:26:30,255 --> 04:26:33,456
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to have the kids involved, but they graduated out of there too.

3064
04:26:33,876 --> 04:26:38,337
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been people graduating out of the Columbus schools.

3065
04:26:40,648 --> 04:26:49,413
[SPEAKER_08]: 1929, if you want to go back that far, and you know, everyone should have a little bit of a voice in it, but let's not put the impetus on that.

3066
04:26:50,053 --> 04:26:53,735
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know, you want to bring it out, bring it to the community.

3067
04:26:54,055 --> 04:27:08,064
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I disagree so much with Paul Rousseau's stance on this and coming out against this, you know, against the city of Medford.

3068
04:27:08,729 --> 04:27:13,912
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we are one Medford, hopefully, but you know, it's all divided right now.

3069
04:27:13,932 --> 04:27:25,818
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and, and, and, and no one's willing to say that, you know, they're just willing to, they have their own agenda and want to move it forward.

3070
04:27:25,838 --> 04:27:26,939
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know,

3071
04:27:29,099 --> 04:27:29,940
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not right.

3072
04:27:30,580 --> 04:27:35,403
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not right without the community being heard.

3073
04:27:35,924 --> 04:27:39,026
[SPEAKER_08]: And everyone's going to say, well, we put it out there back in June.

3074
04:27:39,286 --> 04:27:39,926
[SPEAKER_08]: You know something?

3075
04:27:40,587 --> 04:27:42,328
[SPEAKER_08]: The community is out there right now.

3076
04:27:43,729 --> 04:27:48,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Put your money where your mouth is and say, OK, let's have a community meeting.

3077
04:27:48,512 --> 04:27:50,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what they have to say.

3078
04:27:50,333 --> 04:27:57,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And no one has the guts there, including the members of this committee that

3079
04:27:59,170 --> 04:28:02,892
[SPEAKER_08]: are afraid to put it out there because they know it's not going to work.

3080
04:28:03,572 --> 04:28:05,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you and appreciate it.

3081
04:28:07,514 --> 04:28:07,974
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

3082
04:28:08,274 --> 04:28:08,614
[SPEAKER_35]: Seth.

3083
04:28:12,956 --> 04:28:13,776
[SPEAKER_63]: Yeah, that's me.

3084
04:28:14,617 --> 04:28:18,258
[SPEAKER_63]: I was just going to echo a lot of what Ingrid said.

3085
04:28:18,979 --> 04:28:22,260
[SPEAKER_63]: I am also a Columbus parent, as I mentioned earlier this evening.

3086
04:28:25,942 --> 04:28:39,890
[SPEAKER_63]: I would love for my daughter to be more involved in the process and for there to be more opportunities for her classmates and for her schoolmates to be involved in the renaming.

3087
04:28:41,191 --> 04:28:51,257
[SPEAKER_63]: At the same time, that plays into a lot of what member Russo has been talking about and others on the committee in the

3088
04:28:59,827 --> 04:29:16,214
[SPEAKER_63]: committee or advisory committee being a safe space for kids to show up and be part of the process.

3089
04:29:16,294 --> 04:29:23,737
[SPEAKER_63]: I don't know whether or not, obviously, there'll be voting members, but if there's going to be elementary school kids coming

3090
04:29:26,311 --> 04:29:42,338
[SPEAKER_63]: people, I wouldn't want it to be a contentious group of people that are not there in good faith, you know, welcoming them with the possibilities of new names.

3091
04:29:43,678 --> 04:29:44,819
[SPEAKER_63]: Yeah.

3092
04:29:47,660 --> 04:29:47,960
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

3093
04:29:48,200 --> 04:29:48,700
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Seth.

3094
04:29:50,341 --> 04:29:50,881
[SPEAKER_40]: Marie Mack.

3095
04:29:54,980 --> 04:29:56,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, can you hear me?

3096
04:29:57,001 --> 04:29:57,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

3097
04:29:58,602 --> 04:30:19,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanna say as a member of the community, a long-term member of the community, what I find extremely disturbing in all of this, and whether you're for or against the name change, I think what you're feeling and what's creating the divisiveness in the community of Medford is the way this was first started.

3098
04:30:20,074 --> 04:30:23,576
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very sorry, but to me,

3099
04:30:24,591 --> 04:30:28,354
[SPEAKER_09]: The biggest problem is the involvement of member Rousseau.

3100
04:30:29,915 --> 04:30:42,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Long before this went to the vote, he posted on his own campaign page that he was gonna change this and went so far as to say he had already picked a name on his own.

3101
04:30:43,647 --> 04:30:45,969
[SPEAKER_09]: And he published that name that he had chosen.

3102
04:30:46,589 --> 04:30:49,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it went to the vote, the community didn't know.

3103
04:30:49,552 --> 04:30:53,175
[SPEAKER_09]: And even tonight listening to this, I didn't wanna say anything,

3104
04:30:54,204 --> 04:31:00,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how you as mayor and head of this committee can listen to him and the way that him and Ms.

3105
04:31:00,128 --> 04:31:01,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Graham speaks.

3106
04:31:01,889 --> 04:31:08,773
[SPEAKER_09]: They have made it very clear to me that they will not be unbiased in choosing members of this committee.

3107
04:31:09,353 --> 04:31:12,675
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to me that they want to cherry pick people.

3108
04:31:13,236 --> 04:31:17,138
[SPEAKER_09]: They have called members of the Medford community bad characters.

3109
04:31:17,816 --> 04:31:20,718
[SPEAKER_09]: they already feel that they're gonna have bad characters.

3110
04:31:21,118 --> 04:31:23,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And everyone just sits there and lets them speak that way.

3111
04:31:24,941 --> 04:31:34,847
[SPEAKER_09]: So to me, you're gonna have a school committee can choose people selecting exactly who they want to do what they want, when they want.

3112
04:31:35,467 --> 04:31:41,111
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this is gonna be a very inclusive, equitable, diverse setting at all.

3113
04:31:41,934 --> 04:31:47,617
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand it's against your policy, but it's- Maria, 15 seconds.

3114
04:31:48,057 --> 04:31:48,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

3115
04:31:48,937 --> 04:31:51,438
[SPEAKER_09]: The situation we're in is so severe.

3116
04:31:52,099 --> 04:31:56,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you should rewrite your policy to try and get rid of the divisiveness in this community.

3117
04:31:56,941 --> 04:32:02,443
[SPEAKER_39]: Anne-Marie?

3118
04:32:05,005 --> 04:32:05,705
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm here.

3119
04:32:07,106 --> 04:32:07,266
[SPEAKER_54]: So,

3120
04:32:08,587 --> 04:32:12,429
[SPEAKER_54]: Basically, again, we're still at the same position we were four hours ago.

3121
04:32:13,269 --> 04:32:18,071
[SPEAKER_54]: I mean, you have a committee who keeps on telling me that it's not gonna take any time, it doesn't take time.

3122
04:32:18,451 --> 04:32:19,472
[SPEAKER_54]: We have administrators.

3123
04:32:20,012 --> 04:32:25,895
[SPEAKER_54]: We have to open up our schools to all our elementary schools have to be open in three weeks.

3124
04:32:26,475 --> 04:32:29,256
[SPEAKER_54]: I don't understand this process this evening.

3125
04:32:29,756 --> 04:32:32,918
[SPEAKER_54]: And honestly, the members keep on saying that they hear people.

3126
04:32:33,298 --> 04:32:35,359
[SPEAKER_54]: Well, I've been listening to people all night.

3127
04:32:35,939 --> 04:32:38,241
[SPEAKER_54]: but no one has addressed the situation yet.

3128
04:32:38,741 --> 04:32:42,844
[SPEAKER_54]: It's like you've heard, but you're continuing on with the process.

3129
04:32:42,864 --> 04:32:44,326
[SPEAKER_54]: You're continuing on with everything.

3130
04:32:44,346 --> 04:32:50,430
[SPEAKER_54]: I mean, you have members that are concerned that there might be actors that might be applying.

3131
04:32:50,450 --> 04:32:55,454
[SPEAKER_54]: How are they going to distinguish which ones are actors and which ones are not actors?

3132
04:32:55,974 --> 04:33:05,122
[SPEAKER_54]: I mean, I am frustrated to the point that I am so disheartened with my school committee, something I cherished very, very much.

3133
04:33:05,882 --> 04:33:09,225
[SPEAKER_54]: and to keep on listening to this for the next four hours.

3134
04:33:10,086 --> 04:33:13,950
[SPEAKER_54]: And no one has discussed anything about our school, our kids going back to school.

3135
04:33:14,390 --> 04:33:17,013
[SPEAKER_54]: And as far as member McLaughlin, you're right.

3136
04:33:17,173 --> 04:33:20,896
[SPEAKER_54]: It is not up to the school committee to make the policy of how they're going to go back.

3137
04:33:21,357 --> 04:33:24,299
[SPEAKER_54]: But you have to be involved in that planning.

3138
04:33:24,740 --> 04:33:26,541
[SPEAKER_54]: You need to know what's going on.

3139
04:33:28,021 --> 04:33:29,943
[SPEAKER_54]: I mean, this is ridiculous.

3140
04:33:30,363 --> 04:33:34,768
[SPEAKER_54]: No one is saying to change your values change your opinion, change anything.

3141
04:33:35,268 --> 04:33:38,591
[SPEAKER_54]: We're just asking, or I'm asking, slow down.

3142
04:33:39,963 --> 04:33:41,924
[SPEAKER_54]: pick it and do it correctly.

3143
04:33:42,004 --> 04:33:45,387
[SPEAKER_54]: As far as people saying they've heard us, I don't think so.

3144
04:33:45,427 --> 04:33:53,633
[SPEAKER_54]: Because if you listen to what's going on tonight, for the last four hours of participation, you've had both people that are for it and people that are against it.

3145
04:33:53,893 --> 04:33:57,816
[SPEAKER_54]: But it seems that the people are for it have been listened to.

3146
04:33:57,856 --> 04:34:03,920
[SPEAKER_54]: And the people that are not for it, for whatever reason, everybody has the right to believe what they wanna believe.

3147
04:34:04,820 --> 04:34:06,642
[SPEAKER_54]: Put the kids first tonight.

3148
04:34:08,362 --> 04:34:09,203
[SPEAKER_54]: and postponing.

3149
04:34:10,223 --> 04:34:14,526
[SPEAKER_54]: I'd like to know if the process is gonna be like this to make sure our kids are gonna have proms.

3150
04:34:15,127 --> 04:34:16,648
[SPEAKER_54]: What's the MCAS gonna be like?

3151
04:34:17,068 --> 04:34:18,289
[SPEAKER_54]: Is there gonna be an MCAS?

3152
04:34:18,869 --> 04:34:22,332
[SPEAKER_54]: Is there gonna be any type of social break for the kids this year?

3153
04:34:23,052 --> 04:34:23,753
[SPEAKER_39]: Graduation.

3154
04:34:23,893 --> 04:34:24,713
[SPEAKER_54]: Graduation.

3155
04:34:24,973 --> 04:34:32,479
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

3156
04:34:32,799 --> 04:34:35,120
[SPEAKER_41]: Everybody can speak once on this and we'll go back.

3157
04:34:35,220 --> 04:34:37,402
[SPEAKER_41]: So Tony, you're next.

3158
04:34:46,755 --> 04:34:47,275
[SPEAKER_56]: Hi, thank you.

3159
04:34:47,295 --> 04:34:48,296
[SPEAKER_56]: Am I unmuted?

3160
04:34:48,896 --> 04:34:49,496
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, you're good.

3161
04:34:49,897 --> 04:34:50,297
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

3162
04:34:50,417 --> 04:35:00,783
[SPEAKER_56]: So really quick again, what if the committee chooses a name that is 75 characters long, the ever loving school of Medford, blah, blah, blah.

3163
04:35:00,843 --> 04:35:05,725
[SPEAKER_56]: And you have to select the sign and all the literature to go with this.

3164
04:35:05,785 --> 04:35:09,887
[SPEAKER_56]: And that sign may cost a lot of money, a lot more than a standard sign.

3165
04:35:11,448 --> 04:35:14,290
[SPEAKER_56]: Without knowing what the budget constraints are,

3166
04:35:14,890 --> 04:35:20,291
[SPEAKER_56]: How can anyone make a decision on whether or not this is the appropriate measure to rename a school?

3167
04:35:20,331 --> 04:35:22,132
[SPEAKER_56]: What if the city can't handle that budget?

3168
04:35:22,292 --> 04:35:24,792
[SPEAKER_56]: I mean, I just think it's kind of backwards.

3169
04:35:24,812 --> 04:35:28,733
[SPEAKER_56]: Shouldn't that budget be set first and then you decide what the school name is going to be?

3170
04:35:29,833 --> 04:35:33,074
[SPEAKER_56]: We have no idea as citizens what this is going to cost.

3171
04:35:33,134 --> 04:35:35,114
[SPEAKER_56]: And you're still trying to push this through.

3172
04:35:35,134 --> 04:35:35,974
[SPEAKER_56]: I mean, I know it's through.

3173
04:35:36,034 --> 04:35:37,995
[SPEAKER_56]: I know that the order is through and whatnot.

3174
04:35:38,815 --> 04:35:41,597
[SPEAKER_56]: It's just, it's just, it's just all done so awkwardly.

3175
04:35:42,638 --> 04:35:45,320
[SPEAKER_56]: Over four hours has been spent tonight on this topic.

3176
04:35:46,300 --> 04:35:49,282
[SPEAKER_56]: We have kids that are still not back in school fully yet.

3177
04:35:49,603 --> 04:35:50,843
[SPEAKER_56]: We have so many other issues.

3178
04:35:51,124 --> 04:35:54,506
[SPEAKER_56]: We know the school budget this year is in deficit.

3179
04:35:54,646 --> 04:35:57,688
[SPEAKER_56]: We have a library that hasn't, we haven't figured out how to pay for that yet.

3180
04:35:58,409 --> 04:36:00,110
[SPEAKER_56]: And we're talking about all this stuff here.

3181
04:36:00,737 --> 04:36:03,039
[SPEAKER_56]: that really would not change anything.

3182
04:36:03,199 --> 04:36:04,040
[SPEAKER_56]: This can wait.

3183
04:36:04,160 --> 04:36:06,322
[SPEAKER_56]: This is not something that needs to be discussed now.

3184
04:36:06,763 --> 04:36:08,364
[SPEAKER_56]: We need to get back to get these kids.

3185
04:36:08,805 --> 04:36:10,846
[SPEAKER_56]: We need to focus on what the kids are doing right now.

3186
04:36:10,906 --> 04:36:12,007
[SPEAKER_56]: Let's get them back in school.

3187
04:36:12,027 --> 04:36:12,908
[SPEAKER_56]: Let's get them safe.

3188
04:36:13,309 --> 04:36:14,710
[SPEAKER_56]: What's going to happen in September?

3189
04:36:15,931 --> 04:36:20,195
[SPEAKER_56]: I didn't get to watch my daughter cross the platform holding her diploma this year.

3190
04:36:20,876 --> 04:36:24,279
[SPEAKER_56]: Still pretty ticked off about that because it was opportunity for that.

3191
04:36:24,319 --> 04:36:25,480
[SPEAKER_56]: But that's not what this is about.

3192
04:36:26,868 --> 04:36:29,270
[SPEAKER_56]: But I don't wanna see that happen again to the kids in 2021.

3193
04:36:29,510 --> 04:36:32,552
[SPEAKER_56]: Can we just redirect the focus to where it needs to be right now?

3194
04:36:33,252 --> 04:36:37,595
[SPEAKER_56]: This is not going to change the city right now.

3195
04:36:37,715 --> 04:36:38,716
[SPEAKER_56]: We need help right now.

3196
04:36:38,736 --> 04:36:40,157
[SPEAKER_36]: Tony, you have 15 seconds.

3197
04:36:40,177 --> 04:36:46,620
[SPEAKER_56]: I appreciate you listening again, but listening is great, but acting, that's really what we need here.

3198
04:36:47,241 --> 04:36:48,722
[SPEAKER_56]: We need some real action.

3199
04:36:49,682 --> 04:36:51,544
[SPEAKER_56]: Table this, put it off for now.

3200
04:36:51,824 --> 04:36:53,405
[SPEAKER_56]: We don't need to deal with this right now.

3201
04:36:53,425 --> 04:36:54,765
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Tony.

3202
04:36:54,785 --> 04:36:55,406
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

3203
04:37:02,377 --> 04:37:02,748
[SPEAKER_39]: Melissa?

3204
04:37:06,701 --> 04:37:10,544
[SPEAKER_53]: Hi, I just wanna go back to what I said earlier.

3205
04:37:11,485 --> 04:37:19,833
[SPEAKER_53]: A little bit ago, a few minutes ago, it was said that the school is not just for the Italian Americans, it was for the entire community.

3206
04:37:20,413 --> 04:37:33,605
[SPEAKER_53]: So my question is, if it's for the entire community to decide, why was it just decided by the school committee and not, there was no way to allow the entire community to vote whether or not the name should change?

3207
04:37:35,065 --> 04:37:37,526
[SPEAKER_53]: I am having a little bit of difficulty here.

3208
04:37:55,731 --> 04:37:57,131
[SPEAKER_53]: whether or not the name should change.

3209
04:37:57,432 --> 04:38:06,714
[SPEAKER_53]: And then from there, if again, it is voted on that it should change, then we talk about how we would go about coming up with a name.

3210
04:38:06,734 --> 04:38:14,897
[SPEAKER_53]: Because again, I think getting the kids back into school and how all that's going to happen right now is a much more important issue than changing the name.

3211
04:38:15,537 --> 04:38:15,857
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

3212
04:38:16,497 --> 04:38:16,917
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

3213
04:38:17,517 --> 04:38:19,178
[SPEAKER_40]: Member Van de Kloethe and Member McLaughlin.

3214
04:38:19,518 --> 04:38:21,659
[SPEAKER_33]: So the answer simply is by statute,

3215
04:38:23,106 --> 04:38:26,368
[SPEAKER_33]: The naming of school buildings belongs to the school committee.

3216
04:38:27,208 --> 04:38:29,150
[SPEAKER_33]: The responsibility belongs to the school committee.

3217
04:38:30,590 --> 04:38:30,951
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

3218
04:38:31,011 --> 04:38:31,791
[SPEAKER_40]: Member McLaughlin.

3219
04:38:33,452 --> 04:38:34,193
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Mayor.

3220
04:38:34,873 --> 04:38:41,537
[SPEAKER_37]: I took some notes and wanted to answer some of the questions that I've been hearing repeated, and I hope that this is helpful.

3221
04:38:42,377 --> 04:38:45,519
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm hearing often, you know, why aren't we having a community meeting on this?

3222
04:38:45,619 --> 04:38:46,800
[SPEAKER_37]: And I am asking

3223
04:38:47,466 --> 04:38:48,506
[SPEAKER_37]: because I'm confused here.

3224
04:38:49,267 --> 04:38:49,927
[SPEAKER_37]: What is this?

3225
04:38:50,007 --> 04:38:52,108
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a community meeting.

3226
04:38:52,248 --> 04:38:57,830
[SPEAKER_37]: People are saying we've been talking for over four hours and we have been talking for over four hours.

3227
04:38:57,950 --> 04:39:02,872
[SPEAKER_37]: And we've also had previous meetings that were talking for over four hours about the same issue.

3228
04:39:02,912 --> 04:39:07,054
[SPEAKER_37]: So I don't understand when people are saying, why aren't we having a community meeting?

3229
04:39:07,734 --> 04:39:09,174
[SPEAKER_37]: That's exactly what this is tonight.

3230
04:39:10,235 --> 04:39:14,497
[SPEAKER_37]: When people are saying, slow it down, I also feel like we voted on this in June, 2020.

3231
04:39:16,368 --> 04:39:19,752
[SPEAKER_37]: It's March 2021, a year almost has gone by.

3232
04:39:19,772 --> 04:39:28,101
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know how people don't think that that was a slowed down process, frankly, with everything that had been happening.

3233
04:39:28,762 --> 04:39:34,528
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think if people remember from back then, the question was, if not now, when?

3234
04:39:34,749 --> 04:39:35,830
[SPEAKER_37]: And that was over a year ago.

3235
04:39:37,719 --> 04:39:41,684
[SPEAKER_37]: And the other question is, if not us, who?

3236
04:39:42,385 --> 04:39:44,428
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think that that's a legitimate question.

3237
04:39:44,748 --> 04:39:48,212
[SPEAKER_37]: Budget will be part of the advisory committee.

3238
04:39:48,733 --> 04:39:54,801
[SPEAKER_37]: Having people participate in the name change, that's also part of the advisory committee, which is why we chose an advisory committee.

3239
04:39:56,678 --> 04:39:58,200
[SPEAKER_37]: Again, the vote was already approved.

3240
04:39:58,600 --> 04:40:07,550
[SPEAKER_37]: When people keep talking about whether or not we should do this, I think that, again, we have to note this was already approved a year ago.

3241
04:40:09,091 --> 04:40:10,953
[SPEAKER_37]: And then what was the other thing?

3242
04:40:14,893 --> 04:40:23,215
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, and again, the administration is working very hard and has been working very hard this past year to get our children back to school.

3243
04:40:23,235 --> 04:40:25,615
[SPEAKER_37]: And they're continuing to do that.

3244
04:40:25,695 --> 04:40:29,776
[SPEAKER_37]: And we are involved in the process, but we are not the people who choose the process.

3245
04:40:29,836 --> 04:40:39,298
[SPEAKER_37]: Again, our role as school committee members is to decide policy, to approve a budget, and to evaluate the superintendent.

3246
04:40:41,538 --> 04:40:49,220
[SPEAKER_37]: It is not to do the daily work of getting our kids back into school, although I believe it is also very much a priority in our community and has been a focus.

3247
04:40:50,040 --> 04:40:52,240
[SPEAKER_37]: And the administration has been working very hard on that.

3248
04:40:52,300 --> 04:40:54,861
[SPEAKER_37]: So I hope that was an answer to some of the questions.

3249
04:40:58,701 --> 04:41:07,103
[SPEAKER_41]: And I just have to point out, I mean, we also have to remember that when it came before our desks in an agenda on a Friday,

3250
04:41:07,725 --> 04:41:09,466
[SPEAKER_41]: this was voted on on a Monday.

3251
04:41:09,586 --> 04:41:13,787
[SPEAKER_41]: So I agree, we've had many long nights on this.

3252
04:41:13,927 --> 04:41:20,090
[SPEAKER_41]: We've been able to, since then, read emails, talk to people, but we did take the vote.

3253
04:41:20,850 --> 04:41:27,233
[SPEAKER_41]: I know three of us voted to table it to allow more time for public engagement, but we did take a vote.

3254
04:41:27,813 --> 04:41:33,335
[SPEAKER_41]: We learned about it on a Friday and we took a vote on a Monday and people are upset, we have to acknowledge that.

3255
04:41:34,202 --> 04:41:41,327
[SPEAKER_37]: I know we have been for a year, Mayor, and I appreciate that, but we also voted six, you know, six to approve it.

3256
04:41:41,487 --> 04:41:44,128
[SPEAKER_37]: So everybody here, you know, voted to approve it.

3257
04:41:44,248 --> 04:41:47,590
[SPEAKER_37]: And everybody, again, to member Graham's point earlier, has to own that.

3258
04:41:48,151 --> 04:41:55,996
[SPEAKER_37]: And then, you know, and also having a commitment to anti-racism in our city and, you know, having an anti-racist task force at our schools.

3259
04:41:56,036 --> 04:42:00,138
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I think that this is the point that we have to, this is hard work.

3260
04:42:00,158 --> 04:42:00,919
[SPEAKER_37]: This is messy work.

3261
04:42:00,979 --> 04:42:01,919
[SPEAKER_37]: It's painful work.

3262
04:42:02,500 --> 04:42:03,000
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not easy.

3263
04:42:03,971 --> 04:42:04,552
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

3264
04:42:09,422 --> 04:42:09,903
[SPEAKER_39]: Amy and Anna.

3265
04:42:14,983 --> 04:42:31,247
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to say to everyone who's talking about the manner in which this resolution was introduced or the timetable, nearly every social progressive stride that's been made has faced the same complaints.

3266
04:42:31,948 --> 04:42:33,108
[SPEAKER_31]: You didn't do it in the right way.

3267
04:42:33,128 --> 04:42:34,508
[SPEAKER_31]: You didn't ask the right way.

3268
04:42:34,528 --> 04:42:37,149
[SPEAKER_31]: You didn't give us enough time.

3269
04:42:39,100 --> 04:42:40,440
[SPEAKER_31]: We should be doing other things.

3270
04:42:40,840 --> 04:42:51,185
[SPEAKER_31]: So anytime there's been any sort of civil rights advancement, when women earned the right to vote, we were just coming out of World War I. And during that time, it was, we've got to build and repair the country.

3271
04:42:51,265 --> 04:42:53,146
[SPEAKER_31]: Now is not the time to give women the right to vote.

3272
04:42:53,547 --> 04:42:54,767
[SPEAKER_31]: It's never the right time.

3273
04:42:56,288 --> 04:42:57,829
[SPEAKER_31]: You have to do it sometime, you know?

3274
04:42:59,266 --> 04:43:02,068
[SPEAKER_31]: When your laundry is piled up to the ceiling, you don't want to do it either.

3275
04:43:02,108 --> 04:43:04,810
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not the right time to do the laundry until you're out of clothes.

3276
04:43:05,130 --> 04:43:06,091
[SPEAKER_31]: And then you have to do it.

3277
04:43:06,571 --> 04:43:13,536
[SPEAKER_31]: And it doesn't matter whether or not you feel like doing it or you like how the laundry pile was presented to you.

3278
04:43:13,576 --> 04:43:16,718
[SPEAKER_31]: You have to do it because we have laws about going outside naked.

3279
04:43:18,239 --> 04:43:26,825
[SPEAKER_31]: So I would ask those people who are complaining about how this came about or the timetable, when would be the right time?

3280
04:43:27,446 --> 04:43:29,487
[SPEAKER_31]: How could someone have presented it to you?

3281
04:43:30,008 --> 04:43:32,290
[SPEAKER_31]: I feel like if you really ask yourself,

3282
04:43:33,130 --> 04:43:34,431
[SPEAKER_31]: You never would have been okay with it.

3283
04:43:34,531 --> 04:43:38,434
[SPEAKER_31]: You were always going to be upset that the name of the school was changing.

3284
04:43:38,454 --> 04:43:40,415
[SPEAKER_31]: It was never going to be the right time or the right way.

3285
04:43:40,835 --> 04:43:45,618
[SPEAKER_31]: And those are just rhetorical stalls to progress.

3286
04:43:45,979 --> 04:43:51,903
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'll just close by saying I'm really fed up with all of the attacks, particularly on Member Rousseau.

3287
04:43:52,583 --> 04:43:55,164
[SPEAKER_31]: Member Graham, Member McLaughlin, Mayor Mastone.

3288
04:43:55,985 --> 04:43:58,106
[SPEAKER_31]: Thousands of people elected these folks as members.

3289
04:43:58,686 --> 04:44:00,467
[SPEAKER_31]: Member Rousseau represents me and my values.

3290
04:44:00,867 --> 04:44:02,067
[SPEAKER_31]: I think he's doing a great job.

3291
04:44:02,527 --> 04:44:04,448
[SPEAKER_31]: So do the thousands of other people who voted for him.

3292
04:44:04,909 --> 04:44:07,050
[SPEAKER_31]: Same with- You have 15 seconds, ma'am.

3293
04:44:07,790 --> 04:44:08,330
[SPEAKER_31]: Et cetera.

3294
04:44:08,790 --> 04:44:10,831
[SPEAKER_31]: So please stop attacking our members.

3295
04:44:12,412 --> 04:44:12,992
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

3296
04:44:17,454 --> 04:44:21,296
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm losing track of who already spoke on this, but I think Nicole's next and then Lee.

3297
04:44:23,737 --> 04:44:24,719
[SPEAKER_41]: is waving at me.

3298
04:44:26,882 --> 04:44:27,583
[SPEAKER_40]: So, Nicole.

3299
04:44:31,629 --> 04:44:31,989
[SPEAKER_57]: Hello?

3300
04:44:32,790 --> 04:44:32,971
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3301
04:44:34,312 --> 04:44:35,553
[SPEAKER_57]: Hello, I'm sorry if I have an echo.

3302
04:44:36,033 --> 04:44:42,037
[SPEAKER_57]: So I just want to touch base with what the council member just said about everyone was informed.

3303
04:44:42,357 --> 04:44:46,100
[SPEAKER_57]: You keep on saying that everyone was informed, but that you know that is not true.

3304
04:44:46,560 --> 04:44:51,083
[SPEAKER_57]: Just like Brianna just said, you had two days to make this a point to change this.

3305
04:44:51,403 --> 04:44:54,505
[SPEAKER_57]: The community was not involved, and you all know that.

3306
04:44:54,645 --> 04:44:57,427
[SPEAKER_57]: So to say that they were is just an insult to us.

3307
04:44:58,610 --> 04:45:04,975
[SPEAKER_57]: As for Paul, the way he acts and just his smirking on here is a complete insult.

3308
04:45:05,816 --> 04:45:07,077
[SPEAKER_57]: Everyone knows what Paul said.

3309
04:45:07,117 --> 04:45:11,180
[SPEAKER_57]: If you go on my private, my page, you'll see a video.

3310
04:45:11,641 --> 04:45:13,622
[SPEAKER_57]: Point of privilege, member Van de Kloot.

3311
04:45:13,902 --> 04:45:17,625
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, I think it's inappropriate to single out a school committee members.

3312
04:45:18,586 --> 04:45:24,571
[SPEAKER_33]: And I just, I think it's appropriate not to let that comment continue.

3313
04:45:24,891 --> 04:45:26,853
[SPEAKER_41]: If you could address the chair, please.

3314
04:45:28,462 --> 04:45:28,822
[SPEAKER_41]: Nicole?

3315
04:45:29,402 --> 04:45:29,662
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3316
04:45:30,783 --> 04:45:31,483
[SPEAKER_57]: I won't say that.

3317
04:45:32,043 --> 04:45:32,903
[SPEAKER_57]: It's already out there.

3318
04:45:32,963 --> 04:45:33,583
[SPEAKER_57]: Everyone knows.

3319
04:45:33,844 --> 04:45:41,626
[SPEAKER_57]: I just don't think it's fair for someone to say, well, I want to select X, Y, Z, when they already put out what they want.

3320
04:45:41,846 --> 04:45:44,026
[SPEAKER_57]: And what they want is very biased.

3321
04:45:44,307 --> 04:45:48,708
[SPEAKER_57]: So I'm not unsure why these people are even allowed to have a say in anything.

3322
04:45:48,808 --> 04:45:51,268
[SPEAKER_57]: And Brianna, I know you know this is not right.

3323
04:45:51,869 --> 04:45:55,970
[SPEAKER_57]: I mean, just looking at his smirk is an insult to you, nevermind all of us.

3324
04:45:56,750 --> 04:46:04,640
[SPEAKER_57]: That's all I want to say it's already out there, and this has not been brought up I have people who have been coming to me saying like oh my god I didn't even know that this is happening.

3325
04:46:05,020 --> 04:46:12,510
[SPEAKER_57]: It's not now until us the community has brought this forward to the rest of the community that this is going on and now people are outrage.

3326
04:46:13,070 --> 04:46:16,553
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm supposed to be speaking with the Boston Globe tomorrow about this whole issue.

3327
04:46:16,873 --> 04:46:21,036
[SPEAKER_57]: And I said, I'm going to wait till after this is over because I'm so heated about this right now.

3328
04:46:21,076 --> 04:46:35,227
[SPEAKER_57]: And I want, I don't want to say something non-biased, but I'm just so saddened by what is happening and why we are still concentrating on this when our kids, we just got literally told that our kids need to be back in school by April 4th.

3329
04:46:35,628 --> 04:46:39,751
[SPEAKER_57]: My son is afraid to go to school because he can't wash his hand because there's no paper towels.

3330
04:46:40,327 --> 04:46:43,569
[SPEAKER_57]: Nicole, we have 15 seconds.

3331
04:46:43,910 --> 04:46:45,791
[SPEAKER_57]: This is the stuff that is important.

3332
04:46:46,532 --> 04:46:49,414
[SPEAKER_57]: Right now, I really believe that this should be tabled, if anything.

3333
04:46:49,754 --> 04:46:52,156
[SPEAKER_57]: You obviously know I don't think we should change the name at all.

3334
04:46:52,436 --> 04:46:54,677
[SPEAKER_57]: But right now, I think this should be tabled.

3335
04:46:54,897 --> 04:46:57,519
[SPEAKER_57]: We have too many council members in the mix right here.

3336
04:46:57,539 --> 04:46:58,460
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Nicole.

3337
04:46:58,560 --> 04:46:58,980
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

3338
04:46:59,881 --> 04:47:00,321
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you.

3339
04:47:03,404 --> 04:47:03,824
[SPEAKER_57]: Lee.

3340
04:47:11,923 --> 04:47:12,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Unmute, okay.

3341
04:47:13,744 --> 04:47:15,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for listening to me again.

3342
04:47:16,826 --> 04:47:25,270
[SPEAKER_16]: I honestly have to say, I've been listening to all of your statements and I do try to look at the whole picture.

3343
04:47:25,950 --> 04:47:34,575
[SPEAKER_16]: I have my thoughts in that, but I try to give the benefit of the doubt, but I really have to say here,

3344
04:47:35,885 --> 04:47:54,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham, I think all of the referrals that you gave in regards to, you know, needing to get the kids back to school and the time frame and this, that or whatever, I felt that you gave a perfect example of why this should be tabled.

3345
04:47:55,296 --> 04:48:00,778
[SPEAKER_16]: your statements was a perfect example why this was pushed too quickly.

3346
04:48:00,798 --> 04:48:04,159
[SPEAKER_41]: The thing is- If I could adjust the chair, please.

3347
04:48:04,519 --> 04:48:05,299
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Mayor.

3348
04:48:05,880 --> 04:48:10,181
[SPEAKER_37]: When people address the members, it becomes very personal.

3349
04:48:10,201 --> 04:48:10,721
[SPEAKER_37]: Excuse me.

3350
04:48:11,201 --> 04:48:11,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

3351
04:48:12,902 --> 04:48:13,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me.

3352
04:48:13,542 --> 04:48:17,564
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think that

3353
04:48:20,719 --> 04:48:27,324
[SPEAKER_16]: It was rushed through, it is not a fair situation, and a lot of people still don't know about it.

3354
04:48:27,464 --> 04:48:30,406
[SPEAKER_16]: You say about having, we're having a meeting here.

3355
04:48:30,887 --> 04:48:33,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, how many people don't have computers?

3356
04:48:33,749 --> 04:48:36,971
[SPEAKER_16]: How many people of ages don't know how to use it?

3357
04:48:37,472 --> 04:48:46,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's be fair, there should have been a meeting, say at Medford High School, set up somewhere with the proper,

3358
04:48:47,279 --> 04:48:50,561
[SPEAKER_16]: distancing, so it gave the community to go.

3359
04:48:50,981 --> 04:48:52,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Enough with the backdoor business.

3360
04:48:53,302 --> 04:49:07,150
[SPEAKER_16]: And my other situation is I 100% think the administration should have the control over picking who was on this, because there was definitely bias on the part of our school committee members.

3361
04:49:07,210 --> 04:49:08,471
[SPEAKER_16]: You have 15 seconds.

3362
04:49:08,971 --> 04:49:09,371
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm good.

3363
04:49:09,391 --> 04:49:10,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

3364
04:49:13,379 --> 04:49:15,701
[SPEAKER_41]: I lost track a little bit of who spoke.

3365
04:49:15,801 --> 04:49:17,302
[SPEAKER_41]: I know Ingrid and Jessica spoke.

3366
04:49:18,442 --> 04:49:22,925
[SPEAKER_41]: We have to move on to our final page or so.

3367
04:49:22,945 --> 04:49:30,230
[SPEAKER_41]: Hendricks, I don't think you spoke on this issue.

3368
04:49:30,250 --> 04:49:31,111
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm trying to keep track.

3369
04:49:31,211 --> 04:49:32,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I would appreciate that.

3370
04:49:32,932 --> 04:49:33,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

3371
04:49:36,314 --> 04:49:41,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Mayor, I wanted to, you know, point out that

3372
04:49:44,025 --> 04:49:58,816
[SPEAKER_03]: This came, the energy to make this happen occurred because of a movement that happened in our nation to combat systemic racism.

3373
04:49:59,657 --> 04:50:08,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It was timely, and those of us who pay attention to what happens in the city saw that the meeting was happening,

3374
04:50:10,280 --> 04:50:12,921
[SPEAKER_03]: and we got the information that it was going to happen.

3375
04:50:13,701 --> 04:50:22,562
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked to our friends and our family members that it was gonna be under discussion and hundreds of people showed up to that meeting.

3376
04:50:24,003 --> 04:50:26,043
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been discussed.

3377
04:50:27,583 --> 04:50:35,045
[SPEAKER_03]: If people are concerned about getting our kids back into schools so they can catch COVID, then let's,

3378
04:50:35,882 --> 04:50:37,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at it this way.

3379
04:50:37,223 --> 04:50:43,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stop complaining about what has already been decided and move forward.

3380
04:50:44,268 --> 04:50:45,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get a good name.

3381
04:50:46,630 --> 04:50:47,570
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to change.

3382
04:50:48,411 --> 04:50:48,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

3383
04:50:48,811 --> 04:50:51,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

3384
04:50:54,836 --> 04:50:56,797
[SPEAKER_40]: Last one, we'll move on Brie.

3385
04:51:01,966 --> 04:51:03,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, can everyone hear me?

3386
04:51:03,487 --> 04:51:03,707
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

3387
04:51:04,707 --> 04:51:06,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool, thank you for letting me speak again.

3388
04:51:06,528 --> 04:51:11,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Honestly though, Hendricks just kind of hit most of it on the head for me.

3389
04:51:11,469 --> 04:51:21,353
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just reiterating that you all are elected officials entrusted with this responsibility of naming schools.

3390
04:51:21,373 --> 04:51:22,913
[SPEAKER_17]: This falls under your jurisdiction.

3391
04:51:23,313 --> 04:51:25,854
[SPEAKER_17]: You were elected, elected officials did their job.

3392
04:51:26,434 --> 04:51:27,435
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the process.

3393
04:51:28,619 --> 04:51:32,462
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, this is exactly how this is supposed to work.

3394
04:51:33,943 --> 04:51:42,029
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wanted to reiterate and thank you guys for persevering through all of this.

3395
04:51:42,189 --> 04:51:52,717
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it also stands to be called out that when people claim that you are not listening to them, at this point, what they really mean is that you're not agreeing with them.

3396
04:51:56,465 --> 04:51:58,867
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys are in an incredibly difficult position.

3397
04:51:59,427 --> 04:52:00,368
[SPEAKER_17]: This is messy work.

3398
04:52:01,008 --> 04:52:05,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Doing the right and equitable thing is usually messy work.

3399
04:52:06,231 --> 04:52:09,093
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no way you're going to make everyone happy here.

3400
04:52:10,094 --> 04:52:18,920
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think as part of making Medford equitable and inclusive for all, this is absolutely the right decision.

3401
04:52:19,898 --> 04:52:27,783
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd also like to point out that this new directive to have all of the kids in school in a month is just that.

3402
04:52:28,143 --> 04:52:28,963
[SPEAKER_17]: This is brand new.

3403
04:52:29,504 --> 04:52:37,448
[SPEAKER_17]: So people using that as a reason to further kick this down the road, it's not valid.

3404
04:52:38,309 --> 04:52:41,611
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, get our kids in school.

3405
04:52:41,631 --> 04:52:45,873
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys have fought about that for months when we're following state guidelines.

3406
04:52:46,493 --> 04:52:48,535
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't actually know what people expected you to do there.

3407
04:52:49,338 --> 04:52:56,240
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the fact that there's this new mandate that says, okay, now, thanks.

3408
04:52:56,680 --> 04:52:58,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Now they all need to be back in a month.

3409
04:52:59,321 --> 04:53:03,682
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see that as a valid reason to deter things that were already in progress.

3410
04:53:04,042 --> 04:53:05,962
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

3411
04:53:07,463 --> 04:53:07,923
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

3412
04:53:08,583 --> 04:53:16,205
[SPEAKER_41]: If we remember Graham, if you could screen share, we can move on to finish this document.

3413
04:53:19,306 --> 04:53:19,606
[SPEAKER_41]: Please.

3414
04:53:19,626 --> 04:53:48,023
[SPEAKER_39]: I have a tooth fairy to get to.

3415
04:53:52,045 --> 04:53:53,626
[SPEAKER_41]: My son was very upset yesterday.

3416
04:53:53,666 --> 04:53:54,707
[SPEAKER_41]: The tooth fairy didn't come.

3417
04:53:55,768 --> 04:53:57,969
[SPEAKER_62]: The good thing they work all night, those tooth fairies.

3418
04:53:59,090 --> 04:54:02,292
[SPEAKER_41]: Not last night.

3419
04:54:03,233 --> 04:54:04,634
[SPEAKER_41]: Some calm of relief.

3420
04:54:04,874 --> 04:54:05,174
[SPEAKER_41]: I know.

3421
04:54:05,194 --> 04:54:05,615
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi.

3422
04:54:06,876 --> 04:54:11,059
[SPEAKER_21]: I will admit I was not sad when the tooth fairy was discovered.

3423
04:54:11,419 --> 04:54:13,340
[SPEAKER_21]: It's hard to stay up late.

3424
04:54:14,221 --> 04:54:19,485
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just wondering, have we actually finalized the section on the selection?

3425
04:54:19,585 --> 04:54:20,886
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't think we had, but I,

3426
04:54:22,026 --> 04:54:23,967
[SPEAKER_41]: No, I heard the word move on.

3427
04:54:23,987 --> 04:54:25,608
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, I'm hoping we can do that now.

3428
04:54:25,628 --> 04:54:28,149
[SPEAKER_41]: I know Memogram's going to share the screen.

3429
04:54:28,189 --> 04:54:28,569
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

3430
04:54:30,110 --> 04:54:39,093
[SPEAKER_41]: I let people talk because I didn't know if this was going to lead to a vote, so we can just kind of finalize it.

3431
04:54:40,954 --> 04:54:42,315
[SPEAKER_41]: Is there a motion on the floor?

3432
04:54:43,601 --> 04:54:45,843
[SPEAKER_41]: Is there a motion on the floor to change this in any way?

3433
04:54:45,863 --> 04:54:59,415
[SPEAKER_41]: So that we can just- On the first sentence, it should be the, the should be removed are the- Up to four individuals selected from the Columbus school staff.

3434
04:54:59,435 --> 04:55:01,157
[SPEAKER_41]: Oh, wait, no, maybe it should be up to four.

3435
04:55:06,872 --> 04:55:13,480
[SPEAKER_33]: Why don't you go say the individual selected from the Columbus School and then parentheses say up to four.

3436
04:55:14,321 --> 04:55:18,446
[SPEAKER_33]: Principal Kathy Kay and the one MHA student will be announced.

3437
04:55:35,307 --> 04:55:54,359
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, and then each school committee member, right now it reads, each school committee member will select a member for the advisory committee from the valid applications received and will state the names publicly in the event that an applicant is selected by more than one school committee member, the members will continue to name applicants until a total of seven advisory committee members have been made by the school committee.

3438
04:55:54,999 --> 04:55:58,361
[SPEAKER_41]: Three additional names will be selected by lottery from the remaining applicants.

3439
04:56:00,662 --> 04:56:01,823
[SPEAKER_21]: The mayor will- Eric, can I make a motion?

3440
04:56:02,263 --> 04:56:03,384
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, member- Sorry, I'm sorry.

3441
04:56:03,840 --> 04:56:06,021
[SPEAKER_21]: Nope, member Rousseau, on those three points.

3442
04:56:08,382 --> 04:56:13,865
[SPEAKER_21]: Number two, I would motion to change that to two per member.

3443
04:56:18,547 --> 04:56:18,867
[SPEAKER_32]: Second.

3444
04:56:26,751 --> 04:56:27,852
[SPEAKER_49]: That'd be a big committee.

3445
04:56:29,152 --> 04:56:30,873
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, I guess how many committee members do it?

3446
04:56:33,683 --> 04:56:41,785
[SPEAKER_41]: Can everybody just state a number of how many committee members you're thinking, you're not held to it, just so we can kind of have an idea moving forward through this list.

3447
04:56:42,665 --> 04:56:43,625
[SPEAKER_31]: Can I put up one finger?

3448
04:56:44,885 --> 04:56:45,746
[SPEAKER_41]: You want one member?

3449
04:56:45,766 --> 04:56:46,106
[SPEAKER_41]: 20 plus.

3450
04:56:48,546 --> 04:56:49,486
[SPEAKER_41]: Paul, you want 20 plus?

3451
04:56:49,546 --> 04:56:50,947
[SPEAKER_37]: I would say 13.

3452
04:56:51,067 --> 04:56:51,147
[SPEAKER_37]: Or 11.

3453
04:56:51,247 --> 04:56:52,207
[SPEAKER_37]: I would say no more than 15.

3454
04:56:52,247 --> 04:56:54,747
[SPEAKER_37]: I was at 15.

3455
04:57:06,738 --> 04:57:07,059
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

3456
04:57:07,079 --> 04:57:09,222
[SPEAKER_62]: Member Graham.

3457
04:57:09,282 --> 04:57:09,903
[SPEAKER_62]: We have.

3458
04:57:20,256 --> 04:57:27,541
[SPEAKER_62]: The number of people has to be commiserate with, I know, but the number of people has to be commiserate with the work that has to get done.

3459
04:57:28,281 --> 04:57:40,289
[SPEAKER_62]: So we can have a small committee if we are gonna limit the universe of what we're asking them to consider, but we're asking them to do a tremendous amount of work.

3460
04:57:40,309 --> 04:57:43,090
[SPEAKER_62]: We're not, this is a volunteer committee.

3461
04:57:43,571 --> 04:57:45,352
[SPEAKER_62]: Like there's just, you know,

3462
04:57:46,372 --> 04:57:51,997
[SPEAKER_62]: we need to be respectful of the work that we're asking people to do and make sure that it's reasonable.

3463
04:57:52,598 --> 04:58:05,650
[SPEAKER_62]: So that is, I would love for us to have a smaller committee, but I don't think that makes any sense if we are gonna dump hundreds and hundreds of suggestions on their lap.

3464
04:58:06,687 --> 04:58:20,441
[SPEAKER_62]: Because I think what I want is for them to vet through these suggestions and remove the Schoolie McSchoolface suggestions and all the other things that are non-contenders off the bat.

3465
04:58:20,541 --> 04:58:25,466
[SPEAKER_62]: But I think people are going to put forward names that are not household names.

3466
04:58:25,526 --> 04:58:27,748
[SPEAKER_62]: And somebody is going to have to vet through

3467
04:58:28,929 --> 04:58:31,911
[SPEAKER_62]: that information, it's a lot of work, potentially.

3468
04:58:31,931 --> 04:58:38,214
[SPEAKER_62]: I mean, we just don't know how much work it is, but I think we have to be prepared for the fact it's a lot of work.

3469
04:58:39,475 --> 04:58:39,755
[SPEAKER_33]: Mayor?

3470
04:58:41,776 --> 04:58:42,836
[SPEAKER_40]: Member Van de Kloet.

3471
04:58:43,517 --> 04:58:57,604
[SPEAKER_33]: So I would say the individuals, and instead of saying up to four, let's say up to three selected from the Columbus School staff, Principal Kathy Kaye, so that's four from the Columbus School,

3472
04:58:58,311 --> 04:58:59,792
[SPEAKER_33]: one Medford High School student.

3473
04:59:00,593 --> 04:59:08,360
[SPEAKER_33]: If we're saying that we're each gonna pick two, so we're up to five and two would be, 14 would be 19.

3474
04:59:08,961 --> 04:59:11,062
[SPEAKER_33]: Then the chair would be number 20.

3475
04:59:13,665 --> 04:59:20,611
[SPEAKER_33]: And the member from the historical commission is ex officio non-voting.

3476
04:59:22,423 --> 04:59:23,983
[SPEAKER_33]: So I have 20 voting members.

3477
04:59:24,063 --> 04:59:29,824
[SPEAKER_33]: Now the question is whether we're gonna have those three selected by lottery.

3478
04:59:30,365 --> 04:59:34,285
[SPEAKER_33]: That was in direct response to Kathy's concerns.

3479
04:59:36,926 --> 04:59:37,246
[SPEAKER_33]: You know.

3480
04:59:37,266 --> 04:59:42,327
[SPEAKER_41]: Can I just stop you, member Cress, I didn't hear you.

3481
04:59:42,487 --> 04:59:44,087
[SPEAKER_41]: How many members were you thinking?

3482
04:59:44,267 --> 04:59:47,248
[SPEAKER_41]: Just so we can, I didn't hear what your number was.

3483
04:59:47,947 --> 04:59:55,653
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, I wanted to get some clarification, because I thought Mr. Russo said that we couldn't do a lottery as per our policy.

3484
04:59:55,993 --> 05:00:04,699
[SPEAKER_46]: So I was going to ask, I thought we couldn't do a lottery, but then I'm seeing the lottery is still in the application process.

3485
05:00:04,919 --> 05:00:08,082
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, we can take it out.

3486
05:00:08,322 --> 05:00:11,324
[SPEAKER_41]: We agreed to do at least three of the lottery.

3487
05:00:11,364 --> 05:00:14,987
[SPEAKER_41]: The school committee sets the policy, and we can change the policy.

3488
05:00:15,723 --> 05:00:22,068
[SPEAKER_41]: what do we feel is best to move forward with the committee to do such important work as to change the name of the Columbus School?

3489
05:00:23,129 --> 05:00:26,892
[SPEAKER_41]: I think we all were in agreement, there should be some component of the lottery.

3490
05:00:26,952 --> 05:00:30,695
[SPEAKER_41]: So I would say leave that in there and we'll change our other policy if we need to.

3491
05:00:31,335 --> 05:00:36,720
[SPEAKER_41]: But for right now, I know Kathy, that means a lot to you to have some component as a lottery.

3492
05:00:37,040 --> 05:00:39,882
[SPEAKER_41]: So I agree that that should remain.

3493
05:00:39,902 --> 05:00:43,225
[SPEAKER_41]: And I believe other committee members did as well.

3494
05:00:43,265 --> 05:00:44,866
[SPEAKER_41]: So I feel like that's something we agreed on.

3495
05:00:47,757 --> 05:00:49,839
[SPEAKER_46]: I agree to the lottery.

3496
05:00:49,859 --> 05:01:03,751
[SPEAKER_46]: I think that maybe one member, one, the school committee would select one applicant each and then the additional applicants would then go into the lottery.

3497
05:01:03,771 --> 05:01:11,218
[SPEAKER_46]: So that might be maybe a total of six lottery and each school committee member picking an applicant.

3498
05:01:13,809 --> 05:01:15,450
[SPEAKER_41]: That would depend on how many members we have.

3499
05:01:15,510 --> 05:01:25,436
[SPEAKER_41]: So do you believe that there should be 11, 13, 15, 17, 21, because there's three of us at least that believe it should be 15 or less.

3500
05:01:25,976 --> 05:01:30,178
[SPEAKER_41]: And if it's 15 or less, it's gonna be the Columbus school individuals.

3501
05:01:30,358 --> 05:01:33,000
[SPEAKER_41]: It's gonna be probably one person per member.

3502
05:01:33,480 --> 05:01:40,424
[SPEAKER_41]: It's gonna be one high school student, three from, you know, in a number from the lottery.

3503
05:01:40,484 --> 05:01:43,346
[SPEAKER_41]: So we need to get an idea of how many members there would be first.

3504
05:01:45,146 --> 05:01:55,936
[SPEAKER_46]: I think it's going to be closer to 20 because we are giving them such a big task to do all the research.

3505
05:01:57,958 --> 05:02:08,968
[SPEAKER_46]: And based on the current timeline, I've already put my resolution out there for extending the timeline so that they can do the thoughtful discussions.

3506
05:02:10,911 --> 05:02:25,705
[SPEAKER_46]: The way that it's detailed now in such a short amount of time, I think that there would need to be additional members to do the additional research with, you know, to thoroughly, you know, pick those names.

3507
05:02:26,646 --> 05:02:34,393
[SPEAKER_41]: And then Mia, Member McStone, did you give a number for the committee that you're thinking?

3508
05:02:35,394 --> 05:02:35,935
[SPEAKER_49]: I did not.

3509
05:02:39,272 --> 05:02:40,372
[SPEAKER_26]: I see the tiebreaker.

3510
05:02:40,772 --> 05:02:58,858
[SPEAKER_49]: Sorry, I just, I mean, I can see that if they get many names, I know with all the emails we got, I would say we probably were maybe 30 to 40 names were suggested in the emails we received over the last nine months.

3511
05:02:59,718 --> 05:03:01,939
[SPEAKER_49]: So then this is opened up to the community.

3512
05:03:02,975 --> 05:03:04,716
[SPEAKER_49]: I wonder if it will be a large number.

3513
05:03:04,896 --> 05:03:08,717
[SPEAKER_49]: So no, I mean on the advisory committee, how many, right.

3514
05:03:08,737 --> 05:03:15,920
[SPEAKER_49]: If we're thinking about how much work they each have to do, they each get divvied up 40 names each to just, you know, Google their name and see what their story is.

3515
05:03:15,940 --> 05:03:18,581
[SPEAKER_49]: Um, so probably 20.

3516
05:03:18,621 --> 05:03:23,402
[SPEAKER_41]: I think the 21 has it then.

3517
05:03:25,223 --> 05:03:29,385
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, we should base it somewhat off of that because there's four people that believe it should be 21.

3518
05:03:30,575 --> 05:03:32,496
[SPEAKER_41]: three that feel it should be 15 or less.

3519
05:03:32,596 --> 05:03:35,277
[SPEAKER_41]: So it's okay.

3520
05:03:35,717 --> 05:03:37,478
[SPEAKER_41]: That helps to get an idea.

3521
05:03:37,518 --> 05:03:39,359
[SPEAKER_41]: Anybody can change their mind.

3522
05:03:39,499 --> 05:03:40,120
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Russo?

3523
05:03:41,280 --> 05:03:42,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, sorry.

3524
05:03:42,321 --> 05:03:47,443
[SPEAKER_21]: Just briefly, you know, part of the problem with my resolution was there wasn't background.

3525
05:03:47,503 --> 05:03:51,405
[SPEAKER_21]: Member van de Kloots was definitely better at providing sort of context.

3526
05:03:51,825 --> 05:03:59,809
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, while we are not telling the advisory committee how to operate when they get together, that doesn't mean I didn't imagine how they might do their work.

3527
05:04:01,262 --> 05:04:14,988
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, if there's even 30 or 40 names, I mean, I would imagine that they would divide themselves up to do a first pass through them and, you know, divide the work, divide, conquer.

3528
05:04:15,008 --> 05:04:17,889
[SPEAKER_21]: So that was the rationale behind such a large number.

3529
05:04:19,230 --> 05:04:22,431
[SPEAKER_21]: But since we've already landed there, I guess I'm just dragging the meeting out, sorry.

3530
05:04:23,051 --> 05:04:27,673
[SPEAKER_21]: I do, I just feel strongly about being able to pick two members.

3531
05:04:27,733 --> 05:04:28,974
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that, you know,

3532
05:04:30,866 --> 05:04:33,307
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to read a lot of applications.

3533
05:04:34,847 --> 05:04:39,208
[SPEAKER_21]: And does anybody here think we're going to see only one person in that application pool?

3534
05:04:39,228 --> 05:04:40,848
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to be like, I want that person.

3535
05:04:41,748 --> 05:04:44,469
[SPEAKER_21]: And you're going to look at the rest of them and not be like, no, I want that one too.

3536
05:04:44,889 --> 05:04:53,010
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I partially it's self-serving that I don't want to have to just pick one name out of what will surely be many qualified applicants.

3537
05:04:54,511 --> 05:05:00,212
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems like a self-limiting decision that will create

3538
05:05:01,918 --> 05:05:09,002
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't wanna spend a whole weekend trying to pick between my two finalists when we need this many applicants anyways.

3539
05:05:09,202 --> 05:05:13,083
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm sticking to the two and hopefully.

3540
05:05:20,987 --> 05:05:29,251
[SPEAKER_41]: So I would just leave number one, I would put two per member and then I would put all the additional up to 21

3541
05:05:30,848 --> 05:05:31,669
[SPEAKER_41]: pulled from a lottery?

3542
05:05:37,974 --> 05:05:39,855
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm sorry, Mayor, can you say that again?

3543
05:05:41,176 --> 05:05:50,003
[SPEAKER_41]: Leave number one, how it stands up to four selected from the Columbus School staff, Principal Kathy Bay and the one MHS student.

3544
05:05:50,043 --> 05:05:51,965
[SPEAKER_41]: So that's upwards of five.

3545
05:05:52,125 --> 05:05:54,227
[SPEAKER_41]: Then you have two per member, that's 14.

3546
05:05:55,088 --> 05:05:58,791
[SPEAKER_41]: And then the rest shall be pulled from the lottery, whatever that number that.

3547
05:05:59,814 --> 05:06:04,518
[SPEAKER_33]: Mayor, you've already got, you've got five from number one, three.

3548
05:06:05,098 --> 05:06:09,442
[SPEAKER_33]: You've got up to, up to, okay, up to three, four.

3549
05:06:10,503 --> 05:06:13,025
[SPEAKER_33]: Five, so you've got five people in number one.

3550
05:06:13,225 --> 05:06:15,587
[SPEAKER_33]: If we each pick two, that's four.

3551
05:06:15,707 --> 05:06:18,409
[SPEAKER_41]: Four people in number one, four people in number one.

3552
05:06:19,029 --> 05:06:19,850
[SPEAKER_33]: No, no.

3553
05:06:20,090 --> 05:06:21,311
[SPEAKER_41]: Three, sorry, up to three.

3554
05:06:21,351 --> 05:06:22,993
[SPEAKER_62]: If we do up to three.

3555
05:06:23,273 --> 05:06:25,074
[SPEAKER_62]: And MHS student.

3556
05:06:25,234 --> 05:06:28,057
[SPEAKER_62]: Three, Kathy K and MHS student is five.

3557
05:06:28,953 --> 05:06:31,314
[SPEAKER_62]: So I think it's 23.

3558
05:06:31,474 --> 05:06:32,475
[SPEAKER_62]: This math works out to 23.

3559
05:06:32,515 --> 05:06:34,116
[SPEAKER_62]: So 5 plus 14 plus 3 is 17.

3560
05:06:34,176 --> 05:06:38,758
[SPEAKER_62]: Wait, so 5 plus 14 is 19, sorry, plus 3 is 21, plus a chair is 22, and an ex officio.

3561
05:06:38,778 --> 05:06:38,818
[SPEAKER_33]: OK.

3562
05:06:59,600 --> 05:07:02,561
[SPEAKER_62]: So let's talk, it's 23 plus an ex-officio.

3563
05:07:03,521 --> 05:07:03,761
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

3564
05:07:05,302 --> 05:07:05,682
[SPEAKER_21]: It's late.

3565
05:07:06,202 --> 05:07:08,042
[SPEAKER_21]: It's 23 plus an ex-officio.

3566
05:07:09,143 --> 05:07:12,804
[SPEAKER_62]: So 23 voting members and one ex-officio member.

3567
05:07:17,625 --> 05:07:19,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's if we agree to number four.

3568
05:07:27,608 --> 05:07:29,068
[SPEAKER_21]: If I may, Mayor,

3569
05:07:29,847 --> 05:07:34,088
[SPEAKER_21]: So number four was about the mayor appointing the chair.

3570
05:07:34,108 --> 05:07:39,049
[SPEAKER_21]: I had an extensive conversation with member Vander Kloot about this.

3571
05:07:39,749 --> 05:07:45,890
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess I don't feel that the chair doesn't have to be a voting member.

3572
05:07:46,490 --> 05:07:54,512
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that all I care about for the chair is the chair must have experience with open meeting law and Roberts rules.

3573
05:07:56,432 --> 05:07:58,753
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a committee that's even much smaller than 23,

3574
05:08:00,939 --> 05:08:04,201
[SPEAKER_21]: And this committee has to follow open meeting law.

3575
05:08:04,221 --> 05:08:22,252
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't want the person to be learning open meeting law on the fly, because what I worry about is at the end of the day, when the name or names come out, that anybody could take to court the operations of the advisory committee and say, you didn't comply with open meeting law, so your decision doesn't matter.

3576
05:08:23,032 --> 05:08:28,916
[SPEAKER_21]: And we all have to start over, because that to me sounds like a nightmare scenario.

3577
05:08:30,062 --> 05:08:31,203
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't know who to pick.

3578
05:08:31,683 --> 05:08:42,609
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know when the community we can pick to act as the chair and whether or not we would actually want to go through the applicants or if you may have somebody in mind.

3579
05:08:43,529 --> 05:08:44,810
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have anybody in mind.

3580
05:08:45,570 --> 05:08:59,177
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I don't think we necessarily have to land on who that is yet, but if the applications are coming in and it doesn't look like anybody has this experience,

3581
05:09:00,098 --> 05:09:08,785
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, can I just pause on my thought and suggest that we put that on the application form to say, would you be interested in serving as the chair?

3582
05:09:09,426 --> 05:09:11,828
[SPEAKER_21]: And do you have experience in meeting law?

3583
05:09:15,831 --> 05:09:16,892
[SPEAKER_44]: No, don't go backwards.

3584
05:09:18,653 --> 05:09:18,934
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor?

3585
05:09:19,394 --> 05:09:23,838
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, that's not a bad idea, because I don't have anybody in mind right now.

3586
05:09:23,898 --> 05:09:25,259
[SPEAKER_41]: I'd like to see who applies.

3587
05:09:26,720 --> 05:09:27,441
[SPEAKER_41]: Member van de Kloot?

3588
05:09:28,641 --> 05:09:44,808
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, so you, so the chair would be chosen by the mayor before the meeting?

3589
05:09:52,131 --> 05:09:52,411
[SPEAKER_33]: You know.

3590
05:09:52,431 --> 05:09:54,472
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor.

3591
05:09:54,512 --> 05:09:56,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Senator Russo.

3592
05:09:59,123 --> 05:10:04,584
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, Member Radley, I think this is a, you know, there was a couple of spots.

3593
05:10:04,624 --> 05:10:10,206
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we both left it in where there was some squishiness of like, well, what happens if it's like, we'll figure it out if we get there.

3594
05:10:10,726 --> 05:10:21,288
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like, you know, at 11 o'clock after six hours of meeting, I'm comfortable if the members are with saying,

3595
05:10:22,631 --> 05:10:44,965
[SPEAKER_21]: we will discuss it at that meeting of all the people who suggest, you know, we won't come to the meeting and see the names for the first time, but if the superintendent, when she provides the list says there were three people who applied to be the chair, you know, then we could have a conversation about that during the meeting and pick that person sort of separate from pipping the membership, although it is the membership.

3596
05:10:45,005 --> 05:10:46,186
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that's just my thought.

3597
05:10:46,426 --> 05:10:46,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't.

3598
05:10:46,867 --> 05:10:47,547
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm okay with that.

3599
05:10:47,667 --> 05:10:49,788
[SPEAKER_33]: I think I would say chair or co-chairs.

3600
05:10:51,950 --> 05:10:52,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

3601
05:10:53,499 --> 05:10:56,380
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, I just, and that's fine.

3602
05:10:57,820 --> 05:10:59,181
[SPEAKER_33]: However you wanna do it.

3603
05:10:59,201 --> 05:11:07,604
[SPEAKER_62]: So are we saying that we will collectively select the chair?

3604
05:11:08,604 --> 05:11:11,265
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, I was giving the responsibility to the mayor.

3605
05:11:14,686 --> 05:11:20,988
[SPEAKER_33]: We could say that the person that she picks, since we're each picking two, that one of her picks will be

3606
05:11:22,415 --> 05:11:23,616
[SPEAKER_33]: for the chair or co-chairs.

3607
05:11:25,757 --> 05:11:26,057
[SPEAKER_62]: I don't know.

3608
05:11:28,579 --> 05:11:32,461
[SPEAKER_62]: I think it would need to be in excess, otherwise you'd have an even number of people.

3609
05:11:33,882 --> 05:11:38,184
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, but it doesn't necessarily, in terms of the voting, it doesn't necessarily matter.

3610
05:11:38,204 --> 05:11:40,425
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't know.

3611
05:11:41,266 --> 05:11:45,048
[SPEAKER_41]: And number one, we don't know where that's gonna land at one, two, or three, so.

3612
05:11:49,030 --> 05:11:51,732
[SPEAKER_33]: So part of the question is we're also asking whether they're gonna

3613
05:11:52,688 --> 05:11:59,590
[SPEAKER_33]: you know, when we get to the process of how many names they're gonna give us, you know.

3614
05:11:59,731 --> 05:12:06,813
[SPEAKER_62]: So are we saying one of the mayor's appointments will serve as the chair?

3615
05:12:07,693 --> 05:12:07,913
[SPEAKER_33]: Right.

3616
05:12:07,933 --> 05:12:12,175
[SPEAKER_21]: That doesn't feel fair.

3617
05:12:14,176 --> 05:12:20,358
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I just, you know, it doesn't feel fair to take

3618
05:12:20,785 --> 05:12:28,968
[SPEAKER_21]: one of the mayor's regular appointments away because there may only be one or two people who say they would be the chair.

3619
05:12:29,388 --> 05:12:40,252
[SPEAKER_21]: So the mayor really loses the chance to even really pick, you know, if there's one person who's- The way you do it is that you have, you pick the committee members and they pick their own co-chairs.

3620
05:12:42,245 --> 05:12:47,887
[SPEAKER_33]: And the only problem with that, I mean, it definitely works, but who's organizing that first meeting then?

3621
05:12:48,368 --> 05:12:51,789
[SPEAKER_33]: Who's sending out the notices?

3622
05:12:52,649 --> 05:13:03,794
[SPEAKER_33]: That's what the problem is if you have the committee pick their own, if you have the advisory committee pick their own leadership, it starts it all out and how long does it take to get to that decision?

3623
05:13:04,474 --> 05:13:11,757
[SPEAKER_62]: And I think the other challenge there is the open meeting law requirement and being able to adhere to that.

3624
05:13:14,090 --> 05:13:22,696
[SPEAKER_62]: because if the advisory committee doesn't adhere to the open meeting law, that will be a problem for this committee.

3625
05:13:25,838 --> 05:13:32,002
[SPEAKER_62]: So we need to take measures to ensure that there is compliance with the open meeting law.

3626
05:13:37,446 --> 05:13:41,689
[SPEAKER_21]: So I feel like we have the challenge of

3627
05:13:42,236 --> 05:13:48,899
[SPEAKER_21]: truly having an unknown here and that we don't know if there will be even any applicants who want to be the chair.

3628
05:13:50,219 --> 05:14:06,205
[SPEAKER_21]: So, but we, but member Vander Kloot's change date to end it earlier is good news because then we will know with an entire week in advance, whether or not there actually wasn't the applicants to be chair.

3629
05:14:06,706 --> 05:14:08,826
[SPEAKER_21]: If there weren't, then we can scramble,

3630
05:14:11,249 --> 05:14:28,817
[SPEAKER_21]: to find somebody who would be interested, you know, a city councilor or somebody from another, I mean, they don't necessarily have to be from our committee, community even, but it just feels hard without having any idea whether we will have any applicants.

3631
05:14:29,857 --> 05:14:30,138
[SPEAKER_33]: Mayor.

3632
05:14:32,238 --> 05:14:33,319
[SPEAKER_33]: Member Van de Kloot.

3633
05:14:33,999 --> 05:14:39,982
[SPEAKER_33]: So the reason why I originally said the mayor will appoint was because I wanted the mayor to do some legwork in advance of

3634
05:14:40,600 --> 05:14:45,364
[SPEAKER_33]: this to search out people who would be interested.

3635
05:14:46,625 --> 05:14:53,410
[SPEAKER_33]: And so that she would know who the chair was gonna be rather than leaving it up to who applied.

3636
05:14:53,890 --> 05:15:09,342
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, I needed, I'm thinking when we had advisory committees before, for example, for building the schools, the mayor sought out people to be chairs and appointed them.

3637
05:15:10,922 --> 05:15:17,265
[SPEAKER_33]: I will, by the way, tell you that this committee is larger than the building the future committees were.

3638
05:15:22,927 --> 05:15:24,288
[SPEAKER_33]: Nobody's amused by that, I guess.

3639
05:15:27,049 --> 05:15:30,010
[SPEAKER_21]: It's funny though.

3640
05:15:34,072 --> 05:15:37,333
[SPEAKER_21]: If I may, Mayor, do you, what are your thoughts?

3641
05:15:38,673 --> 05:15:39,654
[SPEAKER_41]: You know what, that's fine.

3642
05:15:40,322 --> 05:15:45,805
[SPEAKER_41]: but maybe you can write one of my picks will be the chair.

3643
05:15:46,505 --> 05:15:55,470
[SPEAKER_41]: And if the committee needs another number to make it the 21 or 23, I mean, I can have a pick then.

3644
05:15:56,710 --> 05:16:02,093
[SPEAKER_41]: Otherwise I'll just have the chair and I'll have one other pick.

3645
05:16:02,293 --> 05:16:09,217
[SPEAKER_41]: But if there is 20 members, the mayor gets another pick and that will help us solve number one.

3646
05:16:10,685 --> 05:16:15,808
[SPEAKER_33]: Do we need, are we keeping in the three additional names by lottery, just?

3647
05:16:16,948 --> 05:16:17,209
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

3648
05:16:17,829 --> 05:16:18,529
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, okay.

3649
05:16:21,791 --> 05:16:26,133
[SPEAKER_41]: So if number one is full, we'll have a full committee of 23 and an alternate.

3650
05:16:26,593 --> 05:16:33,537
[SPEAKER_41]: If it's not, then it may lead us to go into number five, which would allow me two picks plus the chair.

3651
05:16:33,557 --> 05:16:36,398
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, and the chair is a voting member, correct?

3652
05:16:37,339 --> 05:16:37,519
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

3653
05:16:38,735 --> 05:16:53,688
[SPEAKER_33]: And the historical person, I was really hoping, I put it in your lap, Mayor, because I just thought that you would be a good point person for reaching out to the historical society and asking, we're going to need help.

3654
05:16:54,849 --> 05:17:01,976
[SPEAKER_33]: The advisory committee is going to need help looking into the history of some of the people that are suggested.

3655
05:17:02,458 --> 05:17:13,606
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, I would just ask for the change on that to be historical society, historical commission, historical district commission, just so I have a large enough pool to find somebody that's willing to do it.

3656
05:17:14,046 --> 05:17:14,346
[SPEAKER_41]: Sure.

3657
05:17:17,008 --> 05:17:19,970
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, historical commission, historical district commission.

3658
05:17:20,531 --> 05:17:25,154
[SPEAKER_41]: Those are the three bodies we have in Medford that could help me.

3659
05:17:25,895 --> 05:17:29,797
[SPEAKER_33]: And potentially, since they're non-voting members, it could be more than one.

3660
05:17:36,462 --> 05:17:36,862
[SPEAKER_32]: like that.

3661
05:17:37,963 --> 05:17:38,384
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, please.

3662
05:17:38,404 --> 05:17:38,744
[SPEAKER_41]: Thanks.

3663
05:17:41,966 --> 05:17:42,167
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

3664
05:17:43,288 --> 05:17:43,948
[SPEAKER_41]: Member herself.

3665
05:17:45,930 --> 05:17:48,292
[SPEAKER_21]: And could we add something after number three?

3666
05:17:48,312 --> 05:18:02,363
[SPEAKER_21]: A new number for, um, to just say that the, um By a majority vote of the advisory committee, a member can be removed to allow for the scenario for which a

3667
05:18:03,812 --> 05:18:08,356
[SPEAKER_21]: either somebody we pick or a randomly selected person is a disruptor.

3668
05:18:08,396 --> 05:18:09,277
[SPEAKER_41]: Is that further down?

3669
05:18:09,737 --> 05:18:13,621
[SPEAKER_41]: I think that removal is further down, we can add that.

3670
05:18:14,021 --> 05:18:14,702
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm almost sure.

3671
05:18:14,722 --> 05:18:15,122
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm sorry, okay.

3672
05:18:15,162 --> 05:18:16,283
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, we can put it down here.

3673
05:18:16,904 --> 05:18:23,610
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, removal's positive that if somebody, well, if somebody doesn't show up to meetings or something is in here, so we can send that.

3674
05:18:23,790 --> 05:18:24,291
[SPEAKER_41]: That was in Paul.

3675
05:18:25,352 --> 05:18:26,152
[SPEAKER_33]: Paul had that in.

3676
05:18:26,172 --> 05:18:26,793
[SPEAKER_41]: That was in mine.

3677
05:18:27,333 --> 05:18:28,815
[SPEAKER_33]: I did not have it in mine, so.

3678
05:18:29,451 --> 05:18:30,291
[SPEAKER_33]: You could add that.

3679
05:18:30,571 --> 05:18:31,711
[SPEAKER_62]: We'll add that in at the end.

3680
05:18:31,811 --> 05:18:32,612
[SPEAKER_41]: Let's keep going.

3681
05:18:32,632 --> 05:18:35,032
[SPEAKER_62]: Let's see, five, six.

3682
05:18:35,472 --> 05:18:37,793
[SPEAKER_62]: Are there any other changes to one through six here?

3683
05:18:37,813 --> 05:18:42,853
[SPEAKER_33]: I think it's too big, but that's.

3684
05:18:44,974 --> 05:18:49,615
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, I think three of us think it's too big, but we've lost that, so.

3685
05:18:49,835 --> 05:18:49,935
OK.

3686
05:19:06,900 --> 05:19:08,604
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so I'm just going to move this.

3687
05:19:09,527 --> 05:19:10,690
[SPEAKER_32]: Give me one quick second.

3688
05:19:35,081 --> 05:19:36,642
[SPEAKER_32]: We finished this as well, right?

3689
05:19:37,702 --> 05:19:38,322
[SPEAKER_32]: This is good.

3690
05:19:40,763 --> 05:19:43,904
[SPEAKER_33]: We have to look at this again in light of our other discussions.

3691
05:19:51,107 --> 05:19:53,568
[SPEAKER_33]: So change up to four, up to three staff members.

3692
05:19:58,930 --> 05:19:59,750
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, that's right.

3693
05:20:02,486 --> 05:20:02,806
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

3694
05:20:05,768 --> 05:20:07,149
[SPEAKER_32]: And then this is otherwise good.

3695
05:20:11,091 --> 05:20:11,551
[SPEAKER_39]: One second.

3696
05:20:12,972 --> 05:20:15,273
[SPEAKER_41]: I trust Ms.

3697
05:20:15,353 --> 05:20:32,022
[SPEAKER_41]: Kay will start immediately to get student involvement, so we don't really have to set a timeline, but maybe we can just ask her, even on the side tonight, to keep us posted, even if it's a every Friday email on what the school's doing to get the students involved.

3698
05:20:32,895 --> 05:20:34,056
[SPEAKER_59]: Yeah, I, yeah.

3699
05:20:37,418 --> 05:20:39,739
[SPEAKER_41]: So I'm sure teachers will get involved to try to make it.

3700
05:20:42,721 --> 05:20:46,483
[SPEAKER_33]: I just think that, yeah, I think we have to be really realistic.

3701
05:20:46,863 --> 05:20:55,409
[SPEAKER_32]: Any objections on this paragraph?

3702
05:20:58,610 --> 05:20:59,171
[SPEAKER_39]: One more second.

3703
05:21:00,952 --> 05:21:01,092
[SPEAKER_39]: Nope.

3704
05:21:02,998 --> 05:21:03,718
[SPEAKER_32]: Good, okay.

3705
05:21:10,520 --> 05:21:11,561
[SPEAKER_32]: Moving it above the line.

3706
05:21:20,524 --> 05:21:23,685
[SPEAKER_62]: Okay, the work of the advisory committee.

3707
05:21:23,705 --> 05:21:23,745
[SPEAKER_62]: So,

3708
05:21:34,878 --> 05:21:42,462
[SPEAKER_62]: at our committee of the whole, we will also put forward.

3709
05:21:44,264 --> 05:21:46,505
[SPEAKER_33]: No, this is just the work of the advisory committee.

3710
05:21:47,145 --> 05:21:47,585
[SPEAKER_33]: Correct.

3711
05:21:49,987 --> 05:21:50,147
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah.

3712
05:21:52,782 --> 05:22:08,429
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, for number two, I think it's important that there, it's very possible that there will be people who are not aware of the letters that we've received and the depth of angst.

3713
05:22:08,969 --> 05:22:18,954
[SPEAKER_33]: So for that reason, I wanted them to have access in a file to the letters so they could understand what kind of letters we've read, we've gotten.

3714
05:22:21,519 --> 05:22:28,686
[SPEAKER_33]: So they don't have to read them, but I just want to say that they have access to them so they can understand what the discussion has been so far.

3715
05:22:30,528 --> 05:22:31,689
[SPEAKER_41]: I think that's important as well.

3716
05:22:38,735 --> 05:22:41,158
[SPEAKER_33]: OK, does anybody object to that?

3717
05:22:43,099 --> 05:22:43,260
[SPEAKER_33]: No.

3718
05:22:43,860 --> 05:22:44,801
[SPEAKER_33]: OK, how about number three?

3719
05:22:47,279 --> 05:22:51,503
[SPEAKER_41]: Number three, the advisory committee will develop criteria for evaluating the names.

3720
05:22:51,563 --> 05:22:59,830
[SPEAKER_41]: The advisory committee will determine the process for vetting the names, narrowing the field, and submitting three finalists to the school committee.

3721
05:23:00,110 --> 05:23:09,418
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, now there's a crucial point here, and this is one of the key talking points that I mentioned right at the beginning.

3722
05:23:12,881 --> 05:23:15,322
[SPEAKER_33]: There are two different ways we could go about this.

3723
05:23:15,962 --> 05:23:28,267
[SPEAKER_33]: Paul suggested that the advisory council go all the way down to the single last name, they give a presentation, and the school committee votes to confirm it, okay?

3724
05:23:28,947 --> 05:23:31,928
[SPEAKER_33]: And frankly, he had that all done on the same night.

3725
05:23:33,698 --> 05:23:51,589
[SPEAKER_33]: I say that the advisory committee gives the school committee three names and the school committee then at a subsequent meeting, I don't think it should happen at the same meeting, that we pick one of the names.

3726
05:23:53,409 --> 05:24:06,753
[SPEAKER_33]: The arguments pro and against are, if we have the advisory committee pick the final name and then we just rubber stamp it, in many ways I feel like we're giving up our responsibility.

3727
05:24:07,173 --> 05:24:10,254
[SPEAKER_33]: However, I realize that others will have a different opinion about that.

3728
05:24:11,074 --> 05:24:17,576
[SPEAKER_33]: But it's a clear, we have to make a decision about how we're gonna proceed on that particular point.

3729
05:24:20,797 --> 05:24:21,417
[SPEAKER_41]: Just a thought.

3730
05:24:23,027 --> 05:24:47,615
[SPEAKER_41]: if you went with the three names, and even if we decided a later time, but a community survey to really put it out to the community, not only the children of the Columbus and parents of the Columbus, but the whole community to, we were getting amazing responses on surveys we put out, and this would be a way to try to bring people together to pick a name, just a thought.

3731
05:24:48,315 --> 05:24:49,135
[SPEAKER_41]: Or a public hearing.

3732
05:24:50,236 --> 05:24:51,236
[SPEAKER_41]: We could have a public hearing.

3733
05:24:51,994 --> 05:24:56,376
[SPEAKER_41]: you'd have to have an address in Medford and only get one vote per person.

3734
05:24:56,536 --> 05:25:00,077
[SPEAKER_41]: It would be some work, but member Rousseau.

3735
05:25:01,738 --> 05:25:08,581
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like we're kind of vacillating a bit between it's our responsibility, but then we don't want the responsibility.

3736
05:25:08,601 --> 05:25:10,302
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

3737
05:25:10,342 --> 05:25:11,862
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that any better?

3738
05:25:20,868 --> 05:25:21,068
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

3739
05:25:21,608 --> 05:25:21,929
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

3740
05:25:22,249 --> 05:25:26,931
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a little bit vacillating between we want to have the responsibility to who we don't.

3741
05:25:26,951 --> 05:25:32,795
[SPEAKER_21]: If we put it in the community to pick three, then we aren't picking a name.

3742
05:25:33,575 --> 05:25:36,717
[SPEAKER_21]: If we get three and we pick a name, then we're picking a name.

3743
05:25:37,417 --> 05:25:40,699
[SPEAKER_21]: If the advisory committee just gives us the name, then we're not picking the name.

3744
05:25:41,460 --> 05:25:46,262
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like we should decide whether we want to pick the name or not before we decide how that will happen.

3745
05:25:50,646 --> 05:26:01,751
[SPEAKER_21]: talking about the, I mean, there's probably a dozen other ways we could decide what the name will be, but we, the, for me, the bifurcating issue here is do we pick the name or not?

3746
05:26:04,032 --> 05:26:13,236
[SPEAKER_20]: And I could be convinced by the way, frankly, but I think we should answer that explicitly before we decide the next, you know, which way we go.

3747
05:26:14,000 --> 05:26:15,863
[SPEAKER_21]: with how that happens.

3748
05:26:16,463 --> 05:26:22,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Do people have a strong preference to, do you want the responsibility to pick the name as the statute requires?

3749
05:26:22,751 --> 05:26:28,438
[SPEAKER_21]: Or do you want to like punt and give it to somebody else so you can say, well, I wouldn't have picked that name after it's picked.

3750
05:26:32,486 --> 05:26:39,391
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, Paul, if you put it in those terms, I think that we have the responsibility to pick from three finalists.

3751
05:26:39,551 --> 05:26:47,316
[SPEAKER_33]: And I would suggest that it would be OK with me if the advisory committee weighted them or numbered them or chose not to do that.

3752
05:26:48,377 --> 05:26:49,698
[SPEAKER_33]: We gave it to those equally.

3753
05:26:50,398 --> 05:26:54,581
[SPEAKER_33]: But if you put it in those terms, then I don't see how we can choose not to.

3754
05:26:54,601 --> 05:26:58,023
[SPEAKER_41]: And I think the advisory committee gave us three.

3755
05:27:01,289 --> 05:27:06,772
[SPEAKER_41]: know and saying that they can't put out a survey themselves and at least give us the results to help us decide.

3756
05:27:08,772 --> 05:27:09,273
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Graham.

3757
05:27:10,653 --> 05:27:23,539
[SPEAKER_62]: I actually loved the suggestion of us narrowing down to two and then asking the students of the Columbus to vote.

3758
05:27:26,721 --> 05:27:28,602
[SPEAKER_62]: I loved that idea.

3759
05:27:30,959 --> 05:27:39,386
[SPEAKER_62]: I think it's could be a really powerful lesson for the students, right?

3760
05:27:39,406 --> 05:27:42,488
[SPEAKER_62]: So they talk about voting during election day.

3761
05:27:43,109 --> 05:27:48,693
[SPEAKER_62]: This is a chance for them to vote on something more than like what their favorite cookie is, right?

3762
05:27:48,733 --> 05:27:50,715
[SPEAKER_62]: Like this is a chance for them to vote.

3763
05:27:53,257 --> 05:28:01,220
[SPEAKER_62]: we could be presented with three options and we could collectively narrow to two and then let the school vote later that week.

3764
05:28:06,001 --> 05:28:06,361
[SPEAKER_37]: Mayor.

3765
05:28:07,862 --> 05:28:08,842
[SPEAKER_37]: Member McLaughlin.

3766
05:28:10,279 --> 05:28:28,916
[SPEAKER_37]: I also like that idea, just because I like the idea of the, you know, again, the students understanding the process, you know, seeing this having gone through, you know, a certain way, their involvement from the beginning all the way through the end, and ultimately, you know, their vote.

3767
05:28:29,377 --> 05:28:36,183
[SPEAKER_37]: So I forget who the community member was that suggested it, but I wanted to thank them for the suggestion.

3768
05:28:44,315 --> 05:28:48,097
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor Kathy Kretz is trying to remember.

3769
05:28:48,738 --> 05:28:50,079
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, I just wanted to chime in.

3770
05:28:50,119 --> 05:29:02,946
[SPEAKER_46]: So I do like the idea of having even a survey for the community so that they can give us some feedback once we have the three final names.

3771
05:29:05,035 --> 05:29:09,778
[SPEAKER_46]: I think it's really important that we involve the community somehow in this process.

3772
05:29:12,080 --> 05:29:13,301
[SPEAKER_46]: So I think that's a great idea.

3773
05:29:13,341 --> 05:29:24,749
[SPEAKER_46]: I think I like the idea of the students at the same time, I just wanna make sure that we're involving the entire community, you know, and including the students in the community in the process.

3774
05:29:25,529 --> 05:29:31,333
[SPEAKER_46]: It's just something that it's just such a, you know, big responsibility.

3775
05:29:31,873 --> 05:29:33,855
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm just getting exhausted, sorry.

3776
05:29:34,415 --> 05:29:35,915
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, no, and maybe we could do both.

3777
05:29:36,976 --> 05:29:39,936
[SPEAKER_41]: Miss K can do a survey for the students.

3778
05:29:40,036 --> 05:29:50,959
[SPEAKER_41]: We could ask either the committee or us to do a survey for the community, and that would be results that we can use as a committee to choose the final name.

3779
05:29:51,819 --> 05:29:52,099
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor.

3780
05:29:53,459 --> 05:29:53,780
[SPEAKER_41]: Member.

3781
05:29:55,100 --> 05:29:55,520
[SPEAKER_40]: Vanderkleep.

3782
05:29:55,902 --> 05:30:02,204
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, so my concern when you get down to two names is that it becomes polarizing again, right off the bat.

3783
05:30:03,164 --> 05:30:07,726
[SPEAKER_33]: So I love the idea of involving the kids and the community.

3784
05:30:08,726 --> 05:30:11,087
[SPEAKER_33]: There is a time factor for all of those things.

3785
05:30:12,208 --> 05:30:21,511
[SPEAKER_33]: But I really would suggest that we might even have the kids go from three names to two names, or we're adding another process here.

3786
05:30:22,884 --> 05:30:30,430
[SPEAKER_33]: but that's why you don't pick two names is because you have one Italian American and one black American, and there you are with your polarization.

3787
05:30:32,452 --> 05:30:38,397
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's why I said three, up to three, I said up to three, somewhere along the line.

3788
05:30:38,477 --> 05:30:42,140
[SPEAKER_41]: It could be up to four, we're responsible for picking the final name.

3789
05:30:42,240 --> 05:30:46,064
[SPEAKER_41]: So, yep, I agree with three, first two.

3790
05:30:46,884 --> 05:30:47,445
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Russo?

3791
05:30:47,465 --> 05:30:49,987
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember in,

3792
05:30:51,912 --> 05:30:52,493
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Sue.

3793
05:30:52,933 --> 05:30:57,577
[SPEAKER_20]: We had a mock election for president a very long ago.

3794
05:30:57,898 --> 05:31:04,924
[SPEAKER_21]: And I guess I just wonder about the mechanics of kindergartners, pre-school graders voting.

3795
05:31:04,944 --> 05:31:11,230
[SPEAKER_20]: I recognize that not all students are, I'm not suggesting that they can't take a train.

3796
05:31:11,451 --> 05:31:13,132
[SPEAKER_37]: Bruce, may I?

3797
05:31:13,613 --> 05:31:14,974
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wonder about it.

3798
05:31:15,697 --> 05:31:17,357
[SPEAKER_37]: What point of privilege?

3799
05:31:17,658 --> 05:31:18,258
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, please.

3800
05:31:18,278 --> 05:31:20,578
[SPEAKER_37]: Member Russo, your audio is not working.

3801
05:31:20,718 --> 05:31:23,299
[SPEAKER_37]: It is going in and out, and it's very difficult to understand you.

3802
05:31:23,319 --> 05:31:27,380
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not sure what the difference is, but I think it might be related to your posture.

3803
05:31:27,520 --> 05:31:32,901
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know what your microphone is, but just FYI, it's very difficult to hear you.

3804
05:31:34,162 --> 05:31:35,042
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, can you hear me now?

3805
05:31:36,062 --> 05:31:36,282
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

3806
05:31:36,702 --> 05:31:37,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3807
05:31:37,102 --> 05:31:38,143
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm apologizing for that.

3808
05:31:39,574 --> 05:31:50,389
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess I'm just worried about the mechanics of a actual election at that grade level that I mean I would certainly trust Dr. She says she can pull that off.

3809
05:31:50,930 --> 05:31:51,210
[SPEAKER_21]: I just.

3810
05:31:53,615 --> 05:31:59,577
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I mean, when when you were presented with multiple options as with any kind of election.

3811
05:32:01,038 --> 05:32:05,979
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to be told what those options are and you have to make a decision.

3812
05:32:07,040 --> 05:32:14,502
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, as with all regular elections, what you get for information sort of major deciding factor.

3813
05:32:16,343 --> 05:32:38,835
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, if there's a teacher who has a, you know, and I'm not suggesting this would happen, but if there's a teacher who has a clear preference, and the teacher is the person who gets to tell the students, oh, it's election day, and here's the three options, there's this terrible option over here, terrible option over here, and this great option over here, like, and I know the teachers wouldn't literally do that, but kids are very intuitive

3814
05:32:39,858 --> 05:32:41,479
[SPEAKER_21]: teachers will have preferences.

3815
05:32:42,299 --> 05:32:55,287
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just, I'm concerned about whether or not the students will be voting for what they want or whether they will be voting based on the preferences of the adults in their lives, whether that's their teachers or their parents.

3816
05:32:56,467 --> 05:32:58,909
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't dislike the idea.

3817
05:32:58,929 --> 05:33:04,572
[SPEAKER_21]: I just have a lot of worry about the mechanics of getting it done.

3818
05:33:04,592 --> 05:33:08,334
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would like to hear Dr. K greatly.

3819
05:33:11,854 --> 05:33:18,981
[SPEAKER_41]: HAB-Masyn Moyer): And why don't we, why don't we leave it up to the advisory committee 23 people can choose if they have time to do one or two surveys.

3820
05:33:19,001 --> 05:33:21,884
[SPEAKER_41]: HAB-Masyn Moyer): Now, Mayor.

3821
05:33:22,765 --> 05:33:26,568
[SPEAKER_41]: HAB-Masyn Moyer): And we have the final decision based out of off of three one way or another.

3822
05:33:26,588 --> 05:33:36,698
[SPEAKER_41]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, she-her, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-

3823
05:33:37,455 --> 05:33:38,235
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm fine with that.

3824
05:33:38,556 --> 05:33:38,756
Yes.

3825
05:33:44,779 --> 05:33:45,040
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

3826
05:33:45,600 --> 05:33:46,000
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, good.

3827
05:33:46,901 --> 05:33:50,263
[SPEAKER_41]: We'll write that up and then we're going on to number four.

3828
05:33:50,903 --> 05:33:59,448
[SPEAKER_41]: Press relations will be directed through the advisory committee chair and members of the advisory committee are urged to send press contacts to the chair.

3829
05:34:00,389 --> 05:34:02,030
[SPEAKER_41]: Stop me if you have questions, but I'll keep going.

3830
05:34:03,052 --> 05:34:08,958
[SPEAKER_41]: Number five, advisory committee meetings are public meetings and must follow all requirements of the open meeting law.

3831
05:34:10,039 --> 05:34:12,982
[SPEAKER_41]: Six, the superintendent will provide a note taker and create minutes.

3832
05:34:13,903 --> 05:34:23,193
[SPEAKER_41]: Seven, it is expected that the advisory committee will need to meet three to five times and a majority of voting members will be required to reach a quorum for the meeting.

3833
05:34:24,312 --> 05:34:36,561
[SPEAKER_41]: the advisory committee will hold at least one public hearing to solicit feedback on the options they are considering per the charge of this resolution as at least one of their, at at least one of their meetings.

3834
05:34:37,842 --> 05:34:38,142
[SPEAKER_62]: Mayor?

3835
05:34:38,462 --> 05:34:38,683
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

3836
05:34:39,503 --> 05:34:48,390
[SPEAKER_62]: Can we revise this to say they will hold at least one public hearing or issue one public survey to provide them some options?

3837
05:34:49,571 --> 05:34:50,872
[SPEAKER_62]: I am very sensitive to

3838
05:34:53,499 --> 05:35:04,142
[SPEAKER_62]: a group of volunteers coming forward to do this work and being treated badly because of the work they're trying to do.

3839
05:35:05,562 --> 05:35:06,122
[SPEAKER_37]: Fine with me.

3840
05:35:06,682 --> 05:35:07,123
[SPEAKER_37]: Fine with me.

3841
05:35:08,503 --> 05:35:09,803
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

3842
05:35:13,964 --> 05:35:17,285
[SPEAKER_41]: Number nine, advisory committee members may withdraw from participation.

3843
05:35:17,305 --> 05:35:20,326
[SPEAKER_41]: This is where we could add what you were mentioning before.

3844
05:35:21,204 --> 05:35:29,186
[SPEAKER_41]: advisory committee members may withdraw from participation by notifying the chair and will not be counted in subsequent quorum and voting requirements.

3845
05:35:29,286 --> 05:35:33,387
[SPEAKER_41]: The chair will notify the remaining members of the advisory committee of the reduction in membership.

3846
05:35:33,487 --> 05:35:37,307
[SPEAKER_41]: No new members will be added to the advisory committee due to vacancies.

3847
05:35:39,008 --> 05:35:50,070
[SPEAKER_41]: And that's where I would suggest we add any language if it was mentioned before of somebody

3848
05:35:52,122 --> 05:35:55,285
[SPEAKER_41]: if the committee needed to vote a member out for some reason.

3849
05:35:57,406 --> 05:36:07,314
[SPEAKER_41]: Number 10, while consensus is always preferred, a simple majority of the total number of advisory committee members will be required to select up to three names that will be forwarded to the school committee.

3850
05:36:08,155 --> 05:36:13,859
[SPEAKER_41]: Note, if the school committee votes to have the advisory choose the, okay, we're gonna get three so we can take that out.

3851
05:36:14,560 --> 05:36:14,720
[SPEAKER_41]: Yep.

3852
05:36:16,181 --> 05:36:17,102
[SPEAKER_41]: Love in the advisory.

3853
05:36:17,342 --> 05:36:19,584
[SPEAKER_41]: Yep, and I think I have two,

3854
05:36:21,738 --> 05:36:28,859
[SPEAKER_41]: Number 11, the advisory committee will present their recommendations for the new names of the Columbus Elementary School no later than May 24th, 2021.

3855
05:36:29,380 --> 05:36:37,461
[SPEAKER_41]: A presentation will be given explaining the way that the recommendation was arrived at and why the names were chosen.

3856
05:36:38,922 --> 05:36:43,322
[SPEAKER_33]: So it should be, we're chosen since there's gonna be more than one?

3857
05:36:44,123 --> 05:36:44,903
[SPEAKER_33]: We're chosen, yeah.

3858
05:36:45,363 --> 05:36:46,283
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah.

3859
05:36:47,663 --> 05:36:51,004
[SPEAKER_41]: And on Kathy's point of the timeframe, I mean,

3860
05:36:51,664 --> 05:36:57,507
[SPEAKER_41]: I think everybody, majority at least, wants this done by the end of the fiscal year.

3861
05:36:57,527 --> 05:37:09,073
[SPEAKER_41]: I just would want the committee to know that if they needed an extra week on something, that they'd be able to ask us somehow because of all the work that they have to do.

3862
05:37:09,533 --> 05:37:09,713
[SPEAKER_33]: Right.

3863
05:37:10,534 --> 05:37:11,734
[SPEAKER_33]: Mayor, I agree with you.

3864
05:37:11,855 --> 05:37:12,955
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm really concerned.

3865
05:37:12,995 --> 05:37:17,938
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, there's a whole lot of me which thinks that this work ought to happen in the fall.

3866
05:37:19,816 --> 05:37:21,957
[SPEAKER_33]: and a temporary name should be given to the school.

3867
05:37:21,977 --> 05:37:45,611
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, you know, I guess the way that I would put is maybe put another line, if the advisory committee concludes or if a majority of the advisory committee concludes that they cannot complete this work in the timeframe specified, that they come before the school committee or that they communicate

3868
05:37:48,205 --> 05:37:53,007
[SPEAKER_33]: this to the school committee with a suggested new timeline.

3869
05:37:53,928 --> 05:37:54,388
[SPEAKER_33]: How's that?

3870
05:38:00,210 --> 05:38:11,935
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, that would take care of the concern that I personally have that it's too much work and too little time.

3871
05:38:16,829 --> 05:38:17,590
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Rousseau?

3872
05:38:18,931 --> 05:38:22,053
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually don't have a problem with this, but I do think you need to put a constraint.

3873
05:38:22,413 --> 05:38:38,286
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if they come back and say we need until next January, that if they, you know, when they think about the work they have ahead of them, there will be members of the advisory committee who want to do PhD level work on every single advisor, every single suggestion.

3874
05:38:38,346 --> 05:38:41,709
[SPEAKER_21]: And there will be others who want to just go to Wikipedia for 10 minutes.

3875
05:38:42,389 --> 05:38:44,131
[SPEAKER_21]: And everybody in between.

3876
05:38:47,318 --> 05:38:50,359
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like that's me on a daily basis with some things.

3877
05:38:50,679 --> 05:39:03,164
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we allow them to change the timeline to anything they want, then the voice of the person who wants to write a novel about every person might win, and then we're not gonna ever get this done.

3878
05:39:03,564 --> 05:39:15,149
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think I'm fine with them telling us we need a little more time or whatever, but I am also not fine with them having the option to tell us that they can't get it done before the school year ends.

3879
05:39:16,727 --> 05:39:19,709
[SPEAKER_41]: So you want to put it in an end date.

3880
05:39:20,389 --> 05:39:26,413
[SPEAKER_41]: Timeline shall not exceed July 31st so that it covers the next school year or something like that.

3881
05:39:29,675 --> 05:39:29,955
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

3882
05:39:30,896 --> 05:39:31,116
[SPEAKER_38]: Why?

3883
05:39:31,656 --> 05:39:33,157
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

3884
05:39:33,798 --> 05:39:35,699
[SPEAKER_21]: And the question is, why don't we just give them that much time?

3885
05:39:35,779 --> 05:39:38,921
[SPEAKER_41]: But I think you get more.

3886
05:39:39,241 --> 05:39:45,005
[SPEAKER_41]: These people, all the people that apply are going to know this is under a pretty

3887
05:39:45,686 --> 05:39:57,353
[SPEAKER_41]: serious timeline, and I think Will It Apply are going to want to do this work now if they come to May and they're like, we are doing work nonstop, but we really feel that to do this right, we need another month with three more meetings.

3888
05:39:57,393 --> 05:39:59,574
[SPEAKER_41]: We want to do a survey and a public meeting.

3889
05:39:59,634 --> 05:40:02,375
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, we don't know what the committee is going to say.

3890
05:40:02,515 --> 05:40:06,237
[SPEAKER_41]: So I like how Jenny wrote it.

3891
05:40:07,918 --> 05:40:13,301
[SPEAKER_21]: There are two items missing that I have in mind that I think are important.

3892
05:40:15,140 --> 05:40:27,153
[SPEAKER_21]: And maybe they're in there just like worded differently on mine I have a number 23 that says an advisory committee member that refuses to communicate about scheduling participation or participation can be removed.

3893
05:40:27,814 --> 05:40:32,699
[SPEAKER_33]: I thought we just talked about that but then we did withdraw right here.

3894
05:40:33,760 --> 05:40:35,002
[SPEAKER_21]: Well that's withdrawal.

3895
05:40:37,731 --> 05:40:44,933
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, that's where I said you could add your language that you, if somebody needs to be removed, that's what I suggest added after that.

3896
05:40:46,074 --> 05:40:46,454
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

3897
05:40:47,054 --> 05:40:54,516
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, it's simpler language and I guess it... Removal of a member is permitted by a majority vote of the committee.

3898
05:40:55,276 --> 05:40:55,877
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, that's fine.

3899
05:40:56,217 --> 05:40:58,217
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the other one was the,

3900
05:41:09,220 --> 05:41:10,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Where's the one about?

3901
05:41:10,682 --> 05:41:17,907
[SPEAKER_21]: For my number 24, there's this consensus may is, I know that was in there somewhere.

3902
05:41:17,988 --> 05:41:19,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, number 12 there.

3903
05:41:19,969 --> 05:41:21,210
[SPEAKER_21]: Mine doesn't say the same thing.

3904
05:41:22,111 --> 05:41:31,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Mine says, while consensus is always preferred, a simple majority of the total number of advisory committee members will be required to select the recommended new name.

3905
05:41:33,900 --> 05:41:48,789
[SPEAKER_21]: In the event that all members of the Advisory Committee are not present for the final vote to select the recommended new name, a majority vote of the total number of Advisory Committee members is still required, not a majority of Advisory Committee members that are present.

3906
05:41:49,170 --> 05:41:52,672
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is sort of, again, trying to prevent any kind of

3907
05:41:55,646 --> 05:41:57,647
[SPEAKER_21]: suggestions that things weren't on the up and up.

3908
05:41:58,328 --> 05:42:05,132
[SPEAKER_21]: If you get to schedule the meetings and you have a preference, so you make sure that just the people who are gonna vote the way you want can actually show up.

3909
05:42:05,973 --> 05:42:15,039
[SPEAKER_21]: This is saying that a majority of the members must be there to vote for the final one.

3910
05:42:15,119 --> 05:42:16,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Not the regular meeting, the regular quorum.

3911
05:42:18,902 --> 05:42:20,663
[SPEAKER_21]: If people can't make it, that's fine.

3912
05:42:20,863 --> 05:42:24,866
[SPEAKER_21]: But all members, yeah.

3913
05:42:31,038 --> 05:42:38,635
[SPEAKER_21]: I just have that a majority vote of the total number of advisory committee members is required.

3914
05:43:06,590 --> 05:43:11,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

3915
05:43:12,573 --> 05:43:13,093
[SPEAKER_40]: Mayor.

3916
05:43:14,073 --> 05:43:14,834
[SPEAKER_40]: Member Krantz.

3917
05:43:15,534 --> 05:43:30,381
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, so I'm just really uncomfortable and I wouldn't be able to approve the date, the May 24th.

3918
05:43:30,481 --> 05:43:32,282
[SPEAKER_46]: I just feel that it's too rushed.

3919
05:43:33,148 --> 05:43:48,697
[SPEAKER_46]: You know, I mentioned that at the beginning of the meeting when I, you know, detailed the timeline, this advisory committee in the resolution that was originally stated was supposed to have a term of six months.

3920
05:43:49,297 --> 05:43:53,000
[SPEAKER_46]: So now we're condensing the six months into about eight weeks.

3921
05:43:54,120 --> 05:44:01,405
[SPEAKER_46]: And so I'm just, I mean, I would ask my committee members if they would consider changing that date

3922
05:44:02,361 --> 05:44:04,483
[SPEAKER_41]: Even with- I just, I really think it's too soon.

3923
05:44:05,624 --> 05:44:07,986
[SPEAKER_41]: Memocrats, even with number 15 we just added.

3924
05:44:18,514 --> 05:44:19,675
[SPEAKER_41]: Till July 31st.

3925
05:44:22,398 --> 05:44:23,719
[SPEAKER_46]: I still think it's too soon.

3926
05:44:25,689 --> 05:44:47,330
[SPEAKER_46]: You know, I mean, I read the original resolutions that were presented in June, and it clearly stated the advisory committee will have a six-month term so that, you know, in my opinion, that would be ample time for the committee to

3927
05:44:48,871 --> 05:44:59,386
[SPEAKER_46]: to have thoughtful, reflective discussions, get the survey results, read the survey results, thoroughly research for the new name.

3928
05:45:00,444 --> 05:45:04,125
[SPEAKER_46]: this is, you know, we're rushing to get the new name on May 24th.

3929
05:45:04,205 --> 05:45:10,706
[SPEAKER_46]: You know, we're not, in this particular meeting, we're not changing the vote.

3930
05:45:11,506 --> 05:45:12,326
[SPEAKER_46]: And I get that.

3931
05:45:13,147 --> 05:45:17,167
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm just, you know, I just think it's too short of a timeframe.

3932
05:45:17,928 --> 05:45:19,028
[SPEAKER_46]: That that's my opinion.

3933
05:45:25,169 --> 05:45:26,409
[SPEAKER_21]: And Mia has her hand up.

3934
05:45:27,449 --> 05:45:29,530
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, I can't see Mia, sorry.

3935
05:45:29,570 --> 05:45:30,150
[SPEAKER_41]: Member McStone?

3936
05:45:30,677 --> 05:45:34,960
[SPEAKER_49]: Sure, thank you, Mayor.

3937
05:45:36,141 --> 05:45:58,475
[SPEAKER_49]: For number 15, if the advisory committee recommends a timeline change, which I hear what Kathy's saying, for the time crunch it is now, could it be that in the meantime, that we will refer to the Columbus School with the temporary name of the South Medford Elementary School?

3938
05:46:00,765 --> 05:46:13,010
[SPEAKER_49]: So then it feels like we're moving forward, it's temporary, but if an extension is asked, if the advisory committee asked for an extension at that time.

3939
05:46:13,030 --> 05:46:18,252
[SPEAKER_41]: I think we've gone to two.

3940
05:46:18,612 --> 05:46:22,793
[SPEAKER_41]: Would we have to do that unless they asked for an extension past the start of the school year?

3941
05:46:23,313 --> 05:46:27,255
[SPEAKER_41]: If they asked for an extension past the start of the school year, I'd agree to that, but.

3942
05:46:28,015 --> 05:46:28,295
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

3943
05:46:29,596 --> 05:46:29,876
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor.

3944
05:46:31,329 --> 05:46:33,170
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not in favor of a temporary name.

3945
05:46:34,110 --> 05:46:37,412
[SPEAKER_46]: We're forming this advisory committee so that they can come up with a name.

3946
05:46:37,432 --> 05:46:42,133
[SPEAKER_46]: I just don't understand some of that.

3947
05:46:43,174 --> 05:46:51,297
[SPEAKER_46]: And that's not in the resolution that I went back to the original resolution and it didn't state that

3948
05:46:52,287 --> 05:46:56,270
[SPEAKER_46]: The name would have to take on a temporary name.

3949
05:46:56,670 --> 05:47:04,776
[SPEAKER_46]: If a name wasn't decided by July 1 in keeping in mind that this is a pandemic.

3950
05:47:05,786 --> 05:47:16,611
[SPEAKER_46]: And all the deadlines that occurred all year everywhere, everything changed and got slid and extended and delayed.

3951
05:47:17,111 --> 05:47:26,375
[SPEAKER_46]: So I'm just, you know, I wouldn't be happy with the way that the resolution in this section is written with the strict timeframe.

3952
05:47:27,636 --> 05:47:29,637
[SPEAKER_46]: And that's my opinion.

3953
05:47:31,597 --> 05:47:32,138
[SPEAKER_62]: Member Graham?

3954
05:47:33,258 --> 05:47:33,778
[SPEAKER_39]: Member Rosado?

3955
05:47:35,731 --> 05:47:41,657
[SPEAKER_62]: The resolution that we passed did say that effective July 1st, the school no longer be named the Columbus School.

3956
05:47:41,737 --> 05:47:49,064
[SPEAKER_62]: So I am amenable to giving the committee at their request time into the end of July.

3957
05:47:49,084 --> 05:47:55,910
[SPEAKER_62]: And if we're going to extend that, we need to have an answer for what will we call the school between those dates.

3958
05:47:57,051 --> 05:48:00,635
[SPEAKER_62]: I feel like South Medford Elementary School is a fine interim,

3959
05:48:01,371 --> 05:48:04,956
[SPEAKER_62]: name, but I am a hard no on a six-month extension.

3960
05:48:05,276 --> 05:48:09,922
[SPEAKER_62]: So I'm a no, absolutely not.

3961
05:48:12,346 --> 05:48:18,574
[SPEAKER_41]: And was it Mia that said South Medford or you said Mystic earlier, so you chained it to South Medford, Mia?

3962
05:48:19,039 --> 05:48:39,766
[SPEAKER_49]: No, I mean, my heart is with the Mystic, but for this process, I think just to be able to move forward with a temporary name while the advisory committee asks for more time, the South Meffitt Elementary School buys us more time with also recognizing that we are no longer honoring Columbus.

3963
05:48:40,547 --> 05:48:44,528
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, one comment and then Paul, member Russo, can we take that line out?

3964
05:48:44,728 --> 05:48:46,589
[SPEAKER_41]: Because they're gonna have to come to us

3965
05:48:48,171 --> 05:48:52,654
[SPEAKER_41]: before July 30th, before May 24th to ask us for an extension.

3966
05:48:53,094 --> 05:49:00,538
[SPEAKER_41]: And since it's midnight and we've been going at this since 545, I do not wanna pick a temporary name right now.

3967
05:49:00,558 --> 05:49:03,100
[SPEAKER_41]: That's just my feeling.

3968
05:49:03,340 --> 05:49:10,705
[SPEAKER_41]: We'll do that on May 24th after we've had a couple months to think about it and knowing they're gonna need an extension.

3969
05:49:10,785 --> 05:49:13,246
[SPEAKER_41]: So I would suggest we just take that out.

3970
05:49:13,847 --> 05:49:14,467
[SPEAKER_41]: Member Rousseau.

3971
05:49:15,928 --> 05:49:24,636
[SPEAKER_21]: When you say take that out, you mean I would be fine with getting rid of the South Medford Elementary School suggestion if we remove the ability for them to ask for an extension.

3972
05:49:29,381 --> 05:49:33,424
[SPEAKER_21]: The original resolution, which my request continues to reference, is crystal clear.

3973
05:49:33,624 --> 05:49:36,127
[SPEAKER_21]: On July 1st, this school will not have that name.

3974
05:49:36,687 --> 05:49:38,389
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't have it both ways where we will

3975
05:49:39,798 --> 05:49:42,299
[SPEAKER_21]: adhere to that resolution and then not adhere to it.

3976
05:49:42,520 --> 05:49:46,002
[SPEAKER_21]: It also said on October 1st, the advisory committee would be working and they're not.

3977
05:49:46,502 --> 05:49:51,485
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I mean, the intent of that resolution is what we're working on.

3978
05:49:51,785 --> 05:50:05,713
[SPEAKER_21]: We obviously can't follow the letter of it, but, and that's why I think Member McStone's suggestion is a good one because it makes us at least adhere to the fact that we are not going back, that this is not going to be the name on July 1st.

3979
05:50:06,793 --> 05:50:11,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, yeah, these new website goes up with the new data on July 1st for the year.

3980
05:50:11,637 --> 05:50:14,199
[SPEAKER_21]: It will say something other than the Columbus.

3981
05:50:14,299 --> 05:50:20,204
[SPEAKER_21]: So I I'm fine with getting rid of that South number 15 altogether, but that means I'm also fine.

3982
05:50:20,464 --> 05:50:23,447
[SPEAKER_21]: I would want to remove the ability for them to ask for an extension.

3983
05:50:24,127 --> 05:50:36,177
[SPEAKER_41]: No, I'm just, I'm just saying, get rid of just so in the interim of any change that exceeds July 1st, the school will be, will a new name will be chosen.

3984
05:50:36,952 --> 05:50:41,375
[SPEAKER_41]: on or around May 24th, not tonight at midnight.

3985
05:50:42,756 --> 05:50:43,516
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all I'm asking.

3986
05:50:43,796 --> 05:50:45,097
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't understand, Mayor, I'm sorry.

3987
05:50:45,678 --> 05:50:46,878
[SPEAKER_21]: It is late, so I'm not following.

3988
05:50:46,978 --> 05:50:50,461
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, no, everything stays.

3989
05:50:50,641 --> 05:50:56,945
[SPEAKER_41]: If a majority of the advisory committee votes to recommend a timeline change to the school committee, they may do so.

3990
05:50:57,545 --> 05:51:01,308
[SPEAKER_41]: At that time, the school committee will vote to approve or decline this recommendation.

3991
05:51:01,708 --> 05:51:04,510
[SPEAKER_41]: Time changes shall not exceed a final date of July 31st.

3992
05:51:05,652 --> 05:51:18,399
[SPEAKER_41]: In the interim of any change that exceeds July 1st, the school will have an interim name to be decided at the time of approval or denial of the extension.

3993
05:51:22,641 --> 05:51:25,262
[SPEAKER_21]: If I can just, I see what you're saying, sorry.

3994
05:51:25,642 --> 05:51:27,563
[SPEAKER_21]: It is very late as you've highlighted.

3995
05:51:27,843 --> 05:51:32,786
[SPEAKER_21]: I do just worry that we're gonna have a meeting about what the temporary name is gonna be for five hours.

3996
05:51:33,026 --> 05:51:34,227
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's, I think,

3997
05:51:35,537 --> 05:51:45,481
[SPEAKER_21]: For people that will be concerned that the extension is really going to be extended again, that this temporary name will be the name for a school year.

3998
05:51:45,501 --> 05:51:54,185
[SPEAKER_21]: I just, I'm just worried that we're going to have, you know, 200 emails about what the temporary name should be.

3999
05:51:55,285 --> 05:52:02,028
[SPEAKER_41]: And if we pick the South Medford Elementary School now, we're going to get 200 emails of people that are upset that we picked it at midnight.

4000
05:52:03,231 --> 05:52:04,312
[SPEAKER_41]: after a meeting that started at 545.

4001
05:52:05,112 --> 05:52:19,920
[SPEAKER_41]: So it's like a no-win situation, I understand that, but I think just giving it a little time and picking in by May, we'll at least have had some thought, because it was Mystic at 545, and now it's South Medford Elementary School.

4002
05:52:19,960 --> 05:52:29,766
[SPEAKER_41]: And my brain's as mushy as everybody else's, and I just don't, I feel like that's an important decision, even if it's an interim name for only one, two to five months.

4003
05:52:31,650 --> 05:52:34,713
[SPEAKER_41]: member van de Kloet and then member Graham had her hand up.

4004
05:52:35,013 --> 05:52:51,108
[SPEAKER_33]: It's ludicrous to say that we can't change the date of the original motion to say that you know that if they need more time we'll give them another month and they can the Columbus can stay the Columbus for another month.

4005
05:52:51,528 --> 05:52:51,748
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean

4006
05:52:53,129 --> 05:52:56,110
[SPEAKER_33]: As many have said, we're during a pandemic, all the other timelines.

4007
05:52:57,230 --> 05:53:07,792
[SPEAKER_33]: If you actually go back and read the minutes, and there is probably a problem with the minutes, but it doesn't reference the whole, it just says the name of the Columbus will change, and it doesn't put the date on what we actually voted.

4008
05:53:08,373 --> 05:53:09,673
[SPEAKER_33]: And I went back and read it.

4009
05:53:09,793 --> 05:53:18,595
[SPEAKER_33]: Now the intent was clear, but I'm just saying, Paul, to hang your hat on and saying, you know, that's your personal thing that it has to change on July 1st.

4010
05:53:19,767 --> 05:53:20,127
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay?

4011
05:53:20,488 --> 05:53:25,451
[SPEAKER_33]: There's nothing in the world that says it can't change on August 1st.

4012
05:53:26,291 --> 05:53:26,712
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay?

4013
05:53:27,232 --> 05:53:28,933
[SPEAKER_33]: There's just nothing.

4014
05:53:28,953 --> 05:53:34,697
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, if you want to avoid the temporary date, I mean, somewhere along the line,

4015
05:53:36,719 --> 05:53:38,880
[SPEAKER_33]: I think we've been working really well together.

4016
05:53:38,940 --> 05:53:40,840
[SPEAKER_33]: We've got different opinions about this.

4017
05:53:40,900 --> 05:53:48,543
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, frankly, I'd like to say December 1st, because I think December 1st would be much more of a process of bringing kids in.

4018
05:53:48,563 --> 05:54:04,708
[SPEAKER_33]: To me, there's a rush here, which is still really uncomfortable, but I need to ask you to move off that, oh my God, the world is gonna end on July 1st if we don't change the name of the Columbus School.

4019
05:54:07,170 --> 05:54:11,371
[SPEAKER_41]: August 1st seems more reasonable because it would come after the July 31st date anyway.

4020
05:54:14,953 --> 05:54:15,913
[SPEAKER_46]: I agree with Ms.

4021
05:54:15,933 --> 05:54:16,413
[SPEAKER_46]: Van De Kloot.

4022
05:54:16,453 --> 05:54:23,175
[SPEAKER_46]: I've already stated that I think the timeline, you know, the date, all the other dates were missed.

4023
05:54:24,176 --> 05:54:26,336
[SPEAKER_46]: And they were missed because we're in a pandemic.

4024
05:54:27,277 --> 05:54:30,318
[SPEAKER_46]: In the original resolution, it does say

4025
05:54:31,383 --> 05:54:34,464
[SPEAKER_46]: that the advisory committee will have six months.

4026
05:54:35,344 --> 05:54:39,805
[SPEAKER_46]: So this time here, May 24th, that's not six months.

4027
05:54:39,845 --> 05:54:49,808
[SPEAKER_46]: So we're gonna keep to the July 1st deadline, but we're gonna just remove the six months that was originally in the resolution.

4028
05:54:50,368 --> 05:54:58,951
[SPEAKER_46]: And I know that was in the resolution and so was the July 1st date, but we're gonna skip the six months and we're just gonna keep the July 1st

4029
05:55:00,291 --> 05:55:02,632
[SPEAKER_46]: It's just not, I mean, it's just not right.

4030
05:55:02,912 --> 05:55:05,614
[SPEAKER_46]: It's not fair, it's not equitable, it's not reasonable.

4031
05:55:05,634 --> 05:55:12,037
[SPEAKER_46]: And that's how I feel like a strong no for me on May 24th.

4032
05:55:12,777 --> 05:55:13,838
[SPEAKER_46]: That's my strong no.

4033
05:55:14,258 --> 05:55:20,601
[SPEAKER_46]: And I've already provided my timeline and that wasn't second, so that's fine.

4034
05:55:20,621 --> 05:55:22,222
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm moving on from that.

4035
05:55:22,322 --> 05:55:24,583
[SPEAKER_46]: But I really think that

4036
05:55:27,401 --> 05:55:32,966
[SPEAKER_46]: You know, having this decision on July 1 is rushed.

4037
05:55:34,287 --> 05:55:40,112
[SPEAKER_46]: I even suggested in the timeline that I put forth at the beginning of the meeting that

4038
05:55:41,494 --> 05:55:54,262
[SPEAKER_46]: If we don't count the summer dates, and if the advisory committee were to meet in summer, brings us to September 1st, they would be coming to us with a recommended new name.

4039
05:55:54,843 --> 05:56:06,971
[SPEAKER_46]: Even if they have a couple, like have one meeting in July, one meeting in August, but they still have April, May, June, July, August, and they could come to us with a new name in September.

4040
05:56:08,069 --> 05:56:20,055
[SPEAKER_46]: The way that I read the resolution, it didn't make sense to me that the name had to, you know, transition over immediately on July 1st, where we didn't even follow all the other dates.

4041
05:56:20,496 --> 05:56:24,058
[SPEAKER_46]: We didn't, we missed all those other dates and that didn't matter to anybody.

4042
05:56:24,678 --> 05:56:26,359
[SPEAKER_46]: It didn't matter that we missed all those dates.

4043
05:56:26,399 --> 05:56:27,119
[SPEAKER_59]: Point of order.

4044
05:56:27,639 --> 05:56:27,880
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

4045
05:56:28,980 --> 05:56:29,260
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor.

4046
05:56:29,500 --> 05:56:30,441
[SPEAKER_40]: Personal privilege.

4047
05:56:31,521 --> 05:56:33,963
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, Kathy, member Gratz, apologies.

4048
05:56:35,112 --> 05:56:43,980
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that myself and I believe Member Graham have sent multiple emails over the last six months about when is this Committee of the Whole going to happen.

4049
05:56:44,380 --> 05:56:46,282
[SPEAKER_21]: It didn't matter is not true.

4050
05:56:46,302 --> 05:56:49,165
[SPEAKER_21]: I have been trying to get this scheduled

4051
05:56:50,313 --> 05:56:51,493
[SPEAKER_21]: over and over and over.

4052
05:56:51,573 --> 05:56:55,194
[SPEAKER_21]: And it has been brought up in our regular school committee meetings over and over and over.

4053
05:56:55,274 --> 05:57:04,057
[SPEAKER_21]: So to say that it didn't matter that we missed all the dates, every single week that we had meetings, I'm like, when are we having this meeting?

4054
05:57:04,797 --> 05:57:09,678
[SPEAKER_21]: It did matter a lot because I certainly agree they should have had more time and they didn't have more time.

4055
05:57:09,778 --> 05:57:11,359
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't think it's because of the pandemic.

4056
05:57:11,379 --> 05:57:13,980
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's because nobody wanted to deal with this.

4057
05:57:15,120 --> 05:57:15,640
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why.

4058
05:57:15,660 --> 05:57:15,720
[SPEAKER_21]: And

4059
05:57:19,918 --> 05:57:23,941
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know what, if we had stopped pressing, this meeting wouldn't have happened either.

4060
05:57:24,601 --> 05:57:38,670
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, I think if, you know, if we want to just delay it till after the election and we all get voted out and then we can be reversed before we chisel the Columbus off the name, then that's, just say it and just ask for that.

4061
05:57:39,831 --> 05:57:41,092
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm not interested in that.

4062
05:57:41,472 --> 05:57:48,637
[SPEAKER_21]: And I won't vote for anything that says that we will have anything other than the Columbus, not the name,

4063
05:57:50,117 --> 05:57:54,760
[SPEAKER_21]: on July one per the actual motion that six members voted for.

4064
05:57:54,780 --> 05:57:59,463
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, so we're a little bit of a standstill.

4065
05:57:59,483 --> 05:58:06,987
[SPEAKER_41]: We have the July date, May, July, now September and December have been brought up.

4066
05:58:07,067 --> 05:58:08,768
[SPEAKER_41]: So we've got to try to get on the same page.

4067
05:58:09,609 --> 05:58:11,990
[SPEAKER_41]: A member, I just heard somebody, Member McLaughlin.

4068
05:58:13,071 --> 05:58:13,771
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Mayor.

4069
05:58:16,041 --> 05:58:24,464
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, through the chair, I wanna say again, I hear my colleagues, but I also have to say that I disagree respectfully and I agree to disagree.

4070
05:58:24,484 --> 05:58:35,387
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't think that this process frankly has been rushed in the sense of we've been talking about this as again, since June, 2020, we've had several meetings over this.

4071
05:58:35,447 --> 05:58:39,448
[SPEAKER_37]: I think the advisory committee process is being tightened.

4072
05:58:39,468 --> 05:58:41,469
[SPEAKER_37]: I wouldn't necessarily say it's being rushed.

4073
05:58:41,669 --> 05:58:45,010
[SPEAKER_37]: We've had discussion and discussion and even tonight we're still having discussion

4074
05:58:45,635 --> 05:58:50,383
[SPEAKER_37]: over whether or not the name change should happen when that was decided a year ago.

4075
05:58:50,563 --> 05:58:56,433
[SPEAKER_37]: And now people are talking about postponing the advisory committee process again for more.

4076
05:58:57,079 --> 05:59:03,561
[SPEAKER_37]: you know, for a longer period of time and more discussion and more sort of putting our community members, frankly, through this.

4077
05:59:03,641 --> 05:59:06,862
[SPEAKER_37]: And I feel like causing more divide and more pain.

4078
05:59:06,902 --> 05:59:21,567
[SPEAKER_37]: And I feel like it's, you know, sort of like ripping the bandaid off and getting things done and having people have a solid deadline and looking at, you know, again, there's some, you know, I'm willing to be flexible around some of the, you know, July 1st, July 31st sort of thing or whatever.

4079
05:59:21,647 --> 05:59:25,689
[SPEAKER_37]: But I think that we have to have a hard date of, you know, of

4080
05:59:27,250 --> 05:59:31,694
[SPEAKER_37]: know, end of May, end of school year, and then a July decision, and then it's done.

4081
05:59:32,455 --> 05:59:35,137
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's what we have voted on and worked on and talked about all year long.

4082
05:59:35,177 --> 05:59:45,066
[SPEAKER_37]: But we keep, and as a school committee too, I feel like we keep bringing people through this process, and through this process, and through this process, and just stirring in this pain.

4083
05:59:45,386 --> 05:59:50,531
[SPEAKER_37]: And I am voting to move this forward with

4084
05:59:51,832 --> 05:59:55,936
[SPEAKER_37]: the respect of asking people to please apply to the committee.

4085
05:59:56,356 --> 06:00:07,105
[SPEAKER_37]: If you feel this strongly about it and you're this passionate about it, apply to the committee so that you can be part of the committee that is part of the change that can move our community forward and help our kids celebrate this new name.

4086
06:00:07,445 --> 06:00:07,866
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

4087
06:00:10,588 --> 06:00:11,008
[SPEAKER_37]: Mayor.

4088
06:00:12,009 --> 06:00:12,450
[SPEAKER_62]: Member Grim.

4089
06:00:14,577 --> 06:00:23,800
[SPEAKER_62]: I think to Member McStone's point, the value of identifying what happens in the interim is important.

4090
06:00:26,961 --> 06:00:39,205
[SPEAKER_62]: If for no other reason than to try to limit the hostile environment that could be created for the advisory work who will be in the thick of doing their work.

4091
06:00:41,892 --> 06:00:55,582
[SPEAKER_62]: So I feel like it would be fine to just clearly state that if this happens, the school committee will choose a temporary name for the school effective July 1st.

4092
06:00:56,023 --> 06:01:08,112
[SPEAKER_62]: I think that we don't, if it were me, I would be happy to make that decision now because if we don't, we are absolutely signing up for another five hour meeting

4093
06:01:09,671 --> 06:01:29,948
[SPEAKER_62]: which I'm perfectly happy to do but that five-hour meeting is going to happen in front of the advisory committee that is in the middle of doing this work and it's going to create a hostile environment and I would like us to try to avoid making this process hostile for the people volunteering to do this hard work on our behalf.

4094
06:01:30,629 --> 06:01:30,789
[SPEAKER_62]: So

4095
06:01:31,696 --> 06:01:39,680
[SPEAKER_62]: At minimum, I think we should just clearly state that the school committee will make that decision if it becomes necessary.

4096
06:01:39,700 --> 06:01:47,805
[SPEAKER_62]: Ideally, we would just decide it so that we can move forward, but I am open to either suggestion.

4097
06:01:47,825 --> 06:01:58,711
[SPEAKER_62]: I'm just not open to not saying anything in this particular instance, because I think it just sets us up for more churn and we need less churn.

4098
06:01:59,191 --> 06:02:00,332
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, I see your points.

4099
06:02:01,581 --> 06:02:10,467
[SPEAKER_33]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of State for Education and Human Services, to speak on behalf of the Board of Trustees.

4100
06:02:10,487 --> 06:02:20,794
[SPEAKER_33]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of State for Education and Human Services, to speak on behalf of the Board of Trustees.

4101
06:02:20,814 --> 06:02:26,298
[SPEAKER_33]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of State for Education and Human Services, to speak on behalf of the Board of Trustees.

4102
06:02:26,318 --> 06:02:30,961
[SPEAKER_33]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of State for Education and Human Services, to speak on behalf of the Board of Trustees.

4103
06:02:34,505 --> 06:02:42,331
[SPEAKER_41]: So go to July 31st, at that point, you would hope that the committee would have the names for us and we'd pick a name by then.

4104
06:02:44,093 --> 06:02:44,373
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

4105
06:02:44,833 --> 06:02:45,054
Okay.

4106
06:02:46,094 --> 06:02:50,258
[SPEAKER_33]: And so that we just for an extra month, it would be called Columbus for an extra month.

4107
06:02:51,279 --> 06:02:51,619
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

4108
06:02:51,939 --> 06:03:04,129
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, if that is so unacceptable to my colleagues, then I would strongly vote for changing it to the South Medford Elementary School and not leaving it as an open, because I don't want that to become the issue.

4109
06:03:05,575 --> 06:03:09,216
[SPEAKER_33]: I think, to me, it seems silly to have an interim name for just one month.

4110
06:03:13,678 --> 06:03:14,038
[SPEAKER_37]: Mayor.

4111
06:03:14,978 --> 06:03:15,898
[SPEAKER_37]: Member McLaughlin.

4112
06:03:17,279 --> 06:03:17,919
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

4113
06:03:18,759 --> 06:03:20,299
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, I lost my train of thought for one second.

4114
06:03:20,319 --> 06:03:21,060
[SPEAKER_37]: Hold on.

4115
06:03:21,800 --> 06:03:28,862
[SPEAKER_37]: So maintaining, yeah, maintaining the name for July 31st, but again, to

4116
06:03:30,064 --> 06:03:30,825
[SPEAKER_37]: I would consider.

4117
06:03:32,206 --> 06:03:42,415
[SPEAKER_37]: But again, to member Graham's point, I would say that should the advisory committee not have a name by July 31st, then the school committee will choose the name.

4118
06:03:44,577 --> 06:03:45,037
[SPEAKER_38]: Fine with that.

4119
06:03:45,518 --> 06:03:46,759
[SPEAKER_33]: We'll choose the temporary name.

4120
06:03:49,181 --> 06:03:49,561
[SPEAKER_37]: Whatever.

4121
06:03:49,822 --> 06:03:50,022
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean,

4122
06:03:51,980 --> 06:03:57,504
[SPEAKER_37]: We'll choose the temporary name and then no, that we'll choose the name because we're giving the advisory committee the charge to finish.

4123
06:03:57,584 --> 06:04:01,686
[SPEAKER_37]: We gave them till May or June and then July we're giving them an extension.

4124
06:04:01,726 --> 06:04:05,088
[SPEAKER_37]: So if they don't choose the name by the end of July, we will choose the name.

4125
06:04:07,190 --> 06:04:11,392
[SPEAKER_37]: Not we will give them more time so then we can name a temporary name.

4126
06:04:11,993 --> 06:04:16,676
[SPEAKER_37]: Not that we will choose a temporary name thereby giving more time to draw this process out more.

4127
06:04:16,716 --> 06:04:18,377
[SPEAKER_37]: No, then we will choose the name.

4128
06:04:19,164 --> 06:04:23,008
[SPEAKER_33]: No, that they have to give us a recommendation on July 31st.

4129
06:04:23,309 --> 06:04:23,669
[SPEAKER_37]: Period.

4130
06:04:24,170 --> 06:04:24,530
[SPEAKER_33]: Period.

4131
06:04:25,030 --> 06:04:27,153
[SPEAKER_37]: And if they don't, yeah, exactly.

4132
06:04:27,433 --> 06:04:27,753
[SPEAKER_41]: Period.

4133
06:04:29,475 --> 06:04:32,439
[SPEAKER_41]: Basically, we will allow an extension up until July 31st.

4134
06:04:32,559 --> 06:04:33,600
[SPEAKER_41]: After that, we will pick a name.

4135
06:04:34,517 --> 06:04:35,438
[SPEAKER_37]: our colleagues on board.

4136
06:04:35,558 --> 06:04:40,121
[SPEAKER_33]: When you say after that we will pick a name you're opening a whole new kettle of fish.

4137
06:04:40,301 --> 06:04:43,824
[SPEAKER_41]: We won't put it we won't put that in writing but well we don't have to.

4138
06:04:44,865 --> 06:04:45,585
[SPEAKER_62]: I think we have to.

4139
06:04:46,246 --> 06:04:47,166
[SPEAKER_62]: I think we have to.

4140
06:04:47,487 --> 06:04:50,189
[SPEAKER_62]: There has to be a finite endpoint

4141
06:04:51,474 --> 06:04:58,578
[SPEAKER_62]: of what this committee is being charged to do and how we will respond if that does not happen.

4142
06:04:58,598 --> 06:05:03,622
[SPEAKER_33]: There is, the final date is July 31st, 2021.

4143
06:05:03,742 --> 06:05:06,103
[SPEAKER_33]: And what if they just don't?

4144
06:05:08,505 --> 06:05:11,106
[SPEAKER_62]: They come back and they say we're a hung jury, sorry.

4145
06:05:11,126 --> 06:05:20,152
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, if that happens- Three recommendations to us.

4146
06:05:22,299 --> 06:05:33,304
[SPEAKER_62]: I think that is exceedingly reasonable and I don't think it's likely to happen, but here we are at midnight talking about

4147
06:05:34,406 --> 06:05:43,129
[SPEAKER_62]: trying to form this committee because we have spent the entire evening talking about the thing we decided back in June of last year.

4148
06:05:43,229 --> 06:05:51,132
[SPEAKER_62]: So I don't think we can rule out that it's a possibility, and I want there to be a clear path.

4149
06:05:52,165 --> 06:05:56,206
[SPEAKER_62]: that says what happens in the off chance that that occurs?

4150
06:05:56,527 --> 06:06:07,870
[SPEAKER_33]: I think that then in the off chance the school committee will, the school will be called the South Medford Elementary School until a name is decided upon.

4151
06:06:09,211 --> 06:06:10,571
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we put that in the language though?

4152
06:06:17,994 --> 06:06:20,955
[SPEAKER_41]: I liked Melanie's versus picking a name right now.

4153
06:06:23,146 --> 06:06:23,566
[SPEAKER_37]: I agree.

4154
06:06:23,586 --> 06:06:25,368
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it puts us back the responsibility.

4155
06:06:25,688 --> 06:06:30,132
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it also motivates the advisory committee because I think, you know, they've done all this work.

4156
06:06:30,172 --> 06:06:31,974
[SPEAKER_37]: They're going to want to have the input on the name.

4157
06:06:32,014 --> 06:06:39,720
[SPEAKER_37]: They're not going to want to give it over to a school committee decision or, you know, a South Medford school decision or what have you.

4158
06:06:39,780 --> 06:06:50,790
[SPEAKER_37]: So I say, you know, here's the first deadline, you know, may, if you cannot make this deadline, you know, and you need to request an extension, here's the process for the extension.

4159
06:06:51,192 --> 06:06:56,813
[SPEAKER_37]: we will give the extension till July 31st, as has been suggested by my colleagues.

4160
06:06:57,473 --> 06:07:06,996
[SPEAKER_37]: And if there's still not a decision by July 31st, then the decision reverts to the school committee and we vote on a name by August 15th.

4161
06:07:07,876 --> 06:07:10,216
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's what I would do.

4162
06:07:10,296 --> 06:07:12,597
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I think we have to have clear guidelines

4163
06:07:13,749 --> 06:07:22,372
[SPEAKER_37]: clear marks for where the expectations are and if they don't occur, what happens as a result, frankly.

4164
06:07:22,392 --> 06:07:26,013
[SPEAKER_33]: Anybody planning on going on summer vacation this summer?

4165
06:07:26,233 --> 06:07:32,795
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, that's the wonder of Zoom or some other remote option that we can still access things wherever we are.

4166
06:07:32,855 --> 06:07:33,595
[SPEAKER_37]: On vacation.

4167
06:07:40,615 --> 06:07:48,338
[SPEAKER_21]: In theory, I don't have a problem with this August 15th, we'll pick a date thing, but you know, I mean, I play that out in my mind.

4168
06:07:48,378 --> 06:07:51,579
[SPEAKER_21]: We are going to come to the meeting with seven different names.

4169
06:07:52,739 --> 06:07:53,680
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what's gonna happen.

4170
06:07:53,900 --> 06:07:54,740
[SPEAKER_62]: I completely agree.

4171
06:07:54,840 --> 06:07:55,740
[SPEAKER_62]: I completely agree.

4172
06:07:56,160 --> 06:08:09,165
[SPEAKER_62]: But there has to be a clear answer to what if the advisory committee just cannot fulfill the obligations that we've asked them to fulfill.

4173
06:08:10,379 --> 06:08:14,600
[SPEAKER_62]: Because what we can't do is start back here in July.

4174
06:08:14,620 --> 06:08:16,700
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what we will be doing.

4175
06:08:18,141 --> 06:08:31,924
[SPEAKER_62]: But we have to, I feel like at that point, we have to be talking about names instead of advisory committees and how we will proceed.

4176
06:08:33,224 --> 06:08:36,965
[SPEAKER_62]: Like, I think the how we will proceed question just has to be answered by us tonight.

4177
06:08:41,365 --> 06:08:48,212
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, I think if no recommendation is provided by July 31st, the school committee will choose a name by August 15th.

4178
06:08:50,515 --> 06:08:52,797
[SPEAKER_39]: I agree with that.

4179
06:08:54,539 --> 06:09:02,848
[SPEAKER_21]: So we will get together as a group and do the very thing that both people who are pro and against changing the Columbus name do not want us to do.

4180
06:09:04,335 --> 06:09:12,279
[SPEAKER_21]: And every person who has spoken and emailed for and against the change does not want us just waking up one morning and picking a new name.

4181
06:09:12,479 --> 06:09:20,843
[SPEAKER_21]: They want all kinds of different things, whether it's to keep the old name or to have the students pick the name or the community.

4182
06:09:21,463 --> 06:09:31,007
[SPEAKER_21]: Every option that we have heard did not include the option we are saying we're going to do if the advisory committee is unable to complete their task.

4183
06:09:33,083 --> 06:09:40,912
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's just say, you know, August 1st to August 15th of this year, I'm going to send my family away to a cabin in the woods, if there is no actual name.

4184
06:09:42,034 --> 06:09:46,479
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I'm not going to feel terribly like I can even go to my day job.

4185
06:09:46,719 --> 06:09:49,442
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's going to be horrible.

4186
06:09:50,188 --> 06:09:58,071
[SPEAKER_21]: If we are just going to on our own sit down and just pick a name out of the blue, it's like the opposite of everything everybody wants.

4187
06:09:58,572 --> 06:10:01,433
[SPEAKER_21]: I say we should have a, here's what happens.

4188
06:10:01,693 --> 06:10:07,375
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's explicit and it's not, what happens is a whole bunch more work and process that nobody likes.

4189
06:10:09,696 --> 06:10:14,718
[SPEAKER_41]: And what if we just put shall not exceed final date of July 31st, 2021.

4190
06:10:16,846 --> 06:10:20,249
[SPEAKER_41]: at which time and name shall be, you know, the final date.

4191
06:10:20,289 --> 06:10:24,633
[SPEAKER_41]: So final date would be when we choose a name and just leave it at that.

4192
06:10:24,793 --> 06:10:33,081
[SPEAKER_41]: We will know in May, if they even need an extension, we will know in May, if we have to do anything further and just, that's it.

4193
06:10:33,241 --> 06:10:36,424
[SPEAKER_41]: They have to pick a name and give it to us and we have to choose it.

4194
06:10:38,886 --> 06:10:39,827
[SPEAKER_41]: May I?

4195
06:10:40,948 --> 06:10:41,629
[SPEAKER_41]: Member McLaughlin.

4196
06:10:42,233 --> 06:10:42,633
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

4197
06:10:43,134 --> 06:10:52,300
[SPEAKER_37]: So I think what I hear through the chair, I think what I hear my colleague saying is he is worried about ambiguity.

4198
06:10:52,640 --> 06:11:03,908
[SPEAKER_37]: And I don't necessarily agree that what we would be asking the school committee to do is what both sides on this issue or all folks have not wanted.

4199
06:11:04,828 --> 06:11:05,208
[SPEAKER_37]: I think

4200
06:11:06,565 --> 06:11:14,969
[SPEAKER_37]: Or if that is the case, it's even it incentivizes the advisory committee to to do this really important work that we've been asking them to do.

4201
06:11:15,009 --> 06:11:32,138
[SPEAKER_37]: But that said, I also do want to point out to my colleagues, and I know that everyone is aware of the time, but I'm also very concerned about, you know, our administration and our staff and our colleagues and friends and neighbors and everyone else that have been on this call all night long.

4202
06:11:32,974 --> 06:11:37,595
[SPEAKER_37]: and some of whom have to get up in a matter of a few hours for school starting.

4203
06:11:37,675 --> 06:11:46,556
[SPEAKER_37]: So I would like to encourage my colleagues to come to a decision with this so that we can move forward and let people get to bed.

4204
06:11:47,177 --> 06:11:49,617
[SPEAKER_33]: Mayor, I need to add to that.

4205
06:11:49,737 --> 06:11:53,498
[SPEAKER_33]: We also haven't covered the first part of this, page one.

4206
06:11:54,598 --> 06:11:56,858
[SPEAKER_33]: So our work is not done at the end of this page.

4207
06:11:57,618 --> 06:11:59,359
[SPEAKER_33]: And there are more people that would like to speak.

4208
06:12:03,288 --> 06:12:03,868
[SPEAKER_62]: Page one.

4209
06:12:04,749 --> 06:12:10,271
[SPEAKER_62]: So is this what we want?

4210
06:12:11,772 --> 06:12:12,832
[SPEAKER_33]: No, to keep it not.

4211
06:12:15,073 --> 06:12:18,175
[SPEAKER_33]: I think we should finish this sentence after July 31st, 2021.

4212
06:12:18,235 --> 06:12:18,975
[SPEAKER_33]: Period.

4213
06:12:21,316 --> 06:12:25,898
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

4214
06:12:26,739 --> 06:12:29,140
[SPEAKER_37]: So what are we going to do if there's no recommendation though?

4215
06:12:30,595 --> 06:12:34,637
[SPEAKER_40]: What are we going to do if we can't get 23 people that want to serve on the board?

4216
06:12:34,677 --> 06:12:38,778
[SPEAKER_40]: I mean, we're going to have to address it at the time we're stuck with the issue.

4217
06:12:38,798 --> 06:12:41,159
[SPEAKER_41]: A million what ifs could happen.

4218
06:12:42,260 --> 06:12:42,460
[SPEAKER_41]: Right.

4219
06:12:45,581 --> 06:12:49,583
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I mean, I thought that's what we were doing was catching all the what ifs.

4220
06:12:49,903 --> 06:12:53,705
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the biggest what if because, you know,

4221
06:12:56,540 --> 06:13:14,204
[SPEAKER_21]: I just don't think this is actually as impossible to imagine as, I mean, I don't think that the advisory committee would purposefully do this at all, but we don't know if we will have 30 suggestions or 10,000 for crying out loud.

4222
06:13:16,505 --> 06:13:21,466
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody and their brother from all over the world who thinks it should be Christopher Columbus could send in junk names.

4223
06:13:22,686 --> 06:13:24,807
[SPEAKER_21]: All of them have to be looked at by the advisory committee.

4224
06:13:29,150 --> 06:13:36,996
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that if they do their work honestly and I don't expect any less, they still may not actually finish by July 31st.

4225
06:13:38,738 --> 06:13:54,811
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we want them to do the work and they're saying, look, we're powering through 200 of these a week, we have another nine weeks to go and there's not enough time, what are we gonna call this damn school when the kids come back, when Dr. K needs to order more envelopes?

4226
06:13:58,567 --> 06:13:59,427
[SPEAKER_21]: She needs to know that.

4227
06:13:59,547 --> 06:14:02,048
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, her staff and everybody else and all the others.

4228
06:14:02,328 --> 06:14:12,330
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we don't have to chisel the building, obviously, but it has to have a name for communication and all the other stuff that happens where that's actually on there.

4229
06:14:13,590 --> 06:14:15,291
[SPEAKER_41]: We cannot decide that tonight.

4230
06:14:15,771 --> 06:14:16,951
[SPEAKER_41]: We cannot decide that.

4231
06:14:18,611 --> 06:14:21,132
[SPEAKER_41]: What about, you know, now it's the 11th.

4232
06:14:21,432 --> 06:14:22,292
[SPEAKER_41]: We're into the 11th.

4233
06:14:22,512 --> 06:14:23,252
[SPEAKER_41]: It's March 11th.

4234
06:14:23,772 --> 06:14:26,953
[SPEAKER_41]: We cannot decide on a name, even if it's a temporary name.

4235
06:14:27,912 --> 06:14:29,553
[SPEAKER_41]: the day after a meeting was posted.

4236
06:14:29,693 --> 06:14:30,934
[SPEAKER_41]: It's not fair.

4237
06:14:32,616 --> 06:14:33,576
[SPEAKER_37]: I would agree with the mayor.

4238
06:14:33,596 --> 06:14:34,317
[SPEAKER_37]: I agree with the mayor.

4239
06:14:34,958 --> 06:14:36,199
[SPEAKER_37]: I would agree with the mayor in that case.

4240
06:14:36,259 --> 06:14:37,660
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't think we can decide on a name.

4241
06:14:38,240 --> 06:14:42,223
[SPEAKER_62]: Oh, so I think we just leave it like this and roll the dice.

4242
06:14:43,484 --> 06:14:44,445
[SPEAKER_21]: See you all in July.

4243
06:14:44,465 --> 06:14:44,525
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

4244
06:14:45,086 --> 06:14:47,768
[SPEAKER_62]: Okay.

4245
06:14:48,328 --> 06:14:50,570
[SPEAKER_62]: Any changes to this section?

4246
06:14:51,651 --> 06:14:52,231
[SPEAKER_62]: Just the date.

4247
06:14:52,812 --> 06:14:53,332
[SPEAKER_62]: The date.

4248
06:14:54,273 --> 06:14:55,113
[SPEAKER_62]: What is wrong with the date?

4249
06:14:56,920 --> 06:15:04,248
[SPEAKER_62]: they're gonna do their work by the 24th, and we're gonna do that by the 7th.

4250
06:15:04,468 --> 06:15:04,808
[SPEAKER_62]: It's fine.

4251
06:15:05,649 --> 06:15:05,929
[SPEAKER_62]: Okay.

4252
06:15:08,412 --> 06:15:10,114
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

4253
06:15:10,194 --> 06:15:11,615
[SPEAKER_39]: Paragraph A is granted.

4254
06:15:11,755 --> 06:15:11,996
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

4255
06:15:15,639 --> 06:15:16,040
[SPEAKER_32]: We did that.

4256
06:15:24,738 --> 06:15:27,059
[SPEAKER_39]: Member van de Kloot, you said we had to go back to something?

4257
06:15:28,799 --> 06:15:30,599
[SPEAKER_39]: We have to go back to the first page.

4258
06:15:32,840 --> 06:15:46,183
[SPEAKER_62]: Just give me a second to... Okay.

4259
06:15:46,724 --> 06:15:47,204
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

4260
06:15:47,764 --> 06:15:48,344
[SPEAKER_32]: This is it, guys.

4261
06:15:59,068 --> 06:16:05,590
[SPEAKER_33]: Uh, so, um, I of course think this works just fine.

4262
06:16:06,590 --> 06:16:16,973
[SPEAKER_41]: Um, the thing that, um, can I just point to what we're going over just cause it's late and this whole, this whole section we have to.

4263
06:16:17,893 --> 06:16:20,374
[SPEAKER_33]: So mine is a little different from Paul's Paul.

4264
06:16:20,494 --> 06:16:21,154
[SPEAKER_33]: I made yours.

4265
06:16:21,554 --> 06:16:22,414
[SPEAKER_33]: I made it shorter.

4266
06:16:23,115 --> 06:16:23,495
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

4267
06:16:24,335 --> 06:16:24,475
[SPEAKER_33]: Um,

4268
06:16:26,551 --> 06:16:37,264
[SPEAKER_33]: I added the most significant thing is a charge to the advisory committee where it says, I don't know how that just happened.

4269
06:16:37,484 --> 06:16:37,864
[SPEAKER_62]: Yeah.

4270
06:16:38,125 --> 06:16:42,630
[SPEAKER_62]: There's something funny going on with the formatting, so I'm just going to fix it while you talk, Paulette.

4271
06:16:46,104 --> 06:16:56,897
[SPEAKER_33]: The way that we charge is the advisory committee with the task of vetting names submitted for consideration and weighing the relative strength of submissions against a criteria they will develop.

4272
06:16:57,498 --> 06:17:05,267
[SPEAKER_33]: The criteria will include but not be limited to such factors as the potential for the name to bring the community together.

4273
06:17:05,928 --> 06:17:13,472
[SPEAKER_33]: the ability for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students, and the name as a representation of the Medford community's proud history.

4274
06:17:14,013 --> 06:17:21,357
[SPEAKER_33]: Furthermore, the advisory committee is charged with narrowing the field of names to three finalists.

4275
06:17:21,957 --> 06:17:29,081
[SPEAKER_33]: And then at that point where it says these final names, and it says either, whatever, take out that sentence.

4276
06:17:36,239 --> 06:17:50,342
[SPEAKER_33]: So take out number B. The final exams will be presented.

4277
06:17:50,422 --> 06:17:54,543
[SPEAKER_33]: So, Jenny, also the subset of A. Yes.

4278
06:18:09,406 --> 06:18:12,907
[SPEAKER_62]: And like that, Paulette?

4279
06:18:13,447 --> 06:18:13,747
[SPEAKER_62]: Yeah.

4280
06:18:17,687 --> 06:18:21,888
[SPEAKER_62]: And member Rousseau, was there other stuff in your?

4281
06:18:21,908 --> 06:18:36,451
[SPEAKER_59]: The folders.

4282
06:18:37,827 --> 06:18:42,890
[SPEAKER_33]: So there is one difference, or at least one that I remember explicitly.

4283
06:18:43,310 --> 06:18:50,894
[SPEAKER_33]: Member Russo, you had that the names of Medford schools were named after an individual and we want to continue that.

4284
06:18:51,074 --> 06:18:55,356
[SPEAKER_33]: I do not specify that also because not all the schools were named after an individual.

4285
06:18:55,936 --> 06:19:01,379
[SPEAKER_33]: Also because maybe I almost anticipated that someone might

4286
06:19:02,137 --> 06:19:05,678
[SPEAKER_33]: put in the name Mystic and I didn't want to not include that.

4287
06:19:06,278 --> 06:19:12,780
[SPEAKER_33]: So I've not defined that and I think that for me, I'd rather have it open.

4288
06:19:13,860 --> 06:19:25,643
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor, actually, I don't say that they're named after people and what it says is whereas all Medford public schools bear names with a connection to Medford and the committee wishes to retain that tradition.

4289
06:19:26,744 --> 06:19:27,584
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have that in here?

4290
06:19:28,311 --> 06:19:32,652
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't, because when you say Medford, Medford High School.

4291
06:19:33,713 --> 06:19:37,674
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I mean for the future name, this is not in the whereas, this is in the results.

4292
06:19:37,774 --> 06:19:39,174
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is what we're telling them to do.

4293
06:19:39,194 --> 06:19:44,056
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I. So could you read it again, Paul?

4294
06:19:44,256 --> 06:19:45,996
[SPEAKER_33]: Because I interpreted it differently.

4295
06:19:46,556 --> 06:19:55,099
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, mine's in the whereas, and it's simply saying that all Medford public schools are named bear names with a connection to Medford.

4296
06:19:55,680 --> 06:19:57,701
[SPEAKER_21]: and we wish to continue that tradition.

4297
06:19:57,721 --> 06:20:01,483
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, obviously- That's not true, and it hasn't always been true in the past.

4298
06:20:02,244 --> 06:20:03,024
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

4299
06:20:03,084 --> 06:20:03,664
[SPEAKER_41]: That's true now.

4300
06:20:03,704 --> 06:20:04,105
[SPEAKER_41]: I like that.

4301
06:20:04,145 --> 06:20:07,086
[SPEAKER_41]: I like that there would be a connection to Medford.

4302
06:20:07,106 --> 06:20:10,448
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, I feel like- Does Mystic count as a connection to Medford?

4303
06:20:10,488 --> 06:20:11,068
[SPEAKER_33]: Is that okay?

4304
06:20:11,549 --> 06:20:11,909
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

4305
06:20:12,429 --> 06:20:12,709
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, okay.

4306
06:20:13,430 --> 06:20:19,633
[SPEAKER_33]: So I was just seeing it just as only, but it does mean that nobody can put in Da Vinci.

4307
06:20:20,954 --> 06:20:21,734
[SPEAKER_21]: It does, yes.

4308
06:20:22,034 --> 06:20:22,254
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

4309
06:20:24,315 --> 06:20:25,176
[SPEAKER_33]: I kind of like Da Vinci.

4310
06:20:27,426 --> 06:20:29,167
[SPEAKER_33]: Everything's named after him.

4311
06:20:30,068 --> 06:20:30,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Got an awful lot.

4312
06:20:32,529 --> 06:20:33,149
[SPEAKER_33]: Galileo.

4313
06:20:33,570 --> 06:20:35,231
[SPEAKER_37]: I know, I liked Galileo too.

4314
06:20:35,671 --> 06:20:42,215
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. Galileo, are you sure you just, you know, if we just now put it, then we can see what they come up with.

4315
06:20:43,328 --> 06:20:57,852
[SPEAKER_37]: I think we leave them the latitude to let people come up with, I like the idea and we can put that as a recommendation if we want, or send them on their way or give them their charge or something to say, it would be nice if you would consider something to that effect.

4316
06:20:57,892 --> 06:21:05,034
[SPEAKER_37]: But I also think, especially with the kids and everybody, let them have their imagination and let them, I would agree.

4317
06:21:07,324 --> 06:21:17,346
[SPEAKER_33]: Melanie, in the charge, I wrote that the committee will come up with what they're measuring names against.

4318
06:21:17,946 --> 06:21:21,467
[SPEAKER_33]: And one of the measurements is the connection to Medford.

4319
06:21:21,847 --> 06:21:22,587
[SPEAKER_33]: So it is there.

4320
06:21:25,988 --> 06:21:26,088
[SPEAKER_33]: OK.

4321
06:21:26,108 --> 06:21:31,209
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me go back to the bullet three, though.

4322
06:21:38,736 --> 06:21:42,900
[SPEAKER_21]: The criteria will include but not limited to.

4323
06:21:42,920 --> 06:21:45,863
[SPEAKER_21]: I would rather the criteria may include.

4324
06:21:48,045 --> 06:21:48,706
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, that's fine.

4325
06:21:49,887 --> 06:21:53,451
[SPEAKER_21]: If they decide they don't like the criteria in that list, I think they should be free to

4326
06:21:54,130 --> 06:21:54,310
[SPEAKER_33]: Right.

4327
06:21:55,230 --> 06:22:02,812
[SPEAKER_33]: This really comes to my discussion with Rick Orlando, who co-chaired the Building the Future Committee when we built the new.

4328
06:22:03,252 --> 06:22:14,634
[SPEAKER_33]: He said the first thing that was really important is for the committee to come up with the criteria that they're going to measure their decisions against so that they've got some agreed standard.

4329
06:22:15,194 --> 06:22:20,535
[SPEAKER_33]: And he said that was really probably the most important thing that they did in making it flow so easily.

4330
06:22:20,615 --> 06:22:22,235
[SPEAKER_33]: So I thought that was important.

4331
06:22:23,038 --> 06:22:24,379
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, and I think it's great.

4332
06:22:24,439 --> 06:22:31,486
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, I mean, it's the reason the other reason for the may is that Yeah, that's fine.

4333
06:22:32,186 --> 06:22:34,809
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, representation of Medford community proud history.

4334
06:22:35,029 --> 06:22:41,475
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, not all our history is proud, but some of it still does need to be should be considered for recognition.

4335
06:22:42,356 --> 06:22:43,777
[SPEAKER_21]: And then

4336
06:22:45,014 --> 06:22:57,724
[SPEAKER_21]: But the role model part, you know, mystic as a river isn't usually considered a role model, but perhaps the mystic people is, yeah.

4337
06:22:57,804 --> 06:23:01,787
[SPEAKER_21]: So, but with the word may there, they really essentially can do whatever they want.

4338
06:23:01,947 --> 06:23:04,409
[SPEAKER_21]: And that makes me comfortable with that.

4339
06:23:06,731 --> 06:23:12,335
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the whereas's, there's a bunch of whereas's, nevermind, they're fine.

4340
06:23:16,243 --> 06:23:16,843
[SPEAKER_21]: I can look at that.

4341
06:23:17,944 --> 06:23:19,825
[SPEAKER_26]: Excuse me.

4342
06:23:20,065 --> 06:23:20,765
[SPEAKER_26]: Member McLaughlin.

4343
06:23:21,425 --> 06:23:30,209
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I was just going to ask Member Graham if she could highlight what part we're talking about right now, because I am also starting to... Oh, is this still the whole part?

4344
06:23:30,249 --> 06:23:32,390
[SPEAKER_37]: We're not going... I think we're done.

4345
06:23:32,930 --> 06:23:35,031
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I think we already did all... Oh, good.

4346
06:23:35,311 --> 06:23:36,652
[SPEAKER_37]: So... Yeah.

4347
06:23:36,872 --> 06:23:37,432
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

4348
06:23:37,472 --> 06:23:37,832
[SPEAKER_37]: That's it.

4349
06:23:38,353 --> 06:23:38,753
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

4350
06:23:39,013 --> 06:23:40,414
[SPEAKER_37]: So then, Mayor, may I?

4351
06:23:42,134 --> 06:23:43,195
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

4352
06:23:44,096 --> 06:23:52,378
[SPEAKER_37]: I just wanted to thank my colleagues and everybody that has been on the call this long and everyone for this whole process.

4353
06:23:52,438 --> 06:24:08,843
[SPEAKER_37]: I know it's been incredibly arduous and I know there have been things that we have not agreed on and I hope that folks can agree to disagree and move forward to support Medford and our children and thank you.

4354
06:24:16,581 --> 06:24:22,803
[SPEAKER_41]: We have, if we're the committee's done, I'm just gonna let the residents speak.

4355
06:24:23,863 --> 06:24:25,804
[SPEAKER_41]: Lisa, you're still keeping time, please.

4356
06:24:26,524 --> 06:24:28,485
[SPEAKER_41]: And we will take a final vote on this.

4357
06:24:31,086 --> 06:24:31,406
[SPEAKER_41]: Ingrid.

4358
06:24:39,368 --> 06:24:40,909
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I am done.

4359
06:24:41,536 --> 06:24:44,737
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what I wanted to say, I think it's pretty late.

4360
06:24:44,817 --> 06:24:45,298
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I'm done.

4361
06:24:45,318 --> 06:24:47,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Just thanks everyone for all the work you've done.

4362
06:24:49,019 --> 06:24:49,419
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

4363
06:24:49,439 --> 06:24:50,360
[SPEAKER_39]: All right.

4364
06:24:50,460 --> 06:24:50,860
[SPEAKER_39]: Annemarie?

4365
06:24:54,181 --> 06:24:55,402
[SPEAKER_54]: Can I just ask the question?

4366
06:24:55,422 --> 06:24:56,182
[SPEAKER_54]: Because I wasn't sure.

4367
06:24:56,202 --> 06:25:04,786
[SPEAKER_54]: Are you still going to be taking names of Italian people or people in history with Italian names?

4368
06:25:04,806 --> 06:25:06,226
[SPEAKER_54]: Or is that off the table?

4369
06:25:06,846 --> 06:25:07,267
[SPEAKER_41]: No, yes.

4370
06:25:07,627 --> 06:25:08,207
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, we will be.

4371
06:25:08,227 --> 06:25:09,728
[SPEAKER_54]: OK.

4372
06:25:10,128 --> 06:25:10,628
[SPEAKER_41]: Absolutely.

4373
06:25:11,676 --> 06:25:40,221
[SPEAKER_54]: All right, and then what I do ask is that, you know, for some people it's the name, for some people it's what it represents and doesn't represent, and some people believe certain readings that they have read, some have other opinions, but really keep in mind, you know, it's about culture, it's about history, it's about, yes, it's about Italians that did come into the community,

4374
06:25:40,981 --> 06:25:43,443
[SPEAKER_54]: and didn't make, made a lot of sacrifices.

4375
06:25:43,783 --> 06:25:52,529
[SPEAKER_54]: And I am an Italian, I understand exactly what the, just, you know, diversity is and all of that.

4376
06:25:52,609 --> 06:26:05,678
[SPEAKER_54]: But if it's not about the Italian name, and that's what I've been hearing tonight, then I really recommend that an Italian name be selected, because it feels as an Italian American, and I truly,

4377
06:26:06,338 --> 06:26:14,888
[SPEAKER_54]: believe this is that it's wiping out a lot of what you know the community stood for, and I understand about the change.

4378
06:26:15,469 --> 06:26:16,631
[SPEAKER_54]: I know about the diversity.

4379
06:26:16,991 --> 06:26:18,973
[SPEAKER_54]: I know about progress, but

4380
06:26:19,870 --> 06:26:38,260
[SPEAKER_54]: If it seems like we've been asking all night to postpone or whatever, and even though people have listened, they haven't heard, and people are gonna get upset that I said that, but at least listen to the fact that we do have more than just a name attached to that.

4381
06:26:38,820 --> 06:26:45,644
[SPEAKER_54]: There's a lot more that, and I don't mean to be disrespectful, but there's a lot more that maybe people are not aware of.

4382
06:26:46,164 --> 06:26:54,889
[SPEAKER_54]: that maybe if they ask the people that live in the city and has doesn't have to be, you don't have to be here your whole life, you don't have to be here 10 months, you don't have to be here a week.

4383
06:26:55,650 --> 06:26:59,532
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm just saying listen, and really understand.

4384
06:27:00,092 --> 06:27:05,156
[SPEAKER_54]: It's not just about a name.

4385
06:27:05,256 --> 06:27:05,616
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

4386
06:27:07,057 --> 06:27:07,457
[SPEAKER_40]: Nadine.

4387
06:27:10,589 --> 06:27:11,349
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you, Mayor.

4388
06:27:11,590 --> 06:27:19,894
[SPEAKER_60]: I just want to know, why aren't you honoring, not you specifically, sorry, why aren't you honoring the length of the original deadlines in that first resolution?

4389
06:27:19,914 --> 06:27:29,340
[SPEAKER_60]: I mean, I know COVID has made it difficult in many ways, but what is the issue with lengthening the whole process?

4390
06:27:30,220 --> 06:27:30,820
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm just curious.

4391
06:27:30,840 --> 06:27:33,802
[SPEAKER_41]: If anyone knows.

4392
06:27:33,822 --> 06:27:35,043
[SPEAKER_41]: I can let the committee speak.

4393
06:27:35,083 --> 06:27:38,645
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, one reason is the children go back to school in September.

4394
06:27:39,096 --> 06:27:48,322
[SPEAKER_41]: So having the name changed prior to the new school year, the process started June, 2020, but I'll let the member McLaughlin.

4395
06:27:49,903 --> 06:27:51,304
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I think that I would add to that.

4396
06:27:51,364 --> 06:28:03,652
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, the process started June, 2020 that we've had, you know, several committee meetings, several hours coming into the, you know, midnight out passing the midnight hour tonight and several conversations.

4397
06:28:03,692 --> 06:28:06,234
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think that there are people in the community that are just

4398
06:28:06,877 --> 06:28:14,002
[SPEAKER_37]: going to have to get to the point where we can agree to disagree and be able to move forward.

4399
06:28:14,042 --> 06:28:34,556
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think the timeline is important to continue the process and progress in our city and to give our children and families who have had struggles with this name for some time, some relief and to be able to stick to what we had said we would do for a deadline.

4400
06:28:44,622 --> 06:28:45,423
[SPEAKER_57]: Um, Seth.

4401
06:28:48,604 --> 06:28:49,805
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you, Mayor.

4402
06:28:50,425 --> 06:28:56,969
[SPEAKER_63]: I just wanted to mention that the Tooth Fairy in our house actually leaves notes on occasion.

4403
06:28:57,109 --> 06:29:05,513
[SPEAKER_63]: So, you know, that might be something that you might want to take advantage of tonight from middle management.

4404
06:29:05,533 --> 06:29:06,073
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

4405
06:29:06,113 --> 06:29:06,514
[SPEAKER_63]: Yes.

4406
06:29:06,834 --> 06:29:07,974
[SPEAKER_38]: Good idea.

4407
06:29:07,994 --> 06:29:08,635
[SPEAKER_38]: Good idea.

4408
06:29:09,275 --> 06:29:10,716
[SPEAKER_63]: I want to do just

4409
06:29:21,733 --> 06:29:23,774
[SPEAKER_63]: issues that have been going on in this year.

4410
06:29:23,794 --> 06:29:47,969
[SPEAKER_63]: I am happy that tomorrow morning when Ellie wakes up that I will be able to let her know that there will be a new name that will be that her school will be referred to and that there might even be some way of having her participate in that process.

4411
06:29:48,249 --> 06:29:49,790
[SPEAKER_63]: So thanks again.

4412
06:29:50,592 --> 06:29:51,613
[SPEAKER_63]: Thanks for all of your hard work.

4413
06:29:52,773 --> 06:29:53,133
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

4414
06:29:53,834 --> 06:29:58,996
[SPEAKER_63]: See you, uh, Dr. Kade tomorrow morning.

4415
06:29:59,056 --> 06:29:59,596
[SPEAKER_63]: Happy birthday.

4416
06:29:59,636 --> 06:30:00,437
[SPEAKER_63]: I think today, right?

4417
06:30:00,497 --> 06:30:03,458
[SPEAKER_63]: We'll see her in a few hours.

4418
06:30:04,819 --> 06:30:05,639
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

4419
06:30:06,100 --> 06:30:07,220
[SPEAKER_38]: Kathy, is it your birthday?

4420
06:30:08,561 --> 06:30:08,801
[SPEAKER_63]: No.

4421
06:30:14,143 --> 06:30:14,584
[SPEAKER_21]: Next week.

4422
06:30:15,624 --> 06:30:16,044
[SPEAKER_41]: Next week.

4423
06:30:16,705 --> 06:30:19,246
[SPEAKER_41]: Happy birthday, Diane.

4424
06:30:20,336 --> 06:30:23,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mayor in through you.

4425
06:30:24,322 --> 06:30:30,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Happy early birthday, and good morning everyone I just wanted to say quickly well first thank you all.

4426
06:30:30,991 --> 06:30:32,794
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you know the seats that you sit in.

4427
06:30:33,454 --> 06:30:35,357
[SPEAKER_18]: You've chosen to be there, but I.

4428
06:30:36,178 --> 06:30:40,760
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm certain you didn't anticipate this particular night going down the way that it did.

4429
06:30:40,820 --> 06:30:42,300
[SPEAKER_18]: I thank you all for your commitment.

4430
06:30:42,700 --> 06:30:54,264
[SPEAKER_18]: And to the entire community, everybody who's shown up to voice their opinion, we may or may not agree, there's always value in public debate and discourse when it's done respectfully.

4431
06:30:54,825 --> 06:30:58,046
[SPEAKER_18]: And sadly, we saw tonight it wasn't consistently.

4432
06:30:59,306 --> 06:31:04,810
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, and I couldn't help but think I wish we had just had the foresight to give this decision to the children.

4433
06:31:05,831 --> 06:31:10,654
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they would have shown us many lessons on how you get through problem solving.

4434
06:31:11,495 --> 06:31:14,256
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's also a shout out to our educators who prepare them.

4435
06:31:15,517 --> 06:31:21,161
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I heard the term this, you know, the term these people shouldn't have an opinion.

4436
06:31:21,201 --> 06:31:21,982
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard that tonight.

4437
06:31:22,942 --> 06:31:29,388
[SPEAKER_18]: And, again, and I think this is something this is children don't approach their work that way they don't think in these people senses.

4438
06:31:30,189 --> 06:31:35,093
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's something that sadly they eventually learn from adults that exclusion.

4439
06:31:36,835 --> 06:31:40,678
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think about the students who will sit in these seats, who will protect them.

4440
06:31:41,839 --> 06:32:01,805
[SPEAKER_18]: And let's promise them that they will not have to be exposed to the stuff that has gone down here this evening, where our elected officials have been outright disrespected, lied about, and basically blamed for generations of racism that still permeate within this city today.

4441
06:32:02,666 --> 06:32:06,927
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I encourage us all to protect them as we

4442
06:32:08,749 --> 06:32:12,150
[SPEAKER_18]: put this burden on them and we asked them to engage in this process.

4443
06:32:12,550 --> 06:32:14,011
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's make sure that that's equitable.

4444
06:32:14,871 --> 06:32:19,032
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard the terms equity, diversity, inclusion tonight.

4445
06:32:19,112 --> 06:32:20,093
[SPEAKER_18]: These are not buzzwords.

4446
06:32:21,233 --> 06:32:26,195
[SPEAKER_18]: If you do not understand the meaning and cannot connect to those words, please stop using them.

4447
06:32:26,995 --> 06:32:36,427
[SPEAKER_18]: There are those of us more qualified, who know what they mean and know how to bring equity forward in our community, and we're here we're not going anywhere we've been here we're not new to this community.

4448
06:32:37,388 --> 06:32:38,189
[SPEAKER_18]: So to those.

4449
06:32:38,629 --> 06:32:44,416
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for the six members who voted in favor of this decision to move forward with this change.

4450
06:32:45,257 --> 06:32:46,318
[SPEAKER_18]: We are here to support you.

4451
06:32:47,158 --> 06:32:49,159
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's it.

4452
06:32:49,659 --> 06:32:50,719
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not going anywhere.

4453
06:32:51,519 --> 06:32:58,622
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just, again, want to thank all of the members in the community for their commitment to this work and getting through this work tonight.

4454
06:32:59,022 --> 06:32:59,883
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Diane.

4455
06:33:00,143 --> 06:33:01,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much, Lisa.

4456
06:33:01,643 --> 06:33:03,084
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you, Mayor and the members.

4457
06:33:03,584 --> 06:33:03,904
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

4458
06:33:04,204 --> 06:33:04,504
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

4459
06:33:06,345 --> 06:33:08,186
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, so we have a final document.

4460
06:33:09,086 --> 06:33:11,307
