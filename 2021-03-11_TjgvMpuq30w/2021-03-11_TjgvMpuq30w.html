    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1.891s">First</a>  of all, I love the historical research and I personally think that is a contender for the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8.757s">I</a>  don't think we should limit our name only to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14.563s">I</a>  think just going ahead and voting on that tonight, we would not be following any of our policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21.249s">We</a>  wouldn't be following our naming policy, which there is actually a naming policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=25.7s">I</a>  think we've kind of set people up for expecting that there might be a process for naming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=33.867s">There's</a>  a whole lot of me which would like to say yes, but you know, let's just vote it now and over with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=40.493s">I</a>  will tell you that from all the letters we've received and the discussions we've had, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=44.837s">there</a>  will certainly still be part of our population which disagrees with the change altogether, no matter what we say or do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=53.34s">And</a>  that is because they feel that something is being taken away from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=57.021s">And</a>  of course, all of my efforts have this point have been trying to move us in a direction where we could in fact choose a name, which is good for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=68.784s">And</a>  I do think your suggestion hits that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=72.156s">Now,</a>  as vice chair, I need to report that there were more than 100 letters in the school committee account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=84.263s">Many</a>  of those letters, and if I read all 100, we will literally be here for hours and hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=91.648s">We</a>  could just turn off this and I could read for the next five hours and start our discussion at midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=97.951s">So</a>  I want to mention, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=101.289s">right</a>  now that we had 96 people asking us to supporting the name change and we received one petition from our resolution with 391 Medford residents signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=119.249s">The</a>  other last time we did receive a petition from Medford United, which also had, I think it was close to 600 Medford residents signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=132.159s">And</a>  I did read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=134.201s">If</a>  I need to go back, I can find that and read it into, all of this will be put into the record though. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=141.466s">A</a>  little tricky because in this particular time, we only have three communications <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=147.053s">opposed</a>  to the name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=150.276s">I</a>  mean, and we know that there are far more letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=155.179s">Some</a>  of the letters have come into my private account as opposed to the school committee account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=160.343s">We</a>  did receive one letter from Mr. Petrella, which I'm just going to mention because he said that he had his hand raised or was, and he didn't get to speak at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=173.152s">So</a>  I want to make sure that we're not overlooking anybody.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=176.428s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot, if I may, I did get that email as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=180.109s">And</a>  I did respond because Dr. Cushing and I, we were going by the raised hand function. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=186.39s">So</a>  I did respond that we called on everybody, including two people twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=192.192s">So</a>  I wanted to confirm with him that he wasn't physically raising his hand, make sure his camera was on, because I'm very cognizant of that as are all the committee members.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=201.124s">Yes,</a>  and I would personally like to ask, if people are speaking, please turn on your cameras so we can see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=208.206s">It's</a>  just, I know you're not mandated to, but it is much easier for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=214.167s">So</a>  if you can, that's a personal request. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=216.508s">If</a>  you don't want to, that's your option, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=222.869s">Anyway,</a>  so that's the letters received up to this point, and they've been coming in pretty consistently. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=230.971s">At</a>  this point, I'll just give it as report. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=232.913s">They'll</a>  be all put into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=235.755s">And</a>  if anybody wishes me to do anything differently, I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=241.999s">I'm</a>  at the it's at the will of the committee.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=244.681s">I</a>  think putting them in the record is the best option for right now, because I know a number of people want to speak as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=250.666s">Thank</a>  you, Member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=253.127s">Member</a>  Kreatz?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=258.037s">I</a>  just wanted to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=259.718s">Stone</a>  for sharing that history with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=261.978s">And</a>  I concur with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=264.119s">Vanderkoot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=264.879s">You</a>  know, I'm not ready to make a decision, and I do feel that this process should be a public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=273.402s">You</a>  know, from many of the community members that I've heard, you know, since June of 2020, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=280.342s">You</a>  know, we, we've been waiting for this meeting, so that we could have the public engage and, you know, ask questions and share their opinions, but I do think that that name is, you know, would be is a good suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=296.992s">Um,</a>  once we come up with the plans for choosing the names process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=302.015s">Um,</a>  so I just wanted to share that information and I just want to ask the mayor a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=306.598s">So</a>  mayor, I just had a question because I had a motion, you know, in regards to the two resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=313.763s">Should</a>  I hold off and wait till we get to that part of the meeting?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=320.367s">Well,</a>  I think you must, I think you may have amendments to the, to the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=324.109s">So</a>  I think we should take it <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=325.489s">the</a>  resolution in sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=327.952s">So</a>  you would make, I would ask that you make the amendments or we discuss each section one at a time and whether we, main thing we need to decide which one we're gonna go off of. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=340.585s">So</a>  that's, it's completely up to you, but I would say we do a section by section.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=345.498s">So</a>  I have a motion that is in regards to the entire timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=351.645s">So</a>  I'm wondering if I should just read that now and if it could be considered, you know, as a, you know, in a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=364.208s">It</a>  should probably take me about two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=367.993s">So,</a>  in my opinion, the deadlines in the meeting dates that were outlined in both resolutions are too tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=375.244s">The</a>  original resolution on June 15 stated specific dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=379.69s">You</a>  know July 121 was when the school was going to be renamed, and then there was supposed to be a committee of the whole on September 1, and that's where we are right now we're, we're at the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=392.859s">And</a>  after that, October 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=397.142s">the</a>  advisory committee was supposed to be formed, and then they would have been meeting October, November, December, January, and they would have submitted a new name to us by January 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=410.907s">Because</a>  we're in the global pandemic, three of the four deadlines were missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=416.089s">So</a>  I think we should take a step back today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=418.91s">Today</a>  marks one year into the coronavirus pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=423.032s">And</a>  the Commissioner of Education has stated that the schools must be open for full-time in-person learning on April 5, while middle school will be required to do so on April 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=434.207s">Our</a>  paramount focus should be planning to get the children, teachers, and staff back to school safely to receive the best education, having a budget to accommodate those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=444.234s">I</a>  think that this should be our priority right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=447.996s">Also,</a>  due to the magnitude of the change, I have recommended a slightly different timeline because in the original resolution, it was stated that the advisory committee should have a term of six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=464.307s">So</a>  if I go back to the original timeline, the dates were September 1st, October 1st, November, December, January, February. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=474.636s">So</a>  that was the six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=476.698s">So</a>  here we are today on April, I'm sorry, not April, March 10th, and we are meeting for the rescheduled September 1st meeting, which was the committee of the whole to plan the structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=489.52s">And</a>  we're still in the global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=491.782s">So</a>  then the next meeting, which would be the advisory committee would have been formed would be in April this coming April, which was, you know, according to the original resolution was exactly one month after the committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=507.659s">So</a>  that would bring us to April 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=510.001s">But</a>  I happen to think that April 10th is a little too soon to form the advisory committee, so I was thinking like April 30th would be a good time to form the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=521.644s">And</a>  then that would give the advisory committee April, then May, June, July and August are summer months, so we have to exclude those months, September, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=532.066s">October</a>  happens to be Italian American Heritage Month, and we celebrate, you know, Columbus Day, which is a federal holiday, so I'm not sure if we want to include that month for the research or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=546.457s">And</a>  then that would put our timeline up to November 2021, where the advisory committee would have the full six months, not including the summer months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=556.966s">It</a>  could be shorter if the committee wanted to meet during the summer months of July and August. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=562.871s">It</a>  all depends on whether or not they would meet, which would mean the advisory committee would be coming to us either if we <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=570.797s">include</a>  the summer months they would be coming to us September to bring the new research name or November to bring the new research name and this would give ample time and you know for the advisory committee to have a thoughtful reflective discussions to thoroughly research a new name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=590.824s">So</a>  this is the motion that I'm making to extend the timeline that was detailed in the in the <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=598.789s">The</a>  plan that we're working on right now is still working off of the dates that were in the original resolution, but the three dates have already been missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=611.931s">So</a>  that's my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=613.992s">My</a>  motion is to extend the timeline detailed in forming the advisory committee and pushing out the dates a little further so that the advisory committee can have six months as detailed in the original resolution.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=628.473s">Thank</a>  you member Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=638.152s">So</a>  a couple of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=639.552s">Mayor,</a>  like you, I went down and I distilled from both member Rousseau's and my own resolution key talking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=653.216s">And</a>  I asked Peter if he would put them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=656.857s">I</a>  think they're similar to yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=658.377s">There</a>  may be one difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=662.032s">Because</a>  I don't really think it's a choice between mine and Paul's so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=667.479s">I</a>  think that member Rousseau, because he was dedicated to doing this, sort of got out and laid out a process and giving <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=678.653s">us</a>  all the opportunity to say, yep, that works for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=683.438s">No,</a>  it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=684.359s">And</a>  so I wrote mine down because it was pretty convoluted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=688.303s">But</a>  the six key talking points really covers the most important things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=695.37s">Now,</a>  I had mentioned the other day at our meeting on Monday that I do have concerns about the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=703.876s">And</a>  my concerns about the timeline are because not in the first part, not the, you know, application process, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=714.022s">We</a>  actually have, member Kretsch suggested April 30th, the meeting is on April 26th, which both member Ruseau and myself put as the date to choose the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=726.986s">But</a>  it's the time, how much time does the advisory committee have to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=732.228s">And</a>  part of that is asking, what are we asking them to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=739.531s">So</a>  these are the key talking points that I put forward that you're seeing on the screen right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=746.313s">One</a>  is how is the advisory committee chosen? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=749.234s">And</a>  by the way, the application, I had one additional thing about availability and time, but otherwise mine and member Rousseau's, I think we're pretty close. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=759.765s">and</a>  not particularly complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=763.129s">But</a>  point number two is what is the makeup of the advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=766.492s">Three,</a>  once names are submitted for consideration, what is the next step in the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=772.264s">Four,</a>  what is the charge to the advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=775.265s">What</a>  are we asking them to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=777.306s">Five</a>  is how is the chair or co-chairs chosen? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=780.426s">And</a>  six, does the advisory committee bring one choice to the school committee for confirmation or up to three for our selection? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=787.409s">Those</a>  are really the key points that member Brousseau and myself look at in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=796.733s">So</a>  that's just, I put that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=799.335s">I</a>  know there are many hands raised now, so I'm just gonna lay that out right now.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=804.458s">Yep,</a>  we're gonna do public participation, and then we will, mine are similar to yours, Member Van der Kloot, we'll work off of one, maybe Paul's, where you know yours best, and we'll go through it one section at a time, knowing those are the key issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=819.488s">Anne-Marie?</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Maria]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=826.135s">Could</a>  you hear me now?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_64]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=827.215s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Maria]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=829.236s">Man,</a>  you can hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=830.477s">Okay,</a>  so I do understand where everyone is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=836.439s">I</a>  know you have two motions actually on the table, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=840.181s">One</a>  was from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=841.462s">Mostone</a>  and the other one is from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=843.582s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=845.683s">But</a>  again, I will reiterate it from my standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=849.625s">And</a>  my standpoint is that with <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=852.318s">the</a>  commissioner of education coming out and giving us all, or giving you guys, the schedule of when our children are supposed to be going back to school, there is so much to be really considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=867.882s">You</a>  need to look at your budget, you need to look at, you know, custodians, are you gonna be getting contractors to come in to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=875.064s">Yes,</a>  they've been doing a great job up until today, but that is comparing <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=880.526s">two,</a>  three days a week compared to students that are going in five days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=884.827s">I</a>  do know that there's already other cities that have already have responded to the commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=892.789s">I</a>  know Burlington has actually stated that they might start earlier than the deadlines that he has given. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=898.851s">I</a>  believe there's another city that has also mentioned the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=902.811s">So</a>  again, I will reiterate the name change or no name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=910.037s">precedence.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=911.437s">We</a>  need to get our kids in school and time is of the essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=915.379s">Could</a>  someone at least explain how many more meetings are going to be invested into this advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=925.801s">From</a>  the school committee also, not just the advisory committee, because school committee has to be some part of that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=932.203s">Right,</a>  that's what we're here to figure out tonight, Anne-Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=935.406s">this</a>  will outline as best we can how many meetings it will take for the school committee, the advisory committee and create a timeline for that.</p>

    <p>[Anna Maria]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=942.509s">Okay,</a>  because again, as one of your members had posted, you know, you have a really contagious budget that you have to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=950.513s">And</a>  that's coming, that should have already been started. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=953.915s">And</a>  the discussion is already should have already started. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=956.056s">I'm</a>  not aware if it has. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=957.696s">But</a>  I also do know that right around the corner, we hit June. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=962.368s">And</a>  at the end of June, school committee has to present the budget, has to be accepted by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=967.509s">A</a>  lot of people go on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.35s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.911s">So</a>  it's all right.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=973.371s">Thank</a>  you, Anne-Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=975.011s">That</a>  was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=978.232s">We</a>  have, I don't know the name, iPhone X.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=992.837s">I'm</a>  trying to unmute you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_59]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=996.479s">Hold</a>  on one second.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1012.861s">There</a>  you go.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1013.221s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1013.681s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1014.061s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1015.322s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1016.062s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1016.923s">Under</a>  the guise that I'm in a time sensitive issue here, I just wanted to go back and revisit the thought process behind why this is so sentimental to the Italian American community and others as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1031.688s">And</a>  I was doing some homework and doing some research and found an article that was printed in June <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1038.231s">18th</a>  2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1038.671s">It</a>  was printed by a Louis Navier and I just want to read a portion of it because it is very very lengthy and I don't want to take everyone through it but it's certainly something that everyone can either look up or I can certainly send it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1052.315s">So</a>  this portion is based off of why the Columbus, it's basically more about Columbus Day but why the name Columbus is important or at least in the psyche. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1063.378s">In</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1065.803s">New</a>  Orleans in 1891, back in March of 1891, a gentleman named David Hennessey was murdered. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1074.11s">He</a>  was a police chief and he was murdered by people of Italian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1081.256s">So</a>  there were 11 Italians that were brought up on trial and were acquitted, come to find out they weren't even part of what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1089.614s">But</a>  back then, because the Italians were hated so much by the United States as such as Mark Twain would likely predict, an extrajudicial killing and an Italian accused of murder as the outcome more likely than a trial by jury. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1104.146s">Twain</a>  was not being provocative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1105.807s">He</a>  was inspired by true events. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1107.529s">And</a>  this was one of those events. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1109.719s">These</a>  11 Italian Americans, which were dock workers, cobblers, food vendors, tin smith, one was even a laborer on a plantation, were all round up after that and they were lynched.</p>

    <p>[j0qza4ZNB3E_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1124.373s">They</a>  were murdered.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1126.224s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1126.924s">So</a>  in a nutshell, I just want to let you know that this was something that was brought out back in 1891 and President Harrison in 1891 created Columbus Day in recognition of the Italian community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1141.827s">I</a>  wish I could finish this because it is very, very important to understand the context of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1146.748s">And</a>  this was something that was created that really is very, very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1149.789s">And</a>  I hope that everybody can get in touch with me to understand this better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1153.089s">The</a>  Italian community deserves to hear about this.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1159.841s">that</a>  you'll have more time to speak on each issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1162.842s">Dave,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_64]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1164.143s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1165.603s">Mayor,</a>  I just wanted to... Mayor, I just heard from iPhone X, and I guess he was trying to unmute, but he couldn't unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1175.046s">Would</a>  you be able to try him again?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1176.447s">It</a>  was the iPhone X. Okay, we'll have... Yep, he's in queue, or she. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1183.77s">He</a>  or she is in queue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1185.09s">I</a>  just unmuted Nadine, and then we'll go...</p>

    <p>[Miguel Aguiso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1188.876s">Madam</a>  Mayor, can you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1192.798s">Yes,</a>  Nadine, hold off one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1195.039s">Yes,</a>  go ahead, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1196.019s">What's</a>  your name?</p>

    <p>[Miguel Aguiso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1197.96s">My</a>  name is Miguel Aguiso, 61 Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1201.762s">I</a>  just wanted to say off the record, I'm in total opposition of the Columbus School being changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1207.284s">But</a>  I just had a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1208.745s">I</a>  heard earlier that there was 300 and some odd people that were in, that were, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1215.234s">For</a>  the change, for the record, how many people were against it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1218.577s">I</a>  miss Vanderdijk, I believe her name is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1221.379s">She</a>  said that there were some sort of people in the 600 name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1224.762s">And</a>  then second part, how much is a name change going to cost us in Medford, if you don't mind me asking?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1230.908s">Yeah,</a>  the two petitions we received, one was in favor, that was $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1237.71s">96</a>  people, and then the petition we were given on Monday was from a different group, Medford United, and that was, oh, I think 650 Medford residents.</p>

    <p>[Miguel Aguiso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1249.398s">650</a>  for an opposition of the change? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1253.301s">An</a>  opposition, correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1254.722s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1256.163s">And</a>  you have a number on how much this is gonna cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1259.486s">I</a>  don't have a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1260.367s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1262.548s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1265.15s">Nadine,</a>  are you unmuted?</p>

    <p>[Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1270.239s">I</a>  think I am now, Mayor, can you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1272.361s">Yes,</a>  yes, there you go.</p>

    <p>[Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1273.582s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1275.423s">Nadine</a>  Moretti, 126 Burgett Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1279.526s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor, and good evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1281.908s">My</a>  intent isn't to make this a personal attack, but it is certainly a personal attack on everyone you have listened to about how this is affecting them, our city, and that ultimately their voices, opinions, and feelings mean nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1296.459s">You've</a>  listened to so many people <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1298.798s">but</a>  are you truly hearing us? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1300.641s">As</a>  of Monday night, it still appears the school committee will move forward regardless of the speakers who so eloquently asked you to reconsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1306.309s">Do</a>  right by Medford's residents and in light of the workload ahead of you after Desi's recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1312.098s">Wondering</a>  if any of that resonated with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1315.6s">To</a>  quote member Rousseau back in June 2020, I would make this decision and put this forward if literally every person wrote to me and said, do not change the name and I wouldn't bat an eyelash. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1326.665s">This</a>  statement certainly resonated with a myriad of registered voters and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1331.587s">My</a>  children, along with Paul's, attended Columbus Elementary for nine years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1335.809s">We</a>  went on field trips together, were on the PTO, hung at the school yard daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1339.811s">I</a>  volunteered in my children's classrooms, at events within the school, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1343.28s">Never</a>  once hearing or heard a word, excuse me, uttered that it was a bothersome or offensive name because it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1350.324s">Renaming</a>  any school is bigger than just the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1353.006s">It</a>  doesn't matter that an advisory committee was slated to be formed because as we recently learned, those deadlines have passed and more importantly, without proper input or inclusion of the residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1364.453s">But</a>  we're still in a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1366.069s">You</a>  now have been tasked with figuring out how to get, at the very least, K-5 back in school, per the latest guidance from DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1373.591s">In</a>  light of so many requests to table it for these reasons, there shouldn't be a rush to complete this unless it's personally driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1381.093s">You</a>  are voted in to be the voice of all the parents, not only the ones that agree about the Columbus school name being changed after 90 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1390.148s">This</a>  proposal is part of an agenda to change and cancel what they see fit or render offensive and unhealthy culture being driven by our evolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1397.874s">So</a>  in closing, you're well aware that I'm 100% against renaming Columbus Elementary, but I'm more against the school- Time's up, Nadine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1406.52s">Making</a>  it a priority over normal learning environment for our children during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1411.684s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1412.065s">Thank</a>  you, Nadine.</p>

    <p>[Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1414.847s">Bill?</a> </p>

    <p>[Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1421.786s">Hello?</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1424.107s">Bill,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1425.107s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1426.408s">I'm</a>  sorry, okay.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1427.609s">A</a>  little bit.</p>

    <p>[Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1428.809s">Can</a>  you hear me okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1430.41s">Hello?</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1431.21s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1432.151s">You</a>  can hear me fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1434.071s">Okay,</a>  my name's Bill Giglio. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1435.752s">My</a>  statement is for Paul, and this is not to pick on Paul or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1439.954s">Paul,</a>  you're in your second term, but yet this has never been an issue with you in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1445.917s">Your</a>  platform or anyone else on the committee's platform has never ran <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1450.296s">on</a>  the name change being such a high priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1453.419s">Since</a>  becoming a member just before the 2019 election of an extreme left progressive group called the Our Revolution, this seems to fall right in line with their ideology of changing history and the national narrative of cancel culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1465.909s">So</a>  your resolution to change the name of the Columbus School seems a little sketchy, suspicious, and disingenuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1471.393s">Plus</a>  we all know this opens up the floodgates for everything else to be renamed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1476.537s">That's</a>  just my first half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1477.338s">But</a>  my second half is actually a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1479.019s">This</a>  was obviously a go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1480.952s">So</a>  like the other gentleman had said, what is going to be the cost for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1485.253s">When</a>  can we expect the breakdown of who's going to be doing such work, such as the lawyers, contractors, state filing fees, and what they're going to be getting paid to do their work? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1495.796s">If</a>  this is being funded by some sort of donations, when can we expect a list of who's donating? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1500.737s">And</a>  should a group such as the Our Revolution be allowed to donate? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1506.979s">Because</a>  I can tell you, a lot of us do not want this coming out of <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1511.181s">school</a>  money or tax funded money.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1515.384s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1515.705s">I</a>  will work on getting a breakdown of how much this will cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1518.887s">I'm</a>  not sure as of tonight.</p>

    <p>[Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1520.509s">I'll</a>  ask at this point, why if, if the, if the date would have been July, how come there's none of that is even thought of or, or, you know, research. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1534.68s">I</a>  mean, that's, that's a, that's a huge factor.</p>
