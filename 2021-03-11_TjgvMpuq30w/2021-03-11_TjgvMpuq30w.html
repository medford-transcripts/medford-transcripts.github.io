    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1.891s">First</a>  of all, I love the historical research and I personally think that is a contender for the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8.757s">I</a>  don't think we should limit our name only to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14.563s">I</a>  think just going ahead and voting on that tonight, we would not be following any of our policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21.249s">We</a>  wouldn't be following our naming policy, which there is actually a naming policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=25.7s">I</a>  think we've kind of set people up for expecting that there might be a process for naming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=33.867s">There's</a>  a whole lot of me which would like to say yes, but you know, let's just vote it now and over with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=40.493s">I</a>  will tell you that from all the letters we've received and the discussions we've had, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=44.837s">there</a>  will certainly still be part of our population which disagrees with the change altogether, no matter what we say or do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=53.34s">And</a>  that is because they feel that something is being taken away from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=57.021s">And</a>  of course, all of my efforts have this point have been trying to move us in a direction where we could in fact choose a name, which is good for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=68.784s">And</a>  I do think your suggestion hits that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=72.156s">Now,</a>  as vice chair, I need to report that there were more than 100 letters in the school committee account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=84.263s">Many</a>  of those letters, and if I read all 100, we will literally be here for hours and hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=91.648s">We</a>  could just turn off this and I could read for the next five hours and start our discussion at midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=97.951s">So</a>  I want to mention, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=101.289s">right</a>  now that we had 96 people asking us to supporting the name change and we received one petition from our resolution with 391 Medford residents signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=119.249s">The</a>  other last time we did receive a petition from Medford United, which also had, I think it was close to 600 Medford residents signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=132.159s">And</a>  I did read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=134.201s">If</a>  I need to go back, I can find that and read it into, all of this will be put into the record though. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=141.466s">A</a>  little tricky because in this particular time, we only have three communications <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=147.053s">opposed</a>  to the name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=150.276s">I</a>  mean, and we know that there are far more letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=155.179s">Some</a>  of the letters have come into my private account as opposed to the school committee account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=160.343s">We</a>  did receive one letter from Mr. Petrella, which I'm just going to mention because he said that he had his hand raised or was, and he didn't get to speak at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=173.152s">So</a>  I want to make sure that we're not overlooking anybody.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=176.428s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot, if I may, I did get that email as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=180.109s">And</a>  I did respond because Dr. Cushing and I, we were going by the raised hand function. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=186.39s">So</a>  I did respond that we called on everybody, including two people twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=192.192s">So</a>  I wanted to confirm with him that he wasn't physically raising his hand, make sure his camera was on, because I'm very cognizant of that as are all the committee members.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=201.124s">Yes,</a>  and I would personally like to ask, if people are speaking, please turn on your cameras so we can see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=208.206s">It's</a>  just, I know you're not mandated to, but it is much easier for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=214.167s">So</a>  if you can, that's a personal request. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=216.508s">If</a>  you don't want to, that's your option, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=222.869s">Anyway,</a>  so that's the letters received up to this point, and they've been coming in pretty consistently. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=230.971s">At</a>  this point, I'll just give it as report. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=232.913s">They'll</a>  be all put into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=235.755s">And</a>  if anybody wishes me to do anything differently, I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=241.999s">I'm</a>  at the it's at the will of the committee.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=244.681s">I</a>  think putting them in the record is the best option for right now, because I know a number of people want to speak as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=250.666s">Thank</a>  you, Member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=253.127s">Member</a>  Kreatz?</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=258.037s">I</a>  just wanted to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=259.718s">Stone</a>  for sharing that history with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=261.978s">And</a>  I concur with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=264.119s">Vanderkoot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=264.879s">You</a>  know, I'm not ready to make a decision, and I do feel that this process should be a public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=273.402s">You</a>  know, from many of the community members that I've heard, you know, since June of 2020, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=280.342s">You</a>  know, we, we've been waiting for this meeting, so that we could have the public engage and, you know, ask questions and share their opinions, but I do think that that name is, you know, would be is a good suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=296.992s">Um,</a>  once we come up with the plans for choosing the names process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=302.015s">Um,</a>  so I just wanted to share that information and I just want to ask the mayor a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=306.598s">So</a>  mayor, I just had a question because I had a motion, you know, in regards to the two resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=313.763s">Should</a>  I hold off and wait till we get to that part of the meeting?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=320.367s">Well,</a>  I think you must, I think you may have amendments to the, to the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=324.109s">So</a>  I think we should take it <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=325.489s">the</a>  resolution in sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=327.952s">So</a>  you would make, I would ask that you make the amendments or we discuss each section one at a time and whether we, main thing we need to decide which one we're gonna go off of. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=340.585s">So</a>  that's, it's completely up to you, but I would say we do a section by section.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=345.498s">So</a>  I have a motion that is in regards to the entire timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=351.645s">So</a>  I'm wondering if I should just read that now and if it could be considered, you know, as a, you know, in a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=364.208s">It</a>  should probably take me about two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=367.993s">So,</a>  in my opinion, the deadlines in the meeting dates that were outlined in both resolutions are too tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=375.244s">The</a>  original resolution on June 15 stated specific dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=379.69s">You</a>  know July 121 was when the school was going to be renamed, and then there was supposed to be a committee of the whole on September 1, and that's where we are right now we're, we're at the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=392.859s">And</a>  after that, October 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=397.142s">the</a>  advisory committee was supposed to be formed, and then they would have been meeting October, November, December, January, and they would have submitted a new name to us by January 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=410.907s">Because</a>  we're in the global pandemic, three of the four deadlines were missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=416.089s">So</a>  I think we should take a step back today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=418.91s">Today</a>  marks one year into the coronavirus pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=423.032s">And</a>  the Commissioner of Education has stated that the schools must be open for full-time in-person learning on April 5, while middle school will be required to do so on April 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=434.207s">Our</a>  paramount focus should be planning to get the children, teachers, and staff back to school safely to receive the best education, having a budget to accommodate those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=444.234s">I</a>  think that this should be our priority right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=447.996s">Also,</a>  due to the magnitude of the change, I have recommended a slightly different timeline because in the original resolution, it was stated that the advisory committee should have a term of six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=464.307s">So</a>  if I go back to the original timeline, the dates were September 1st, October 1st, November, December, January, February. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=474.636s">So</a>  that was the six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=476.698s">So</a>  here we are today on April, I'm sorry, not April, March 10th, and we are meeting for the rescheduled September 1st meeting, which was the committee of the whole to plan the structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=489.52s">And</a>  we're still in the global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=491.782s">So</a>  then the next meeting, which would be the advisory committee would have been formed would be in April this coming April, which was, you know, according to the original resolution was exactly one month after the committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=507.659s">So</a>  that would bring us to April 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=510.001s">But</a>  I happen to think that April 10th is a little too soon to form the advisory committee, so I was thinking like April 30th would be a good time to form the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=521.644s">And</a>  then that would give the advisory committee April, then May, June, July and August are summer months, so we have to exclude those months, September, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=532.066s">October</a>  happens to be Italian American Heritage Month, and we celebrate, you know, Columbus Day, which is a federal holiday, so I'm not sure if we want to include that month for the research or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=546.457s">And</a>  then that would put our timeline up to November 2021, where the advisory committee would have the full six months, not including the summer months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=556.966s">It</a>  could be shorter if the committee wanted to meet during the summer months of July and August. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=562.871s">It</a>  all depends on whether or not they would meet, which would mean the advisory committee would be coming to us either if we <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=570.797s">include</a>  the summer months they would be coming to us September to bring the new research name or November to bring the new research name and this would give ample time and you know for the advisory committee to have a thoughtful reflective discussions to thoroughly research a new name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=590.824s">So</a>  this is the motion that I'm making to extend the timeline that was detailed in the in the <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=598.789s">The</a>  plan that we're working on right now is still working off of the dates that were in the original resolution, but the three dates have already been missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=611.931s">So</a>  that's my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=613.992s">My</a>  motion is to extend the timeline detailed in forming the advisory committee and pushing out the dates a little further so that the advisory committee can have six months as detailed in the original resolution.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=628.473s">Thank</a>  you member Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=638.152s">So</a>  a couple of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=639.552s">Mayor,</a>  like you, I went down and I distilled from both member Rousseau's and my own resolution key talking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=653.216s">And</a>  I asked Peter if he would put them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=656.857s">I</a>  think they're similar to yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=658.377s">There</a>  may be one difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=662.032s">Because</a>  I don't really think it's a choice between mine and Paul's so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=667.479s">I</a>  think that member Rousseau, because he was dedicated to doing this, sort of got out and laid out a process and giving <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=678.653s">us</a>  all the opportunity to say, yep, that works for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=683.438s">No,</a>  it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=684.359s">And</a>  so I wrote mine down because it was pretty convoluted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=688.303s">But</a>  the six key talking points really covers the most important things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=695.37s">Now,</a>  I had mentioned the other day at our meeting on Monday that I do have concerns about the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=703.876s">And</a>  my concerns about the timeline are because not in the first part, not the, you know, application process, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=714.022s">We</a>  actually have, member Kretsch suggested April 30th, the meeting is on April 26th, which both member Ruseau and myself put as the date to choose the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=726.986s">But</a>  it's the time, how much time does the advisory committee have to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=732.228s">And</a>  part of that is asking, what are we asking them to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=739.531s">So</a>  these are the key talking points that I put forward that you're seeing on the screen right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=746.313s">One</a>  is how is the advisory committee chosen? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=749.234s">And</a>  by the way, the application, I had one additional thing about availability and time, but otherwise mine and member Rousseau's, I think we're pretty close. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=759.765s">and</a>  not particularly complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=763.129s">But</a>  point number two is what is the makeup of the advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=766.492s">Three,</a>  once names are submitted for consideration, what is the next step in the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=772.264s">Four,</a>  what is the charge to the advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=775.265s">What</a>  are we asking them to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=777.306s">Five</a>  is how is the chair or co-chairs chosen? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=780.426s">And</a>  six, does the advisory committee bring one choice to the school committee for confirmation or up to three for our selection? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=787.409s">Those</a>  are really the key points that member Brousseau and myself look at in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=796.733s">So</a>  that's just, I put that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=799.335s">I</a>  know there are many hands raised now, so I'm just gonna lay that out right now.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=804.458s">Yep,</a>  we're gonna do public participation, and then we will, mine are similar to yours, Member Van der Kloot, we'll work off of one, maybe Paul's, where you know yours best, and we'll go through it one section at a time, knowing those are the key issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=819.488s">Anne-Marie?</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=826.135s">Could</a>  you hear me now?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_64]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=827.215s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=829.236s">Man,</a>  you can hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=830.477s">Okay,</a>  so I do understand where everyone is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=836.439s">I</a>  know you have two motions actually on the table, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=840.181s">One</a>  was from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=841.462s">Mostone</a>  and the other one is from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=843.582s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=845.683s">But</a>  again, I will reiterate it from my standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=849.625s">And</a>  my standpoint is that with <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=852.318s">the</a>  commissioner of education coming out and giving us all, or giving you guys, the schedule of when our children are supposed to be going back to school, there is so much to be really considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=867.882s">You</a>  need to look at your budget, you need to look at, you know, custodians, are you gonna be getting contractors to come in to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=875.064s">Yes,</a>  they've been doing a great job up until today, but that is comparing <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=880.526s">two,</a>  three days a week compared to students that are going in five days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=884.827s">I</a>  do know that there's already other cities that have already have responded to the commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=892.789s">I</a>  know Burlington has actually stated that they might start earlier than the deadlines that he has given. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=898.851s">I</a>  believe there's another city that has also mentioned the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=902.811s">So</a>  again, I will reiterate the name change or no name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=910.037s">precedence.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=911.437s">We</a>  need to get our kids in school and time is of the essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=915.379s">Could</a>  someone at least explain how many more meetings are going to be invested into this advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=925.801s">From</a>  the school committee also, not just the advisory committee, because school committee has to be some part of that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=932.203s">Right,</a>  that's what we're here to figure out tonight, Anne-Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=935.406s">this</a>  will outline as best we can how many meetings it will take for the school committee, the advisory committee and create a timeline for that.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=942.509s">Okay,</a>  because again, as one of your members had posted, you know, you have a really contagious budget that you have to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=950.513s">And</a>  that's coming, that should have already been started. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=953.915s">And</a>  the discussion is already should have already started. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=956.056s">I'm</a>  not aware if it has. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=957.696s">But</a>  I also do know that right around the corner, we hit June. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=962.368s">And</a>  at the end of June, school committee has to present the budget, has to be accepted by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=967.509s">A</a>  lot of people go on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.35s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=971.911s">So</a>  it's all right.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=973.371s">Thank</a>  you, Anne-Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=975.011s">That</a>  was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=978.232s">We</a>  have, I don't know the name, iPhone X.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=992.837s">I'm</a>  trying to unmute you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_59]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=996.479s">Hold</a>  on one second.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1012.861s">There</a>  you go.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1013.221s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1013.681s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1014.061s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1015.322s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1016.062s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1016.923s">Under</a>  the guise that I'm in a time sensitive issue here, I just wanted to go back and revisit the thought process behind why this is so sentimental to the Italian American community and others as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1031.688s">And</a>  I was doing some homework and doing some research and found an article that was printed in June <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1038.231s">18th</a>  2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1038.671s">It</a>  was printed by a Louis Navier and I just want to read a portion of it because it is very very lengthy and I don't want to take everyone through it but it's certainly something that everyone can either look up or I can certainly send it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1052.315s">So</a>  this portion is based off of why the Columbus, it's basically more about Columbus Day but why the name Columbus is important or at least in the psyche. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1063.378s">In</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1065.803s">New</a>  Orleans in 1891, back in March of 1891, a gentleman named David Hennessey was murdered. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1074.11s">He</a>  was a police chief and he was murdered by people of Italian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1081.256s">So</a>  there were 11 Italians that were brought up on trial and were acquitted, come to find out they weren't even part of what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1089.614s">But</a>  back then, because the Italians were hated so much by the United States as such as Mark Twain would likely predict, an extrajudicial killing and an Italian accused of murder as the outcome more likely than a trial by jury. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1104.146s">Twain</a>  was not being provocative. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1105.807s">He</a>  was inspired by true events. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1107.529s">And</a>  this was one of those events. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1109.719s">These</a>  11 Italian Americans, which were dock workers, cobblers, food vendors, tin smith, one was even a laborer on a plantation, were all round up after that and they were lynched.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1124.373s">They</a>  were murdered.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1126.224s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1126.924s">So</a>  in a nutshell, I just want to let you know that this was something that was brought out back in 1891 and President Harrison in 1891 created Columbus Day in recognition of the Italian community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1141.827s">I</a>  wish I could finish this because it is very, very important to understand the context of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1146.748s">And</a>  this was something that was created that really is very, very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1149.789s">And</a>  I hope that everybody can get in touch with me to understand this better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1153.089s">The</a>  Italian community deserves to hear about this.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1159.841s">that</a>  you'll have more time to speak on each issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1162.842s">Dave,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_64]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1164.143s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1165.603s">Mayor,</a>  I just wanted to... Mayor, I just heard from iPhone X, and I guess he was trying to unmute, but he couldn't unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1175.046s">Would</a>  you be able to try him again?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1176.447s">It</a>  was the iPhone X. Okay, we'll have... Yep, he's in queue, or she. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1183.77s">He</a>  or she is in queue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1185.09s">I</a>  just unmuted Nadine, and then we'll go...</p>

    <p>[Miguel Aguiso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1188.876s">Madam</a>  Mayor, can you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1192.798s">Yes,</a>  Nadine, hold off one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1195.039s">Yes,</a>  go ahead, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1196.019s">What's</a>  your name?</p>

    <p>[Miguel Aguiso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1197.96s">My</a>  name is Miguel Aguiso, 61 Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1201.762s">I</a>  just wanted to say off the record, I'm in total opposition of the Columbus School being changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1207.284s">But</a>  I just had a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1208.745s">I</a>  heard earlier that there was 300 and some odd people that were in, that were, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1215.234s">For</a>  the change, for the record, how many people were against it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1218.577s">I</a>  miss Vanderdijk, I believe her name is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1221.379s">She</a>  said that there were some sort of people in the 600 name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1224.762s">And</a>  then second part, how much is a name change going to cost us in Medford, if you don't mind me asking?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1230.908s">Yeah,</a>  the two petitions we received, one was in favor, that was $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1237.71s">96</a>  people, and then the petition we were given on Monday was from a different group, Medford United, and that was, oh, I think 650 Medford residents.</p>

    <p>[Miguel Aguiso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1249.398s">650</a>  for an opposition of the change? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1253.301s">An</a>  opposition, correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1254.722s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1256.163s">And</a>  you have a number on how much this is gonna cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1259.486s">I</a>  don't have a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1260.367s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1262.548s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1265.15s">Nadine,</a>  are you unmuted?</p>

    <p>[Nadeen Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1270.239s">I</a>  think I am now, Mayor, can you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1272.361s">Yes,</a>  yes, there you go.</p>

    <p>[Nadeen Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1273.582s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1275.423s">Nadine</a>  Moretti, 126 Burgett Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1279.526s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor, and good evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1281.908s">My</a>  intent isn't to make this a personal attack, but it is certainly a personal attack on everyone you have listened to about how this is affecting them, our city, and that ultimately their voices, opinions, and feelings mean nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1296.459s">You've</a>  listened to so many people <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1298.798s">but</a>  are you truly hearing us? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1300.641s">As</a>  of Monday night, it still appears the school committee will move forward regardless of the speakers who so eloquently asked you to reconsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1306.309s">Do</a>  right by Medford's residents and in light of the workload ahead of you after Desi's recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1312.098s">Wondering</a>  if any of that resonated with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1315.6s">To</a>  quote member Rousseau back in June 2020, I would make this decision and put this forward if literally every person wrote to me and said, do not change the name and I wouldn't bat an eyelash. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1326.665s">This</a>  statement certainly resonated with a myriad of registered voters and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1331.587s">My</a>  children, along with Paul's, attended Columbus Elementary for nine years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1335.809s">We</a>  went on field trips together, were on the PTO, hung at the school yard daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1339.811s">I</a>  volunteered in my children's classrooms, at events within the school, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1343.28s">Never</a>  once hearing or heard a word, excuse me, uttered that it was a bothersome or offensive name because it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1350.324s">Renaming</a>  any school is bigger than just the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1353.006s">It</a>  doesn't matter that an advisory committee was slated to be formed because as we recently learned, those deadlines have passed and more importantly, without proper input or inclusion of the residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1364.453s">But</a>  we're still in a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1366.069s">You</a>  now have been tasked with figuring out how to get, at the very least, K-5 back in school, per the latest guidance from DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1373.591s">In</a>  light of so many requests to table it for these reasons, there shouldn't be a rush to complete this unless it's personally driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1381.093s">You</a>  are voted in to be the voice of all the parents, not only the ones that agree about the Columbus school name being changed after 90 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1390.148s">This</a>  proposal is part of an agenda to change and cancel what they see fit or render offensive and unhealthy culture being driven by our evolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1397.874s">So</a>  in closing, you're well aware that I'm 100% against renaming Columbus Elementary, but I'm more against the school- Time's up, Nadine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1406.52s">Making</a>  it a priority over normal learning environment for our children during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1411.684s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1412.065s">Thank</a>  you, Nadine.</p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1421.786s">Hello?</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1424.107s">Bill,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1425.107s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1426.408s">I'm</a>  sorry, okay.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1427.609s">A</a>  little bit.</p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1428.809s">Can</a>  you hear me okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1430.41s">Hello?</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1431.21s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1432.151s">You</a>  can hear me fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1434.071s">Okay,</a>  my name's Bill Giglio. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1435.752s">My</a>  statement is for Paul, and this is not to pick on Paul or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1439.954s">Paul,</a>  you're in your second term, but yet this has never been an issue with you in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1445.917s">Your</a>  platform or anyone else on the committee's platform has never ran <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1450.296s">on</a>  the name change being such a high priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1453.419s">Since</a>  becoming a member just before the 2019 election of an extreme left progressive group called the Our Revolution, this seems to fall right in line with their ideology of changing history and the national narrative of cancel culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1465.909s">So</a>  your resolution to change the name of the Columbus School seems a little sketchy, suspicious, and disingenuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1471.393s">Plus</a>  we all know this opens up the floodgates for everything else to be renamed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1476.537s">That's</a>  just my first half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1477.338s">But</a>  my second half is actually a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1479.019s">This</a>  was obviously a go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1480.952s">So</a>  like the other gentleman had said, what is going to be the cost for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1485.253s">When</a>  can we expect the breakdown of who's going to be doing such work, such as the lawyers, contractors, state filing fees, and what they're going to be getting paid to do their work? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1495.796s">If</a>  this is being funded by some sort of donations, when can we expect a list of who's donating? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1500.737s">And</a>  should a group such as the Our Revolution be allowed to donate? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1506.979s">Because</a>  I can tell you, a lot of us do not want this coming out of <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1511.181s">school</a>  money or tax funded money.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1515.384s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1515.705s">I</a>  will work on getting a breakdown of how much this will cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1518.887s">I'm</a>  not sure as of tonight.</p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1520.509s">I'll</a>  ask at this point, why if, if the, if the date would have been July, how come there's none of that is even thought of or, or, you know, research. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1534.68s">I</a>  mean, that's, that's a, that's a huge factor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1537.796s">The</a>  school committee has the authority to change the name of a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1541.268s">That's</a>  the only answer I can give you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1545.049s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1545.329s">Can</a>  anybody else? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1546.61s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1548.311s">I</a>  would like to address one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1551.373s">Many</a>  people are speaking about all the different things that the school committee faces, and that's absolutely true. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1558.537s">We</a>  have a lot of work ahead of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1561.559s">However,</a>  and part of this is being brought about, well, you need more time to hear us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1569.033s">We</a>  have heard strongly from the community, and I myself have gone and spoken to some members who are very anti the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1578.579s">And</a>  it's very, very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1580.56s">But</a>  to say you don't have enough time, well, frankly, we're a pretty dedicated bunch all across. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1587.164s">And</a>  I don't think that once we get through <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1591.707s">the</a>  process and work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1593.948s">And</a>  there will be some things that I speak to, like removing one piece, we'll get to it later, off of a school committee onto a committee of the whole instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1605.912s">You</a>  know, so I do, and the other thing which I think is key for me to say as the longest serving school committee member is, and when this first came up, I spoke to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1617.856s">Now,</a>  when this first came up, I will tell you, and I've said to other people, I wasn't happy with the process, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1625.262s">Because</a>  at that first meeting, I felt confident in that, yes, I did feel there was a reason to change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1634.17s">You</a>  must remember that there was in light of a very <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1638.133s">a</a>  spring of great reckoning and understanding of what was going on in our world and the racism that exists that we all saw with our own eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1651.088s">And</a>  there is a context to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1654.568s">But</a>  20 years ago, when we built the new schools, I can absolutely tell you that there was a discussion in the committee, in the Building the Future Committee of which I was part, about the naming of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1670.523s">And</a>  at that time, we were well aware that there were people who would much prefer it not to be the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1681.029s">I've</a>  kicked myself sometimes because I let that go, partially in deference to a community member who I had great respect for and who didn't want it to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1693.162s">But</a>  it's been a recurring <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1698.328s">You</a>  know, maybe you haven't heard it, but I have over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1704.191s">I've</a>  heard it, I've had discussions down at the Columbus School with parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1708.093s">So</a>  it's not that this just popped up and there's been, it's not been part of our discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1715.577s">It</a>  has been particularly for parents whose children attend the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1721.881s">And</a>  that certainly isn't to say that everybody agrees, but it's certainly been there.</p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1727.731s">So</a>  if you're saying you don't have, if you're saying that there was plenty, there was ample time and there's still ample time, then why is Kathy Creeds then asking for more time?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1737.013s">So</a>  the time has to do with the timeline that she's suggesting is part of the discussion that we'll have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1746.54s">We're</a>  sort of talking two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1749.162s">I</a>  too, after I worked out my resolution, believes that it would be great to have more time, which is to say a number of weeks more to come to the conclusion of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1762.242s">I've</a>  built in and will talk to my committee about saying that I think that once we put the advisory council together and they begin their work, that they are the ones who will need to be able to say to us, hey, we need eight more weeks, or we need 12 more weeks, or we think this has to be the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1781.687s">But</a>  that's a discussion that as we work out the particulars of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1785.688s">The</a>  other thing is the reality of it is, and we just have to say this, and it's just blunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1791.809s">When</a>  people are saying they haven't been heard, we have heard them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1796.67s">But</a>  unfortunately, we don't necessarily agree with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1800.752s">We</a>  are not agreeing to change, to not change the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1806.214s">So</a>  people keep on saying, you haven't heard us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1809.615s">Well,</a>  we are hearing you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1811.316s">And</a>  quite honestly, I mean, I had some great discussions and I was really moved at one point by one person who told me what Columbus Day meant in his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1822.14s">And</a>  I listened and I heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1824.482s">I've</a>  heard other people say we're erasing history. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1827.164s">We're</a>  still going to teach our kids about Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1830.126s">It</a>  is part of our education strands. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1835.751s">It's</a>  not like we're just saying, and Columbus had, hey, there were some things that were good about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1841.095s">What</a>  we're saying is, is he, is this name the one we want to represent this educational facility in our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1852.085s">You</a>  have voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1855.54s">the</a>  committee, six members plus the mayor, this community voted for us to do what we think is best. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1862.243s">This</a>  is not an easy job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1864.524s">It</a>  is painful, it is tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1866.905s">One</a>  of my committee members said to me, you know, Paulette, the problem with you is you wanna make everybody happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1871.648s">And</a>  that's absolutely true. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1873.348s">I</a>  don't wanna piss anybody off. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1875.369s">And</a>  no matter what I do, I'm going to make some people unhappy in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1880.232s">I</a>  am being true to myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1883.473s">I've</a>  worked, spent hours and hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1885.554s">And</a>  by the way, those hours were not conflicting with the other work that I do, talking to administration, saying, hey, can we work on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1891.597s">Hey,</a>  what about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1892.478s">Okay,</a>  I've got lots of hours in my day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1896.02s">But</a>  trying to say, how does this process work? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1900.082s">And</a>  is there a way that the process can help bring this community together? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1905.865s">I</a>  listened on Monday when Mr. McKillop suggested that we start all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1912.31s">And</a>  for a while back, I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1915.471s">I</a>  was wondering about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1917.351s">But</a>  I came, thought deeply and said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1920.331s">At</a>  this point, we have had lots of opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1924.112s">People</a>  in Medford are aware of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1926.733s">I</a>  walked my dog this afternoon with someone I didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1929.953s">She's</a>  not particularly involved at all in the politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1933.054s">I</a>  said, wow, I've got a heavy meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1935.154s">And</a>  she said, oh yeah, it's the Columbus naming issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1938.835s">People</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1940.635s">Anyway.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1941.806s">Well,</a>  and again, you know, I'm not trying to hit below the belt, but you say that, you know, we vote for you and make the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1950.09s">But</a>  I mean, it was also a time, don't forget, where a lot of people in the city did not know Paul is a convicted felon. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1955.973s">Now</a>  they know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1956.634s">Do</a>  we kick him off the board? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1958.034s">He</a>  still has a chance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1958.955s">Okay,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1960.756s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1961.756s">Member</a>  van de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1963.597s">Is</a>  two minutes up? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1965.018s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1965.498s">We</a>  have Marie.</p>

    <p>[Marie Levey-Pabst]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1973.356s">Hi,</a>  can you hear me all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1974.737s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1975.497s">Awesome,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1976.138s">I</a>  can't even find myself on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1978.399s">I'll</a>  be quick, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1980.16s">I'm</a>  a parent of children at the currently named Columbus School and I am so grateful that we hopefully are now talking about, the name change is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1988.566s">Just</a>  to clarify, the name change is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1990.267s">The</a>  question now is how does that process happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1993.149s">So</a>  I hope I'm getting that right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1994.329s">And</a>  I also just wanna say this, I just wanna push for this name change to happen as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2000.734s">It</a>  is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2003.355s">I</a>  have a third grader and a fifth grader and I'd had high hopes that my fifth grader would leave the school knowing that it was no longer going to be the Columbus and have a different name that better represented the Medford that I know and love. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2016.738s">And</a>  so I just want to throw that out that I hope I understand what the pandemic everything's changed with timelines, but I just want to say I hope that we don't put this off too long because as we can see, it's causing fractures and it's causing <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2029.801s">I</a>  just want to say I am so grateful for Paul Rousseau and all of you who have stood up for this, but I just know you've had to work so hard and do so much and put so much out there, and I think it's time for us to finish this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2041.752s">And</a>  I also just want to put in a plug there for having the students involved at that school, and I think that that would be just an amazing community project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2048.738s">So</a>  I appreciate all the research everyone else has done, but I think it'd be really nice to have some student involvement here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2054.102s">And</a>  I just really wanted to come on and say, I'm very excited about the name change and I'm excited to see it move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2058.166s">And</a>  I'd be thrilled if my fourth grader starts at that school next year with a brand new name to celebrate.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2063.55s">Thank</a>  you, Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2068.514s">I'm</a>  going to go down the list, but I'm just, I did see somebody physically raising their hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2072.577s">So</a>  we just, on the bottom of your screen, there's a raise hand button. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2077.181s">If</a>  not, I do see you Carol. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2079.103s">So</a>  I will get to you, but let's just go and order Seth.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2084.636s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2085.316s">My</a>  name is Seth Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2086.357s">My</a>  daughter attends the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2087.658s">She's</a>  10. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2089.459s">Christopher</a>  Columbus would abduct girls her age for his crew to rape. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2094.243s">He</a>  was a slave trader and committed genocide against the indigenous population. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2099.266s">We</a>  are not erasing history and choosing a new name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2103.429s">We</a>  are choosing to better represent who we hold up as heroes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2108.234s">Columbus</a>  brutality was seen as egregious by his contemporaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2112.476s">He</a>  was imprisoned and stripped of his titles. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2116.458s">I</a>  want to make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2118.259s">Those</a>  that honored him at the time decided he was no longer worthy of that honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2126.243s">All</a>  of the school committee members recognized the need for the name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2133.567s">I</a>  don't want Columbus name never to be spoken of again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2139.0s">of</a>  a fuller history, one that hasn't been erased. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2143.264s">The</a>  school was named to raise up our Italian American community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2147.707s">Italian</a>  Americans faced religious discrimination, fear over their politics, belief that they would crowd out others for jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2157.294s">Is</a>  this sounding familiar? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2159.336s">These</a>  are prejudices that we see expressed today towards other marginalized communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2168.257s">Medford</a>  is a, excuse me, Medford is a wonderful melting pot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2175.083s">Let's</a>  find someone who's emblematic of that and lift up those that might be marginalized today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2181.749s">My</a>  daughter and I would be happy to help.</p>

    <p>[Brenna Kristiansen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2192.688s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2194.669s">I</a>  submitted a letter to the previous meeting, and I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2198.571s">Is</a>  there a plan moving forward to also rename the Columbus Park as well?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2205.355s">That's</a>  not on the table now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2206.775s">Tonight's</a>  discussion is about a process for the renaming of the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2211.538s">Mayor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2215.94s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2218.407s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2219.188s">Thank</a>  you for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2220.368s">I</a>  do know from the previous administration, I asked the question about the Columbus School because I thought that it, even before getting your email, that Crystal Campbell would be an excellent name for the park, which was when I read your letter, I thought that was sort of serendipitous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2239.081s">And</a>  my understanding is that it's actually a city-side only issue in that it is not a school or school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2246.644s">related</a>  matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2247.745s">So</a>  I don't believe we have the authority to make that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2251.187s">And</a>  I doubt I doubt Mayor Langeau-Kern has had a chance to look into that necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2256.71s">So,</a>  but I just wanted to confirm that I don't believe that based on the previous city solicitor, it is not within our authority.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2266.255s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2267.195s">Thank</a>  you, Brenna. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2270.797s">Mr.</a>  Carbone.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Carbone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2275.516s">Thank</a>  you very much for allowing me to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2277.558s">I,</a>  as I said, when this issue came up back in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2282.983s">I</a>  support changing the name of the school, because Christopher Columbus does not share my values I don't believe he shares any Italian Americans values living in America today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2294.594s">I</a>  want to say that I find it a little bit disingenuous for this committee to say, well, you know, it just so happened that the same within a few weeks of George Floyd being killed, it just so happens that was the week we decided to change the name of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2310.665s">I</a>  don't find that particularly compelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2312.166s">I</a>  think that's not just a coincidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2314.287s">It</a>  doesn't change my opinion, though, and I hope it wouldn't change anyone else's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2318.05s">Just</a>  as it doesn't change my opinion is I don't care how tough your job is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2321.612s">I</a>  do not care how tough the school committee thinks their job is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2325.294s">And</a>  I don't want to, I don't particularly care to hear it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2328.375s">You</a>  are elected to do this job, please do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2332.126s">I</a>  think we have to put this committee together sooner rather than later, that the people who should be given priority are people like myself, whose children have either gone to the Columbus School or are currently going to the Columbus School, that their voices be heard, that before we decide how lovely the Mystic River is and how we should name the school after the mystic, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2354.705s">that</a>  instead we should get their input, that that's actually important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2358.407s">I</a>  think these discussions should be around one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2361.189s">We've</a>  decided to change the name of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2363.71s">Most</a>  people likely support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2365.991s">Then</a>  we should get people who want to be on this committee so they can actually get about changing the name of this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2372.975s">Let's</a>  do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2374.056s">And</a>  let's stop the pick the bickering and the petty infighting, which I know at times even I can be a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2381.98s">Thank</a>  you very much for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2383.12s">That</a>  was under two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2386.34s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cadee Stefani]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2390.959s">Um,</a>  hi, it's Katie. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2393.26s">Um,</a>  hi, I'm sorry, my mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2396.122s">I'm</a>  at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2396.682s">But</a>  um, I just wanted to say like, while renaming something is like large, as a school is like a really like incredible task to kind of take on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2405.647s">I</a>  feel like it's important to not delay the vote on renaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2410.49s">I</a>  think like people have mentioned it, but schools are the foundation of a community they build, like future citizens, and like, they're really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2418.835s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2420.087s">Like</a>  while we aren't like we're not changing history by renaming, but we're kind of bringing a history that has been like often overlooked into like a new light. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2428.473s">I</a>  think a strong community like Medford, somewhere I'm proud to be from, somewhere I'm proud to have gone to school in, shouldn't celebrate such a horrendous historical figure by giving him like the honor of the names of one of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2442.638s">um,</a>  by doing this, like we, I, like I said, like we're looking at our true history. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2447.821s">And</a>  I think also we just have so many more heroes in our community that we like deserve this type of honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2454.264s">Um,</a>  like I was thinking like Amelia Earhart has a house in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2458.006s">She</a>  moved in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2458.966s">She</a>  lived in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2459.766s">Like</a>  we, I think there are more important historical figures that we can honor in, um, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2465.949s">And</a>  yeah, I just wanted to say that, like, I think it's just important to not delay this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2470.772s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2474.494s">Thank</a>  you, Katie. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2475.734s">I</a>  know Carol had her hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2477.795s">Carol,</a>  are you still on? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2478.816s">I</a>  don't want to miss you, and you would be next if I went in order.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2493.664s">I</a>  just unmuted you, Carol, yes.</p>

    <p>[Carol Delaney]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2496.905s">Oh,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2498.006s">I</a>  don't live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2500.686s">But</a>  I have written a book about Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2502.486s">I</a>  spent years doing research and most people know nothing about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2507.488s">He's</a>  not the people that people are accusing him of being. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2510.629s">He</a>  never had slaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2513.209s">He</a>  was against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2515.01s">Read</a>  my book, Columbus and the Quest for Jerusalem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2518.311s">It</a>  won some awards and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2522.152s">And</a>  he's not the man that everybody is claiming that he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2527.796s">And</a>  I would be very, I mean, I don't live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2529.938s">I'd</a>  be opposed to the name change until, I think you should be educating people about Columbus because he's not the person that everybody seems to be thinking he is, was.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2541.669s">Thank</a>  you, Carol. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2542.85s">Okay,</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2545.413s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2545.613s">Rocha?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2563.851s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2564.011s">Rocha,</a>  I just want to meet with you.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2565.674s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2566.816s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2568.319s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2568.88s">So</a>  I'm here to express my wholehearted support in the establishment of this advisory committee to rename the Columbus Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2577.686s">The</a>  bottom line is that every day that the Columbus name persists is a day where Medford is honoring genocide and white supremacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2586.21s">Many</a>  of those who are opposed to the renaming claim that it's a way to honor Italian heritage, but this is a profoundly ahistorical and whitewashing take that really is equivalent to those who defend the existence of Confederate flags and statues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2602.017s">There</a>  are many figures in Italian history that are deserving of being honored and held up as an example to Medford students because their accomplishments did not amount to one of the most atrocious and barbaric periods of human history. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2616.667s">The</a>  tradition that Medford has to name, to highlight Medford figures is also of great value to the education of our children and should be maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2626.909s">The</a>  bottom line is as last summer's explosion of students coming forward with discriminatory experiences revealed very clearly, Medford has its own racist history and present to reckon with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2638.257s">Renaming</a>  the Columbus School is one of the many steps against white supremacy that Medford must take to begin repairing the harm that has been inflicted in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2647.804s">And</a>  while those opposed to the renaming have expressed that other matters should be prioritized at this time, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2653.479s">The</a>  creation of this committee is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2656.401s">The</a>  school should have never bore that name, and this is centuries worth of harm finally being put to a stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2662.405s">The</a>  change needs to happen as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2665.207s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2824.798s">We're</a>  losing you again.</p>

    <p>[Debra Daly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2836.323s">300</a>  signatures and another 600 signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2841.585s">And</a>  then we don't even know what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2844.806s">And</a>  after the school, is it a bridge? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2846.947s">Is</a>  it a square? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2848.559s">I</a>  just don't know where things are, what's going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2851.842s">So</a>  that's really bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2860.369s">Would</a>  the children back to school and then revisit this a little bit more before definitive decisions are made about the name change and really get a vote in Medford, a good vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2875.356s">see</a>  how many people actually want to change it and invest money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2880.639s">And</a>  that's all I need to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2882.4s">And</a>  thank you and keep up the good work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=2885.482s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3033.732s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3034.072s">I</a>  know we said two minutes per person, but you could speak as we go through the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3046.281s">So</a>  Anne-Marie, David, and Nadine, you'll be the first to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3051.475s">I</a>  think we were gonna take it section by section, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3059.458s">The</a>  first section of the policy is with regards to the application form for membership in the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3075.824s">We</a>  have a date here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3078.496s">that</a>  the application form will be done by this Friday, the 12th at 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3083.919s">I'm</a>  just gonna read what the form will include so we can discuss that in its entirety and then obviously have people comment if they'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3092.504s">I</a>  do have a question on something myself on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3097.347s">On</a>  the form will be the full name, address, contact information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3101.65s">Why</a>  do you wanna be on the advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3104.662s">Suggested</a>  new name for the school, including the following name, brief explanation for why you think the name should be considered relationship of the suggestion to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3115.005s">Are</a>  you a current or former member of the Columbus Elementary School community? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3119.787s">Are</a>  you related to a school committee member? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3122.067s">And</a>  if so, how will you require an interpreter? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3125.568s">Do</a>  you have access to a computer and an internet connection to participate in Zoom meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3130.85s">Demographics</a>  information includes age, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3134.298s">gender,</a>  sexual orientation, household income, educational attainment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3138.781s">What</a>  language do you mainly speak at home? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3143.105s">Racial</a>  ethnic identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3144.506s">And</a>  the superintendent will create a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3150.05s">Okay,</a>  so that is the name chain. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3158.276s">That</a>  is the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3158.897s">Does</a>  anybody have any questions on that form? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3160.878s">Member</a>  Kreatz, member Van der Kloot, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3163.933s">I'm</a>  going to let the school committee ask questions first, then we're going to go to Anne-Marie, Nadine, David, Nicole, and Kristen.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3170.874s">member</a>  Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3171.995s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3173.036s">Um,</a>  yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3173.956s">So</a>  I wanted to amend that date because I know that the superintendent we are meeting tonight and the superintendent does her weekly updates every Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3185.184s">So</a>  and she's meeting this week in particular, um, with Jesse, you know, to gather the information, um, you know, and provide updates to the community on <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3195.891s">you</a>  know, what's going to be, you know, details for reopening schools and getting the children back into school safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3204.278s">So</a>  I feel as though two days from now is a little too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3208.922s">So</a>  I wanted to amend that date to at the earliest if possible, like Monday or the following Friday, so that that's my amendment, either Monday the 15th, I believe, or Friday the 19th.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3226.257s">Thank</a>  you, member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3227.641s">Member</a>  van de Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3230.749s">Just</a>  unmute yourself, member van de Kloot, please.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3233.909s">When</a>  member Rousseau created the form, he had on his form that someone applying for the advisory council committee, sorry, would also be submitting a name on the same form. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3247.2s">I</a>  have severed the forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3249.121s">I</a>  have you apply for the advisory committee or you're putting in a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3254.105s">Anybody</a>  who is a member of the advisory committee <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3257.899s">on</a>  the advisory committee can certainly put in a name, but they're two different forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3262.964s">It'll</a>  just be more easy to organize. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3266.226s">Here's</a>  the list of names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3267.528s">Here's</a>  the list who's applying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3270.29s">The</a>  other difference in our form is I also asked on the one for the advisory committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3278.357s">I</a>  asked when they were available. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3281.459s">So</a>  there's a line that says, you know, can you tell us when you're available? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3285.723s">Because</a>  I think we need to know if people are only available one day a week, that might not be sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3293.169s">If</a>  they're only available between four and six on Tuesdays, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3297.331s">that</a>  may be difficult, and so that's why I asked that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3301.553s">The</a>  other thing is when I wrote mine, I put a statement in it as opposed to a question, and member Rousseau knows about this, a statement saying that if people needed interpretation services or computers, whatever, that that would be supplied. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3321.34s">So</a>  it's a statement rather than asking them if they <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3324.761s">it's</a>  just makes it clear.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3327.363s">Okay,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3328.364s">I</a>  believe E, which is the suggested names for the school should be removed from this form. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3335.769s">We're</a>  gonna make sure Susie's taking good notes on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3343.655s">Okay,</a>  so you wanna add the availability. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3349.098s">What</a>  is the availability onto this form?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3351.838s">Can</a>  I ask the question differently, Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3354.879s">Instead</a>  of adding it on Member Ruseau's, could we just use mine instead? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3360.381s">Because</a>  I've already written it all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3362.422s">And</a>  since Member Ruseau submitted the other one, I'd like to hear if he's, you know, these are my suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3371.725s">It</a>  would just be easier unless there's a lot of controversy about it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3378.808s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3380.643s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor, and thank you, Member Van der Kloot, for your resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3385.747s">It</a>  certainly helps to move us somewhere so that there's actual movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3391.631s">I</a>  completely agree that E should be removed and the form should be severed, so that's, I think there's probably nobody who would disagree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3398.616s">I</a>  do think it's important to have a statement in there that, on the application form, that if somebody gets picked for the advisory committee, they don't get to show up with their names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3407.506s">that</a>  they think that, you know, that was sort of the logic I had was when you're applying, if you have some names you wanna do to suggest, you do it in line as you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3417.151s">I</a>  just worry somebody will apply to the advisory committee thinking when they get picked, that they get to show up to the advisory committee and then start suggesting names, which is not at all what either of these resolutions puts forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3429.297s">And</a>  so I just wanna be careful that we have some language in there to prevent somebody who went through the effort of applying <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3435.987s">got</a>  selected and shows up at the advisory committee and is devastated to find out their names aren't even on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3442.751s">And</a>  it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3443.932s">By</a>  the time the advisory committee is meeting with the list, it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3447.534s">So</a>  I am fine with removing E. As for whether we should work from one or the other, I'm not really sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3456.339s">I</a>  mean, there's a lot of preamble stuff that's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3463.444s">that</a>  I think we also have to kind of discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3469.326s">But</a>  the, sorry, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3471.587s">So</a>  instead of working from either resolution, can we work from the list of questions that either you or I put forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3478.869s">Because</a>  that then is going to, we can, one of those is addressed in that list of what I said were the key questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3488.32s">Um,</a>  so if we if we worked from the key questions, then we would be, then we would have the discussion about each of our different approaches.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3498.423s">May</a>  I just respond? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3499.423s">Member</a>  Ruseau, then Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3501.684s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3502.784s">I</a>  do agree that that makes the most sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3506.005s">I</a>  just want to be careful that we understand that we need to leave this room with the actual language and the approved resolution, not <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3516.246s">you</a>  know, we're gonna have another meeting after Susie reads these minutes and tries to cobble together from our conversation what we think that the resolution should look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3524.829s">So</a>  then we're another two weeks away from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3526.989s">I</a>  mean, the exact text that is the resolution that we'll vote on, I think needs to be actually written down in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3534.952s">And</a>  so I agree we should take them by the questions, but at the end, we're not gonna, I mean, I certainly feel weird about voting for a resolution that's like 35 amendments <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3546.564s">that</a>  nobody has actually seen the text of. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3549.026s">Because</a>  one of the main reasons I wrote this was to prevent confusion, errors, and internal conflicts in the actual instructions that we're giving. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3561.096s">To</a>  tell people to do something, and then in another place, make it so they can't do it, that's not a good look. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3567.441s">So</a>  I agree we should do it in order like you suggested, but I wanna have the exact words before we vote on it.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3579.963s">member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3583.184s">Just</a>  a couple thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3584.845s">I</a>  feel like somebody needs to build this as we are talking so that at the end it can be read in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3591.227s">Um</a>  and I don't know if Susie is able to do that or prepared to do that in a Google Doc. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3598.689s">If</a>  she's not, I'm happy to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3601.21s">Um</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3603.441s">I</a>  am fine with the two applications being severed, but I am not on board with any date delays. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3612.646s">So</a>  I do not, I'm not on board with date delays and I would be happy to lend my assistance to create the Google form if that's what it takes to get the forms out the door by Friday.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3625.993s">I</a>  think the best way to have one of us <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3631.709s">have</a>  a working document to make these changes is to start with one, either member Bandiclute's or member Ruseau's and make the changes right on shared access. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3645.933s">Agree.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3648.694s">And</a>  if I may ask a question, because I know that you put the motion forward, Dr. Edouard-Vincent or the admin team, what is the timeframe? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3660.387s">for</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3660.727s">I</a>  know it's only a few days, so I'm not opposed to a few days extra if you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3666.652s">I</a>  just wanted to hear from you first.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3677.583s">With</a>  creating a new document, we are working on a specific communication for schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3685.965s">I</a>  think Monday would be more reasonable if I continue with the original communication that I'm doing for this Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3693.067s">If</a>  I could have until Monday to send out all communications regarding the advisory council, I should be able to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3704.918s">and</a>  let it be a separate freestanding communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3708.96s">I</a>  could do it by Monday.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3712.381s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3715.262s">So</a>  first member Van der Kloot and member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3718.963s">Jenny,</a>  can you send it to Jenny or I, the word, it in words, so one of us can type this up, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3727.707s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3729.178s">Yeah,</a>  so superintendent I'm fine with Monday, provided that it doesn't change the next date, the next day, it has to stay in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3737.271s">So</a>  I'm not I am I am willing to go along for a change that makes the superintendent's life easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3744.842s">but</a>  I am not willing to slide the date, slide the date, slide the date, slide the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3749.545s">So</a>  I'm just saying that right now, as long as we feel like that's adequate time for people to apply with that shift of the first deadline from Friday to Monday, I am absolutely fine with that, but I am not on board for a slow shift of all of these dates.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3766.383s">No,</a>  that would be my only request. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3768.866s">If</a>  we could let this be a freestanding communication and give us till Monday to send it out and the remaining dates can remain.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3778.559s">Thank</a>  you, Debra Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3780.622s">So,</a>  Mayor, are you <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3783.001s">do</a>  you want me to do this or are you going to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3785.443s">I</a>  just, we probably can't both do it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3788.125s">Would</a>  you mind doing it only so that while you're typing, I can let the residents speak and I'll keep track of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3793.849s">And</a>  you can type whether you share it at the end or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3797.272s">And</a>  which one am I working from? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3802.928s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot, we were going to do yours because you severed the two forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3806.913s">So</a>  let's start there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3808.014s">Let's</a>  start with Member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3810.336s">Kathy</a>  has a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3812.198s">Before</a>  that motion is called to change the date, we're going to let the residents speak on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3817.484s">So</a>  Anne-Marie.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3822.543s">hold</a>  on um i am here except to get myself okay so i do have a couple of things that i want to address and that is with all due respect i know it was brought up that this was a um topic that came up 20 years ago and even though it might be a topic that other people might know is a new topic it's been 20 years for a lot of people that are involved now that's one <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3847.561s">And</a>  as far as, we're gonna be debating this forever, but as far as people thinking that when people were saying that they weren't heard, I believe, just to clarify, is the night of the meeting in June, when there were people that unfortunately were cut off because they weren't able to say what they wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3867.934s">And</a>  from what I understand, the motion went basically more in regards to 50 emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3876.7s">And</a>  it wasn't open to everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3879.183s">I</a>  just want to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3880.825s">The</a>  other thing is, is that we're sitting here and you guys are talking about a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3886.67s">So</a>  if I'm understanding this correctly, you're going to have this out by Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3891.255s">And</a>  how long do the people have to fill out and complete them and return them?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3898.517s">We're</a>  working on that tonight so that there's proposals, we don't have that set in stone.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3903.259s">Okay,</a>  because at this point here you have a member who's saying that they don't want to delay any other days or dates, and it's really not fair to ever applies to this, that if it's postponed at the beginning, that it shouldn't be postponed in the other dates because it's a domino effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3921.761s">The</a>  other thing is, is that once the applications are in, since people don't think it's going to be cut time consuming, and again, time is of the essence unless people don't want their kids in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3933.7s">The</a>  fact remains is who's going to be interviewing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3938.31s">the</a>  people that apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3940.052s">Who</a>  is selecting the applications? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3943.255s">Has</a>  the diversity director seen the application before it goes out? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3946.657s">Has</a>  the city solicitor seen the application before it goes out to make sure that it's live on?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3951.582s">15</a>  seconds.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3952.843s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3953.703s">And</a>  I have had a lot of questions of <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3957.126s">not</a>  to be disrespectful to anyone, but why is it so important to put down our sex orientation to find out if you want to be on a committee or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3966.634s">Because</a>  I don't think when you go and apply for a job, you're able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3972.058s">Because</a>  that is, it's okay.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3976.582s">Okay,</a>  good, good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3979.465s">And</a>  I think we're here to hash a lot of those out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3981.967s">But</a>  thank you for the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3984.409s">Nadine.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_59]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3988.463s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Nadeen Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3998.328s">It's</a>  not so much a question, just part of what I really didn't get to finish saying before. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4001.769s">So</a>  I'm reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4003.09s">That's</a>  why I'm not even on video because it's just easier to do it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4006.691s">Bear</a>  with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4007.792s">It</a>  was mentioned that the school committee has full authority to change the name, which I guess I fully don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4012.954s">But</a>  it's not just about, say, at least six of you, OK, or about the seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4017.216s">It's</a>  about a whole city, which I know you keep hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4020.342s">I</a>  know this is set in stone that it's changed, but the problem is the name Columbus Elementary for the last 90 years represents the people of Medford of all races. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4030.747s">And</a>  by pushing to change it, you're taking that away from everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4036.05s">If</a>  I'm gonna make this more personal aside from being a former Columbus parent, I'm half Puerto Rican, half Sicilian. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4041.132s">Puerto</a>  Rican bloodlines and culture evolved through a mix of Spanish, African, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4045.274s">and</a>  indigenous Taino, I think that's how you pronounce it, and Caribbean Indian races. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4050.419s">And</a>  as a result of my mixed heritage, Columbus still has no negative effect on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4054.522s">It</a>  was 500 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4056.284s">I</a>  think if this was chosen 90 years ago, there was all different races back then, and it would have been an issue <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4066.291s">you</a>  know, probably back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4067.771s">We</a>  live in the cancel culture right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4069.832s">And</a>  I think this is just a product of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4071.392s">And</a>  I think it's being rushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4074.132s">I</a>  think that there's more important things to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4076.613s">You</a>  know, we have children that have been out of school for one year, especially vocational students suffering because they're not in there enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4085.514s">This</a>  is just not a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4087.355s">And</a>  I hope you really think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4089.615s">Thank</a>  you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4093.436s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4094.807s">David</a>  McKillop.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4099.548s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4100.388s">So</a>  to finish my point, this letter that I was reading was basically talking about exactly what people brought up, which was racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4110.25s">Back</a>  in 1891, the systematic racism against Italians was horrific, just as it was everywhere else in every other situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4119.833s">But</a>  President Harrison created the Columbus Day holiday to end that, to bring people into the fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4127.88s">And</a>  I think that to sit there and talk about racism and white supremacy, I don't think President Harrison was a white supremacist when he was thinking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4137.468s">In</a>  fact, the Italian consulate in Italy itself <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4141.187s">Sent</a>  over a statue of christopher columbus to forge a union between the two countries And this is why it is so important to the italian culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4150.99s">It's</a>  not just Christopher columbus and is in the history of the man. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4155.952s">It</a>  is a symbol of a way to in to include the italian american community and that's when it was created in 1892 And it was created and after 13 <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4170.679s">I</a>  don't know, generations of people celebrating Christopher Columbus and it morphed into a symbol more so than the name and the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4182.688s">It's</a>  a symbol of inclusiveness and to take that away without anybody being able to vocalize it is taking away that symbol. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4190.474s">So</a>  again, I say to you, like I said to you on Monday, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4193.556s">people's</a>  perceptions are their reality, and you are taking away that reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4198.5s">Please,</a>  I implore you, please do not drive the stake further. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4203.024s">The</a>  jury is out on the history of Christopher Columbus, as Carol pointed out, and I think there has to be more conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4211.19s">I</a>  just want to leave you there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4214.553s">I</a>  implore that you think about it, and I applaud Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4218.295s">Van</a>  der Kloot for even thinking about it after Monday's conversation.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4223.373s">Thank</a>  you, David. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4225.456s">Nicole.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_59]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4235.127s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4235.588s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4241.365s">Hello,</a>  how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4242.986s">Thank</a>  you for letting me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4244.608s">I</a>  just wanted to ask one thing, and this is the major thing that is going around Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4249.992s">Does</a>  anyone care about the division that this is causing Medford right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4256.678s">That's</a>  what I really want you council members to actually think about is what this is doing to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4262.483s">This</a>  isn't just actually a Medford thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4264.504s">This</a>  goes way above Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4266.326s">This</a>  is now a state thing where other people are speaking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4270.393s">Have</a>  you thought about that at all?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4274.836s">Personally,</a>  very much so, yes.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4277.257s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4278.098s">So</a>  I'm not, none of you really know me, but I come from, I'm an Italian American. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4282.881s">My</a>  parents and my great grandparents are all, you know, I'm the first to come over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4288.484s">And</a>  the thing that Columbus is so important to us, it's not the person, as David said, it's what it is to Italian Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4297.009s">South</a>  Medford is a very Italian-American community, just like a lot of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4302.031s">You</a>  are basically taking that away and stomping on all our traditions, everything that we care about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4307.914s">A</a>  lot of people that are against this, as you say, they're not really from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4312.896s">They</a>  might now live in Medford, but they don't know the culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4316.157s">No</a>  one on the committee is actually Italian-American. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4319.518s">So</a>  you don't know how we actually feel about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4322.96s">I</a>  have a son. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4324.22s">He's</a>  in the second grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4326.161s">He</a>  came home to me, he doesn't know anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4328.543s">And</a>  he said that Italians are bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4331.266s">And</a>  I said, what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4333.508s">Columbus</a>  is bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4334.649s">He's</a>  a bad person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4336.29s">Nobody,</a>  you don't know what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4338.272s">So</a>  this is my, my nine year old child is coming home saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4342.435s">And</a>  he said that someone told him this in recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4345.338s">So</a>  you have to think about not only what you're doing to the Italian community, but what you're doing to our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4350.222s">Nicole,</a>  you have 15 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4353.607s">So</a>  that's what I just want you to think about is that what this means to time community and what we feel about is not about the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4362.072s">I</a>  don't think Columbus is bad, but it's about what the meeting is, why Columbus was even brought up as David has discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4369.796s">It</a>  has nothing to do about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4371.597s">It's</a>  made you Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4374.599s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4375.139s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4376.16s">Thank</a>  you, Nicole.</p>

    <p>[Deanne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4381.463s">Kristen.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4389.281s">Hi,</a>  am I unmuted? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4391.183s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4392.724s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4394.325s">I</a>  just felt like I needed to make a very specific point that even though some of my fellow Italian Americans here keep acting as if the Italian American community is united on this matter, I just want to say on the record that this is not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4410.678s">I</a>  am 100% Italian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4413.837s">And</a>  I have been arguing against honoring Columbus since the 90s when I refused to apply for a Knights of Columbus scholarship, which made my grandpa not speak to me for a week since he was the grand knight of his chapter at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4426.15s">And</a>  also, despite what some people want us to think, the horror at Columbus's acts is not a modern day phenomenon. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4434.759s">There</a>  are writings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4436.738s">contemporary</a>  writings at the time in the 1500s by people like Bartolomé de las Casas, who was a colonizer, was so horrified by the treatment of the natives that he renounced his land grant, freed his slaves, became a priest, and went back to Hispaniola to try to help the natives. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4453.807s">He</a>  was not a perfect man himself because it was the 1500s, but he did not believe that people deserve to be tortured and enslaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4460.67s">He</a>  wrote contemporary accounts of the torture that the natives <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4464.881s">under</a>  the Spanish and the colonizers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4466.643s">And</a>  these acts are so diabolically and disgustingly violent that I couldn't even feel comfortable discussing them in front of children. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4475.67s">So</a>  why should they go to a school that honors the person who spearheaded them? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4480.615s">And</a>  if, frankly, as a culture, if we insist on sticking with Columbus to name the school, a man who didn't even set foot in the United States, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4489.548s">just</a>  says to me that members of our community can't think of any other Italians or Italian-Americans who have done great things for our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4495.693s">And</a>  to me, that's just sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4497.494s">I</a>  think we can do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4498.575s">We</a>  can honor Italians at the same time if we want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4502.878s">I</a>  can think of plenty of people off the top of my head who would deserve to be honored as Italian-Americans without having to, you know, name a school after a man who did terrible things that I wouldn't even talk about in front of a kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4518.67s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4521.36s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4523.681s">Jean.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4529.204s">Jean,</a>  you're unmuted.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4533.826s">Can</a>  you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4535.027s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4535.867s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4537.148s">I'll</a>  be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4538.148s">So</a>  I think these conversations and the things that people are talking about illustrate very well what I alluded to earlier, and the fact that the change management process is not a process that needs to be jammed through for expediency. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4551.442s">for</a>  political optics in an election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4554.784s">And</a>  I think that's why looking at these conversations, that's why this needs to be a more longer term conversation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4562.75s">I</a>  think people are still overlooking that for a lot of Italian Americans, it's not about Columbus and what he did in his life. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4572.496s">It</a>  is about what he became to Italian Americans who used that opportunity under Harris to lift themselves up <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4581.829s">and</a>  stop being lynched and beaten and prosecuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4585.23s">Although</a>  I will say as someone of Italian descent, Italians are still treated badly in certain circles and people still lock down on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4594.473s">And</a>  there is stereotypical issues that occur specifically in Hollywood and the way Italians are projected and portrayed on television. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4604.715s">So</a>  this idea that Italian Americans don't suffer anything isn't true. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4610.643s">but</a>  it's not in the same regard as what's going on in other areas of our culture right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4615.864s">And</a>  so there's a great opportunity here as we move forward to create healing, but that's done over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4623.206s">It's</a>  not done by a three week effort to put together a random committee and decide on a name out of people submit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4631.889s">It's</a>  more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4633.029s">And</a>  I agree with the previous speaker, but there are many Italian icons that could be selected instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4639.96s">But</a>  again, that's something that Italian Americans should be picking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4644.303s">We</a>  shouldn't be told again, like we were told originally. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4647.186s">And</a>  you have 15 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4648.947s">So</a>  again, I would urge you with someone who is a certified project management, change management consultant, and have been doing this type of work for 25 years, that it needs to be measured or it's going to create a deeper rift. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4663.418s">It</a>  won't be something that will be forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4666.861s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Carbone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4676.097s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4677.098s">Christopher</a>  Carbone, my daughter Sarah actually attends the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4681.358s">With</a>  regards to the application, which is what this segment of the meeting was supposed to be about, I think the application should have a section in there, not just for their address, a party, a person living in Medford at a certain address could still send their children to another school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4697.501s">I</a>  think there should be a section in there that says, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4701.54s">have</a>  you or any of your children attended the Columbus School? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4704.984s">How</a>  many? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4706.065s">When</a>  they something along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4707.948s">And</a>  the reason for that is because I think the people who are most proximate to the school who send their children there or have sent their children there should have a larger voice in this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4719.762s">I</a>  think that that I mentioned my first set of comments and I think it's true now because we're going to be the people going to be most affected by the school's name case because we are most proximate to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4728.731s">And</a>  how else do I know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4730.053s">Well,</a>  I know that because when Mr. Rousseau first brought up this issue back in June, the first thing he said was, I sent my kids to Columbus or something to the effect of I couldn't believe they still had the name Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4743.366s">That's</a>  saying something important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4745.707s">I</a>  think the people who send their children to that school should have a greater voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4750.688s">Now,</a>  how will that greater voice be? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4752.408s">I</a>  don't think there should be a certain number of people on the committee who attended it, but I think it should be something on the effect of a tiebreaker or something along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4760.97s">So</a>  I believe that the application should be amended <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4764.691s">to</a>  include people who, so that you say, how many, do you live in, do you send your children to Columbus? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4771.876s">And</a>  if so, when? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4773.217s">So</a>  that can be part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4774.798s">I</a>  think that if we're going to ask people, and I strongly oppose asking people their sexual orientation, I think that is, there's no reason for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4782.342s">But</a>  if you were to ask that, I don't want a straight person <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4786.705s">I</a>  don't know why a straight person who lives in West Medford should have a greater voice than a gay couple who send their kids to the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4795.852s">I</a>  think those people should get priority, and I think that's remarkable.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4801.716s">Mr.</a>  Carboni, we do have the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4804.519s">Are</a>  you a current or former member of the Columbus Elementary School community? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4808.161s">If</a>  so, how so we can <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4811.067s">potentially</a>  make that a question mark if we should ask for the date of when they attended or worked there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4818.291s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4820.632s">Martha?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4827.196s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, you might be muting them and unmuting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4831.121s">I</a>  think we're both playing around. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4832.623s">There</a>  we go, Martha.</p>

    <p>[Martha Ondras]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4833.364s">I</a>  am now unmuted, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4835.987s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4837.109s">I</a>  am in favor of changing the name of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4840.994s">Columbus</a>  doesn't represent <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4844.659s">Medford</a>  particularly appropriately, and I don't think he represents the Italian American community for that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4853.941s">I</a>  would like to endorse the application process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4859.062s">I</a>  think you can separate the, I know I, in my work as a, in a foundation, I often have applications submitted where the, the demographic information, the race and, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4874.255s">sexual</a>  orientation are put in a separate document. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4877.316s">So</a>  those do not become part of the application decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4881.918s">They</a>  are simply tracked for reasons that the city wants to know the makeup of its participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4890.821s">And</a>  I think that's, excuse my dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4892.961s">She's</a>  pretty restless right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4896.663s">But</a>  I think the, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4899.548s">process</a>  should be a good one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4901.368s">I</a>  don't think it needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4902.509s">I</a>  think delaying it or claiming that there are other things that are more important are essentially diversion tactics. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4910.291s">And</a>  I think we need to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4912.811s">It's</a>  been a long time coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4914.111s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4916.052s">Thank</a>  you, Martha. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4918.012s">Philippe?</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4922.874s">I</a>  will unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4923.494s">Or</a>  try.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4927.355s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4927.675s">Can</a>  you hear me now?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4928.695s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4929.716s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4930.556s">So</a>  good evening everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4931.897s">So</a>  I've heard for the past hour and a half people arguing on both sides, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4935.759s">And</a>  everyone's kind of making their own case. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4938.18s">And</a>  so for me, I don't have a horse in the game as Mr. Carbone had mentioned, but my son will be going to Columbus in a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4945.263s">So</a>  we have been kind of looking at the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4947.644s">And</a>  one of the things that I was more concerned about is just kind of looking at this objectively is I was a little bit surprised to hear that we still don't have an estimate as to how much this costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4957.649s">So</a>  for example, like if I'm doing work on my house, I'll get you know estimates to figure out how much it is to figure out if I can get into the budget right before I go ahead and do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4965.813s">But</a>  given that I've kind of heard that we've been like $3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4970.109s">below</a>  the budget for 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4972.15s">And</a>  again, you guys will have a better idea, just I've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4975.031s">But</a>  for 2021, we'll have to come up with a new budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4977.632s">So</a>  I'm kind of just wondering, like, you know, where does this money come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4981.393s">Does</a>  it have to come from other programs, other materials that we can't give to our students? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4986.195s">If</a>  it's not that much money, okay, well, you know, whatever the decision is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4989.276s">But</a>  if it's something that's like, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars, and obviously that becomes cost prohibitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4993.758s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=4994.478s">i'm</a>  just trying to understand like how that how those decisions made right because at the end of the day we're trying to get the best education for our kids and now it's the best environment as well so all these things need to come into consideration so just trying to get a better idea of how that how that stuff works and that's it for me thanks thank you remember russo then we'll go to kelly</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5017.534s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5018.634s">I</a>  just wanted to comment on the demographics question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5022.856s">As</a>  with the superintendent search, and it's true that it's not actually set in the, it's not in the resolution, and that's a failure of my own because I, having done the superintendent search survey, that is exactly what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5037.542s">There</a>  was, you'd finish the whole survey, and at the end, there was a button that says, you know, there would be a demographics survey you could fill out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5045.585s">It</a>  was completely unrelated to your, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5047.958s">actual</a>  application and we could not correlate or collate those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5053.782s">So,</a>  and the reason was described by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5058.645s">Andres</a>  about, you know, getting a sense for, so who in the community are we reaching most importantly, so we can figure out who we're not reaching is the purpose of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5068.391s">It's</a>  certainly not to decide that we want to have a gay person on the committee and, you know, that's not the purpose of that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5077.54s">But</a>  it does read that way, so I totally own that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5081.363s">I</a>  would say about the cost, I don't have a clue what the cost is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5085.607s">I</a>  think there are probably many options around cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5089.029s">And</a>  like the Columbus apparently right now, they need new envelopes for their letters, a new letterhead, like they need to order them because they are out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5098.097s">So</a>  there's no additional cost to order them with a new name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5102.741s">If</a>  they were throwing away 10 years worth of envelopes, then of course, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5107.536s">That's</a>  totally a different conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5111.239s">And</a>  then I also wanted, Mayor, there's also a member of the public who has been trying to get attention, and now I don't see her. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5123.107s">And</a>  I don't remember her name, because she's been there waving her hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5128.35s">And</a>  it was David, I believe, was the first name, although there was a woman in the video. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5134.754s">And</a>  I just wanted to make sure we could get <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5139.586s">I'm</a>  afraid I don't remember the name, but if they could come back on and I see them, I'll raise that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5144.53s">But</a>  they've been waving for quite a long time and I think they're just getting this.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5148.772s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5149.453s">Just</a>  let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5150.033s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bri Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5248.311s">Hi,</a>  can everyone hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5250.233s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5251.494s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5253.916s">I</a>  haven't lived in Medford for very long, and I just want to say I really appreciate all the work and all the discussion that everyone has put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5264.324s">I</a>  wanted to offer a perspective to maybe consider how this looks to our children, specifically the children who attend the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5275.513s">In</a>  that I think kids today are growing up in a time of immense racial racial tension Information is more readily available to them than it was even to me when I was in school and These kids are smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5292.159s">They</a>  ask about this stuff and I think it's important that we show our kids that when we know better we do better and <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5300.307s">I</a>  don't, I don't think it's any of this is meant to detract from what Columbus means to Italian Americans, but it's, you know, when we learn things, I think it's important that our children see that we adapt to new incoming data and that we learn from history. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5315.89s">People</a>  keep saying, I don't want to erase history. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5318.071s">This</a>  name change is erasing history, but why would we also continue to ignore it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5323.272s">And,</a>  um, you know, I just, I think it's just, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5330.071s">In</a>  terms of, and then my second point was around the monetary concerns that folks have been bringing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5335.153s">And</a>  to that point, I wanted to say, truth be told, there is never a right time to bring about true systemic change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5342.355s">There's</a>  never a right time to confront inconvenient truths and do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5349.317s">The</a>  right thing is usually the most painful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5352.858s">And</a>  if there was a fundraising effort, you know, to make this change happen, I would contribute to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5359.844s">And</a>  I'll come out and say, my kid, when she's school age, is not going to go to the Columbus school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5364.587s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5365.127s">You</a>  have 15 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5366.948s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5367.769s">But</a>  I don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5369.19s">Medford</a>  is my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5370.571s">I</a>  would gladly contribute to see us know better and do better for our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5376.674s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5386.38s">OK,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5386.94s">Caught</a>  me off guard there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5388.696s">Thank</a>  you very much for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5390.298s">I</a>  just wanted to say that I think this whole process would have gone a lot better if it had been handled better back in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5398.367s">To</a>  me, this is not a school issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5402.471s">It</a>  is a community issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5404.854s">There's</a>  a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5406.793s">and</a>  you're renaming a city building in a neighborhood that affects an awful lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5415.136s">The</a>  entire community should have been notified far ahead of that June meeting, not 48 hours early to meet the letter of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5423.659s">What</a>  about all the people who are not regularly on social media or perhaps not at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5429.001s">Notification</a>  had been done primarily on the Medford Public Schools site. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5433.769s">What</a>  about people without kids in the system? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5436.492s">They</a>  don't check the MPS site because they have no need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5440.155s">I</a>  realize how hard it is to reach people these days, but a far better effort needed to be made for a community issue of this magnitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5447.902s">It</a>  should have been in the transcript and notification made in other ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5453.288s">I</a>  take exception to it being said that the community was heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5456.651s">We</a>  have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5457.832s">You</a>  gave 48 hours notice over a weekend and made a decision for which you will not reverse, and that's why the community is irate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5466.678s">And</a>  at least one of the school committee members states he would make this change even if everyone said not to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5472.762s">That</a>  is arrogant, and that person is not listening to all constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5477.725s">and</a>  notification of this particular meeting was no better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5480.946s">The</a>  patch posted notification of tonight's meeting exactly 37 minutes before the meeting began at 5.07 this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5491.468s">How</a>  is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5493.669s">If</a>  we had a couple of June 15th meeting, we'd be in a better place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5498.23s">A</a>  wedge has been driven in this community that is probably irreversible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5503.011s">And</a>  as others have stated, you have far more pressing issues going on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5507.213s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5560.025s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5560.705s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5563.283s">I</a>  just want to say, it's so sad that so many people are looking at this as an attack on Italian Americans, who certainly have just, you know, suffered discrimination and oppression. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5577.812s">And</a>  even to this day, probably experienced some of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5582.095s">It's</a>  not about hurting Italian Americans, you know, it's about moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5589.185s">And</a>  I just want to laud all the people that spoke in favor of the name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5596.069s">And</a>  I wanted to add a historical fact to what others have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5602.092s">Even</a>  if we don't look at Columbus and say, oh, he did this and he did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5609.065s">If</a>  we just look at the funding for the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria, where did the money come from that funded those three ships that set out on those voyages? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5624.457s">It</a>  came from the confiscated estates of Jews and Muslims in Spain who were <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5636.184s">hunted</a>  by the Inquisition who either had to convert to Christianity or leave the country or be burned at the stake. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5649.269s">So</a>  we can see even the voyage of <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5653.683s">Columbus</a>  was tainted from the start with the spoils of oppression. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5659.688s">And</a>  we see how all oppression is linked to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5663.911s">And</a>  there is white supremacy and Italians have been subjected to that white supremacy, just like black people, people of color, Jews, Muslims. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5675.541s">And</a>  I just want to say to the Italian community or some of the Italian community that doesn't understand or wanna</p>

    <p>[Tony Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5730.486s">So</a>  I just wanted to say, um, I was going to read something tonight, but just listening to the meeting and picking up all the different conversations just turned into my list has turned into a bunch of points. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5740.41s">And,</a>  um, sorry if it sounds that way, but I just want to start by saying I can solve this problem right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5746.215s">This</a>  is what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5747.436s">Let's</a>  start by renaming every school in the district, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5751.079s">School</a>  A, school B, school C, school D. Let's just have a stale district. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5755.822s">No</a>  culture, no nothing for anyone, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5758.244s">That</a>  way they will just solve all the problems for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5760.306s">We'll</a>  wipe this right off the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5761.547s">We</a>  can be the most boring city in the universe, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5764.269s">And</a>  we'll move along to the city streets and we'll move on to the buildings and all the corners that we name after all the people who have done so much for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5771.774s">Let's</a>  just go ahead and <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5773.075s">cancel</a>  it all right out, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5774.576s">And</a>  that way we can all live equally and no one will have any problems with anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5779.259s">The</a>  next thing I wanted to say is the woman, I'm sorry, I don't know her name, who spoke for the Medford Mercury, it is up to the Medford Mercury and Patch the Patch to post those things, but it's also the responsibility of the city to make sure that those things reach those papers in time so people have the appropriate notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5798.452s">37</a>  minutes is not acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5802.119s">Does</a>  anyone considered it's more than just taking some chisels to a concrete building and changing a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5807.702s">You</a>  have to think about all the paperwork that goes into it, changing the all the letterheads and the websites and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5815.805s">There's</a>  a lot more to this than just putting a sign up, you know, and tying it to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5820.627s">This</a>  is pretty elaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5822.388s">This</a>  is really something that needs to have more thought go into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5827.386s">Paula,</a>  I'm sorry, Mia, thank you so much for finding that book. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5830.568s">Some</a>  of us already have that book. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5832.009s">We</a>  know that book. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5833.49s">And</a>  what that book really states is the city has already spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5837.272s">They've</a>  already voted on it.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5838.953s">They</a>  chose that name, okay?</p>

    <p>[Tony Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5841.314s">They</a>  wanted that name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5842.395s">That's</a>  why it was selected 90 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5846.598s">Just</a>  please consider all these things and consider how many people that this is affecting because it really does affect people and people are irate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5855.483s">Thank</a>  you for letting me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5859.602s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

Okay, I don't see that he's on actually anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5883.573s">So,</a>  Amy and Mariana.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5891.994s">Hi,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5893.315s">I</a>  just wanted to respond to a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5897.358s">One</a>  thing is, you know, going back to what council committee member said, this name change way back when was the result of the community coming together and wanting a name that had some more social justice and progressive consideration in it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5914.589s">And</a>  that's all people today are asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5917.723s">I'm</a>  sure at the time people were, there were plenty of people opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5921.245s">Plenty</a>  of people who had anti-Italian sentiments were opposed to the name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5924.666s">They</a>  were wrong then, just the way I would say that people who are opposed to more inclusion and social justice today are wrong today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5934.23s">Segregation</a>  wasn't popular in its time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5936.151s">It</a>  divided communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5937.752s">People</a>  who wanted their schools to stay white felt they weren't heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5941.833s">And</a>  we look back now and they were totally wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5947.006s">I</a>  can think of a number of cultural figures from my cultural background that I wouldn't want to name a school after. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5953.69s">I</a>  have Romanian relatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5955.451s">I</a>  don't want to send my kids to Kočescu High School or Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5959.773s">Not</a>  everyone from your culture is worth elevating. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5962.995s">And</a>  if we're going to elevate heroes, I want to pick them carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5967.023s">And</a>  my last point to this guy who said, let's name all the schools by numbers and have no culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5972.187s">New</a>  York City has PS1 through, I don't know, 200. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5976.15s">And</a>  I would highly challenge anyone to say that New York City doesn't have any culture because of how they named their schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=5984.616s">Anyway,</a>  that's it.</p>

    <p>[Dan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6002.523s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6003.083s">I</a>  just want to say, Mayor, this is not directed at you or member Kreatz, but to the other members of the school committee, it's pretty obvious by the signs of the petitions where the citizens of the city stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6017.096s">This</a>  is an election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6019.038s">And</a>  let me make it clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6020.459s">You</a>  have awoken a sleeping giant in this city and be prepared <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6025.56s">to</a>  suffer the consequences at the next election. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6028.061s">We</a>  will vote yous out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6030.102s">Everyone</a>  yous. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6031.123s">So</a>  be prepared for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6032.363s">That's</a>  all I have to say.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6043.869s">Melissa?</a> </p>

    <p>[Melissa Dubuc]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6048.031s">Hi,</a>  how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6051.4s">I</a>  joined the meeting late, so I apologize if things have been brought up that I didn't hear.</p>

    <p>[Melissa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6063.427s">I</a>  know that this has been passionate on both sides whether we are for the change of the school or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6071.338s">My</a>  suggestion would be, because this is really taking a toll on the city, people are writing nasty comments back and forth to each other on Facebook and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6083.508s">I</a>  think it's doing a disservice to our community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6089.473s">Why</a>  can't the school committee take a step back and allow the community themselves to vote on it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6096.018s">Because</a>  I think if the community gets to vote, whichever way it goes, at least everybody will feel like they have input and they've actually been heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6105.566s">And</a>  I think it will be a little bit easier to digest <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6110.501s">if</a>  it was done properly by a vote for the people in the community, they have the opportunity to vote whether they're for or not for the change of the school in the city that they live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6123.187s">And</a>  then at that point, if it is voted at the name of the school get changed, then we can move on and maybe think of a different name. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6134.133s">But</a>  I think this is sort of being done <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6136.974s">in</a>  a not so great way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6138.555s">I</a>  think this is an opportunity to show the city that we care about what everybody has to say and not push it one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6148.342s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6152.925s">Thank</a>  you, Melissa. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6159.209s">Member</a>  Graham, I'm not sure if you want to screen share so we can ask <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6168.775s">over</a>  the amendments and changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6171.436s">I</a>  think we're changing the date of the 12th to the 15th for when the application form for membership in the advisory committee will be prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6187.643s">We're</a>  moving the suggestion, E on Paul's at least, the suggestion new name for the school, including the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6198.257s">while</a>  we move to the naming form proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6205.601s">We're</a>  gonna add the availability of those applying to be on the advisory committee to the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6214.046s">Yeah,</a>  that's already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6218.629s">Okay,</a>  and then we have questions about the demographics, including, and I know it's been discussed, so we're gonna take out <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6227.932s">Number</a>  three, sexual orientation.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6232.034s">So</a>  can I just step back and tell you what we have accomplished so far before we go forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6240.377s">I</a>  think you should screen share it so we could all just take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6242.658s">I'm</a>  happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6243.438s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6244.458s">I</a>  just want to point out this is a five-page resolution and we have addressed one paragraph of the five-page resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6251.741s">So</a>  cover page one, at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6257.679s">Nope,</a>  not even. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6258.74s">We're</a>  sort of in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6263.764s">So</a>  this started from Paulette's and I will cobble them together as we talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6269.449s">But</a>  what we have covered is the application committee, the advisory committee application. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6274.833s">I</a>  added a bullet here that says the superintendent will create a form no later than Monday, March 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6281.559s">The</a>  form will be translated in a manner consistent with all district communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6286.223s">The</a>  availability is listed already. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6289.164s">I</a>  made this update to clarify when we ask, which was already on the form, if you're a member of the Columbus School community, if so, how and when, student, family, staff, and in what year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6306.732s">The</a>  demographics information, I added a clause that said will be collected but separated from the main body of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6314.157s">I</a>  am not in favor of removing sexual orientation because again, the goal of collecting these demographics is to understand who we are reaching and who we are not reaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6323.784s">And</a>  that is a common best practice question that is put in surveys all the time now because <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6333.05s">we</a>  want to know that we are reaching all members of our community and they are an important portion of the community.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6342.653s">Okay,</a>  thank you, Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6344.574s">So</a>  we'll just, if anybody has questions on this or any additional changes, we could comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6348.855s">I</a>  see Member Ruseau's hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6350.816s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6352.076s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6352.997s">I</a>  just wanted to comment on the demographics. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6355.818s">I</a>  know that it is <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6358.191s">sometimes</a>  a problem for some people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6360.572s">These</a>  lists of not only the options, but the actual categories within each of the options, but I may have these backwards, sorry, are from the federal government's list. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6377.102s">This</a>  work to get this stuff together and what we are tracking as a district for participation in our surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6384.195s">was</a>  something we did for the superintendent search. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6386.077s">So</a>  this isn't like I just made it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6389.74s">This</a>  is from the federal government and the best practice that I believe member Graham mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6394.964s">So</a>  I too would be opposed to removing any of these.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6402.57s">They</a>  are all optional though. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6405.112s">You're</a>  not obligated to answer any of the demographic questions.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6407.794s">They're</a>  all optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6409.035s">Okay,</a>  so if there's any other amendments, any members, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6414.005s">would</a>  like to make to this section, please let us know now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6418.768s">Otherwise</a>  we can do an all-inclusive motion to amend this section so that it will, or we can do it at the end as well and move on, but.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6429.054s">Can</a>  we just go back up a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6430.755s">I</a>  can't see some of the screen.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6433.617s">We</a>  can, maybe Memogram could increase the.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6438.36s">Yes,</a>  if you could maybe just try to increase it up to 125 maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6443.49s">Perfect,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6448.202s">I'm</a>  just taking a few more moments to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6450.327s">Sorry,</a>  I'll be right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6452.031s">Take</a>  your time, Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6521.125s">I</a>  do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6524.907s">Mayor,</a>  I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6526.688s">Yes,</a>  Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6527.928s">Yes,</a>  I know I'm looking at Paulette's, you know, her, her resolution, and she does have the application form and suggestion will be posted and communicated out to usual mechanisms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6542.805s">including</a>  translations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6544.106s">Okay,</a>  that's number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6544.867s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm just reading the wrong paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6546.828s">The</a>  application will clearly state that interpretation services will be available to any community member who so requests and technology, laptop, camera, microphone will also be provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6559.758s">I'm</a>  not seeing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6562.139s">Okay,</a>  so there, okay, there it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6563.781s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6576.874s">And</a>  if we can all read number four as well to make sure there's no questions on number four can just work our way down to application timeline next. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6614.522s">If</a>  there's no further questions, we can go on to the name selection form details. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6653.547s">And</a>  I'll read out loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6654.507s">I</a>  mean, I can read out loud as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6656.008s">I</a>  read from Paul's for the first section. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6660.448s">I'll</a>  read from Paul S for the second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6662.289s">It's</a>  submission of names for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6666.01s">The</a>  school committee will request the superintendent or her designee to develop a form to be used to submit names for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6673.231s">The</a>  form will include the following name, full name, address, contact information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6678.372s">Are</a>  you a current or former member of the Columbus Elementary School community? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6682.639s">We</a>  will add, and if so, when. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6685.001s">Name</a>  you are suggesting and a brief explanation of why you think the name should be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6690.284s">Relationship</a>  of the suggestion to Medford are related to the name you submitted, if so, how. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6698.17s">Any</a>  other information that you can provide to the advisory committee for their consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6702.753s">Individuals</a>  applying to be on the advisory committee may submit names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6706.796s">Each</a>  name submitted for consideration should be listed on separate forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6711.684s">the</a>  name of Christopher Columbus will not be considered a valid submission. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6719.91s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6721.051s">Yes,</a>  Member Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6722.512s">Just</a>  so you know, on this, as this differs from Paul's in just two ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6729.477s">I</a>  added the sentence about, are you related to the name you submitted? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6734.84s">And</a>  I also asked that each name be submitted on a different form. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6742.813s">Otherwise,</a>  mine and Paul's are the same.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6747.016s">The</a>  same. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6747.317s">And</a>  then I just want to make sure there's a timeline so that people have more than enough time to do research and submit names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6756.524s">So</a>  do we want to put a timeline here?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6759.186s">So</a>  Mayor, I put all the timelines in a separate section. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6764.091s">So</a>  just because the timelines were sort of commingled. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6767.653s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6768.634s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6769.295s">That's</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6770.055s">We'll</a>  do that separately.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6771.345s">So</a>  if there's any other questions, Member Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6774.406s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6776.307s">I</a>  also have a number, I'm trying to figure out if it's actually a different place in Member Van der Kloots about paper versions of the application form being available. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6787.813s">It's</a>  number six on mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6789.113s">Is</a>  that anywhere in Member Van der Kloots, and if not?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6791.435s">I</a>  forgot to add that, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6793.115s">It</a>  should be added.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6795.056s">So,</a>  I mean, I don't, I think it's for both the applications and for the, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6801.539s">the</a>  names, so I don't care where it gets added, if it gets added twice or not, but it's just saying that there will be paper forms for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6811.104s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6822.369s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6831.021s">the</a>  submission of names for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6833.123s">I</a>  will see if there's any. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6837.226s">Nadine?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6838.568s">Nadine?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6840.79s">Did</a>  you want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6843.312s">Did</a>  you want to speak on submission of names for consideration?</p>

    <p>[Nadeen Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6846.655s">Well,</a>  I just had a quick question about the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6849.277s">And</a>  forgive me if someone answered it already, because I may have missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6854.682s">So</a>  is there no <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6856.889s">possibility</a>  of this being tabled, this resolution, or it was speeding up the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6863.211s">Am</a>  I understanding that correct, I guess? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6869.333s">I'm</a>  trying to wonder why it's being sped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6874.155s">This</a>  isn't gonna help figuring out how our kids are gonna get back to school or a healthy learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6880.457s">I</a>  guess I'm just lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6882.177s">So</a>  Kathy had brought up <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6885.256s">changing</a>  the timeline, is that being considered? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6889.039s">I'm</a>  just curious.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6890.16s">Yeah,</a>  we didn't get to the timeline section yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6892.101s">The</a>  only timeline we've got to was when the form would be complete, which will be, we changed that from this Friday to Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6900.448s">Okay,</a>  but- Timeline hasn't been discussed yet, and there's no motion on the table to table the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6907.433s">No</a>  motion on the floor to table the matter right now.</p>

    <p>[Nadeen Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6911.917s">Can</a>  residents do that?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6913.958s">No,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Nadeen Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6915.216s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6915.456s">I</a>  figured I'd ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6916.457s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6917.757s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6918.618s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6920.939s">Ann</a>  Marie?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6925.842s">I'm</a>  here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6926.242s">I'm</a>  just getting it ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6932.286s">I</a>  guess I'm the only one banging my head on a wall here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6936.108s">I</a>  asked a few questions before, and that was, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6940.211s">The</a>  reason that the question on the application came up is because I know legally you can't do that on your sexual orientation on an employee application. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6950.895s">So</a>  I was wondering and I was asking that question on a legal base. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6955.456s">But</a>  as of right now, there's still no question, there's still no answers to did the city solicitor see it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6961.358s">Has</a>  the diversity director seen it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6965.08s">You</a>  know, I understand that people are saying, you know, people knew about it, people didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6970.402s">Again,</a>  we're talking the priority of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6975.483s">If</a>  there are people right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6977.916s">on</a>  the committee that feel that the name should be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6981.119s">I</a>  don't understand why it is such an urgency that if they have the name change done, whether you do it next month or in two months or in four months, it's going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6996.393s">The</a>  change is going to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6997.975s">So</a>  I don't understand why that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7000.497s">Second</a>  of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7002.176s">Again,</a>  I don't know if I'm gonna get any answers, but people keep on saying this isn't gonna be time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7008.603s">You</a>  have just mentioned, Madam Mayor, that you're only on the first section of five, and we have been on for close to two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7019.054s">Being</a>  involved in the system, I know how much time it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7024.244s">But</a>  again, we still have no answers to how much is it gonna cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7029.645s">How</a>  much time is gonna be put into it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7031.806s">Who</a>  are the ones that are gonna be selecting these applications? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7036.047s">How</a>  are you going to put everyone on the same schedule? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7042.048s">More</a>  importantly, everyone now is going to be looking at their screen to observe what they're voting on within 10, 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7052.907s">I</a>  don't know about anybody else, but I hope to God the budget doesn't you guys don't work on the budget like that.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7058.67s">I</a>  am Murray. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7059.33s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7060.23s">I'm</a>  sorry, Lisa.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7062.071s">Don't</a>  be sorry, Ingrid.</p>

    <p>[Ingrid Moncada]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7070.984s">Hi,</a>  I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7073.626s">I</a>  think I missed if this was answered already, but I want to know who is eligible to apply for the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7082.252s">Is</a>  it all methamphetamines? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7084.133s">Are</a>  we going to check that it's a methamphetamine or can it be anyone? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7088.637s">And</a>  also, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7091.398s">Also,</a>  the same with the application for the name change, are we going to ask for residents only or is other people that don't even know if we're going to be have a chance to, to apply and then the other question is what about Columbus kids, or, well, any kids but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7110.256s">What's</a>  the, are they gonna, will they be able to give ideas? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7115.257s">Is</a>  the Columbus School gonna have like a different way to submit names, a different process that is gonna involve more their opinions? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7125.779s">I</a>  think that will be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7126.82s">There's</a>  just, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7128.34s">Thank</a>  you, Ingrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7129.74s">Yes,</a>  you do have to be a Metro resident is what we have on our sheet right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7138.641s">So</a>  if this is approved, you'd have to be a Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7141.783s">And</a>  we are down the line going to discuss who will be eligible and definitely want to give some, there's section 10, at least in Paul's and I believe Paulette's has it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7158.613s">That's</a>  why we ask on the application, if you're a parent or teacher at the Columbus school, so we can discuss that as we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7172.458s">Member</a>  van de Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7179.202s">On</a>  mine, I have a separate paragraph devoted to the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7184.044s">Now,</a>  the original intent was to have a very lengthy process with students being involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7190.908s">The</a>  time frame makes it shorter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7193.459s">and</a>  certainly will not be as we intended when the original motion was drawn up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7203.324s">But</a>  there is a piece that's dedicated to it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7209.127s">Yes,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7211.208s">Mayor,</a>  I can share my screen for the... Thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7216.87s">For</a>  this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7219.057s">which</a>  is I've titled Application Timelines and Submission Guidelines for Advisory Committee and Name Suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7225.041s">So</a>  the application form and suggestion form will be posted and communicated out through usual mechanisms the district uses, including translations to prominent languages on Monday, March 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7237.091s">And</a>  again, on Monday, March 22nd, the application and submission period will open Monday, March 15th and close on Friday, April 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7246.698s">at</a>  5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7247.839s">A</a>  paper version of both applications will be created by the superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7251.763s">Residents</a>  may request a paper version by contacting the superintendent's office at this phone number.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7258.41s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7259.552s">Yeah,</a>  Jenny, Member Graham, it's not screen sharing, so maybe, sorry, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7265.258s">Sorry,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7266.719s">Member</a>  Vanderlew, will we screen share?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7268.7s">Yes,</a>  so I think that there was a difference in Paul and mine about the date that the applications were due. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7276.645s">And</a>  part of it is that there's a vacation week built in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7280.908s">So</a>  he had them due on the Friday of vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7287.452s">So</a>  which, Paul, if I recall, originally it was April 26th, 24th, 23rd, right on yours? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7293.576s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7297.691s">I</a>  pushed it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7299.573s">I</a>  have been the 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7300.634s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7301.395s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7301.715s">So</a>  that's the Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7302.616s">So</a>  that's the Friday of vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7305.699s">And</a>  that's usually the day when we're then getting our packets of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7311.905s">So</a>  I gave more time, less time to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7316.129s">I</a>  have it done on Friday, April 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7320.665s">which</a>  does cut off time, but it's because of vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7324.606s">I</a>  wanted to make sure that our office staff had enough time to collect all the applications, to collect the names, and to prepare them to give them to us as appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7337.309s">So</a>  that was the reason why Paul and I had a different time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7343.391s">I</a>  just wanted to be clear on that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7345.751s">And</a>  what your date was, what member of it include?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7349.452s">April</a>  16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7350.272s">So</a>  in essence, people have four weeks to apply.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7353.312s">To</a>  apply in name change.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7361.314s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7365.514s">Again,</a>  it just had to do with the vacation week issue.</p>
