[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, here.

25
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:17,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

26
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:18,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

27
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:19,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So three present, none absent.

28
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:21,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I'm going to turn it over to the superintendent.

29
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

30
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:26,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited too.

31
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:30,462
[SPEAKER_01]: make today's presentation.

32
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:39,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's presentation is going to be a partially interactive presentation.

33
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:48,211
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a poll scheduled for you to be able to interact with us and give us a little bit of real-time feedback.

34
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:55,295
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be a little first time we're trying it out, but I think it should be fun to get a little bit of information in real time.

35
00:04:56,739 --> 00:05:06,671
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to present the revisions and updates to the strategic plan, the district strategy for improvement.

36
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:11,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we presented, we are going to highlight

37
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,541
[SPEAKER_01]: a major initiative from each section.

38
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:25,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to preface it by saying that as we begin the presentation, I'm going to ask that we can complete the presentation.

39
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:37,759
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like, as we address the four key areas of achievement, collaboration, equity, and support, we are trying to leave about

40
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,863
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 12 minutes per section once we get to that section.

41
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:54,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to front load all of the information so that you feel like you have a fairly solid understanding of the information that is contained within the document.

42
00:05:55,313 --> 00:06:01,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll open it up for any questions, clarification, et cetera.

43
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:04,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are going to share a slide deck with you.

44
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,341
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe Dr. Cushing

45
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:11,728
[SPEAKER_01]: was going to be managing that.

46
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:28,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And before you start, Dr. Edward-Vinson, I think what you and I talked about is that this would be an opportunity for us to dive back in in a level of detail that hasn't previously been shared with the committee

47
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:44,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And have this group really think about what we're seeing and hearing, as well as what we heard from all the roundtables that this group worked to get off the ground earlier.

48
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:46,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that was just a month ago.

49
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:58,571
[SPEAKER_06]: and just allow us to start to think about the best positioning of this as it goes forward, not just with the school committee, but also the community.

50
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:05,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think at the end of this, after our questions, I'd like to make sure we just have a little bit of time to talk about those next steps as well.

51
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,894
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think other than that, the floor is yours.

52
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:10,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

53
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:14,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to just start to think on the call right now.

54
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:29,677
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a good amount of our school administrators and leaders that are on the call right now and most likely we will have a few others be able to join the call, but this has truly been a collaborative effort.

55
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:55,810
[SPEAKER_01]: we have met for multiple hours, especially this past month, really going back over what had been in the original draft that was presented over a year ago, taking feedback that we've received over the course of the year, trying to simplify language in certain areas and really talk about and call out the high leverage

56
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,872
[SPEAKER_01]: initiatives that are taking place in the district.

57
00:07:59,332 --> 00:08:02,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to thank all the administrators that are on the call.

58
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:24,092
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at times we had close to 40 members of the team really demonstrating and sharing the areas, specific initiatives that we're doing as a district to advance the district forward, but also the specific areas of expertise that the administrators

59
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:31,958
[SPEAKER_01]: are they are the experts in those particular areas and those are key initiatives that the district is following.

60
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:41,725
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to thank all of them who are on the call right now and all of those who aren't on the call but were great contributors to this document.

61
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:50,032
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a collaborative group effort of the actual work that's taking place in Medford Public Schools right now

62
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:57,295
[SPEAKER_01]: that is aligned and coherent, and that we as a district are moving it forward K through 12.

63
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,278
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Cushing, I am going to have you start the slide deck.

64
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:02,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

65
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,442
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our district strategy for improvement.

66
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:18,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And contained within this district strategy for improvement, the key documents and data pieces that we did use.

67
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:25,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Using this district strategy for improvement plan, we used data from DESE.

68
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:30,772
[SPEAKER_01]: We incorporated data and feedback from city and district surveys.

69
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:35,074
[SPEAKER_01]: administrator feedback at multiple meetings.

70
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:48,598
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, we took feedback from the mayor's education transition subcommittee meeting, which was at the McGlynn school and the Medford mayoral transition committee recommendations.

71
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:57,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things were taken into consideration, um, in addition to the additional feedback round table sessions that we had.

72
00:09:58,303 --> 00:09:59,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Cushing, thank you.

73
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:05,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So the genesis of this plan, what is our district strategy for improvement?

74
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:25,952
[SPEAKER_01]: As part of the requirement for the new superintendent induction program, which is referred to as NISP, this was a requirement at the end of our first year and second year of NISP, where they asked all new superintendents to look at the district's goals for improvement.

75
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:36,048
[SPEAKER_01]: The document that we're about to share today takes those goals for improvement and actually puts it into a living document.

76
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:42,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we have amount of years listed on the document, it is not set in stone.

77
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:49,632
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a living document, which we intend to continue to bring back to this subcommittee, this body.

78
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:53,935
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to give updates, make revisions and changes.

79
00:10:55,296 --> 00:11:14,112
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we present, thinking about what point in time in the year should we be bringing the strategic plan back to the subcommittee to be able to say these are changes, these are things that were added, things that were deleted, because this document is a living document.

80
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:35,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Cushing, I just was going to mention that we as a district, we did participate in retreats, multiple meetings, which I said earlier, and cross-disciplinary team meetings to really make sure that we were not just addressing one population, but that we were addressing the whole child and all learners.

81
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:40,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result of the pandemic, the pandemic has taught us so much.

82
00:11:41,558 --> 00:12:08,413
[SPEAKER_01]: especially about areas that we had of concerns, but this past year, especially, we learned from the pandemic, we made shifts and changes as a district, which were necessary, but also just life events that happened over the course of this past year, we as a district have greater racial awareness, which did allow us to also incorporate those priorities

83
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:10,417
[SPEAKER_01]: into this living document.

84
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:11,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

85
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:24,147
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we presented to you, you may see a slight shift, but we presented to you the four areas of concentration in the Medford Public Schools.

86
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:30,511
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about achievement, collaboration, equity, and support.

87
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:43,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Those being our guiding pillars, what is the glue kind of keeping us together as a district in order for us to, again, execute this district strategy for improvement.

88
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:55,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, I know I've been speaking for a few minutes, but at this point, I really would like to ask the participating audience who's there.

89
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,344
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like you to participate in a poll.

90
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:02,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Since last year, we had an original design.

91
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:11,667
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, over the course of the pandemic, meeting with many members of the team, we have come up with two

92
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:18,724
[SPEAKER_01]: similar but slightly different design patterns of the strategic plan.

93
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:37,389
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want you to look at the two patterns and you're going to see that both of these documents contain the same exact information, but it really is a request for feedback and input on the design.

94
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:40,690
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Cushing, I ask you to present

95
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:58,179
[SPEAKER_01]: So before you, you are looking at two versions, option A and option B. Both documents do contain the same exact information organized in a different way.

96
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:07,024
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would like the participating audience to have an opportunity to participate in a poll.

97
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:12,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Option A does not have the pyramid and option B does.

98
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:20,309
[SPEAKER_01]: So please take just a second to say which option you feel more connected with.

99
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would just love to see your feedback.

100
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I can make a selection.

101
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:45,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I can only see the results.

102
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:47,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It must be because I'm a host or something.

103
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't make a selection either.

104
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is because you are a host.

105
00:14:56,031 --> 00:15:00,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we'll do is if I give another- Oh, there it is.

106
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:01,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it now.

107
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:02,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you see it now?

108
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:03,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, excellent.

109
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:06,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see it.

110
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I don't have access to it.

111
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:12,654
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on polling in your bottom bar.

112
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:14,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

113
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:15,096
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.

114
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:19,120
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, do you prefer option A or okay.

115
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:32,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Edward Vincent, I have removed, I believe, all the co-host options.

116
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:33,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

117
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:37,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody should be able to take a crack at it now.

118
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:39,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

119
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:55,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Cushing, are you able to

120
00:15:58,368 --> 00:15:59,330
[SPEAKER_01]: present the results.

121
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:00,992
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

122
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:02,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

123
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:30,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So just doing this quick informal poll, those of you who had the opportunity to participate, option A has 71% voting for option A, which is the option without the pyramid, and option B had 29% voting for that.

124
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:32,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for,

125
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:39,641
[SPEAKER_01]: participating in this little interactive session and giving us some feedback.

126
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:47,865
[SPEAKER_01]: So option A seems to have moved forward.

127
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:55,829
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the purposes of our slide deck, we are going to continue with what was the original design.

128
00:16:55,969 --> 00:17:00,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over the course of a year, and having made it through the pandemic,

129
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:07,633
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we were getting feedback and people were saying, let's do it.

130
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:10,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like that's gonna be our shift.

131
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:17,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, even though the slide deck is completed, option A was selected by our participating audience.

132
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:20,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that feedback.

133
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:29,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I am now going to pass it on to Dr. Cushing, who's gonna give us a little bit of an overview, Dr. Cushing.

134
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,439
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I am unmuted.

135
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:49,682
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we wanted to quickly share with you a, so the document itself is a cover page that then is hyperlinked to sub documents that actually carry a tremendous amount of the roles and responsibilities.

136
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:58,664
[SPEAKER_04]: There are several documents that will be crafted out of this for various plans that a district should have moving forward.

137
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:03,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's just go into one of the examples.

138
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is for collaborative relationships.

139
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:12,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of the plans that I mentioned, establish a district marketing and communications plan.

140
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:22,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this is extraordinarily important as we're finishing up a school in Maine audit of our interactions with our families and community.

141
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:23,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And so

142
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:27,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Using that information will be tremendously important.

143
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:44,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Tucci will speak about the substance of Community Collaborative Relationships Initiative 3 later on in this presentation, but you'll see here you have the initiative, engage in timely, thoughtful, two-way cultural proficient communication with the Medford Mustang community.

144
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:46,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You have our early indicators of success,

145
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:59,234
[SPEAKER_04]: some anticipated outcomes, the resources that we'll need, and then the leadership team that will move forward to navigate this particular initiative.

146
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:16,208
[SPEAKER_04]: At the top of the page, your 2021 to 2024 strategic plan phase one, as we move through the years and we move forward, this would be a good way to track this plan moving forward as it merges and morphs into future plans.

147
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:24,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you'll have the bottom of the action plan, which actually has the action item.

148
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:24,973
[SPEAKER_04]: This is cut off.

149
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:28,074
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be more below here, but this is just a sample.

150
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:29,675
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have the action items.

151
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:35,657
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have some outputs that are expected, the responsible parties or persons.

152
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:39,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And then target dates for completion.

153
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:52,756
[SPEAKER_04]: If something's ongoing and something that should be continually revisited revamped and should be a manner of practice, whereas they might be a target deadline to have a substantive product.

154
00:19:53,857 --> 00:20:00,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, as we work in the world of education, it is a technical field requiring certifications and the like.

155
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:04,064
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's where I want to turn it over to Ms.

156
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:12,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Galussi to bring us back to the glossary of terms that will be a part of this action plan.

157
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, as a part of this strategic plan.

158
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Dr. Cushing.

159
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:23,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can just advance to the next slide in the interest of time.

160
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:23,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

161
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:36,055
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice hyperlinked on the front page of the plan for our strategic improvement is going to be a hyperlink to a glossary of terms.

162
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:40,619
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a small sample of what would be included in our glossary of terms.

163
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:44,230
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other educational terms that we will be adding to this.

164
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:56,497
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a draft, but just as a sampling to show you some of the terms, just to make sure that the greater community understands all of the language and terminology referenced in our plan.

165
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:59,519
[SPEAKER_02]: We have here the term and then the definition.

166
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:06,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, you can see listed what a 504 plan entails and how you qualify for one.

167
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:13,223
[SPEAKER_02]: terms in terms of positions, you have the BCBA, BTA, the difference between the two.

168
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:16,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other example is the credit for life.

169
00:21:16,624 --> 00:21:22,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something that happens at the high school level with the junior class for financial literacy.

170
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:28,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So just so that the greater community has an understanding of all of the terms listed in the strategic plan.

171
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:40,535
[SPEAKER_02]: From here, I'm going to kick it off starting the, we're gonna dive into, thank you, the ACEs.

172
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:43,877
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first bucket, the A, is achievement.

173
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:58,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And the objective for the achievement part is to develop and implement strategic wide curricula, instructional strategies, and assessments that allow learners to reach their potential as knowledgeable, ethical, and critical thinking citizens.

174
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:05,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So today, myself and Dr. Riccadeli are going to present the achievement bucket.

175
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:12,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one in achievement, there are four initiatives and I will speak to two and Dr. Riccadeli will speak to two.

176
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:18,501
[SPEAKER_02]: This first one, you'll see it's their listed initiative A1.

177
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is establish an ongoing curriculum review cycle.

178
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:32,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the anticipated outcomes for the curriculum review cycle would be to ensure that our curriculum is aligned and updated and current with Massachusetts frameworks.

179
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:39,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Assessing curriculum for bias and professional development to support curriculum.

180
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:48,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Now those are the the broad anticipated outcomes underneath the anticipated outcomes will be action items.

181
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:50,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So just as a brief example.

182
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:56,379
[SPEAKER_02]: For the action items that align to these anticipated outcomes would be right now.

183
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:58,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, we are in the process.

184
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Many departments are in the process of updating

185
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:07,981
[SPEAKER_02]: their curriculum to the Massachusetts frameworks which have recently been updated so departments such as humanities and fine arts.

186
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:09,556
[SPEAKER_02]: health, world language.

187
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:12,958
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the process of that now, and the action item would speak to that.

188
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:21,363
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also in the process of vetting and piloting to implement new curriculum based on making sure it's updated with the Massachusetts frameworks.

189
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:33,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Those, as you know from probably some of the budget hearings as well as curriculum subcommittee meetings, we have mathematics, science, and humanities in the process of that.

190
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:45,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year, annually, we use a rubric tool to assess our curriculum for bias, and that will continue, and professional development is part of the curriculum review cycle.

191
00:23:46,504 --> 00:23:50,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to now pass it to Dr. Cadell to speak about A2.

192
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,626
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so good afternoon.

193
00:23:54,846 --> 00:24:01,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So where initiative A1 had to do with curriculum, initiative A2 has to do with instruction.

194
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:08,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So people usually link the two, and there are a lot of links, but they have differences as well.

195
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:20,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So in initiative A2, we're looking at using evidence-based instructional practices to implement the curriculum district-wide, so using programs that work.

196
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:24,760
[SPEAKER_05]: using instructional practices that work.

197
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,164
[SPEAKER_05]: We want students to be challenged and supported at the same time.

198
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:42,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We want them to be taught within what's called their zone of proximal development, so that the work is not too easy, but it's not so hard that they get frustrated and they don't want to work.

199
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:48,838
[SPEAKER_05]: We want students to engage in academic conversations and metacognitive activities.

200
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:55,482
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want those conversations to be rooted in the language of what they are studying.

201
00:24:56,123 --> 00:25:00,905
[SPEAKER_05]: When we go into classrooms and we do our learning walks, we are looking for that to be occurring.

202
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:05,128
[SPEAKER_05]: We want students to think about what they are learning.

203
00:25:05,168 --> 00:25:10,171
[SPEAKER_05]: We want that metacognitive approach to be evident in instruction.

204
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:18,653
[SPEAKER_05]: We want all students to have access to instruction that benefits their learning style and their progression.

205
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:22,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So it kind of goes hand in hand with that second bullet.

206
00:25:22,114 --> 00:25:32,156
[SPEAKER_05]: We want them to be challenged, but we also want them to have instruction that's really going to benefit them and is going to be adaptable to their learning style and what they need.

207
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:44,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, with regard to anticipated outcomes, we want instruction to be rooted with feedback that is rich, that's authentic, that's targeted.

208
00:25:44,948 --> 00:25:54,217
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not saying that that doesn't happen now, but with regard to our action plans moving forward, actually with all of these outcomes, we are,

209
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:03,816
[SPEAKER_05]: We really want to devote time towards professional development so that teachers and counselors and other staff members

210
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:11,772
[SPEAKER_05]: have the training in each one of these areas so that these outcomes can come true.

211
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:23,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are, with regard to action items in this initiative, so we are looking at professional development, both for teachers and also for administrators.

212
00:26:23,804 --> 00:26:26,907
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the other action items we have here is

213
00:26:28,258 --> 00:26:35,179
[SPEAKER_05]: focused in on professional development for administrators in good instructional practices.

214
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:44,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So in August, we have some significant PD that will begin related to the educator evaluation tool.

215
00:26:45,582 --> 00:26:49,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a sampling of some of the action items.

216
00:26:49,162 --> 00:26:56,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the whole project, but it's a sample of what is included in initiative A2 instruction.

217
00:26:57,905 --> 00:26:58,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

218
00:26:59,046 --> 00:26:59,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you.

219
00:27:00,027 --> 00:27:00,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Now moving to a three.

220
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:07,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the curriculum piece, and we have the instructional piece assessment.

221
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:16,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And so an achievement, a three initiative is to implement common assessments to inform instruction and make modifications to our current curriculum.

222
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,440
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the piece that's going to drive

223
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the decision-making in the district.

224
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:29,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And our anticipated outcomes would be how we are utilizing this student data to inform our decisions.

225
00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:33,683
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of like the big umbrella piece to this particular initiative.

226
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:39,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So below that is data to better identify student need.

227
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:44,865
[SPEAKER_02]: That is if students that need remediation as well as enrichment.

228
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:46,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Determining the growth.

229
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:51,289
[SPEAKER_02]: and achievement of each individual student.

230
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And then streamlining and updating our district-wide assessment schedule.

231
00:27:55,471 --> 00:28:03,915
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this looks like is we currently have some district-wide assessment pieces that we look at per grade level, per content.

232
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:12,019
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also want to try and work on coming up with a more streamlined district-wide assessment tool.

233
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:19,124
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be common from, let's say, grade three through high school, grade 10 or grade 12.

234
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:27,451
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be common, so we would have a common platform as well as common language amongst educators and administrators.

235
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:39,640
[SPEAKER_02]: This would give us streamlined data so that we could really drill down to the specific needs of our students as well as making sure our curriculum is filling the needs.

236
00:28:42,238 --> 00:28:48,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other piece is enhancing and building upon the data teams that we currently have at each of our schools.

237
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:58,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So that especially next year, that's gonna be very important to bridge the gap to this break in instruction that COVID has caused.

238
00:28:58,712 --> 00:29:03,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are two action items in relation to the anticipated outcomes for assessment.

239
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:07,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's one more initiative in achievement, Dr. Riccadeli.

240
00:29:08,738 --> 00:29:14,780
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so if you hear a buzz in the background, there's someone mowing the grass right outside my office, so I apologize.

241
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect timing.

242
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,021
[SPEAKER_05]: He's walking by right now.

243
00:29:17,661 --> 00:29:22,963
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so just to provide a summary.

244
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:35,047
[SPEAKER_05]: So initiative one has to do with curriculum, initiative two instruction, initiative three is assessment, and then initiative four has to do with providing instructional technology, which is a medium.

245
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,312
[SPEAKER_05]: for which to deliver instruction.

246
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:41,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the only one, but an important one that we wanted to include in this plan.

247
00:29:41,803 --> 00:29:44,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So with regard to anticipated outcomes,

248
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:53,454
[SPEAKER_05]: The creation of a district-wide technology plan has been determined as a significant need as we move forward.

249
00:29:55,215 --> 00:30:02,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Another outcome is to engage stakeholders to support the effective use of instructional technology and learning resources.

250
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:14,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanna know what other people think, other people in the community, other people within the district, parents, we want their opinion in what we are developing.

251
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:23,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Another outcome is the assessment of current technology management and infrastructure staff and the recommendations for further growth.

252
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:27,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a connection there with the district technology plan.

253
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:35,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And then lastly, critical elements necessary for effectively utilizing technology for teaching and learning identified and implemented.

254
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:39,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, there's a connection here with the instructional piece.

255
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:48,509
[SPEAKER_05]: We just thought it was important to identify technology as a specific initiative separate from those other pieces.

256
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:50,571
[SPEAKER_05]: With regard to...

257
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,224
[SPEAKER_05]: specific actions for our action plan.

258
00:30:57,725 --> 00:31:11,880
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, the creation of a district action plan, we need to assess the current technology that we have, assess the infrastructure, look at the personnel, look at digital resources, and we need to look at staff development needs.

259
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:18,636
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a plan that we believe will take a good part of next year.

260
00:31:19,136 --> 00:31:25,742
[SPEAKER_05]: We expect it to be thorough and there will be many different members of the leadership team involved in that project.

261
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:35,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And then lastly for an example of an action item would be supporting a rich digital learning environment.

262
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:44,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that's going to be the continuous assessment of teaching and learning and the evaluation of the use of instructional technology and digital resources.

263
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:46,962
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is it that works for our students?

264
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:47,863
[SPEAKER_05]: What works well?

265
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:55,025
[SPEAKER_05]: And what do we wanna, how do we wanna use that for the future?

266
00:31:56,379 --> 00:32:00,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I think at this point, that's a summation of achievement.

267
00:32:00,547 --> 00:32:00,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

268
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:02,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

269
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:05,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's back to Dr. Cushing and Mr. Tucci.

270
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:08,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everybody.

271
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:13,601
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Dr. Cushing and I's turn to talk a little bit about collaboration.

272
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:25,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we delve into it, you know, one of the big things that we wanted to talk about as an objective for collaborative relationships was to create a culture of collaboration through consistent community engagements.

273
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:31,635
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Cushing and I will speak to four major initiatives that will come out of this particular objective.

274
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,136
[SPEAKER_00]: of collaborative relationships.

275
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:39,198
[SPEAKER_00]: The first being build and sustain community partnerships that improve school effectiveness.

276
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:44,400
[SPEAKER_00]: The second being ensure all families are welcomed members of the school community.

277
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:51,993
[SPEAKER_00]: engage in timely thoughtful two way in culturally proficient communication with the Mustang community.

278
00:32:52,574 --> 00:33:02,265
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, working collaboratively with Community stakeholders to appropriate budgetary resources and what i'm going to do here to start.

279
00:33:02,725 --> 00:33:21,790
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm going to speak to the first one, which is building and sustaining community partnerships that improve school effectiveness but before I do so, I think what we were kind of talking about just in general with regards to this objective of collaborative relationships, is that we want to aspire to build a really a partnership between families and the community.

280
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:29,095
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, we want to create an effective learning environment that can work in partnership with those families in the community.

281
00:33:30,537 --> 00:33:46,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hope was that through a lot of these initiatives, that we'll really focus on enhancing our communication efforts with families in the community to ensure that our work is really coordinated with students, families, so that we can all kind of feel confident, prideful about our schools, and feel like we're working collaboratively together.

282
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,733
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, I'll jump into initiative one.

283
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:56,570
[SPEAKER_00]: So initiative one was to build and sustain community partnerships that improve school effectiveness.

284
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:05,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hope with our anticipated outcomes were really three pronged, you know, one of them being enhancing professional development resources for our educators.

285
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:18,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, our hope would be that by developing good partners, we can then provide great professional development that will in turn improve our student outcomes, which is certainly one of our anticipated outcomes.

286
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:24,020
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, one of our other anticipated outcomes was to enhance our educational opportunities for our students.

287
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:29,622
[SPEAKER_00]: both during and after school as a result of having great community partners.

288
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:33,563
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just give you a couple examples of a few action items from this particular initiative.

289
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:47,428
[SPEAKER_00]: We spoke to leveraging our great role the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility is playing and in hoping that we are leveraging the CCSR projects to support greater civic interests.

290
00:34:48,328 --> 00:35:05,843
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also hoping that another action item would be to leverage the co-op and practical internships in the field with our community partners, in particular through the Medford Vocational Technical High School and Medford High School, through the creation of maybe, you know, different programs involving the co-op and practical internships for our high school students.

291
00:35:07,112 --> 00:35:18,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Another action item that would be coming out of this particular initiative would be to establish or cultivate relationships with local universities and organizations to offer educational opportunities to students and staff.

292
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:35,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a final example that I'll give would be to continue nurturing relationships with the community family networks in order to partner, for instance, with the Medford Family Network to increase levels of collaboration to expand offerings such as parent workshops and parent language classes.

293
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:50,412
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certainly some more and additional action items that are coming out of this particular initiative of community partnerships, but that's just a little overview of what to expect in this particular initiative and at this point I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Cushing who will talk about.

294
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:06,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize for some reason the controls to unmute and turn on my camera were not available for a second there.

295
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:23,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So in C2, we want to ensure the initiative is we want to ensure that all families are welcome members of the school community and so the anticipated outcome so that families will report to us feeling included informed in district decision making.

296
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:39,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other anticipated outcome is to develop pride and ownership in the school system, so that people really feel invested in feel as a part of this and so one of the actions about this will be to develop and further enhance family engagement events.

297
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:57,510
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of those include curriculum nights, school open houses, title one evenings, EL family nights, CPAC events in that partnership that has really been cited as an exceptionally positive relationship that has been built through hard work over a number of years.

298
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:08,914
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that is yearly and ongoing and will really rely on surveys and communication with families about how we can make these events better, how we can make them feel more included,

299
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:15,246
[SPEAKER_04]: and how the information coming out of them can really be beneficial to them.

300
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'll turn it back over to Mr. Tucci for initiative C3.

301
00:37:24,085 --> 00:37:25,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you, Dr. Cushing.

302
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:34,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative C3 is an initiative that states engage in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally proficient communication with the Medford Mustang community.

303
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:37,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Our anticipated outcomes are as followed.

304
00:37:37,853 --> 00:37:45,017
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one being as a result of the school and main audit, the district will be better positioned to anticipate and support the school community.

305
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:50,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, improve communication and engagement with caregivers and stakeholders.

306
00:37:51,408 --> 00:38:00,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, increase trust and support, and finally improve student outcomes as a result of this timely, thoughtful, too late, culturally proficient communication.

307
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:13,264
[SPEAKER_00]: So while much work has been done over the course of the past year, and some of our work is ongoing, we have some great goals and action items that we are looking forward to putting in place.

308
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:17,527
[SPEAKER_00]: First one being to improve and streamline parent communication.

309
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:25,473
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, we have hopes as an output to implement the smartphone application as a resource and means of communication across all schools.

310
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:30,237
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to increase translation services to improve caregiver and school communication.

311
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:32,799
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be proactively communicating

312
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:39,716
[SPEAKER_00]: academic progress with our caregivers using our student information management system.

313
00:38:40,536 --> 00:38:46,620
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have plans to evaluate existing mass communication systems and offering additional training to school administrators and our school staff.

314
00:38:47,441 --> 00:39:00,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we're gonna be looking to expand opportunities for families to meet with educators and the progress of their students using existing virtual meeting platforms to hopefully increase that level of communication to improve student outcomes.

315
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:20,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the one final action item I just want to speak to briefly here is that we have our hopes to create a district marketing and communication plan, where we're going to tap into establishing district control social media accounts, really working on updating our website and blog to meet all of our community's expectations.

316
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:34,484
[SPEAKER_00]: and consistently promoting and communicating district-wide events in order to be proactive with regards to our communications, and to just continually research products that are going to support family and community engagement as a whole.

317
00:39:35,064 --> 00:39:45,610
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a few examples of some of our action items that are going to be coming out of this particular initiative of engaging in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally proficient communication.

318
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing, kicking it over to you.

319
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:49,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Mr. Tucci.

320
00:39:50,613 --> 00:40:00,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And the final initiative, C4, is working collaboratively with community stakeholders to appropriate budgetary resources.

321
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:16,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our anticipated outcomes, among others, are through budget documents in an easy-to-read, non-financial term, so the community isn't kind of bowled over with that financial literacy course that they may not have taken.

322
00:40:17,012 --> 00:40:18,913
[SPEAKER_04]: and a transition to Munis.

323
00:40:19,013 --> 00:40:23,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those outcomes really rest on a couple of action steps.

324
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:36,001
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what we want to do is we want to create opportunities as one action step, create opportunities for community stakeholders to have input in school and district improvement processes.

325
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:42,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those improvement processes for schools are directly connected to our budgetary resources.

326
00:40:42,864 --> 00:41:08,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we're asking the school committee for what we're asking the city for, you know, is really driven through surveys, school site councils, school and district based roundtables that we saw first start during the the onset of the pandemic last summer, and then continue just as member Graham mentioned about a month ago, but to be able to continue those open, transparent ways to have people have input

327
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:19,609
[SPEAKER_04]: into the things that are important for them, so that then we can use the technical expertise and education to appropriate the budgetary resources.

328
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:32,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is critical to make sure that we have our community on board, as this is tied to every taxpayer in the city, and we wanna make sure that we are being completely transparent.

329
00:41:33,216 --> 00:41:41,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Another action item is for us to adopt a software package, a budget software package that allows for ease of budget presentation and understanding.

330
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:48,765
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very connected to the city and how city hall and school district talk to one another.

331
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:53,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be a shift to a program called Munis

332
00:41:54,028 --> 00:42:10,979
[SPEAKER_04]: and hopefully we would be able to make this transition happen over the next year or two that would be able to assist our budgetary process as well as to pull out reports and other things that make it easy to show the public our fiscals.

333
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:18,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this time I'm going to click the slides and hand it off on equity to Ms.

334
00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:19,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Susanna Campbell.

335
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:21,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

336
00:42:21,486 --> 00:42:22,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon, everybody.

337
00:42:23,127 --> 00:42:28,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Core value E of ACES represents equitable learning opportunities.

338
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:39,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, the district's objective is to understand the needs of our diverse population and support the academic, social, emotional, and physical needs of our students.

339
00:42:41,196 --> 00:42:44,298
[SPEAKER_03]: As a district, we are committed to supporting the whole child.

340
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:51,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will see through the five initiatives I'm going to review, um, that this support takes various forms.

341
00:42:52,063 --> 00:42:54,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I dive in, I want to acknowledge Ms.

342
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Shulman's contributions to all of this work.

343
00:42:57,986 --> 00:43:04,471
[SPEAKER_03]: She can't be here this afternoon, but she contributed greatly to this equity objective and to the initiatives that we're about to review.

344
00:43:04,571 --> 00:43:08,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure that, um, she gets credit for all of her hard work here.

345
00:43:11,737 --> 00:43:23,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So the five initiatives that fall under equitable learning environments, the first of these is increase the support and understanding of health, wellness, and social emotional needs.

346
00:43:24,284 --> 00:43:46,780
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see on the slide, the anticipated outcomes of this initiative are a social emotional learning inventory to be shared with the public, social emotional learning resources for faculty, social emotional learning action plan, social emotional learning professional development plan, increased ability for students to access curriculum,

347
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:56,945
[SPEAKER_03]: increased students' social-emotional skills, establishment of data cycles and screenings, and increased evidence-based group counseling.

348
00:43:58,005 --> 00:44:07,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So an example of one action item from this initiative is an annual assessment of the district's current social-emotional learning programming.

349
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:16,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Each year, the district will identify areas of strength and need, and this information will be used to develop social-emotional learning action plans,

350
00:44:16,877 --> 00:44:18,217
[SPEAKER_03]: at school and district levels.

351
00:44:18,978 --> 00:44:24,839
[SPEAKER_03]: The action plans will include professional development that will be put into place to address the identified needs.

352
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:32,001
[SPEAKER_03]: A monthly review of the social emotional learning initiatives will also take place to ensure that we are moving forward productively.

353
00:44:32,781 --> 00:44:41,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And the timeline for this initiative is ongoing as this is an annual endeavor and it's conducted on a yearly basis so that we can address needs as they arise.

354
00:44:43,635 --> 00:44:47,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Our second initiative is prioritize the development.

355
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we go on to number two when you have, thank you.

356
00:44:54,141 --> 00:45:07,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Our second initiative is prioritize the development of systems that support a shared vision for disability awareness, anti-racism, anti-bias and cultural proficiency across the school district.

357
00:45:08,725 --> 00:45:30,272
[SPEAKER_03]: The anticipated outcomes for this initiative are the emergence of an increasingly diverse staff, culturally proficient curriculum for all students, assessment of the state of our district with regard to diversity, district-wide disability awareness curriculum, and social justice curriculum for secondary education.

358
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:38,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, just to frame this when we think about and we speak about diversity, our district vision encompasses numerous stakeholders.

359
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:47,134
[SPEAKER_03]: We are working toward building a community that sees diversity as a strength, while also recognizing that bias is real.

360
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:52,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are considering many groups of people who are at risk of being marginalized.

361
00:45:52,957 --> 00:46:03,021
[SPEAKER_03]: So this group includes people of color, people with disabilities, students of various religious, cultural, linguistic backgrounds, and more.

362
00:46:03,741 --> 00:46:12,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So I also want to point out that for many students and members of our community, they may very well be a member of more than one of those groups as well.

363
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:17,524
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to highlight two action items from this initiative.

364
00:46:18,044 --> 00:46:20,345
[SPEAKER_03]: First, our Racial Equity Task Force.

365
00:46:20,826 --> 00:46:29,952
[SPEAKER_03]: This group of community members, parents, caregivers, teachers, and administrators is focused on implementing a means by which to diversify staff.

366
00:46:30,812 --> 00:46:37,317
[SPEAKER_03]: To this end, we have identified a couple of tools that we will be using.

367
00:46:37,977 --> 00:46:41,760
[SPEAKER_03]: One is the New England Minority Network, also known as NEMNET.

368
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:50,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other is the Massachusetts partnerships for diversity and education, and I will speak a little bit more about those under initiative five.

369
00:46:52,207 --> 00:47:02,153
[SPEAKER_03]: But in addition, that the racial equity task force is also focused on assessing the district's cultural proficiency through an equity audit, and this is due to begin this fall.

370
00:47:02,993 --> 00:47:13,428
[SPEAKER_03]: The results of the audit will provide us with information that we can incorporate into this living document, our strategic plan, to move forward and make progress in that regard.

371
00:47:14,197 --> 00:47:18,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to just briefly touch upon expanding our disability awareness curriculum.

372
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:23,100
[SPEAKER_03]: This will include further professional development to reach even more staff.

373
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:33,103
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, we're going to be piloting a disability awareness curriculum for students beginning in grades K and one and high school levels this fall.

374
00:47:35,677 --> 00:47:42,998
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving ahead to initiative three, provide equal access to academics, support and enrichment.

375
00:47:43,118 --> 00:47:48,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Now just for reference, because on this slide you will see the acronym MTSSE.

376
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:53,000
[SPEAKER_03]: MTSS is an acronym for multi-tiered systems of support.

377
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:02,282
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a framework for how school districts can build the necessary systems to ensure that each student receives a high quality educational experience.

378
00:48:03,262 --> 00:48:17,559
[SPEAKER_03]: In contrast, we used to refer to RTI, or response to intervention, and MTSS, which kind of grew out of RTI, is more focused on the whole child, whereas RTI was more focused on the academic performance of students.

379
00:48:18,564 --> 00:48:26,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So under Dr. Edward Vincent's guidance, our task force has added an E to MTSS, and that's to reflect our commitment to enrichment.

380
00:48:27,648 --> 00:48:33,450
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand that enrichment is also a vital component to meeting every student's needs.

381
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody has different needs, and for some students, that includes enrichment.

382
00:48:38,172 --> 00:48:43,535
[SPEAKER_03]: The anticipated outcomes of this initiative are defined and adopted MTSSE,

383
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:54,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Established common practices, procedures, terminology for screening, assessment, data collection, analysis, and focused evidence-based interventions.

384
00:48:55,156 --> 00:49:01,262
[SPEAKER_03]: An expanded library of special education assessments and extended day opportunities.

385
00:49:02,163 --> 00:49:05,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to touch upon two action items from this initiative.

386
00:49:05,706 --> 00:49:10,269
[SPEAKER_03]: First, redefining a district vision for MTSSE systems.

387
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:20,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, this work will include an audit of MTSSE systems and the audit will lead to the formulation and implementation of one or more action plans.

388
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:24,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It will include some of the following items.

389
00:49:24,399 --> 00:49:28,622
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to make sure we have common terminology that's used across the district.

390
00:49:29,462 --> 00:49:36,167
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to make sure that we have training for administrators on these processes to ensure calibration across the district.

391
00:49:37,048 --> 00:49:39,770
[SPEAKER_03]: More opportunities for professional development for staff.

392
00:49:40,651 --> 00:49:51,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And also within this initiative E3, there are other action items related to MTSSE that are focused on data collection and evidence based instruction.

393
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:57,885
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the sake of time, I will just say that MTSSE is for all students, students with and without IEPs.

394
00:49:58,585 --> 00:50:02,854
[SPEAKER_03]: our students that are EL, our advanced placement students.

395
00:50:02,954 --> 00:50:06,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really for all students and these systems will benefit all of our learners.

396
00:50:08,193 --> 00:50:13,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I also wanna highlight the work around the recently released Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines.

397
00:50:13,898 --> 00:50:25,047
[SPEAKER_03]: To analyze this guidance, we are forming a team to review the guidelines, review Medford's current level of compliance and recommendations made in the Mass Dyslexia Guidelines.

398
00:50:25,727 --> 00:50:33,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Our plan is to develop and begin implementation of an action plan that will target the items from the Mass Dyslexia Guidelines.

399
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:37,776
[SPEAKER_03]: that we are going to take on as we move forward.

400
00:50:40,198 --> 00:50:43,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, initiative four, ensure positive school culture.

401
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:47,303
[SPEAKER_03]: This has the following anticipated outcomes.

402
00:50:47,423 --> 00:51:01,714
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have a demonstrated improvement of school culture based on data collection, responsive classroom implementation at the elementary level district-wide, and restorative justice implementation at the secondary level district-wide.

403
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:10,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Numerous strategic task force members weighed in on developing this objective and the corresponding initiatives and action steps.

404
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:24,575
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see from the anticipated outcomes that we were really considering the various developmental levels of our students and we thought critically about how can we create a positive school culture beginning in preschool and going all the way through high school.

405
00:51:25,915 --> 00:51:32,558
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the specific initiatives speaks to promoting positive school culture by developing a culture climate action plan.

406
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:38,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And this action plan will include the following elements and probably more as well.

407
00:51:39,021 --> 00:51:43,524
[SPEAKER_03]: But we will be compiling current practices with identified areas of strength and need.

408
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:50,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in collaboration with our parent caregiver groups, we are looking to increase our positive school culture

409
00:51:51,183 --> 00:51:55,606
[SPEAKER_03]: experiences and practices, such as school-wide days of enrichment.

410
00:51:55,666 --> 00:52:06,134
[SPEAKER_03]: These may be field trips, these may be field days, fun day, fells day, various performances, shared cultural experiences, etc.

411
00:52:07,015 --> 00:52:09,837
[SPEAKER_03]: We also will be including responsive classroom.

412
00:52:10,755 --> 00:52:29,722
[SPEAKER_03]: positive behavioral intervention strategies, inviting professionals from different fields to meet with students and give them background of their particular career, and inviting alumni in to meet with students and discuss the importance of the Mustang way and their Mustang way of life and everyday life.

413
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:39,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we think about positive school culture, we're also really thinking about building a community like I had said before, these all kind of intertwine a community that sees diversity as a strength.

414
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:46,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So these practices, they all work in tandem with one another, and we will remain inclusive on our thinking.

415
00:52:46,675 --> 00:52:48,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're thinking about enrichment opportunities,

416
00:52:49,383 --> 00:52:52,926
[SPEAKER_03]: this is a great opportunity for students to learn about cultural experiences.

417
00:52:53,426 --> 00:53:03,434
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, seeking out a diverse group of professionals to present to middle school and high school students about career paths will help break down stereotypes and give all students a role model.

418
00:53:04,134 --> 00:53:07,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say diverse, I'm really, you know, this is all encompassing.

419
00:53:07,236 --> 00:53:11,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking about all types of diversity, racial diversity, cultural, linguistic, disability,

420
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:19,322
[SPEAKER_03]: and having students see adults who look like them, sound like them, and somehow connect to the student can be very powerful.

421
00:53:21,382 --> 00:53:30,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Our final objective, our final initiative, excuse me, under equity is recruit, retain, and develop an effective and diverse staff.

422
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:40,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And the anticipated outcomes of this initiative are to cultivate a diverse workforce and increase retention rates for all new employees.

423
00:53:41,858 --> 00:53:52,903
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our specific initiatives included in this work is to expand our human resources recruiting activities to fill all positions and develop more diversity among staff.

424
00:53:53,644 --> 00:54:02,988
[SPEAKER_03]: The district will use memberships with Nemnet and with the, as I mentioned before, and with the Massachusetts Partnership for Diversity

425
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:04,908
[SPEAKER_03]: to achieve this.

426
00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:11,210
[SPEAKER_03]: They will also develop a more streamlined hiring process to help with this goal as well.

427
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:19,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, to highlight the importance of this initiative, I think we need to know what our current makeup of staff is.

428
00:54:19,253 --> 00:54:24,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point, according to the Human Resources Office, we have 484 teachers.

429
00:54:25,154 --> 00:54:27,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Five of these teachers are Hispanic.

430
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,144
[SPEAKER_03]: two are black and nine are Asian.

431
00:54:30,664 --> 00:54:36,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means that we have about 1% of our teachers who are Hispanic.

432
00:54:36,746 --> 00:54:44,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And by contrast, according to the DESE data, 13.5% of our student enrollment is Hispanic.

433
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:49,508
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two teachers who are black, which is 0.41%.

434
00:54:49,548 --> 00:54:52,308
[SPEAKER_03]: In contrast, 11.9% of our students are African-American.

435
00:54:57,986 --> 00:55:09,149
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have nine Asian teachers, which is 1.9% of our teaching staff, whereas we have 9.5% of our students are Asian.

436
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:22,012
[SPEAKER_03]: So just looking at, you know, who our teaching staff are in contrast to our student body, it's important that we move toward having a diverse staff that better represents our students.

437
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:28,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for your reference, NEMNet is a national resource organization.

438
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:35,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It assists schools in recruiting and retaining diverse teachers, administrators, and coaches, so they work across

439
00:55:36,105 --> 00:55:37,885
[SPEAKER_03]: on the whole country.

440
00:55:38,665 --> 00:55:43,326
[SPEAKER_03]: They cover over 500 public and private schools, K to 12.

441
00:55:43,366 --> 00:55:47,127
[SPEAKER_03]: They also work with colleges and universities and nonprofit organizations.

442
00:55:48,287 --> 00:55:54,668
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mass Partnership for Diversity, MPDE, is a recruiting consortium for Massachusetts.

443
00:55:54,688 --> 00:56:03,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is more focused locally, and their mission is to locate outstanding candidates of color for teaching, administrative, and support positions.

444
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:13,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So in closing, the district's core value of equity is a huge umbrella, and there's many key initiatives that fall underneath it.

445
00:56:14,515 --> 00:56:16,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for your time and attention.

446
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:22,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Susanna.

447
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:27,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you to all the members of the team that have presented thus far.

448
00:56:28,062 --> 00:56:30,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, too, want to just thank Stacey Shulman.

449
00:56:30,243 --> 00:56:32,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Although she's not online, she definitely

450
00:56:34,456 --> 00:56:37,518
[SPEAKER_01]: very actively involved as a tactical team member.

451
00:56:37,578 --> 00:56:38,839
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to all of you.

452
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:41,920
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am trying to bring us to the finish line.

453
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:49,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to, not I hope, I know I will get to the finish line in under 10 minutes.

454
00:56:50,085 --> 00:56:52,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna just set my timer.

455
00:56:52,466 --> 00:56:58,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to keep time as much as possible so that the balance of this time can be used for questions.

456
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:01,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we come to the S for support,

457
00:57:02,472 --> 00:57:09,118
[SPEAKER_01]: This talks about us assessing, reviewing, and ensuring a safe and secure teaching and learning environment.

458
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:11,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

459
00:57:12,441 --> 00:57:14,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Under support, we have three key initiatives.

460
00:57:15,624 --> 00:57:21,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Initiative number one, maintain and evaluate safety protocols.

461
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:26,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our anticipated outcomes, and there will be more.

462
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:28,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is a fluid document.

463
00:57:29,077 --> 00:57:32,200
[SPEAKER_01]: is to have a comprehensive safety procedures book.

464
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:36,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Have sample letters and examples of letters for principles.

465
00:57:38,244 --> 00:57:43,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Creation of a commonly used statements that are translated.

466
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:49,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, equity and safety for all students and staff.

467
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:57,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And one particular example that I could think about, which I could highlight for us that falls under S1,

468
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:04,344
[SPEAKER_01]: would be establishing a multidisciplinary safety working group.

469
00:58:04,964 --> 00:58:13,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And this group would be reviewing and updating district-wide protocols, such as COVID protocols, which are very relevant today.

470
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:25,234
[SPEAKER_01]: AED use policy, management of food, wellness policy, and field trip protocols, and creating additional templates for communication.

471
00:58:25,814 --> 00:58:39,058
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this work would be housed under the, or the director of health services would be helping to ensure that we are maintaining and evaluating safety protocols.

472
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:43,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Another piece that I wanted to highlight that falls under this initiative

473
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:46,131
[SPEAKER_01]: is how we are understood.

474
00:58:47,182 --> 00:59:09,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we want to purchase a communication system that allows for multilingual communication to our multilingual families and to train administrators and interpreters in using this system to send messages home in languages other than English.

475
00:59:09,731 --> 00:59:16,133
[SPEAKER_01]: It does go in two areas, but again, a way of ensuring that we are being supportive

476
00:59:16,673 --> 00:59:21,277
[SPEAKER_01]: to all constituents in our district.

477
00:59:21,697 --> 00:59:24,459
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one, a few examples there.

478
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Cushing, could we move forward?

479
00:59:28,802 --> 00:59:31,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So initiative number two, under support.

480
00:59:31,784 --> 00:59:37,308
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to build and sustain partnerships with community organizations.

481
00:59:38,709 --> 00:59:39,970
[SPEAKER_01]: This is critically important.

482
00:59:40,391 --> 00:59:41,832
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot do this work alone.

483
00:59:43,011 --> 00:59:47,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So PALS is one of the partnerships that we've highlighted.

484
00:59:48,134 --> 00:59:52,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And PALS stands for Partnership for Advancing Leadership Skills.

485
00:59:52,836 --> 01:00:00,340
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to scale that program up K through 12, district level work on the Mustang Way culture.

486
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,222
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very alive at the middle school levels.

487
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:07,884
[SPEAKER_01]: We really wanna make sure that it continues

488
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:23,240
[SPEAKER_01]: To to breathe life into Mustang nation K through 12, an annual report by the community stakeholder team, we would like to have data indicating consistent consideration

489
01:00:24,548 --> 01:00:29,530
[SPEAKER_01]: for individualized emergency response plans, IER needs.

490
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:40,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, trying to meet the needs of all of our students and learners, and to implement consistent monthly meetings with public safety stakeholders.

491
01:00:40,956 --> 01:00:42,436
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I had to call out just

492
01:00:44,592 --> 01:00:58,232
[SPEAKER_01]: one particular initiative, that consistent consideration of the need for individualized emergency response plans, the IERs, what that would entail is the staff

493
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:17,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Director of Pupil Services, our special education coordinators and our 504 chairpersons to ensure that students who have an IEP or 504 meetings that at any time an individual has a change in status, be it mental, physical,

494
01:01:18,267 --> 01:01:32,736
[SPEAKER_01]: communicative, health, et cetera, that we would be keeping that in mind as we think about building and sustaining partnerships and just making sure that we are not leaving anyone behind.

495
01:01:33,296 --> 01:01:36,759
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something that we just highlighted as a key initiative.

496
01:01:37,979 --> 01:01:43,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to also, key outcome, I'm sorry, can we transition to S3, please?

497
01:01:45,206 --> 01:01:54,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Our third area under initiative S3 is to strategically utilize our finances to improve our learning environments.

498
01:01:56,074 --> 01:01:58,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Two key anticipated outcomes.

499
01:01:59,336 --> 01:02:07,162
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to have the completion of a comprehensive and annualized capital improvement process and inventory.

500
01:02:08,598 --> 01:02:20,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we would like to have ongoing dialogue with the municipal government and MSBA regarding critical infrastructure priorities across the district.

501
01:02:21,072 --> 01:02:29,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as we talk about that, the key piece, our capital improvement planning process

502
01:02:30,327 --> 01:02:49,864
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to have an annual inventory with designated priorities for all pending capital repair and improvement projects to be submitted formally to the Medford School Committee for purposes of advocacy before the Medford Municipal Government.

503
01:02:50,325 --> 01:02:54,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are earmarking that as an example of how we would be

504
01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:04,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Providing and supporting the district that s and and strategically use utilizing our finances to do that.

505
01:03:05,964 --> 01:03:11,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Another area would be under you strategically using our utilizing our finances.

506
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:20,400
[SPEAKER_01]: is to improve learning environments on a literal sense, upgrading security systems.

507
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:41,910
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on, we're actively working right now and hoping to have some of that work done by the end of this school year to be moving to some kind of a tap card system and moving away from some of the keys, which would ensure greater security for all.

508
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:52,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the tap card system records who's going in, who's going out, whereas a key is not necessarily able to do something like that.

509
01:03:53,466 --> 01:03:57,369
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the things that we are trying to do under support.

510
01:03:58,089 --> 01:04:03,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the three key initiatives that were identified.

511
01:04:03,834 --> 01:04:08,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, I really want to open it up the floor for feedback, input, questions.

512
01:04:09,658 --> 01:04:11,619
[SPEAKER_01]: We are eager to hear from you.

513
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

514
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:20,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

515
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:42,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I will start by saying, even last night as we were listening to the principals provide their commentary about this year, and I don't, maybe it just like sort of struck me differently last night because we had heard from really all the schools at that point, but it was,

516
01:04:43,139 --> 01:05:00,559
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty remarkable how many new things have happened this year in a year where there's like no reasonable way to expect new things to be happening right like other than the pandemic but but the things that sort of struck me were that

517
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:21,097
[SPEAKER_06]: we're installing new curricula, we are changing the way we assess students, like there was just like, I don't know, it was just sort of like an interesting like reflection point that everyone sort of thinks of this year as like the year where we like navigated the pandemic and the rules that changed like once a week.

518
01:05:22,978 --> 01:05:28,282
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's been a lot more going on at the same time, and it's pretty remarkable.

519
01:05:28,422 --> 01:05:33,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say that the same goes for this presentation.

520
01:05:33,486 --> 01:05:37,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really quite clear how much work has gone into this, so thank you.

521
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:40,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Kathy, did you want to say something?

522
01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:44,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I wanted to, I don't have any questions.

523
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to say thank you to everybody for this extensive presentation.

524
01:05:50,763 --> 01:05:54,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank all the administrators for their time and efforts preparing this draft.

525
01:05:54,364 --> 01:05:58,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I really enjoyed it and I especially enjoyed the interactive piece taking the poll.

526
01:05:59,526 --> 01:06:01,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know that was something that could be done.

527
01:06:03,107 --> 01:06:04,868
[SPEAKER_08]: The presentation was incredible.

528
01:06:05,668 --> 01:06:08,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody spoke beautifully and just thank you all.

529
01:06:12,173 --> 01:06:12,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

530
01:06:13,775 --> 01:06:14,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

531
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:21,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

532
01:06:22,422 --> 01:06:29,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, this is really interesting report and really thank you all for sharing lots of exciting things.

533
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:39,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I love seeing the drill down and I definitely have some feedback and some questions, if you can bear with me, because it was so comprehensive and also just trying to think about it from a lay person's perspective.

534
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:45,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I think more of the polling definitely, Maurice, I felt like I was in grad school again.

535
01:06:46,032 --> 01:06:49,074
[SPEAKER_07]: And that always gets a good reaction from the students.

536
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:53,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think you should do that more with your even school committee.

537
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:54,857
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll probably really like that.

538
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:57,365
[SPEAKER_07]: A little technique.

539
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:06,312
[SPEAKER_07]: So the strategic plan, I just wanted to ask about, I appreciated very much that you guys were going to do the glossary at the beginning.

540
01:07:06,352 --> 01:07:07,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's important.

541
01:07:07,793 --> 01:07:20,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I would strongly recommend that you guys have a non-educator read your documents before you do that, because there were a couple even on this one that I was like, oh yeah, there's a couple here that, you know, and just because you're so fluid in the language,

542
01:07:20,523 --> 01:07:22,724
[SPEAKER_07]: you're not, in my opinion, you're not really thinking of it.

543
01:07:22,784 --> 01:07:27,445
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, going to grad school three years ago, I was totally initiated into this foreign language.

544
01:07:27,505 --> 01:07:29,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, what the hell is going on with these acronyms?

545
01:07:29,986 --> 01:07:37,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, with these acronyms, they're almost like, it's almost as bad as special education or as bad, you know, it's just another layer, I guess, of it.

546
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:39,349
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just really recommend that.

547
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:47,752
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a couple that I noticed along the way, but whenever you see, you know, initials, I would just encourage you to define them in the glossary.

548
01:07:49,652 --> 01:08:03,375
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's I was so happy to see the equity piece later and all the things that you put under equity, because most of the issues I had under achievement came under equity later, so I was really glad to see that and namely around you know accessing curriculum.

549
01:08:03,895 --> 01:08:11,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Assessing curriculum for access right, so you know I appreciate that you're assessing curriculum, but I also want to be thinking about.

550
01:08:11,537 --> 01:08:28,222
[SPEAKER_07]: for access for all learners and I'm sure you guys are, as was evidenced in the equity piece which I was glad to see and so I wonder about those crossovers and how you, I guess maybe when people see the whole presentation they'll understand but there are things that could go under multiple buckets obviously so there was that.

551
01:08:30,097 --> 01:08:38,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I would also say for the curriculum frameworks, I would really encourage you folks to get the frameworks for students with disabilities to all your educators.

552
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:43,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that that was a project that we had undertaken a few years ago, and those were paper copies.

553
01:08:43,842 --> 01:08:47,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if those frameworks have changed recently or not, but in any case, I would say

554
01:08:47,896 --> 01:08:56,604
[SPEAKER_07]: just to your special educators, but to all your educators, because I think that's a really important component, and a lot of people don't even realize that they exist.

555
01:08:56,764 --> 01:09:07,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt like the PD fell into this bucket under A2, and I would just really say for PD, I was so fascinated, Bernadette, when I sat down with you, I think it was, was it pre-COVID?

556
01:09:07,454 --> 01:09:11,638
[SPEAKER_07]: It must have been pre-COVID, I can't remember, but when we sat down and talked about curriculum, and you were sort of showing me

557
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:14,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in a curriculum about PD, and he was showing me all the PD pieces.

558
01:09:14,992 --> 01:09:17,373
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, this is so fascinating.

559
01:09:17,393 --> 01:09:19,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea I was such a nerd for PD.

560
01:09:19,674 --> 01:09:25,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And helping families in the community know what is really happening for PD in the community.

561
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:31,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's really cool to know, oh, my teacher just went to, or the staff had PD on X subject, and I know something about this.

562
01:09:31,561 --> 01:09:35,763
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can talk to my teacher about it, or ask them about it, because I want to know something about it.

563
01:09:35,863 --> 01:09:37,044
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would really encourage.

564
01:09:37,984 --> 01:09:49,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we had a motion that a PD list would have a biannual report on PD, but I just want to again sort of say that I think that's really, you know, great and important I'll be quick initiative a three.

565
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:53,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, modifications to current curriculum.

566
01:09:53,473 --> 01:09:56,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I was, again, asking about sort of access for curriculum.

567
01:09:56,294 --> 01:10:05,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you're talking about modifications to the current curriculum, just some clarification or maybe even a better wording there, because I think what you're talking about is changes to the current curriculum.

568
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:11,280
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you say modification to the current curriculum, it sort of can confuse the aspect of accommodations and modifications.

569
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,681
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just think about that.

570
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:14,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you following?

571
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:15,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, OK.

572
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:21,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And then initiative equal technology plan family training and technology I think is critical.

573
01:10:21,743 --> 01:10:30,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we've mentioned that a number of times but we've got to figure out some way for giving you know technology we're going to have to have some training for families that don't sort of understand that collaboration.

574
01:10:32,255 --> 01:10:34,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see ensure all families are welcome.

575
01:10:36,351 --> 01:10:38,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I was happy about the collaboration.

576
01:10:38,113 --> 01:10:40,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Munis was an example of not knowing what that was.

577
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,158
[SPEAKER_07]: So in your glossary.

578
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:47,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Equity whole child data cycle screenings.

579
01:10:47,283 --> 01:10:48,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

580
01:10:49,706 --> 01:10:52,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So screenings I can, you know, deduce data cycles.

581
01:10:52,369 --> 01:10:57,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to know more like sort of what you mean, you know, you don't have to answer that necessarily now but

582
01:10:58,155 --> 01:11:03,197
[SPEAKER_07]: know if you want to email me that because I want to make sure that member Graham has her questions addressed as well.

583
01:11:03,277 --> 01:11:06,798
[SPEAKER_07]: E2 curriculum disability awareness lesson plans.

584
01:11:07,219 --> 01:11:20,544
[SPEAKER_07]: So again around curriculum I was just thinking about I know that Susanna has been building a bank of books and adapted and modified books which is really great for access to curriculum and I'm just thinking about again there's lots of resources for lesson plans what have you.

585
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:24,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Racial equity, let's see, disability awareness.

586
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:29,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, so the disability awareness curriculum for the students, the pilot program for K-1 through high school.

587
01:11:29,214 --> 01:11:32,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I was a little, and I was excited about the MTSS.

588
01:11:34,953 --> 01:11:39,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I wanted to ask, under NTSSE, do you want to include athletics in there?

589
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:43,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you have enrichment, but I was thinking about the equity around athletics as well.

590
01:11:43,858 --> 01:11:47,921
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if it would be under enrichment, but something to think about.

591
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:58,987
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wanted to say, for the individual education response, emergency response, all those things, I didn't know the difference between the Universal Safety Committee and the Comprehensive Safety

592
01:12:01,663 --> 01:12:03,064
[SPEAKER_07]: group that you want to create.

593
01:12:03,184 --> 01:12:05,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wonder if there's some intersectionality there.

594
01:12:05,707 --> 01:12:17,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would definitely just say, you know, that group should, you know, be considered because they've been doing a lot of work of which I'm a member, just to be forthcoming, but they've been doing a lot of work over the past few years on exactly this issue.

595
01:12:19,259 --> 01:12:20,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love, love, love

596
01:12:21,394 --> 01:12:27,137
[SPEAKER_07]: the fact that you guys are saying we wanna create a community that sees diversity as a strength because it is our strength.

597
01:12:27,557 --> 01:12:37,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford, one of the reasons I sent my children to our high school is because there's so much diversity at our high school and I wanted our children to be familiar and comfortable with diversity and to encourage it.

598
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:41,923
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it is a huge asset for Medford and I love that you guys wanna highlight that.

599
01:12:42,043 --> 01:12:43,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my feedback.

600
01:12:43,344 --> 01:12:44,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it's helpful.

601
01:12:44,564 --> 01:12:49,866
[SPEAKER_07]: And any questions that I had, if you wouldn't mind emailing me so that I don't have to take your time up in this.

602
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:51,574
[SPEAKER_07]: meeting.

603
01:12:52,874 --> 01:12:53,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

604
01:12:53,634 --> 01:12:54,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

605
01:12:54,915 --> 01:12:56,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Melanie.

606
01:12:57,035 --> 01:13:11,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Superintendent, the other sort of thing that struck me as I was listening to all of this, I have some specific questions, which I think are honestly less important.

607
01:13:11,758 --> 01:13:19,919
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the things that I think is a huge opportunity to include in this plan is to talk about

608
01:13:20,379 --> 01:13:24,844
[SPEAKER_06]: how you will include the community as you unfold this plan.

609
01:13:24,945 --> 01:13:31,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we had these, I thought, really great discussions about our mission and vision statement.

610
01:13:31,773 --> 01:13:35,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, I'll be honest, I've never liked them.

611
01:13:35,497 --> 01:13:39,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I think somebody 20 years ago wrote them and nobody has thought they were

612
01:13:40,664 --> 01:13:42,085
[SPEAKER_06]: important enough to like revisit.

613
01:13:43,566 --> 01:13:49,591
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we heard so much great feedback when we asked the community what they thought about our mission and vision.

614
01:13:50,472 --> 01:13:58,079
[SPEAKER_06]: And my takeaway from that was, if we try to like do that right now, we will do it badly.

615
01:13:58,439 --> 01:14:03,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I didn't really want to sort of push to make that change.

616
01:14:03,884 --> 01:14:05,465
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would like to see

617
01:14:06,806 --> 01:14:34,902
[SPEAKER_06]: us commit as part of our strategic plan to doing that work next year that like we we have this like opinion that we want that this is a like a starting point and that there's a lot of work that has to be done you know that has to be done that the school committee needs to approve but as you were all talking I sort of had in my mind the notion of like some sort of like state of the school district address

618
01:14:36,403 --> 01:14:39,227
[SPEAKER_06]: That would provide an update on this plan.

619
01:14:39,427 --> 01:14:51,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, you know, as I was thinking about some of the things that like, you know, I would word differently or that I feel like the like the meanings there, but it's like the, the.

620
01:14:52,438 --> 01:14:59,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Text is like the message is like the text and the words are like really heavy and they're sort of a mouthful.

621
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:07,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that sort of finessing to me doesn't need to be done to say, yes, we agree with like where this is going and we need to start.

622
01:15:07,944 --> 01:15:15,847
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think it would pay off in spades to think about collaboration in particular,

623
01:15:17,788 --> 01:15:30,033
[SPEAKER_06]: to start with this plan and to say, how do we intend to collaborate with the community around us to take this plan through its first year?

624
01:15:30,473 --> 01:15:39,397
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to redo the mission and vision, and we are going to ask for feedback and reactions to

625
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:46,984
[SPEAKER_06]: the words and statements that we use, not to necessarily change the meaning, but to like crisp it up, right?

626
01:15:47,004 --> 01:15:55,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if you look at how you draft something, it starts out with like the full thought of what you're trying to accomplish.

627
01:15:55,693 --> 01:16:01,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the more people look at it, you sort of refine, refine, refine, refine, refine to get to something that's like,

628
01:16:01,732 --> 01:16:09,854
[SPEAKER_06]: powerful and compelling and I think there's still opportunity to do that in all the work that you've done without derailing the work that is ahead.

629
01:16:10,494 --> 01:16:24,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I would like to see some explicit commitment to that kind of collaboration with the community over the next year that frankly takes this document from

630
01:16:26,932 --> 01:16:45,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a requirement of your induction as a superintendent to being like a real grounding source, not just for you and your staff, but for the entire community and the community just hasn't been able to participate in this at all just yet, and that doesn't mean.

631
01:16:46,363 --> 01:17:03,655
[SPEAKER_06]: You, you can't get the agreement of the school committee and do the work, you know, begin doing the work but I do think we need to think through some of those things and make them explicit parts of the plan so that it's clear that we're not we're not looking for all of that work to be buttoned up.

632
01:17:04,617 --> 01:17:15,082
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, this year in June so that you all can start, but instead to say, like, part of the work ahead of us is to take this document to, like, its next iteration or its next life, whatever that might look like.

633
01:17:16,962 --> 01:17:32,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there is opportunity, and I think it all fits nicely in the, like, spirit of collaboration and partnership as, you know, as, like, an anticipated outcome of this plan and a set of action steps in its own right.

634
01:17:32,609 --> 01:17:34,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think, you know,

635
01:17:35,407 --> 01:17:59,004
[SPEAKER_06]: maintaining this plan has to be part of the plan and I think like on the academic side I have no questions that that will happen but on the like there being a grounding document that people come back to and say yes this is still our plan for the next five years or six years or whatever I think that's going to take its own kind of commitment and I want to make sure that we're talking about that when we talk about

636
01:17:59,785 --> 01:18:11,099
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, approving this plan is not because we think it's like the perfect be all end all plan it's because we believe that this is the right direction and part of that direction is really about.

637
01:18:14,969 --> 01:18:19,773
[SPEAKER_06]: endeavoring to get to version two of the plan, right, as one of many objectives.

638
01:18:20,353 --> 01:18:33,843
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had a lot of like, I had a lot of thoughts as you all were going through about like verbiage and language and those kinds of things, which, you know, I think I have like one set of opinions about that.

639
01:18:33,883 --> 01:18:39,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you talk, if you like had a task force of people, they'd all have opinions about that and sort of out of that would come something.

640
01:18:40,608 --> 01:18:51,057
[SPEAKER_06]: really amazing, particularly if you engaged a bunch of non-educators in terms of how do we speak in a compelling way to the community.

641
01:18:51,337 --> 01:18:55,941
[SPEAKER_06]: You might see something slightly different even though the work doesn't change at all.

642
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:59,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a lot of thoughts around that and instead of trying to

643
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:13,533
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about like where we could change words like that just seemed like it just seemed like we were like we would only nibble around the edges right now if we got into like a wordsmithing exercise of any kind.

644
01:19:15,074 --> 01:19:22,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So that wasn't like I don't want that to become like the thing that this subcommittee does or even that the school committee at large does because I don't think.

645
01:19:24,295 --> 01:19:31,537
[SPEAKER_06]: like nibbling around those edges is gonna get us sort of any further ahead than what the document as it basically stands has.

646
01:19:31,677 --> 01:19:40,159
[SPEAKER_06]: But that commitment to that like next step and that version two, I think could be really powerful in many regards.

647
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:52,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly be another signal to the community that we actually do value the input and the feedback that parents give, which is a C level change

648
01:19:53,843 --> 01:19:56,424
[SPEAKER_06]: for this district, like in the minds of parents.

649
01:19:56,504 --> 01:19:59,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So being able to demonstrate that I think would be hugely powerful.

650
01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:04,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are able to make those commitments.

651
01:20:05,206 --> 01:20:16,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel that the partnership with DESE, School in Maine, which just, you know, has been happening this week, last week,

652
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:24,895
[SPEAKER_01]: those kinds of opportunities to continue to improve and evolve as a district.

653
01:20:25,436 --> 01:20:34,543
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said earlier, this is a living document and my intention really would be for us to be able to

654
01:20:36,565 --> 01:21:03,737
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say wait until this point in the year, because I know just with this being the pandemic year, but to give us time to actually implement several of the key initiatives and action items that were listed, and probably by January, I would say January, February, because we do have some December deliverables,

655
01:21:04,377 --> 01:21:19,086
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to report out to this body or to the larger school committee body to say we presented, you know, phase one or the key presentation to the school committee in

656
01:21:21,782 --> 01:21:48,314
[SPEAKER_01]: in May of 2021, and now based on what was presented, to actually look at what was accomplished, so that it really could be, whether we have to highlight it in a different color, or people could see like, wow, a year ago, this was something that we wanted to actually accomplish, and here we are in January or February, it's already been completed, or three quarters of the way done.

657
01:21:48,814 --> 01:21:50,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do feel this should,

658
01:21:51,455 --> 01:22:01,062
[SPEAKER_01]: from an accountability perspective to really be able to say and demonstrate these are all the areas that we are working on moving the district forward.

659
01:22:01,482 --> 01:22:03,964
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our district strategy for improvement.

660
01:22:04,584 --> 01:22:15,612
[SPEAKER_01]: The initiatives that are housed or contained within this document are happening K through 12 across the district to bring about

661
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:18,774
[SPEAKER_01]: increased outcomes for all of our students.

662
01:22:19,395 --> 01:22:33,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when people say what is happening in Medford, they're going to be able to go into this document and say, wow, this is what they're doing to provide supportive and safe learning environments.

663
01:22:34,213 --> 01:22:37,174
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what they're doing to create equitable opportunities.

664
01:22:37,654 --> 01:22:47,277
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the district is doing under the umbrella of achievement, whether it's professional development, whether it's curriculum, whether it's instruction.

665
01:22:47,817 --> 01:22:50,558
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the district is actually doing.

666
01:22:50,998 --> 01:22:52,618
[SPEAKER_01]: That's C for collaboration.

667
01:22:53,078 --> 01:22:54,899
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a collaborative document.

668
01:22:55,579 --> 01:23:16,286
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I've said to the team, in the entire team of administrators, that I did not want to do something that everyone, first off, didn't know where they fell in the kind of puzzle that everyone has skin in the game, no matter what your role is within the district.

669
01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:21,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is something where I feel collectively we collaborated.

670
01:23:21,648 --> 01:23:24,769
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only are we saying we believe in achievement

671
01:23:25,297 --> 01:23:27,218
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration, equity and support.

672
01:23:27,798 --> 01:23:39,122
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the senior level, working with the administrative team, we are actually doing it in order to execute and present this document to you today.

673
01:23:39,662 --> 01:23:47,005
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am committed where you asked member Graham about a commitment.

674
01:23:47,865 --> 01:23:51,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely am committed to working on the mission vision

675
01:23:53,408 --> 01:24:14,565
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of this document and to have it be an inclusive experience for the community and for us to be able to, you know, let school get off to a good start, but I would say late fall for us to definitely put some things in place to have active participation.

676
01:24:15,627 --> 01:24:28,058
[SPEAKER_01]: in the mission and vision statement and to hear and give the community opportunities to be familiar with all of the initiatives that are taking place in the district.

677
01:24:29,476 --> 01:24:40,786
[SPEAKER_01]: We are really doing a lot and to have it housed in this living document is now letting everyone know it's going to be made public.

678
01:24:41,027 --> 01:24:44,270
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the work of Medford Public Schools.

679
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:49,514
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Medford Public Schools district strategy for improvement.

680
01:24:50,415 --> 01:24:53,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that's kind of like our why why are we here.

681
01:24:54,438 --> 01:25:06,305
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here, not because we want to be here but we're here to bring about improved increased outcomes for our students, and to be inclusive, because we know that we have all kinds of learners within the district.

682
01:25:06,865 --> 01:25:11,308
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do feel like this document says, this is the work that we're going to do.

683
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:14,370
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is what we're going to do for everyone.

684
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:27,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when Susanna presented under equity on the MTSSE, it is a multi-tiered system of support and enrichment because we have all kinds of learners.

685
01:25:28,282 --> 01:25:34,347
[SPEAKER_01]: We have English learners, we have students with disabilities, and we have students that are capable of taking

686
01:25:34,867 --> 01:25:41,832
[SPEAKER_01]: You know honors or advanced placement coursework who are asking to be challenged are asking to be pushed.

687
01:25:42,253 --> 01:25:46,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we also want to remember that they are learners in the district as well.

688
01:25:47,237 --> 01:25:53,001
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking at the entire district and where member McLaughlin said, let's think about

689
01:25:55,043 --> 01:26:11,010
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're thinking about inclusivity, also to think about athletics, and how I would see athletics falling under enrichment, but to specifically call it out and say that we want athletics to be available, not only for students.

690
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:38,176
[SPEAKER_01]: that are naturally inclined to play sports, but for students that might not play sports the way we would originally think about it, but for us to be able to broaden our horizons, expand our thinking, and think outside of the box and say, yes, if we're going to offer the athletics, offer it for our students with disabilities or other students who would play sports in different ways.

691
01:26:38,536 --> 01:26:39,777
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are definitely

692
01:26:41,509 --> 01:26:45,150
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely involved in that and committed to doing that.

693
01:26:45,730 --> 01:27:03,653
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanna thank one more time the entire, all of my administrators, but I want to call out the smaller group that really dedicated a lot of additional time above and beyond working with the larger group.

694
01:27:04,293 --> 01:27:06,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, you know, Dr. Riccadeli,

695
01:27:07,854 --> 01:27:20,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Cushing, Suzanne Galussi, Paul DeLeva, Susanna Campbell, Stacey Shulman, she's on the call, I saw her, Principal Nick Tucci.

696
01:27:22,058 --> 01:27:32,702
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I got everyone in that group who really contributed, gave us feedback, pushed us to get it to this level.

697
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:35,753
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it to this place.

698
01:27:36,115 --> 01:27:38,804
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank Susie for

699
01:27:40,636 --> 01:27:48,982
[SPEAKER_01]: taking my challenge on to look at the original design of the strategic plan, which goes back to 2018-19.

700
01:27:49,263 --> 01:27:54,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank Dr. Cushing for the original design, Dr. Cushing.

701
01:27:54,567 --> 01:27:56,208
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you for the original design.

702
01:27:56,828 --> 01:28:07,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank Susie for also looking at the original design and thinking about our Mustang colors and saying, is there a way to come up with a different palette

703
01:28:08,397 --> 01:28:14,702
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if we could really make this a beautiful living document.

704
01:28:15,063 --> 01:28:26,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And just from our small poll today, it does seem like from the formatting perspective that the majority of people did poll and vote to kind of go with the

705
01:28:28,271 --> 01:28:32,515
[SPEAKER_01]: the newer style, but it's the same content that's contained within.

706
01:28:32,615 --> 01:28:35,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanna say that and thank you.

707
01:28:35,838 --> 01:28:37,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again to all of you.

708
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:42,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I applaud you and I thank you just for taking this journey with me.

709
01:28:52,515 --> 01:28:55,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

710
01:28:56,417 --> 01:29:02,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to ask what the process was for next steps, but I think maybe member Graham was okay.

711
01:29:02,559 --> 01:29:03,719
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the process for next steps?

712
01:29:03,779 --> 01:29:04,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

713
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:14,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I mean, I think this we as a subcommittee can vote to ask you to present this to the larger school committee at an upcoming meeting.

714
01:29:14,723 --> 01:29:20,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love for it not to be the meeting on the seventh because I think there's a

715
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:22,867
[SPEAKER_06]: really full agenda there already.

716
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:30,216
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that leaves the 14th, but we can certainly take that vote.

717
01:29:30,256 --> 01:29:34,741
[SPEAKER_06]: The only other question that I had that I did want to mention to this group was,

718
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:42,385
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't heard much from the Racial Equity Task Force as a committee yet.

719
01:29:43,346 --> 01:29:46,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did hear you mention an equity audit in the fall.

720
01:29:46,587 --> 01:29:50,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember seeing that in the budget particularly or in a called out way.

721
01:29:51,649 --> 01:29:53,690
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am completely on board.

722
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:59,192
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the things I would like to ask the Racial Equity Task Force to really explicitly weigh in on is,

723
01:30:01,373 --> 01:30:21,107
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about the PALS curriculum and our collaboration with law enforcement, I would really like to hear from the Racial Equity Task Force about those concepts and their either support or non-support of those activities.

724
01:30:21,287 --> 01:30:22,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, you know,

725
01:30:23,408 --> 01:30:29,730
[SPEAKER_06]: The police in schools is a very hot topic right now, and has been for a year.

726
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:40,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, frankly for much longer but certainly schools taking active and drastic measure over what they've ever done in the past.

727
01:30:42,405 --> 01:30:49,970
[SPEAKER_06]: to act, especially since the death of George Floyd one year ago.

728
01:30:50,791 --> 01:30:57,696
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to hear from the Racial Equity Task Force about where they are at in terms of

729
01:31:01,938 --> 01:31:04,460
[SPEAKER_06]: the role of police in our own schools.

730
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:11,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I know that is a hot topic and it will be the source of much conversation.

731
01:31:11,564 --> 01:31:23,070
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not even suggesting that we do that this school year, but I would like to hear from them at some point as they do their work in terms of what explicitly they've considered in that regard.

732
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:26,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

733
01:31:29,468 --> 01:31:34,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, yes, I'm sorry I can't tell if you can see the raised hand or not because it's against this white background so.

734
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I would raise my hand as well.

735
01:31:37,581 --> 01:31:48,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I also just wanted to sort of, you know, think about, I mean, I'm looking forward and I, to members Graham's point, the racial equity task force, we haven't heard from and we need to, and I thought that is a really good point.

736
01:31:48,427 --> 01:31:49,467
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for bringing it up.

737
01:31:49,547 --> 01:31:52,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And also an equity audit, I think is really great idea.

738
01:31:52,909 --> 01:32:03,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that CPAC has been talking about for a number of years and just something I'd like you to think about, you know, as you consider, I guess, the next strategic plan or sort of where we're going with things is an inclusion audit.

739
01:32:04,732 --> 01:32:09,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So also to be thinking about sort of what we're doing around inclusion in our community in our school.

740
01:32:10,582 --> 01:32:17,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I think some people often think of that as like, you know, just literally how much time is spent in a gen ed classroom, but it is so much more than that.

741
01:32:18,628 --> 01:32:19,729
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we all know that.

742
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:26,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we also talk about, you know, disability is diversity and equity is inclusion.

743
01:32:27,596 --> 01:32:38,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's, you know, I know we're dealing specifically with race around the anti-racism task force, but I just want to also add that because it's something they've been asking for for some time.

744
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:42,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it addresses equity on a number of levels too.

745
01:32:42,647 --> 01:32:44,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm so glad that these things are moving forward.

746
01:32:44,932 --> 01:32:45,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

747
01:32:46,867 --> 01:33:04,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to say in terms of the work that's been taking place with the Race Equity Task Force, we have one final meeting of this year and then we're going to pause and then restart up again for next year.

748
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:15,212
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we realized as a group was that without the absence of not having an official audit to be able to weigh in on

749
01:33:16,292 --> 01:33:32,604
[SPEAKER_01]: the state of the district, that the members of the race equity task force have been very active, very involved, but also in light of the fact that this was a pandemic year, that we had nearly 1300 students that were not

750
01:33:34,305 --> 01:33:51,814
[SPEAKER_01]: physically on campus, including, you know, many staff that it was kind of an anomaly and to go forward with trying to get information during this year, it would not have been valid information about the state of the Medford public schools.

751
01:33:52,295 --> 01:33:56,597
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the positive pieces about having the conversations

752
01:33:57,050 --> 01:34:25,175
[SPEAKER_01]: and working with the members of the task force has been about knowing that next year we will be back in action, working full time, really having everyone on board and gathering that data from the audit, that that would give us the correct information and data to be able to make recommendations formally about the district

753
01:34:25,635 --> 01:34:26,815
[SPEAKER_01]: and to the school committee.

754
01:34:27,275 --> 01:34:32,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely will keep that in mind, those requests.

755
01:34:33,096 --> 01:34:50,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanna say that, although I know that there's a lot of conversation about different programs that are taking place, I truly feel at least in Medford, the PALS program really is an opportunity of,

756
01:34:53,233 --> 01:35:00,490
[SPEAKER_01]: reading with students, connecting with students in a school environment.

757
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:10,183
[SPEAKER_01]: where the children are younger and developing, providing students with positive opportunities interacting with the police.

758
01:35:11,083 --> 01:35:17,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the police officers, you know, read to the students, positively engage with the students.

759
01:35:17,785 --> 01:35:24,227
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think based on, it's falling under the umbrella of social emotional, the cell umbrella.

760
01:35:25,367 --> 01:35:36,632
[SPEAKER_01]: learning and I feel that creating conditions for positive proactive collaborations, interactions with the police.

761
01:35:38,758 --> 01:35:45,002
[SPEAKER_01]: in partnership with the schools will in the end yield better results for all.

762
01:35:45,603 --> 01:35:57,070
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do think that although I know there are challenges and things that happen in other places, I do feel like here in Medford, we truly have a collaboration.

763
01:35:59,412 --> 01:36:01,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief Buckley was on campus today.

764
01:36:01,253 --> 01:36:04,195
[SPEAKER_01]: The police were here today meeting and planning

765
01:36:05,115 --> 01:36:06,436
[SPEAKER_01]: with our transportation.

766
01:36:06,496 --> 01:36:11,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a lot of positive collaboration that is taking place.

767
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:23,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Medford is in a position to demonstrate what positive partnerships can look like and how it will benefit and can benefit the community.

768
01:36:24,909 --> 01:36:25,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
