1
00:00:01,826 --> 00:00:02,667
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we are good to go.

2
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:07,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to read the meeting notice, Dr. Cushing.

4
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:13,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's some folks in the waiting room if you want to let them in.

5
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:18,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will read the meeting notice so we can get started.

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:29,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Please be advised that on Tuesday, February 11th, 2025 at 7 p.m., there will be an MSBA OPM selection subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via Zoom.

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ahead and call the roll.

14
00:01:16,818 --> 00:01:17,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny Graham here.

15
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:18,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Fiona Maxwell.

16
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:26,381
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Fiona.

17
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Erin Lopate.

18
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:31,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jenny, I am here.

19
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:31,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

20
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:35,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Fiona.

21
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:36,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Cushing?

22
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:37,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

23
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:38,953
[SPEAKER_04]: John McLaughlin?

24
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:44,357
[SPEAKER_04]: John is here.

25
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:47,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bob Dickinson?

26
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,061
[SPEAKER_04]: See Bob as well.

27
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:55,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So three voting members present, zero absent.

28
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:56,884
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a quorum.

29
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what I was hoping to do tonight was a couple of things.

30
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:09,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So, 1st, provide some updates and talk a little bit about this next phase of the project for for and then actually.

31
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at.

32
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:18,776
[SPEAKER_04]: a drafted deliverable that we'll need to complete for the MSBA.

33
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:20,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk about that in just a second.

34
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:28,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Then implicit in all of that will be to discuss our vetting and selection process.

35
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:41,429
[SPEAKER_04]: My hope for tonight is that we can come out of it with an RFS that is pretty well complete and ready to be vetted and viewed by MSBA, which is one of the steps in the process.

36
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,833
[SPEAKER_04]: But between now and then we have a couple of things to look at in the RFS.

37
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,514
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll get to that in just a minute.

38
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:58,139
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of sort of what happens in this next module, there's two components, two big components of module 2.

39
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,221
[SPEAKER_04]: One is to hire the OPM and the other is to hire the designer.

40
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:06,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not going to worry about the designer just yet because we have to hire an OPM before that can happen.

41
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:09,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that

42
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:25,166
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be recommended for approval at the board meeting coming up on the 26th of February and that will be our invitation to the next phase of the project.

43
00:03:25,226 --> 00:03:29,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is module 2 of MSBA, which is where we hire our team.

44
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:32,131
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually going to help do the lion's share of the work.

45
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:32,311
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

46
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:42,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited for the next phase because I think our work gets easier when we have the professionals on board who do this for a living instead of all of us having to figure out and learn.

47
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:45,824
[SPEAKER_04]: all the moving parts of the MSBA process.

48
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:53,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So once that happens, we will have to do a number of things.

49
00:03:53,348 --> 00:04:00,111
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will have to identify an OPM selection committee, which we actually have already done.

50
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,132
[SPEAKER_04]: It is this group.

51
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:05,094
[SPEAKER_04]: We identified and voted on this back in September.

52
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:23,471
[SPEAKER_04]: As I think about the work ahead, and we can maybe come back to this at the end, but as of right now, we have three voting members on this committee, myself, Aaron, and Dr. Cushing, and we will make the selection of the OPM.

53
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:32,677
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually, in my mind, quite a small group of people to pick what becomes a really central figure in our process.

54
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:42,481
[SPEAKER_04]: We may want to think about at our next full committee meeting, adding some number of voting members to this committee members.

55
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:43,581
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you for joining.

56
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:46,402
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly, you know.

57
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:56,931
[SPEAKER_04]: The more the merrier is probably not the right thought process to make this happen, but I do think we should welcome.

58
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:04,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Some perspectives outside of school administration and elected officials to the process.

59
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to think about that.

60
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:12,447
[SPEAKER_04]: We can come back to that at the end once we have once I can give you a little bit more information about.

61
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:18,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what this process is and what the and more and I think as importantly, what the timeline is.

62
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:26,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, once we get sort of flagged through to this next phase, we will have to do a couple of things to MSBA.

63
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:30,341
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to designate our procurement admin.

64
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:31,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's Fiona.

65
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:32,983
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know who that is.

66
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,285
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have to officially put that in writing and move along.

67
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:43,879
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to let them know who our selection committee is, which we will be able to do pretty quickly.

68
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:56,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we will have to give them a draft of what they call RFS, request for services, that shows our redlined version of their template.

69
00:05:57,051 --> 00:06:00,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So MSBA does require that we use their template.

70
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,333
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite prescriptive.

71
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:11,476
[SPEAKER_04]: It made it actually quite easy to fill out, which was wonderful as I was working on this with Will from our communications team.

72
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:14,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will have to

73
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:20,493
[SPEAKER_04]: seek their approval on how we have filled out this document.

74
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,454
[SPEAKER_04]: The document includes any number of things.

75
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:30,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they approve, we will then have to advertise this in three places.

76
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:36,357
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have to advertise it in what the MSBA calls the central register.

77
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:43,158
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to advertise this in a newspaper, and we'll have to advertise this on Combis is my understanding.

78
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:51,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally, they do recommend that we hold an onsite meeting for interested bidders.

79
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:58,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We will then have to go through a process, which we do have to lay out in the RFS where we.

80
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Score all of our.

81
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:14,178
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the bid submissions that we receive, we will then down select to a shortlist service set and invite those folks into visit with us live.

82
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:15,898
[SPEAKER_04]: We will then.

83
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:22,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Call references, make a selection and bring that selection to the.

84
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:28,511
[SPEAKER_04]: the OPM review panel that is hosted by the MSBA on a monthly basis.

85
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:37,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they agree with our selection through that process, then we're free to move into executing a contract.

86
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's like the process in a teeny tiny nutshell.

87
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:45,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll stop there and find out if there are any questions.

88
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:57,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for providing that process in a nutshell.

89
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,407
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds great.

90
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:00,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

91
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:03,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And Fiona, I think I did have one question for you.

92
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:10,090
[SPEAKER_04]: It talked about advertising in the Central Register, the newspaper, and Combis.

93
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:17,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct in assuming that your office will be able to handle that upon issue?

94
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:18,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

95
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,012
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do every day.

96
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:20,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

97
00:08:20,673 --> 00:08:21,253
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, perfect.

98
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:40,117
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, having said all of that, this team will have its work cut out for us as we look at the bid submissions and pick our partner in all of this as we go forward.

99
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:46,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to share my screen and walk through the RFS with you all.

100
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to share a copy of this once we're done.

101
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant to share it before now, but I was still working on it like five minutes ago.

102
00:08:57,023 --> 00:09:11,210
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think overall, what we need to make sure that we're doing is giving bidders an opportunity to know sort of what we're looking for and what we're seeking, as well as sort of staying compliant with

103
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,642
[SPEAKER_04]: what the MSBA is asking us to do.

104
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:19,726
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me pull that up real quick.

105
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:36,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to apologize in advance because it's a little, little wacky with all of the red lines, but that's okay.

106
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Can everybody see my screen?

107
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:47,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

108
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:55,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is the template that the provides and the 1st piece is.

109
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:58,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Instructions, right?

110
00:09:58,504 --> 00:09:58,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

111
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,372
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to follow the instructions.

112
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:11,060
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to review this RFS and make sure that all of our owner specific information is in here.

113
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:21,030
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to review this RFS with our legal counsel to ensure it's in compliance with our federal, state and local laws.

114
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,302
[SPEAKER_04]: for the school committee, that's Howard Greenspan.

115
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:27,784
[SPEAKER_04]: He is our school committee attorney.

116
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:38,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So unless, Fiona, there is somebody else that typically isn't involved from a procurement perspective, my thought would be to pass this by Howard to make sure that he is on board.

117
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:38,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you agree with that?

118
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:39,953
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%, yes.

119
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,054
[SPEAKER_04]: He is, yeah.

120
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,476
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, great.

121
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:49,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have to submit this red line version for MSBA's review prior to advertisement.

122
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:49,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

123
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:56,745
[SPEAKER_04]: We will also include a series of attachments, which I'll talk about later.

124
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:09,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to, a copy of the final RFS and advertisement needs to be submitted to the MSBA with a sample narrative summary and checklist.

125
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:11,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have to get that done.

126
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:18,256
[SPEAKER_04]: An owner should allow a minimum of 10 business days for the MSBA to review the RFS and

127
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:23,146
[SPEAKER_04]: we should not be advertising until MSBA approves.

128
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:26,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are our sort of rules and requirements here.

129
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:39,394
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we move forward here, essentially in this template, everything that's in bold and italics are places where the MSBA is telling us this is for you to fill out.

130
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:43,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So this first section is pretty straightforward.

131
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:53,182
[SPEAKER_04]: in terms of just replacing our name and that kind of thing.

132
00:11:55,043 --> 00:12:13,794
[SPEAKER_04]: This part right here, it does talk about potential approved project may include a renovation of an existing school, a renovation of an addition of an existing school and or new construction, which is why these total project costs have a big range.

133
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:15,716
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a range that

134
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:23,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at based on what I see in the marketplace, because if we are going to pursue some sort of renovation, it might be much smaller.

135
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,421
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're pursuing a completely new build, it would be much bigger.

136
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:31,204
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all dependent on the solution that we all agree to.

137
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:33,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions about that so far?

138
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:37,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

139
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:42,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it asks for a background.

140
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:58,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So this did right with the help of my technological friends over at CHAP-GPT, who have the benefit of all of our documents posted to the website.

141
00:12:59,176 --> 00:13:01,318
[SPEAKER_04]: But essentially what they are asking for here is some

142
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:15,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Some background information about the city, the school building committee, our grade configuration, just things that are pertinent.

143
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:17,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will read what I've written.

144
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:22,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I take no offense if you think it's terrible, but we can wordsmith it as we go.

145
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:31,038
[SPEAKER_04]: The city of Medford, located in the greater Boston area, is a dynamic and growing community that places strong emphasis on educational excellence.

146
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:38,728
[SPEAKER_04]: The district is committed to providing an inclusive and innovative learning environment with a focus on preparing students for success in a rapidly changing world.

147
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:46,111
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford High School, established in the mid-20th century, has served as a cornerstone of the community's educational infrastructure.

148
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:53,134
[SPEAKER_04]: However, over time, the building has become increasingly outdated and no longer meets the evolving needs of students, educators, or the broader community.

149
00:13:53,714 --> 00:14:03,117
[SPEAKER_04]: The facility's aging systems, limited space, and lack of modern learning environments have prompted the city to pursue significant renovations and improvements to the high school campus.

150
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:14,772
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee is comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders, including elected officials, city officials, school district representatives, and community members with a variety of backgrounds.

151
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:23,894
[SPEAKER_04]: The committee's primary mission is to oversee the planning and execution of the Medford High School project, ensuring that it meets academic, social, and safety needs of students.

152
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:41,725
[SPEAKER_04]: The committee has broad support to also pursue expansion of its portfolio of Chapter 74 programs, its early childhood programs, and to co-locate the current Curtis Tufts program to increase access to programming for students of this school.

153
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:46,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I used program a lot in that sentence, so I will fix that.

154
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:53,953
[SPEAKER_04]: The district's grade configuration includes elementary schools K-5, middle school 6-8, and the high school grades 9-12.

155
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: The existing high school facility now serves approximately 1,200 students and is expected to see future growth.

156
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:07,657
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford High School campus also houses athletic facilities, art spaces, and administrative offices that serve the school community and the community at large.

157
00:15:08,337 --> 00:15:13,038
[SPEAKER_04]: As part of the ongoing effort to upgrade the district's infrastructure, the Medford Public Schools submitted

158
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:20,183
[SPEAKER_04]: A statement of interest to the MSBA highlighting the need for a comprehensive solution to address the building's shortcomings.

159
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:30,551
[SPEAKER_04]: The accepted SOI serves as a reference for the project and outlines key areas of concern such as structural integrity, accessibility, energy efficiency, and technology integration.

160
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:37,016
[SPEAKER_04]: The project aims not only to enhance the learning environment for students, but also to ensure that the school can serve the community for generations to come.

161
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:46,844
[SPEAKER_04]: This request for services seeks to engage qualified professionals who can contribute to the success of this transformative project, providing expertise in design, construction, and project management.

162
00:15:47,404 --> 00:16:05,218
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal is to create a state-of-the-art educational facility that fosters creativity, collaboration, and academic excellence, and do the project with substantial community input from the community at large, and specifically from the students and staff who will work, learn, and thrive in the new building.

163
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:15,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's questions things that are missing.

164
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:16,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that was a lot.

165
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:25,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember myself.

166
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:25,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. fishing.

167
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:31,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it's phenomenal.

168
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:31,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do.

169
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:43,733
[SPEAKER_07]: My only suggestion would be where we talk about facilities, art spaces, perhaps say fine and performing arts, just because one of the things we've tried to do is shift to that performing as well.

170
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,317
[SPEAKER_07]: But I thought it was extremely well done.

171
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

172
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Arts.

173
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

174
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:13,193
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

175
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:09,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions thoughts about that lead in.

176
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:12,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

177
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:13,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Um.

178
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:14,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

179
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,723
[SPEAKER_04]: This section is pretty straightforward.

180
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:42,381
[SPEAKER_04]: The next thing that we have to provide is to provide specific information regarding the identified school, including, but not limited to the total square footage, site information, age of the building, historical components of the building and or site, if any building conditions and problems, grade structure and enrollment and MSBA agreed upon enrollment.

181
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:43,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

182
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:54,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a starting point here that says the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School complex was constructed during the late 60s and opened in the fall of 1970.

183
00:18:54,764 --> 00:19:00,791
[SPEAKER_04]: From its opening until 2017, it housed two distinct schools, Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

184
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:05,895
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2017, the Medford School Committee voted to merge the two schools into one comprehensive high school.

185
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:18,282
[SPEAKER_04]: But despite the forward-looking vision aimed at establishing one flagship school to serve as the epicenter of public education for the Medford community, the facility is designed for the delivery of instruction in a bygone era, namely the early 70s.

186
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:28,528
[SPEAKER_04]: The challenges yielded by its antiquated design have been exacerbated by the increasing severity of infrastructure that ranges from deteriorating to inoperable.

187
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:39,512
[SPEAKER_04]: MPS envisions Medford High School as a comprehensive high school with a broad array of academic programming and a host of vocational educational programs sanctioned under MGL Chapter 74.

188
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:45,140
[SPEAKER_04]: But the 55-year-old facility housing MHS is an obstacle to optimal learning conditions.

189
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:51,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford High School currently serves a combined 1210 students in grades 9 through 12.

190
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:55,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Over 50% of these students are CTE students.

191
00:19:55,965 --> 00:20:05,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, MHS houses a preschool program that includes X students and a daycare for children ages X to X that has an enrollment of X together.

192
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:09,994
[SPEAKER_04]: This total enrollment of current students is Y. So we have a few blanks to fill in there.

193
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:19,982
[SPEAKER_04]: The district's agreed upon enrollment projection for a new MHS is 1800 students of this figure 1395 are grade 9 to 12 high school students.

194
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:25,307
[SPEAKER_04]: 200 are pre K students and 100 students are students in district state care.

195
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:32,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to shore up those numbers based on our enrollment certification.

196
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:36,636
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are placeholders to describe what we've got going on there.

197
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:37,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

198
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:38,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

199
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:43,269
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we also have to add a placeholder for our 18 to 22 program.

200
00:20:45,972 --> 00:20:46,212
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

201
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless I glossed over it.

202
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:51,276
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was one of the things.

203
00:20:51,756 --> 00:20:52,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I OK to speak?

204
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:53,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

205
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:54,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

206
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:58,462
[SPEAKER_01]: That was going to be one of the things that I was going to say to Peter.

207
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:01,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can easily get those numbers for you to fill these in.

208
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,027
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

209
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:20,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other thoughts about what might need to be added there?

210
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, I just had a question.

211
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:36,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've been in an ongoing discussion with the Curtis Tufts School about implementing what that may look like on the same campus at the very least.

212
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:45,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a place where we might put that about the way we envision having that therapeutic program also implemented in the same building?

213
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:45,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

214
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:50,219
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great suggestion.

215
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Do that.

216
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:06,733
[SPEAKER_04]: We can come back to this too if we get to the end and think like, oh, there's something else we should be adding.

217
00:22:06,874 --> 00:22:07,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

218
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:11,673
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to speak now or forever hold your peace.

219
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:24,898
[SPEAKER_04]: The next section is our project objectives under that we're thinking about and they did provide a list of things that we might want to put in here.

220
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:29,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of broadly accepted that list.

221
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just reordered them, so identification of community concerns that may impact study options.

222
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:42,650
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think we want to be very upfront that we care about the community input of this process.

223
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:53,299
[SPEAKER_04]: The Northeast collaborative for high performing schools and or the US Green Building Council leads for school certification system.

224
00:22:55,128 --> 00:23:00,933
[SPEAKER_04]: The life cycle costs of operating the school as it relates to future operational budgets, of course, that's very important.

225
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:04,636
[SPEAKER_04]: A CM at risk delivery method.

226
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:08,840
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think that is a growing trend in school buildings.

227
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:15,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And given the uncertainty in the environment, we probably definitely want our CMs on board sooner than later.

228
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:23,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And then planning to ensure learning continuity for all students and particularly for our vocational programs.

229
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,984
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that is 1 of those things that feels very unique to us in other schools.

230
00:23:29,064 --> 00:23:33,468
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need to display students, you have the option of temporary trailers.

231
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:34,389
[SPEAKER_04]: You have many options.

232
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:41,555
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't you can't put the culinary program in a temporary trailer and think that they're going to be able to continue their education.

233
00:23:41,615 --> 00:23:41,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

234
00:23:42,315 --> 00:23:45,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think we have some particular things there.

235
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Vetting potential alternate sites.

236
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:57,930
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have identified a handful of alternate site potentials, and we would want to make sure we're doing our due diligence about that.

237
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:06,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I did add in site adjustments required to increase the number of egresses from the property if the new project remains

238
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:26,503
[SPEAKER_04]: in place, meaning if Medford High is going to continue to be at 489 Winthrop Street, um, I think one thing that we've talked about is, um, the need for an additional egress and how very complicated that actually is given its where it sits and how it's situated.

239
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:30,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I thought that might be a good thing to call out here.

240
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:33,768
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like something special that we should be

241
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:38,501
[SPEAKER_04]: making people aware of as they think about their, their bid responses to us.

242
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:46,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anybody come up with anything else that we might want to add?

243
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we can come back if anybody is inspired.

244
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:18,413
[SPEAKER_04]: All the rest of this is all very, very standard until we get to evaluation criteria.

245
00:25:19,473 --> 00:25:29,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we are required to do is be transparent about how we will rate and evaluate our bids.

246
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:35,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And the list here was broadly provided by the template.

247
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:41,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see that the changes here are really my starting place of points.

248
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:50,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And then really the only thing I added was like this piece about knowledge and experience with the CM at-risk procurement methodology.

249
00:25:51,310 --> 00:26:04,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so before I, like, go through all of these top to bottom, I actually worked sort of from the bottom up and I. Generally assigned 10 points to the thing that I feel like.

250
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,819
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sort of compulsory, so, um.

251
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:15,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly down here, like, um, identifying the current projected workload for projects that are substantial.

252
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:17,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Familiar with, um.

253
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:36,226
[SPEAKER_04]: the LEED certifications and demonstrated experience, knowledge of the purpose and practices of the services of building commissioning consultants, the CM knowledge of procurement law.

254
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:39,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the ones that I felt like, okay,

255
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:45,045
[SPEAKER_04]: You sort of aren't in this game if you don't know those things.

256
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:50,470
[SPEAKER_04]: So I sort of gave that like a compulsory level 10 points.

257
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:56,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there, I said, okay, what are the things that sort of escalate and are, but are still like.

258
00:26:57,057 --> 00:27:00,239
[SPEAKER_04]: what I would consider to be sort of table stakes, right?

259
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:11,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So things like knowledge and demonstrated experience with life cycle cost analysis and cost estimating with actual examples of how they've done this in various communities.

260
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:20,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And the CM at risk felt like something that was a little bit less everybody does this.

261
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:23,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So that felt like something that might warrant

262
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:44,353
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 points, as well as, um, a little bit of increased emphasis on, um, state building code, particularly around the ADA, because I think we have, um, a lot of energy and need to make sure that our buildings, um, are compliant and serve students, um, with all kinds of abilities.

263
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:48,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was sort of my 20 point bracket as it were.

264
00:27:50,595 --> 00:27:55,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was like a 30 point bracket, which was really capacity and skills.

265
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:10,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So talk to us about how many people you have and how they would be involved in our project, the management approach and the kinds of things that they're thinking about.

266
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:15,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was one more 30 point.

267
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:17,736
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

268
00:28:17,816 --> 00:28:18,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there was a 40 point.

269
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:22,077
[SPEAKER_04]: bracket around key personnel.

270
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:24,639
[SPEAKER_04]: So who are these people that are going to work with us every day?

271
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:32,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And are they people that are a good fit for us with their experience and their approach to school buildings?

272
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:48,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And then 50 points being allocated to past performance and the kinds of projects that they've worked on that align with what we're looking to do.

273
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:56,964
[SPEAKER_04]: That all tallies up to 270 points, which is why we have such an odd scale.

274
00:28:57,504 --> 00:29:08,227
[SPEAKER_04]: But I felt like it was easier to keep the points section normalized and bracketed like that than it was to try to get to 100 points.

275
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:14,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then we'd be awarding 12 points and 17 points and on and on.

276
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,231
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I go back to the top.

277
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:30,056
[SPEAKER_04]: happy for you all to tell me that's the craziest thing you've ever tried to make sense of this list.

278
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:38,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was nice to have a starting list from the MSBA to say, this is what we, you know, these are the kinds of things we should be looking at.

279
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so with the exception of the CM at risk, the list really didn't change.

280
00:29:44,022 --> 00:29:49,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I was just curious if anybody has any thoughts or feedback on like the points allocation here.

281
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:11,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I will fill these X's and Y's in.

282
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:28,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once we complete that process of reviewing the

283
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:40,713
[SPEAKER_04]: respondents, we then create a short list essentially of the highest scoring firms.

284
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:48,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we would then sort of start over with the ranking and talk about

285
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:51,527
[SPEAKER_04]: How we plan to do that.

286
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:56,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually was surprised they didn't have anything super specific about this.

287
00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:03,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So I basically said at this point, we're going to talk about the quality of 3 reference checks.

288
00:31:05,954 --> 00:31:11,616
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality of the finalist presentation and the value presented in the cost proposal.

289
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:19,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So, not to say it's going to be the lowest bid, but the best value bid, all things considered.

290
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:23,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So this, I felt like it was a little easier to like, tally to 100 points.

291
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And welcome any additions to this list.

292
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:36,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham, I just have a quick question that perhaps Fiona or Bob could answer.

293
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:58,437
[SPEAKER_07]: When we talk about value presented in the bidder's cost proposal, is this something that will open the cost proposal in line with the bid, or is this something that, as I know happens in other situations, you rank, you make your selection, and then you open that one cost proposal?

294
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:07,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So great question, Peter, as we're dealing with HVAC.

295
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:15,917
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, you would, we would want to, I think it's a great point system, Jenny.

296
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:22,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, there doesn't need to be an even number, but, you know, you need to know what your overall number is.

297
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:29,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to rank our, you know, our proposers.

298
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:31,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we definitely want to,

299
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:56,882
[SPEAKER_02]: put emphasis on the interviews, because I think that's where you're going to see that vendor, you know, and that's where you want to focus on your analogy and summary, and then we open the price proposal piece of it.

300
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:07,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Sienna, are you saying that the cost proposal cannot be a factor in our finalist selection?

301
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So it depends.

302
00:33:11,478 --> 00:33:19,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And this may be a little different than what I'm used to as far as an RFP process or a request for qualifications as well.

303
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:24,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not 100% familiar with the CM at risk.

304
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:29,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually taking a class next month, and we're actually dealing with that with an HVAC project.

305
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:45,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cost is important, but it's not necessarily the factor that determines your end result.

306
00:33:51,523 --> 00:34:03,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, so I just changed it a little bit to say that the final 20 points is based on the value presented in the bidder's technical response and the cost proposal.

307
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to me, it's a package deal, right?

308
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:10,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if Paul wants to charge $10 and he's going to give us

309
00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:22,709
[SPEAKER_04]: 2 widgets and Aaron is going to charge us 20 dollars and in fact, we assess that the very same 2 widgets are available, like.

310
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:27,511
[SPEAKER_04]: The value conversation sort of shifts to cost, but if.

311
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:30,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul's widgets and Aaron's widgets aren't the same.

312
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:41,936
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to make a value decision about which widget we want and how then the cost lines up with those choices.

313
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:52,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, in a finalist situation, you would want to be thinking about cost at least on some level, but in a value context.

314
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So does that change of wording make it

315
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:59,277
[SPEAKER_04]: okay from a procurement perspective, Fiona?

316
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:11,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to like really look at that more deeply, to be honest with you, but I think highlighting it and sharing it, I can look into that more.

317
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:12,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

318
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:13,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

319
00:35:13,991 --> 00:35:14,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

320
00:35:16,373 --> 00:35:19,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will put this for you to take a look at.

321
00:35:20,196 --> 00:35:20,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

322
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:46,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is, I think, a super important conversation about this because, I mean, not to poo-poo Medford High School, but, you know, we could get somebody who wants to just take everything out of the box, you know, doesn't actually want to do anything new or interesting, and

323
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:55,412
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's just like a road activity for them, then of course this should cost less, right?

324
00:35:56,913 --> 00:36:03,137
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that cost of course matters, but what are we getting?

325
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:19,528
[SPEAKER_06]: is really the, it's not, I mean, if the only thing we actually think is even reasonably affordable is this out of the box kind of like cookie cutter thing, then, you know, that's our decision.

326
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:31,392
[SPEAKER_06]: But we don't wanna be tied to the fact that a cookie cutter approach might in fact be half the price, I mean, or whatever, so.

327
00:36:32,862 --> 00:36:33,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I like this conversation.

328
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:51,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I think figuring out how to get this so that we have the freedom to do this the way we want rather than just, you know, we're not buying, we're not, we're not asking like for bids to buy 10 of some widget that you can get on Amazon.

329
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:57,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I guess my thinking was that, um,

330
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:08,859
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, if I were doing this evaluation, that would be the last, you know, we, that would be the last thing we would do.

331
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:17,341
[SPEAKER_04]: We would, you know, open those, those cost bids at the, after the presentations are done and after the scoring is complete for the reference checks.

332
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:24,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that would be like the final way for us to say, okay, where do my points go now?

333
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what, what am I willing to,

334
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:30,132
[SPEAKER_04]: assigned based on the bigger picture, right?

335
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:32,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was my thoughts.

336
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:38,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So Fiona, I will send you a copy of this so you can just take a look at that and confirm that that works.

337
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:56,061
[SPEAKER_04]: My thoughts on next steps are to bring this to the building committee on Monday the 24th and get their, you know, get their agreement and their feedback, obviously, because we have lots of talented, qualified people in the mix.

338
00:37:58,356 --> 00:38:06,222
[SPEAKER_04]: At our larger committee, so we would want to get their input and then we'll be ready to send this to the pretty quickly.

339
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:10,886
[SPEAKER_04]: And to get their feedback.

340
00:38:13,308 --> 00:38:20,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this next section.

341
00:38:22,395 --> 00:38:23,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Gets a little bit wacky.

342
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,782
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to outline our selection process.

343
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:34,144
[SPEAKER_04]: And.

344
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:39,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Include as a documentation of rankings.

345
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:46,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I believe we have basically done at this point.

346
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:53,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should be good there we will.

347
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,050
[SPEAKER_04]: have to fill some of this out.

348
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the OPM selection committee.

349
00:38:59,851 --> 00:39:07,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will talk through this process that we will identify and describe the interview process.

350
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:16,035
[SPEAKER_04]: And the committee's basis of ranking after the interviews, we will outline how the owner plans to negotiate the fee.

351
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:23,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are things that we have to do in this process, as well as if I scroll down,

352
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And we may want to include provisions to re advertise if we get not enough.

353
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:42,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Responses, so this, I didn't actually make that much progress filling out, but would welcome any thoughts or comments on this section.

354
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:02,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not sure what the statute requirements are on that section.

355
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:08,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, as it relates to, you know, this type of project, so, um.

356
00:40:10,078 --> 00:40:14,820
[SPEAKER_02]: You can highlight that maybe Jenny and I can take a look at that section as well.

357
00:40:19,261 --> 00:40:26,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it does talk about the identify reviewers must rank their responses based on the weighted evaluation criteria.

358
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:31,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and must shortlist our minimum of 3 responses.

359
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't really have choices there.

360
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:34,017
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a requirement.

361
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:42,022
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have to describe our interview process and we'll talk about the dates in just a 2nd.

362
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:43,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but.

363
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:48,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing this is a place where we might want to say, like, we will invite.

364
00:40:51,907 --> 00:41:01,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, we, you know, we may say, like, we'll invite shortlisted respondents to a meeting that is not to exceed a certain amount of time.

365
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:09,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that meeting, they'll be invited to provide an overview of their proposal and in advance of that meeting.

366
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:18,482
[SPEAKER_04]: We may provide them a list of questions to, um, to respond to that are specific to the details of their proposal.

367
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could do something like that.

368
00:41:21,244 --> 00:41:27,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know if you have typical language that you use for something like that, or if anybody has any suggestions or thoughts.

369
00:41:28,428 --> 00:41:37,694
[SPEAKER_04]: That, um, about the time, you know, what is an appropriate amount of time for such a finalist meeting to be.

370
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:52,482
[SPEAKER_07]: we have spent for the HVAC OPM and CM interviews, I believe, well, I know because somewhere yesterday, but about an hour and a half to two hours for each interview.

371
00:41:54,503 --> 00:41:54,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

372
00:41:56,704 --> 00:41:58,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, go ahead, Fiona.

373
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:10,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, and to Peter's point, I just know what the HVAC project, so the requirement is to receive a minimum of X amount of bids or proposals.

374
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:14,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's three off the top of my head for the CM at risk.

375
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:23,478
[SPEAKER_02]: But as long as you receive the minimum of three, you don't necessarily have to interview those three.

376
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:25,780
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be a minimum of two.

377
00:42:27,521 --> 00:42:31,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the requirement is just receiving at least three.

378
00:42:31,544 --> 00:42:40,492
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I said I'm not sure how or what that language, the requirement needs to be.

379
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:45,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So the MSBA requires that we talk to three people.

380
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:46,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It does?

381
00:42:46,685 --> 00:42:47,345
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.

382
00:42:47,385 --> 00:42:48,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we have to shortlist three.

383
00:42:49,007 --> 00:43:02,843
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so to Peter's point, we had a list of four, and then we did two interviews, about two hours each.

384
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:35,813
[SPEAKER_07]: And so everyone's also aware, you know, those are those are the visiting team will bring a full team of individuals, you know, upwards of 10 or more people have been on those interviews presenting by the companies.

385
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:36,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

386
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:59,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so what I am saying here is no longer than 2 hours in length, um, and the interview will include an opportunity for the better to present an overview of their proposal and a chance to answer questions that we provide to them at least 48 hours in advance.

387
00:44:00,335 --> 00:44:05,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone have any other thoughts about what that bullet might need to say?

388
00:44:18,149 --> 00:44:25,275
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one says outline how the owner plans to negotiate the fee and what documentation the owner will require.

389
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:31,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I was curious, Fiona, if you had any input on what that might mean.

390
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:39,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not 100% sure what exactly that means and what that language should look like.

391
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:47,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can mark that maybe for me to look at, Jenny?

392
00:44:50,096 --> 00:45:02,921
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, because I do know that the language in the CM at risk we just did for the HVAC had some specific language that actually we are re-looking at.

393
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:06,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if you could highlight that for me.

394
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,563
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't for the CM at risk, it's for the OPM.

395
00:45:11,484 --> 00:45:13,145
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I understand that.

396
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:18,630
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to make sure that I'm looking at the OPM that we hired for the CM at risk.

397
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:26,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just know the CM at risk language was, we really narrowed in looking at that language yesterday.

398
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:31,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to make sure that we're accurate with that language that is for this.

399
00:45:31,761 --> 00:45:32,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

400
00:45:32,622 --> 00:45:32,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

401
00:45:35,796 --> 00:45:54,805
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did change this to a requirement saying that we reserve the right to re-advertise if less than three responses are received or to re-advertise if fee negotiations fail.

402
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:01,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

403
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:05,190
[SPEAKER_04]: If we move on to the timeline,

404
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:18,169
[SPEAKER_04]: What I did, I actually sent some questions to our contact to just get a little bit more context about this review cycle.

405
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,691
[SPEAKER_04]: So this timeline.

406
00:46:22,735 --> 00:46:23,876
[SPEAKER_04]: anchors to two things.

407
00:46:24,256 --> 00:46:29,260
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that we're like ready to post this the day after we get the go-ahead to do so.

408
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,401
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is still very much a TBD.

409
00:46:32,182 --> 00:46:41,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing this anchors to is the scheduled OPM review panel meeting that happens in early April.

410
00:46:44,162 --> 00:46:51,818
[SPEAKER_04]: They happen on a monthly basis, so pending information from our contact about the.

411
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,865
[SPEAKER_04]: The review timeline up front, and then the.

412
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:01,310
[SPEAKER_04]: the process to be at an OPM review panel meeting.

413
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:05,373
[SPEAKER_04]: We may need to slide this whole thing in one direction or another.

414
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:08,114
[SPEAKER_04]: But my goal is that we're ready to go.

415
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:19,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think as you look at this timeline, I would think about it in terms of its proximity one step to the next, knowing that the whole thing could slide out.

416
00:47:21,023 --> 00:47:23,024
[SPEAKER_04]: based on some input from MSBA.

417
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:30,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So it wouldn't happen faster than this or sooner than this, but it could happen later than this and sort of we would slide the whole thing accordingly.

418
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:41,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Having said that, 2-27 would be the date that we push this in the central register, as well as a newspaper, et cetera.

419
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:49,048
[SPEAKER_04]: We would hold an informational meeting and site inspection on 3-6, which is about a week later.

420
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:55,590
[SPEAKER_04]: The following day, we would have it be the last day for questions from respondents.

421
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:07,816
[SPEAKER_04]: The following week we would have responses due so that does give bidders like two full weeks to put their responses together and my understanding is that's pretty typical.

422
00:48:09,537 --> 00:48:15,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Then by the following week we would have done our work to identify who the shortlisted participants are.

423
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:19,242
[SPEAKER_04]: A week after that within the next week we would

424
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:25,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Interview our shortlist respondents and we'll publish the 2 dates where we would plan to do that.

425
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:30,318
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll sort of block time for whoever the committee is in order to be able to do that.

426
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:36,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we would begin negotiations immediately filing, which is like the Monday.

427
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:39,683
[SPEAKER_04]: We would let MSBA know on.

428
00:48:39,703 --> 00:48:43,865
[SPEAKER_04]: 41 and then by 47, we're ready to talk to the.

429
00:48:45,038 --> 00:48:51,340
[SPEAKER_04]: OPM review panel and with an expectation that we'd finish the contract by the end of April.

430
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that feel terrifying?

431
00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:57,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Jenny, I'll jump in.

432
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:03,823
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my area of experience.

433
00:49:05,423 --> 00:49:12,145
[SPEAKER_02]: We could work with this schedule, but just minor, minor logistics and details.

434
00:49:13,027 --> 00:49:28,961
[SPEAKER_02]: An advertised date in the central register of 227 automatically makes me look at my calendar and you need to realize there's lead times when the advertising date is due and then the availability is due.

435
00:49:29,582 --> 00:49:33,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So those automatically get pushed out about six or seven days.

436
00:49:34,286 --> 00:49:40,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as far as the informational meeting and site inspection, that gets pushed out a little bit because of the,

437
00:49:40,862 --> 00:49:44,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Advertise date in the center register in the local paper and the minimum requirements.

438
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:50,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you want to share that timeline with me, I can edit that.

439
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:53,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And be mindful of other people's time right now.

440
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I could edit that to reflect some true timeframes.

441
00:49:56,832 --> 00:50:08,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and in order to do that, Fiona, I think what you're saying is there is no chance for us to be at the review panel meeting on the 7th of April.

442
00:50:10,244 --> 00:50:11,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're saying?

443
00:50:11,945 --> 00:50:19,851
[SPEAKER_02]: If I look at a quick calendar, it's not.

444
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:25,976
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just on my phone looking at a quick calendar, it's not.

445
00:50:25,996 --> 00:50:32,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to probably estimate to push that out about a week or so.

446
00:50:34,814 --> 00:50:41,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, because those review panel meetings are fixed meetings, like, they are on a calendar that it's not ours.

447
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:51,226
[SPEAKER_04]: So 2 things I can send you this timeline and we can make those adjustments and I can also seek some guidance from MSBA about.

448
00:50:53,088 --> 00:50:55,750
[SPEAKER_04]: The lead time required and and.

449
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether, um.

450
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:05,179
[SPEAKER_04]: We do need to, in fact, slide this out, or if there's some other way they would ground this for communities that are ready to go.

451
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:06,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

452
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:19,601
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I could probably talk about that offline because, you know, when you talk about a two 27 appears in the center register, that puts a two 19 deadline date that it has to be submitted and that's next week.

453
00:51:20,221 --> 00:51:20,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

454
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:23,662
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're ready, you know, I'm not opposed to it.

455
00:51:23,882 --> 00:51:24,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly not.

456
00:51:25,302 --> 00:51:29,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I love the aggressive timeline, but I'm just saying logistically,

457
00:51:30,032 --> 00:51:31,072
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be realistic.

458
00:51:32,153 --> 00:51:34,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

459
00:51:35,974 --> 00:51:40,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it sounds like we do have to shift everything out maybe by 1 week.

460
00:51:42,197 --> 00:51:47,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the only question then, and maybe you and I can look at the timeline and figure out.

461
00:51:47,959 --> 00:51:48,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if.

462
00:51:50,258 --> 00:51:56,043
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a possibility for us to make this selection more quickly, like what would that entail?

463
00:51:57,504 --> 00:52:07,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me get some answers to that from our contact, and then I will circle up with you about what that looks like.

464
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:16,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think we have to determine whether we're going to add folks to the selection committee or not.

465
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:26,808
[SPEAKER_04]: But then we also will need to block the dates and times for the meetings that we'll have to have to do these reviews.

466
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:41,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Fiona, since this is all subject to the open meeting law, our meetings are open to the public.

467
00:52:44,395 --> 00:53:06,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess my question is, how do we protect, I guess, various bidders from their competitors sitting through these conversations?

468
00:53:07,332 --> 00:53:08,933
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that done, typically?

469
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:12,790
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

470
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:13,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question.

471
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:23,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So the RFP process is a unique process that, you know, is subject to the statute.

472
00:53:24,213 --> 00:53:34,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I'm not 100% sure how to answer that as far as, you know, public input.

473
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:37,737
[SPEAKER_02]: The evaluation committee is

474
00:53:40,823 --> 00:53:47,007
[SPEAKER_02]: is a committee that's established before any evaluations are done.

475
00:53:48,028 --> 00:54:07,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and the RFP process, you know, doesn't, typically under certain statute or certain sections of the statute, it doesn't require us to have any public input or,

476
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:16,631
[SPEAKER_02]: public information access, I guess is the better word.

477
00:54:17,231 --> 00:54:23,352
[SPEAKER_02]: But depending on the statute and how it's done, there may be certain things that are required.

478
00:54:23,932 --> 00:54:26,353
[SPEAKER_02]: We are required to share with the public.

479
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:34,574
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure how this process works, but I can certainly look into that.

480
00:54:34,594 --> 00:54:36,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

481
00:54:36,895 --> 00:54:37,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

482
00:54:38,631 --> 00:54:44,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am wondering though if the in the executive session exceptions.

483
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:52,505
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is specifically to consider the purchase exchange release of real property.

484
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just wondering if that doesn't provide an exemption.

485
00:55:00,322 --> 00:55:12,367
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the other things I'm noticing here is that when we do a search for a new superintendent in the early phases, those are not open to the public.

486
00:55:12,947 --> 00:55:18,670
[SPEAKER_06]: And this feels very much like that kind of scenario where

487
00:55:20,102 --> 00:55:24,325
[SPEAKER_06]: it being open to the public would be detrimental to our position.

488
00:55:25,306 --> 00:55:26,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

489
00:55:27,007 --> 00:55:35,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is, you know, outside of the area that I typically think about when I think about executive sessions.

490
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:39,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'd have to give advice, but doing it in public would be terrible.

491
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:41,558
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

492
00:55:41,799 --> 00:55:46,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And the real property disposition of real property is totally different.

493
00:55:46,502 --> 00:55:48,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, um,

494
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:50,648
[SPEAKER_02]: falls under a different statute.

495
00:55:50,728 --> 00:55:56,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So that actually does require us to provide the information to the public.

496
00:55:56,256 --> 00:55:59,541
[SPEAKER_02]: But under this, it may be different.

497
00:56:01,395 --> 00:56:17,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I think the central thing that may be different in this procurement is that the procurement is being done by a body that is subject to the open meeting law, which is completely different than how a typical, like, procurement in the city would work.

498
00:56:17,644 --> 00:56:17,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

499
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:20,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, certainly there's public records, but.

500
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:25,728
[SPEAKER_04]: You all don't work under the open meeting law in the same way that.

501
00:56:26,529 --> 00:56:36,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, we do on the school committee, or this body does so I can seek some clarification from MSBA about that as well in terms of, like, how do all of these things fit together?

502
00:56:36,213 --> 00:56:39,134
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will see what I can come up with there too.

503
00:56:39,454 --> 00:56:40,515
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very interesting.

504
00:56:40,535 --> 00:56:42,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

505
00:56:43,996 --> 00:56:48,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then the rest of this.

506
00:56:49,879 --> 00:56:52,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, is.

507
00:56:54,733 --> 00:56:58,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of filling in some of the same information that has been held elsewhere.

508
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,667
[SPEAKER_04]: We are requiring hard copy.

509
00:57:01,727 --> 00:57:02,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll need to.

510
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:06,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Determine how big the committee is, so we can make sure we get enough copies.

511
00:57:07,827 --> 00:57:22,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if I keep going, there's a section here that says, the owner shall list any and all certifications here that the respondent will be required to submit as attachment D required certifications.

512
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:27,511
[SPEAKER_04]: The owner should consult with its legal counsel to determine what certifications may be required.

513
00:57:27,671 --> 00:57:37,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Fiona, I didn't know if this was a question for Howard or a question for you in terms of what certifications we may be requiring people to provide.

514
00:57:37,673 --> 00:57:40,794
[SPEAKER_02]: At the yes, so I would put that as both.

515
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:46,596
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something that typically procurement would check with legal.

516
00:57:48,017 --> 00:57:49,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I can do that.

517
00:57:49,277 --> 00:57:54,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, and if we keep going.

518
00:57:58,127 --> 00:58:04,049
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this is very typical and then we get to the end and there's a series of attachments here.

519
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:07,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll need to provide all of these documents.

520
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:21,794
[SPEAKER_04]: What I did add to it is our educational profile and our Chapter 74 viability program, because we worked really hard on those documents and describing what we thought the educational programming should be here in Medford that is driving our

521
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:25,861
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, thoughts around this building.

522
00:58:26,021 --> 00:58:30,943
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, those things will need to be, um, attached as well.

523
00:58:31,023 --> 00:58:33,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and those documents exist, so that's not a problem.

524
00:58:33,763 --> 00:58:33,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

525
00:58:35,444 --> 00:58:45,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and everything else is, um, boilerplate attachment for the bidders to fill out.

526
00:58:48,307 --> 00:58:52,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and yeah, that's it.

527
00:58:57,777 --> 00:59:02,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions, thoughts, places you want to go back to?

528
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:32,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there are maybe two things left to do.

529
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:47,028
[SPEAKER_04]: One might be a motion to bring this for a final input with its amendments to the full committee.

530
00:59:48,509 --> 00:59:52,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other might be to recommend to the committee

531
00:59:55,529 --> 01:00:01,512
[SPEAKER_04]: an expansion of this team of voting members, which right now stands at Dr. Cushing, Aaron and myself.

532
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:13,219
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, those are the 2 things sort of on my mind that we may want to do in terms of votes tonight so that we can be prepared to bring those back to the committee on the 24th.

533
01:00:13,259 --> 01:00:15,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Thoughts about that?

534
01:00:18,249 --> 01:00:24,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, did you have an idea about the amount of people you wanted to bring in as voting members?

535
01:00:25,034 --> 01:00:29,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Or did you want to see how people felt about increasing the number and go from there?

536
01:00:31,438 --> 01:00:36,602
[SPEAKER_04]: What my main feeling was that maybe it shouldn't be just the three of us making this decision.

537
01:00:38,023 --> 01:00:43,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But I hadn't really, you know, an odd number seems prudent.

538
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:51,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hadn't really thought about it or the makeup of those additional folks any further.

539
01:00:53,637 --> 01:00:55,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So totally open to suggestions.

540
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:06,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Memogram, one thing I would say is it is a significant time commitment.

541
01:01:08,007 --> 01:01:17,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So rather than, I think, for us to say the specific makeup, I definitely have people in certain job types that I think would be really tremendous additions.

542
01:01:18,515 --> 01:01:29,463
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, it is a tremendous time commitment to be able to, one, review the technical proposals, score the technical proposals, and then participate in the interviews and discuss.

543
01:01:31,609 --> 01:01:49,062
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it all depends on how many people on how many organizations submit, but each one having gone through it on the HVAC side for OPM and CM to review the proposals and participate in usually takes between four and five hours.

544
01:01:51,104 --> 01:01:52,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to be fully transparent.

545
01:01:53,566 --> 01:01:53,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

546
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:04,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with Peter, it is time consuming, but I would suggest, as you mentioned, an odd number.

547
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:09,270
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would suggest almost increasing that from 3 to at least 5.

548
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:14,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Is adding to make sense.

549
01:02:21,414 --> 01:02:22,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just think for a 2nd.

550
01:02:22,214 --> 01:02:22,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

551
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:29,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say a minimum of two, possibly as many as four.

552
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:40,707
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just because it's really great to hear what people have to say around the table as you're going through the interviews and reviewing them.

553
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:46,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I may have seen, another person may have missed or what I may have missed, another person may have seen.

554
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:53,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's really tremendous value from that collaborative approach, especially on something as important as this project.

555
01:02:54,941 --> 01:02:57,223
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, definitely a minimum of two, but.

556
01:03:04,007 --> 01:03:05,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would agree.

557
01:03:05,508 --> 01:03:07,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I think at least two.

558
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,551
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, I believe, 15 voting members.

559
01:03:10,132 --> 01:03:20,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't find that it'll be difficult to find other members who would both be willing and excited about the opportunity, but also have some consideration that might be outside of our perspectives thus far.

560
01:03:22,335 --> 01:03:34,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's probably best to go back to the larger group and let them also hear this and see what people's perspectives are, because I think the time commitment seems like a large one.

561
01:03:34,504 --> 01:03:36,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So see how people feel about that as well.

562
01:03:39,228 --> 01:03:50,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it make sense to entertain a motion to recommend increasing the size of the OPM selection committee from three to five to the full committee, and then

563
01:03:51,422 --> 01:03:58,145
[SPEAKER_04]: That will give us sort of an opening for the committee to think about that and make those appointments.

564
01:04:01,506 --> 01:04:07,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I will make that motion of increasing the committee from two to five.

565
01:04:08,569 --> 01:04:09,209
[SPEAKER_04]: From three to five.

566
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:11,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Three to five, sorry, my apologies.

567
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So motion by Dr. Cushing, seconded by?

568
01:04:14,411 --> 01:04:14,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

569
01:04:15,132 --> 01:04:15,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

570
01:04:19,703 --> 01:04:46,568
[SPEAKER_04]: roll call jenny graham yes dr cushing yes um aaron lapati yes green the affirmative zero on the negative motion passes so we'll bring that back to the committee to try to increase the party here just a little bit um and um i think the other question is is there a motion to

571
01:04:48,246 --> 01:04:52,850
[SPEAKER_04]: bring this adjusted RFS to the full committee for input.

572
01:04:56,053 --> 01:04:56,713
[SPEAKER_05]: A motion for that.

573
01:04:58,314 --> 01:04:58,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I will second that.

574
01:04:59,655 --> 01:05:02,378
[SPEAKER_04]: By Aaron, seconded by Dr. Cushing.

575
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:05,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny Graham, yes.

576
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Aaron Olapade.

577
01:05:07,782 --> 01:05:08,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

578
01:05:09,143 --> 01:05:09,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dr. Cushing.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

580
01:05:12,546 --> 01:05:14,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Three in the affirmative, zero negative, motion passes.

581
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:24,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I think if I'm going to flip back quickly to our agenda.

582
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:41,904
[SPEAKER_04]: We have talked about the key elements of Module 2, we have reviewed and edited the drafted RFS, and we have also discussed the vetting and selection process during our review.

583
01:05:42,224 --> 01:05:44,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the only thing left to do is adjourn.

584
01:05:45,385 --> 01:05:46,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

585
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:49,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

586
01:05:50,107 --> 01:05:50,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I will second.

587
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn by Aaron, seconded by Dr. Cushing.

588
01:05:54,378 --> 01:05:56,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Aaron?

589
01:05:57,646 --> 01:05:57,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

590
01:05:58,689 --> 01:05:59,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter?

591
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:00,013
