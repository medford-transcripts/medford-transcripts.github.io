56
01:02:08,668 --> 01:02:21,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Despite all of the great things going on in Medford schools, I unfortunately must open my remarks tonight by expressing sadness and grief over this past weekend's mass shooting in Buffalo.

57
01:02:23,422 --> 01:02:37,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Now designated a hate crime, the tragic killing of 11 and wounding of two at the supermarket reminds us all that racism and gun violence are scourges facing our nation.

58
01:02:40,812 --> 01:02:51,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Targeting a supermarket in a predominantly black neighborhood, the gunman replicated tragic acts that have become far too familiar to all of us.

59
01:02:52,652 --> 01:03:00,139
[SPEAKER_13]: I know teachers and Councilors are working hard with our students to deal with the emotional trauma caused by this terrible event.

60
01:03:01,881 --> 01:03:12,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Although our nation aspires to goals of equity and inclusion, events such as this remind us of so much that has to be done.

61
01:03:14,603 --> 01:03:26,108
[SPEAKER_13]: The students and staff of Medford Public Schools are striving to achieve these goals on a daily basis and are committed to eliminating discrimination of all kinds in our society.

62
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:35,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I kindly request a moment of silence for those viciously lost in Buffalo.

63
01:03:38,052 --> 01:03:39,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

64
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:56,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

65
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:07,919
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to share some updates from what's going on in the district and definitely take a more positive note.

66
01:04:10,921 --> 01:04:25,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Earlier this morning, I'd like to thank the mayor for coming to the high school to support our Italian students who have achieved great accomplishments

67
01:04:26,232 --> 01:04:28,133
[SPEAKER_13]: in studying the Italian language.

68
01:04:28,713 --> 01:04:37,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank the Italian consulate for coming to the high school today and members of the consulate that were presenting awards to our students.

69
01:04:37,896 --> 01:04:41,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Riccadeli, who was there, and all of the world language teachers.

70
01:04:42,217 --> 01:04:48,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Many of our seniors were recognized for the great work that they did with Dante's Inferno.

71
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:55,462
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was a poster that showed the level of work that the students worked on collaboratively.

72
01:04:56,362 --> 01:04:59,466
[SPEAKER_13]: And in speaking with one of the representatives.

73
01:05:00,687 --> 01:05:05,652
[SPEAKER_13]: He talked about the vocabulary and just the great level of work that our students did.

74
01:05:06,272 --> 01:05:18,185
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I just want to congratulate them and congratulate language teachers for the outstanding instruction in Italian for our students that achieved very very high.

75
01:05:18,805 --> 01:05:21,267
[SPEAKER_13]: levels of accomplishment, language accomplishment.

76
01:05:21,627 --> 01:05:27,032

77

81
01:05:58,569 --> 01:06:04,411
[SPEAKER_13]: This year, the Andrews was recognized as one of the top 10 middle school entries in the competition.

82
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:10,833
[SPEAKER_13]: At the end of this week, the students will be notified if they are the grand prize winner.

83
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,953
[SPEAKER_13]: They are already winners to us.

84
01:06:14,754 --> 01:06:15,854

01:14:01,412 --> 01:14:03,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent, for the comments.

144
01:14:03,233 --> 01:14:04,935
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to mention at the

145
01:14:05,573 --> 01:14:29,705
[SPEAKER_10]: CCSR project exposition today, Representative Donato was there as well, but I just wanted to highlight a couple of the projects that the students are doing, because I just do think that for folks who are listening or online, CCSR is the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, and this is a group organization across the middle schools and high schools where students volunteer and they create community-based projects.

146
01:14:30,525 --> 01:14:39,308
[SPEAKER_10]: being there today just, you know, it was so inspiring and gives me so much hope for our students and for our district to see what CCSR does and what the students bring to the table.

147
01:14:39,328 --> 01:14:48,130
[SPEAKER_10]: There was an English language give back project where students help with interpretation for families who are English learners.

148
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:52,091
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a veterans recognition where they're sharing stories of veterans from the war.

149
01:14:52,171 --> 01:14:57,693
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a stand with Ukraine where the students raised, I think, thousands of dollars to support

150
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:12,890
[SPEAKER_10]: folks in Ukraine, the Mystic River Cleanup, Seeds to Feed, Seeds to Feed, they built a garden with food in the quad at the school and they brought the food, the produce to one of the food pantries.

151
01:15:13,851 --> 01:15:24,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Period Poverty, where they're helping other students who experience period poverty, the CCSR Memorial Garden to recognize those in our community who have passed during COVID.

152
01:15:24,883 --> 01:15:46,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So much of it was just so inspiring and I just think that our students and Rich Trotter and Michael Skorka and all of the folks at CCSR that do this work should be just lauded for all of this and for the community members for next year when this happens, encourage community members to come and see these projects and see the students that are working on them because they are really inspiring and something that I think can bring us all further together.

153
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

154
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,863
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to just echo the sentiments of member McLaughlin and our superintendent.

155
01:15:52,908 --> 01:16:08,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. trotter is just a huge advocate for the program and Mr. squawker is inspirational and such a role model for our students and he was there today, along with two representatives from the cummings foundation which could make makes this possible $100,000 was given.

156
01:16:10,344 --> 01:16:13,406
[SPEAKER_09]: to CCSR from the Cummings Foundation, so we wanna thank them.

157
01:16:13,806 --> 01:16:20,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I loved seeing the projects and all great things for our community, and we just hope this continues to eternity.

158
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:21,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, member Hays.

159
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:24,591
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to add that it's also at the elementary schools.

160
01:16:24,711 --> 01:16:25,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thanks.

161
01:16:27,572 --> 01:16:28,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, thank you.

162
01:16:29,553 --> 01:16:38,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up, we have presentation on professional development for administrators, Dr. Carmen Williams, HGSE superintendent resident.

163
01:16:39,335 --> 01:16:41,276
[SPEAKER_09]: And a congratulations, I believe, is in order.

164
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:42,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

165
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:49,220
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe you can explain what the congratulations is about.

166
01:16:49,721 --> 01:16:53,403
[SPEAKER_13]: So Dr. Williams, I am proud to call her Dr. Williams.

167
01:16:53,503 --> 01:17:06,270
[SPEAKER_13]: She successfully defended and completed her Harvard Graduate School of Education doctoral program in ed leadership and school administration.

168
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:29,364
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that was a great accomplishment, and what Dr. Williams is about to present right now is the body of work that was also part of her dissertation but the body of work that she did working with our administrators, this school year, and that work is going to continue.

169
01:17:29,964 --> 01:17:33,407
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I don't want to steal any of her thunder.

170
01:17:33,848 --> 01:17:39,993
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to be able to present the body of work that she did this year, and the work that is going to continue.

171
01:17:40,253 --> 01:17:41,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Williams.

172
01:17:41,254 --> 01:17:42,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope.

173
01:17:42,635 --> 01:17:46,058
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

174
01:17:46,438 --> 01:17:47,339
[SPEAKER_08]: There we are.

175
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:48,120
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

176
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

177
01:17:50,782 --> 01:17:53,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor and committee members.

178
01:17:53,864 --> 01:17:54,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I am.

179
01:17:55,101 --> 01:18:02,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Back, I was with you in the fall and I'm here to share what I've learned and what I've been able to do in my time here at Medford.

180
01:18:03,466 --> 01:18:16,593
[SPEAKER_08]: But before I do, I really want to thank the team who definitely welcomed me with open arms, allowed me an opportunity to learn and grow and practice leadership with you all.

181
01:18:16,933 --> 01:18:18,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't take that for granted.

182
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:24,017
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a huge leap of faith and trust to invite a resident for a year.

183
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:26,144
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was a privilege.

184
01:18:26,184 --> 01:18:26,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

185
01:18:26,724 --> 01:18:34,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I am going to try to summarize my work with by sharing some highlights.

186
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:36,490
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to go back to July.

187
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:53,480
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I entered the district in July, I did a round of entry interviews, I had a complete plan to learn the context of the district, learn the needs and and most importantly, determine how I could best support you all.

188
01:18:54,539 --> 01:18:56,640
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as my own personal growth as a leader.

189
01:18:57,301 --> 01:19:07,586
[SPEAKER_08]: So in those interviews, I've summarized here what people responded to when I asked, what is your vision for success in the district?

190
01:19:08,847 --> 01:19:16,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked a variety of stakeholders from parents, school committee members, leaders, and teachers, and I summarized the statements here.

191
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:18,572
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really wanna highlight just a few things.

192
01:19:20,453 --> 01:19:20,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one,

193
01:19:21,349 --> 01:19:24,232
[SPEAKER_08]: We were coming out of an unprecedented year.

194
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:27,695
[SPEAKER_08]: We had just completed a year of remote and hybrid learning.

195
01:19:28,535 --> 01:19:35,121
[SPEAKER_08]: And while folks had been working very diligently, they had been working in isolation.

196
01:19:36,182 --> 01:19:43,108
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the priorities of operations had gotten in the way of collaboration and being able to work together around instruction.

197
01:19:43,629 --> 01:19:48,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I feel like that definitely influenced the interviews at that time.

198
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:58,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So this idea that folks want to clarify roles and responsibilities and expectations in the wake of a pandemic makes absolute sense to me.

199
01:19:59,973 --> 01:20:02,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Begin with the end in mind and have a narrow focus.

200
01:20:03,535 --> 01:20:08,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Increase collaboration and communication, and definitely use data to support our students.

201
01:20:09,658 --> 01:20:14,921
[SPEAKER_08]: All of these things, including a team culture, were pretty important to the majority of folks that I spoke with.

202
01:20:16,062 --> 01:20:18,463
[SPEAKER_08]: When I asked about the barriers to success,

203
01:20:20,174 --> 01:20:21,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, not surprising.

204
01:20:22,135 --> 01:20:30,121
[SPEAKER_08]: So though communication had been increased around operations, there was still a desire to get more frequent and timely communication.

205
01:20:31,683 --> 01:20:39,629
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a gap, a seemingly growing gap in the ability for folks to change at the same pace.

206
01:20:39,829 --> 01:20:47,075
[SPEAKER_08]: And so typically that meant that there wasn't enough information or relational trust, or there was some kind of gap in understanding

207
01:20:47,748 --> 01:20:51,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And that led to fatigue, confusion, and frustration.

208
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:59,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Though there were many who had the passion and the drive, a clear direction was needed.

209
01:21:01,234 --> 01:21:10,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Folks spoke about silos and how that got in the way, past practice often got in the way of doing work together and doing it more efficiently.

210
01:21:10,969 --> 01:21:19,756
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a desire to be more explicit with accountability systems for the purpose of growth, not more oversight, but more support.

211
01:21:21,518 --> 01:21:24,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And definitely a need to communicate priorities.

212
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:29,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, context matters.

213
01:21:30,247 --> 01:21:42,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the district had recently, and some of these prior to the pandemic, adopted quite a few initiatives because there was an understanding of this mission to serve all students equitably.

214
01:21:43,413 --> 01:21:50,716
[SPEAKER_08]: And to do that, our folks on the ground, our teachers and leaders needed more professional development, more coaching, and more support.

215
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:56,473
[SPEAKER_08]: scientific and research programs also became a part of that.

216
01:21:56,614 --> 01:22:05,339
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you've heard all year about the science of reading in our NWEA map assessment adoption and how important that will be for the future of the district.

217
01:22:05,899 --> 01:22:08,041
[SPEAKER_08]: But now it was time to put all these pieces together.

218
01:22:09,762 --> 01:22:15,825
[SPEAKER_08]: So I shared in the fall four main goals for how I would work with the leaders of Medford.

219
01:22:15,985 --> 01:22:20,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I say leaders, I'm including the superintendent, the assistant superintendents,

220
01:22:20,964 --> 01:22:25,866
[SPEAKER_08]: the curriculum directors and coordinators, our building principals and assistant principals.

221
01:22:26,706 --> 01:22:35,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't read all of these to you because this is a review, but all of these goals were a direct response of the entry interview process.

222
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:47,935
[SPEAKER_08]: So after all of that data collection, I did some additional research from experts in the field looking at both theory and practice, and

223
01:22:48,487 --> 01:22:52,811
[SPEAKER_08]: this symbolizes my theory of action within the district.

224
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:58,135
[SPEAKER_08]: My goal was to create virtuous cycles of professional development.

225
01:22:58,575 --> 01:23:08,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you all are familiar with a vicious cycle and how harmful and often you feel trapped, feel like you're not going anywhere.

226
01:23:08,523 --> 01:23:17,090
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we wanted to create virtuous cycles of improvement through professional development that helped us change and shift

227
01:23:17,406 --> 01:23:19,127
[SPEAKER_08]: are being and doing together.

228
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:40,375
[SPEAKER_08]: So the parts of this include developing a shared vision, building identity and capacity to do the work, committing to an implementation strategy that can then be monitored and assessed for learning, and then creating space for introspection and debriefing.

229
01:23:40,842 --> 01:23:50,105
[SPEAKER_08]: so that we can really study our practice, not just student outcomes, but the how of the work and continually move towards improvement.

230
01:23:53,085 --> 01:23:56,967
[SPEAKER_08]: This table gives you a glimpse into what our monthly meetings look like.

231
01:23:57,327 --> 01:24:05,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I met with administrators for about two hours, once a month, and I incorporated multiple activities.

232
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:08,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we wanted to create these virtuous cycles.

233
01:24:10,688 --> 01:24:23,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Often these protocols or activities were repeated over and over again so that we can not only practice our doing but change our being and believing as far as how we are approaching the work.

234
01:24:24,038 --> 01:24:38,831
[SPEAKER_08]: So opportunities to reflect through journaling, build our identities through peer coaching, and understanding a protocol that is aligned to values, the values of empathy, equity, and collaboration.

235
01:24:39,817 --> 01:24:44,081
[SPEAKER_08]: We had opportunities for teaming through check-ins and sense-making sessions.

236
01:24:44,721 --> 01:25:04,437
[SPEAKER_08]: So creating trust by being vulnerable with how we're seeing data and what we can do with it, and then data analysis protocols that gave us time to pause and really think about what are we seeing, get curious about what we're seeing, and be empowered by the fact that we are the levers of change.

237
01:25:05,858 --> 01:25:12,921
[SPEAKER_08]: All of our meetings, again, took on this same pattern to create virtuous cycles and practice.

238
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:22,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So, at the end of every monthly meeting, I know the leaders love this, I gave them a feedback form and I asked them two questions.

239
01:25:23,626 --> 01:25:26,048
[SPEAKER_08]: What was a plus or a benefit of our meeting?

240
01:25:26,148 --> 01:25:27,148
[SPEAKER_08]: What did we do well?

241
01:25:27,668 --> 01:25:30,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And what was a delta, something that we might do differently?

242
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:35,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And I collected this particular data from the month of September

243
01:25:35,583 --> 01:25:39,044
[SPEAKER_08]: through December, I've coded the responses.

244
01:25:39,084 --> 01:25:54,547
[SPEAKER_08]: They were open-ended responses to the questions, but I coded them so you can have an opportunity to see what are the priorities that came up for leaders after participating in these meetings, and then a sample response so you could try to understand their thinking.

245
01:25:55,067 --> 01:26:02,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when it came to the activities or protocols that were definitely established to build this collaborative adult learning community,

246
01:26:03,514 --> 01:26:20,347
[SPEAKER_08]: We have responses like different activities focus talk with colleagues clarity of purpose of the meeting felt like a manageable amount of work for things that they would like to do differently would like to break into grade level groups to data dive with our individual school.

247
01:26:21,983 --> 01:26:26,306
[SPEAKER_08]: For collaboration, if you look at this one, it says, I enjoy the time to work with peers.

248
01:26:26,486 --> 01:26:30,729
[SPEAKER_08]: It helps for us to understand that we are not alone in our struggles.

249
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:39,896
[SPEAKER_08]: This helps me personally with moving beyond operational aspects of the job and looking at the leadership role I aspire to be.

250
01:26:40,937 --> 01:26:49,163
[SPEAKER_08]: For Deltas, the request was more, a lot of more, more opportunities with content, with data, with discussion groups.

251
01:26:50,631 --> 01:27:10,710
[SPEAKER_08]: requests for time, and so all in all, I found that the activities and protocols and the frequency helped leaders deepen their value for working together and collecting and assessing analyzing data as well.

252
01:27:12,907 --> 01:27:17,390
[SPEAKER_08]: when I asked them individually in January, how are you doing with this?

253
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:23,754
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a sample or a data chart that shows responses.

254
01:27:24,474 --> 01:27:39,563
[SPEAKER_08]: And so 75% of leaders agreed or strongly agreed that they are an active participant in our collaborative learning community, that they appreciate their colleagues' contributions and that they believe that their contributions are valued.

255
01:27:41,287 --> 01:27:43,168
[SPEAKER_08]: 75% agreeing or strongly agreeing.

256
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:52,273
[SPEAKER_08]: For this question, I can confidently facilitate conversations using data to assess and adjust for continuous improvement as an instructional leader.

257
01:27:52,914 --> 01:27:57,797
[SPEAKER_08]: We had, I'm sorry, the last one was 80% and now this one is 75%.

258
01:28:00,258 --> 01:28:09,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, strongly agree or agree that in January, we're moving in this direction and leaders can confidently carry this out.

259
01:28:12,702 --> 01:28:24,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And this question, I can confidently coach others in their self-selected goals using the conversation guide practice in our professional development sessions, 75% agreeing or strongly agreeing in January.

260
01:28:25,368 --> 01:28:28,089
[SPEAKER_08]: And I say that because this was a work in progress.

261
01:28:28,990 --> 01:28:38,854
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, we had just adopted NWEA MAP as an assessment and leaders were in the process of learning how to administer the assessment

262
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:44,136
[SPEAKER_08]: learning how to read reports and then communicate those reports with their staff and families.

263
01:28:44,796 --> 01:28:46,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And so all of this was a work in progress.

264
01:28:50,518 --> 01:29:02,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Through my research, I looked at Michael Fullen and Quinn's coherence framework, the right drivers in action for schools, districts, and systems.

265
01:29:03,221 --> 01:29:07,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And he talks about there are a lot of wrong drivers that build coherence

266
01:29:10,115 --> 01:29:22,778
[SPEAKER_08]: public education have used such as high stakes assessments and mandatory professional developments, often these things cost frustration and cause leaders to feel overwhelmed.

267
01:29:23,219 --> 01:29:30,740
[SPEAKER_08]: But these drivers actually support districts in building coherence and actually achieving their shared goals.

268
01:29:31,281 --> 01:29:36,502
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to share how the work I did in Medford aligns to this coherence framework.

269
01:29:37,087 --> 01:29:42,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And then again, you're gonna see that all of this plays into the virtuous cycle.

270
01:29:44,191 --> 01:29:47,012
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the first one, focus direction.

271
01:29:47,873 --> 01:29:58,058
[SPEAKER_08]: It was important to have a purpose driven points or plan, and that's where the entry interviews came in to help clarify my work.

272
01:29:59,258 --> 01:30:06,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Goals that impact and needed to be important to the stakeholders that were involved, clarity of strategy and change leadership.

273
01:30:07,147 --> 01:30:18,983
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the things that we were able to do by collecting feedback on a regular basis, we were able to maintain that we were all still committed to the goals of the sessions.

274
01:30:20,284 --> 01:30:22,587
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were able to also learn by doing.

275
01:30:23,008 --> 01:30:25,171
[SPEAKER_08]: So the same activities that

276
01:30:25,758 --> 01:30:36,461
[SPEAKER_08]: leaders participated in my monthly meetings, they were asked to go to their buildings or departments and practice those same protocols with the staff that they supervise.

277
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:50,424
[SPEAKER_08]: So overall, I feel like this was a strength in our work and that the routines and rituals of returning to this moral imperative gave leaders opportunities to own their work in a deeper way.

278
01:30:50,964 --> 01:30:53,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, data is the name of this story.

279
01:30:56,258 --> 01:31:01,743
[SPEAKER_08]: helps convince people that we're moving in the right direction when they can actually see it and make sense of it.

280
01:31:03,565 --> 01:31:06,628
[SPEAKER_08]: The second piece is cultivating collaborative cultures.

281
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:14,116
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a desire for the leaders to come together, work more collaboratively, and yet still have their own identity.

282
01:31:14,696 --> 01:31:19,361
[SPEAKER_08]: And so in building this cultural growth and adult learning space,

283
01:31:20,157 --> 01:31:21,018
[SPEAKER_08]: We did quite a bit.

284
01:31:21,098 --> 01:31:26,322
[SPEAKER_08]: We used storytelling through artifacts, something that hadn't been done yet.

285
01:31:26,382 --> 01:31:40,072
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I asked leaders to bring in just an artifact from their scope of work, whether that be a meeting agenda or a letter home to parents, something that represented who they were as an instructional leader.

286
01:31:40,433 --> 01:31:45,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had the opportunity to tell their story and the impact it had on their communities.

287
01:31:46,316 --> 01:32:05,512
[SPEAKER_08]: We made sense of data using three protocols in large and small groups, and I also introduced a coaching protocol to support leaders in having very intentional coaching conversations, which are very different from mentor conversations or friend conversations, very intentional to support growth.

288
01:32:06,413 --> 01:32:11,077
[SPEAKER_08]: All in all, I believe that we had great success with these protocols.

289
01:32:11,788 --> 01:32:17,952
[SPEAKER_08]: We are definitely taking steps towards a more collaborative community, though there's always work to be done.

290
01:32:19,073 --> 01:32:23,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that had a lot to do with this idea of a community of practice.

291
01:32:24,196 --> 01:32:37,425
[SPEAKER_08]: When you bring a community together with a specific goal in mind or task, and you have opportunities for regular practice, again, that virtuous cycle, it tends to help you go further together.

292
01:32:39,435 --> 01:32:42,056
[SPEAKER_08]: The third framework piece is deepening learning.

293
01:32:42,976 --> 01:33:06,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And while we had all kinds of opportunities to co-create professional development through that feedback survey, demonstrate vulnerability by learning alongside and experiment with the protocols, I think all of this gave the psychologically safe space for leaders to pilot and practice

294
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:10,548
[SPEAKER_08]: and understand their learning along the way.

295
01:33:12,889 --> 01:33:15,631
[SPEAKER_08]: We definitely made gains.

296
01:33:15,811 --> 01:33:23,856
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I think more time is needed for true mastery, identity and creativity to occur.

297
01:33:24,436 --> 01:33:29,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the definition of deeper learning according to John Mehta and Sarah Fine.

298
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:33,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, sorry about that.

299
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:42,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And the final one, securing accountability.

300
01:33:42,561 --> 01:33:48,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So internal and external accountability is important if you want to sustain this work.

301
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:55,624
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you know, I was a resident here for 10 months and my time is coming to an end or has come to an end.

302
01:33:56,225 --> 01:34:01,566
[SPEAKER_08]: But I believe the groundwork has been laid for securing accountability with these practices.

303
01:34:02,126 --> 01:34:05,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And so developing the rituals and the repetition will definitely help

304
01:34:06,443 --> 01:34:13,645
[SPEAKER_08]: having all leaders of the organization participate and have a shared language and understanding of the goals was helpful.

305
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:21,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, the district had just adopted the strategic plan in May of 2021.

306
01:34:21,287 --> 01:34:28,348
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fresh and keeping that as a North Star is definitely going to support accountability along the way.

307
01:34:29,328 --> 01:34:35,450
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing that I do wish could happen for the organization is coaching

308
01:34:36,008 --> 01:34:38,730
[SPEAKER_08]: for the top leaders of the organization.

309
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:53,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And so in my research, I found that when organizations commit to symmetrical structures, those structures that are repeated or reflected across the organization, that internal accountability is stronger.

310
01:34:53,298 --> 01:35:04,825
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if we value relationship building in the classroom between teachers and students, and we value a mentoring and coaching relationship between leaders and teachers,

311
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:11,234
[SPEAKER_08]: We want central office staff to be strong mentors and models for the leaders.

312
01:35:11,594 --> 01:35:22,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Then that means that the top of our organizational chart has to be provided with that same psychologically safe space to learn and grow and practice their craft.

313
01:35:23,903 --> 01:35:25,965
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is my recommendation.

314
01:35:25,985 --> 01:35:33,230
[SPEAKER_08]: And this chart just illustrates how the protocols either affirm or support internal.

315
01:35:34,101 --> 01:35:41,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Accountability measures and then some of the external accountability supports that the district also has.

316
01:35:43,364 --> 01:35:51,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving quickly, so where are we now, how do we maintain this work, keep it sustainable and ensure accountability moving forward.

317
01:35:52,424 --> 01:35:57,627
[SPEAKER_08]: My last meeting with the leaders, I worked with them on an action plan for next year.

318
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:01,570
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just a screenshot of what was started.

319
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:05,572
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the strategic plan is the guide for this work.

320
01:36:06,312 --> 01:36:10,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just one of the goals that they came up with, the leaders collectively.

321
01:36:10,995 --> 01:36:16,559
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a goal to provide clear and accurate information regarding data collection, analysis, and usage.

322
01:36:17,339 --> 01:36:18,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And we thought about

323
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:19,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's the audience?

324
01:36:20,431 --> 01:36:23,452
[SPEAKER_08]: If the message needs to be clear and accurate, who's the audience?

325
01:36:23,993 --> 01:36:28,975
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we cater our messaging to meet the needs of the different stakeholders and audiences?

326
01:36:29,496 --> 01:36:32,117
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the media supports that we would need to do that?

327
01:36:32,597 --> 01:36:33,818
[SPEAKER_08]: And who would be responsible?

328
01:36:34,338 --> 01:36:36,499
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, this is a work in progress.

329
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:37,520
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a draft.

330
01:36:38,401 --> 01:36:45,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the leaders are planning to come back to it to continue working on the action plan in June, but this is their work.

331
01:36:45,524 --> 01:36:46,105
[SPEAKER_08]: They own it.

332
01:36:47,025 --> 01:36:49,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that takes us one step closer to sustainability.

333
01:36:51,626 --> 01:37:03,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, I charted out an outline of a data inquiry cycle process that leaders can participate in over the course of the 22-23 school year.

334
01:37:03,929 --> 01:37:15,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And so similar to a unit plan that a teacher would use, there's an objective, there's things to consider prior to, during, and after each meeting

335
01:37:15,638 --> 01:37:24,160
[SPEAKER_08]: in order to prepare data, analyze it collectively, and then make decisions based on that data for continuous improvement.

336
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:31,182
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is just a portion of how I've spent my time in Medford.

337
01:37:31,282 --> 01:37:32,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned a lot.

338
01:37:32,282 --> 01:37:36,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had the opportunity to work with several individuals and groups and stakeholders.

339
01:37:37,836 --> 01:37:47,560
[SPEAKER_08]: But as I presented earlier this fall, this was the majority of my work, the strategic project and the work I defended for Harvard.

340
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:54,482
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will end with asking if there are any questions I can answer or comments you would like to share.

341
01:37:55,484 --> 01:37:56,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dr. Williams.

342
01:37:56,604 --> 01:37:58,085
[SPEAKER_09]: We've loved having you.

343
01:37:58,105 --> 01:37:59,645
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been a great addition to the team.

344
01:37:59,705 --> 01:38:09,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Dr. Musa, Edouard-Vincent, and all the admin, really, we're so thankful for all the work you did for us over the last year and great job on defending.

345
01:38:09,609 --> 01:38:10,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Harvard.

346
01:38:11,249 --> 01:38:11,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

347
01:38:11,769 --> 01:38:12,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Impressive.

348
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:13,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

349
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:15,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

350
01:38:15,411 --> 01:38:16,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

351
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:18,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Williams.

352
01:38:18,387 --> 01:38:19,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

353
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:20,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

354
01:38:20,248 --> 01:38:31,274
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wonderful that we have this excellent partnership with Harvard and we're getting the best of their leaders to come and help Medford identify problems of practice and theories of solutions.

355
01:38:31,374 --> 01:38:34,215
[SPEAKER_10]: And you've been really such a value added to our system.

356
01:38:34,235 --> 01:38:35,076
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you so much.

357
01:38:35,116 --> 01:38:36,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait to see what you do next.

358
01:38:36,997 --> 01:38:40,559
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope that you'll keep in touch with us and we can see your growth as well as ours.

359
01:38:40,939 --> 01:38:41,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

360
01:38:41,879 --> 01:38:42,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

361
01:38:44,561 --> 01:38:45,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

362
01:38:46,122 --> 01:38:46,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

363
01:38:46,902 --> 01:38:47,503
Sorry, thank you.

364
01:38:48,905 --> 01:38:54,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Number three, we have report on the Credit for Life event held on May 6, 2022 at Medford High School.

365
01:38:54,534 --> 01:38:57,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Bernadette Riccidelli, Director of Curriculum and Instruction.

366
01:39:00,784 --> 01:39:01,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

367
01:39:03,492 --> 01:39:12,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee and Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, I would like to ask Lisa evangelistic to join me.

368
01:39:13,201 --> 01:39:16,444
[SPEAKER_06]: We were a three person team, and I, I certainly.

369
01:39:17,905 --> 01:39:19,947
[SPEAKER_06]: want them to shine along.

370
01:39:20,388 --> 01:39:25,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Gail Trainor, former assistant principal at Medford High School, was the third person of our team.

371
01:39:26,275 --> 01:39:30,940
[SPEAKER_06]: She recently retired and she really was an incredible asset to our group.

372
01:39:31,621 --> 01:39:37,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Financial literacy is what she taught when she was a teacher, so we really capitalized on her expertise.

373
01:39:38,842 --> 01:39:49,752
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you probably know, or you may remember, we began this program back in 2018 when we got a grant from the state treasurer's office.

374
01:39:50,712 --> 01:40:01,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did the fair in 2018, we did it again in 2019, we began planning for the 19-20 school year, and obviously we could not hold it in 2020 and in 2021.

375
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:10,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So the money that we received in 2020, we were able to push forward and use this year.

376
01:40:10,246 --> 01:40:12,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So we use that $2,500 to run the fair in part.

377
01:40:12,189 --> 01:40:15,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So moving on here, the fair occurred

378
01:40:22,637 --> 01:40:27,919
[SPEAKER_06]: The fair occurred on Friday, May 6, and the gym at Medford High School.

379
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:31,260
[SPEAKER_06]: We extended it to all grade 12 students.

380
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,181
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not mandatory.

381
01:40:33,201 --> 01:40:34,121
[SPEAKER_06]: It was voluntary.

382
01:40:34,181 --> 01:40:35,101
[SPEAKER_06]: About 237 students did participate.

383
01:40:38,428 --> 01:40:47,895
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that I'm really proud of, in addition to the student participation, which I'll get to a little bit more in depth, was the relationships that we've developed with many of the community members.

384
01:40:48,675 --> 01:40:57,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And Lisa had a lead role as our public relations specialist in the district in reaching out to those members.

385
01:40:57,721 --> 01:41:03,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So Lisa, did you wanna mention or talk about any of the volunteers?

386
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:06,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you did a lot of the outreach to them.

387
01:41:07,818 --> 01:41:24,751
[SPEAKER_07]: was a little different this year some of them had some coven issues in the sense they were nervous about being in an area, which is why we put it in the gym but I do have to say that our sustainers were.

388
01:41:26,718 --> 01:41:28,040
[SPEAKER_07]: with us since 2018.

389
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

390
01:41:31,323 --> 01:41:32,544
[SPEAKER_07]: So Brookline Bank.

391
01:41:33,766 --> 01:41:38,491
[SPEAKER_07]: East Cambridge Savings Bank members plus credit union.

392
01:41:39,092 --> 01:41:39,672
[SPEAKER_07]: We had.

393
01:41:41,335 --> 01:41:51,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Our newer member of the Community Brocklin Trust who served through Bernadette, served as the lead sponsor because they provided the app.

394
01:41:51,601 --> 01:41:54,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Bernadette will explain why we went that route.

395
01:41:56,144 --> 01:41:59,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Goldilocks Bagels, obviously a community resource.

396
01:42:00,126 --> 01:42:04,609
[SPEAKER_07]: They provided the breakfast along with Wegmans, another huge community supporter.

397
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:08,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Armstrong Ambulance, they never say no.

398
01:42:09,532 --> 01:42:17,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Bates Insurance, Kelly Catalo from Cosmopolitan Real Estate.

399
01:42:17,937 --> 01:42:20,118
[SPEAKER_07]: They were all with us from the very beginning.

400
01:42:20,298 --> 01:42:29,804
[SPEAKER_07]: And this year, School Committee Vice Chair Jenny Graham joined us and sat at one of the tables regarding part-time jobs for the students.

401
01:42:29,884 --> 01:42:31,545
[SPEAKER_07]: And she really enjoyed herself.

402
01:42:31,765 --> 01:42:34,847
[SPEAKER_07]: And the students, I think, got a lot out of it.

403
01:42:35,007 --> 01:42:37,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was nice that we could have an in-person event.

404
01:42:37,846 --> 01:42:39,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really thank our community sponsors.

405
01:42:39,787 --> 01:42:42,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope I didn't miss anybody, but we can't do it without them.

406
01:42:43,029 --> 01:42:47,492
[SPEAKER_07]: The school department really, really can lean on them and they always come through for us.

407
01:42:47,532 --> 01:42:48,932
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you all very much.

408
01:42:50,693 --> 01:43:01,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the reasons why Rockland Trust played a really integral role in this year's fair is that, you know, as late as December, we weren't sure that we were going to be able to do the fair in person.

409
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:09,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Given the rising COVID numbers, we needed to be able to have some way of holding it remotely if we needed to.

410
01:43:10,034 --> 01:43:16,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Rockland Trust, along with the consortium of banks, developed an app, along with the support of the state treasurer's office.

411
01:43:17,318 --> 01:43:22,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the event that we needed to flip over to an online version, we would be able to do that.

412
01:43:23,061 --> 01:43:24,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was the first year we used the app.

413
01:43:24,841 --> 01:43:27,062
[SPEAKER_06]: There were some great aspects to it.

414
01:43:27,102 --> 01:43:29,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were things that I think

415
01:43:30,861 --> 01:43:32,462
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, could be improved upon.

416
01:43:32,482 --> 01:43:43,491
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we've gone through this once, and I think as we move forward, if we do this again, which hopefully we can, we will definitely use the app to its best and enhance it with

417
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:47,185
[SPEAKER_06]: with some supports.

418
01:43:47,205 --> 01:43:49,787
[SPEAKER_06]: So this event, probably should have started off with this.

419
01:43:49,827 --> 01:43:54,130
[SPEAKER_06]: This event is a real life opportunity for students to make decisions.

420
01:43:54,630 --> 01:44:06,758
[SPEAKER_06]: So learning is about making decisions, going into those scenarios, being faced with having a budget, staying within that budget, having a salary, making decisions.

421
01:44:06,818 --> 01:44:09,000
[SPEAKER_06]: How much can they spend on housing?

422
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:10,781
[SPEAKER_06]: What can they spend on insurance?

423
01:44:11,241 --> 01:44:13,603
[SPEAKER_06]: What can they spend on different things that they wanna buy?

424
01:44:14,098 --> 01:44:21,770
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's about making decisions and the community volunteers that we had aided those students in making those decisions.

425
01:44:23,012 --> 01:44:26,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a lot of give and take between our volunteers and our students.

426
01:44:30,382 --> 01:44:38,650
[SPEAKER_06]: So in preparation for the fair, the students did engage in some modules during their advisory period in the weeks preceding the fair.

427
01:44:39,411 --> 01:44:44,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So they didn't come to the fair just, you know, with no background knowledge.

428
01:44:44,576 --> 01:44:47,799
[SPEAKER_06]: They had engaged in several of the modules.

429
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:53,966
[SPEAKER_06]: There were some modules that we just didn't get to, but I would say we covered the most significant ones.

430
01:44:55,430 --> 01:45:01,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So new this year to the fair we actually added a couple of things that I thought were kind of fun.

431
01:45:01,613 --> 01:45:04,354
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an interview table so Dr. Peter Cushing.

432
01:45:05,035 --> 01:45:14,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much so he and Neil Osborne who's the city's director of human resources were at the interview table and engage with students on basic

433
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:27,509
[SPEAKER_06]: handshake, interviewing skills, how you act with people in real life scenarios, making eye contact with your interviewer.

434
01:45:28,249 --> 01:45:32,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they even suggested that the students send thank you notes after an interview.

435
01:45:32,613 --> 01:45:35,495
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that was a nice added touch.

436
01:45:36,316 --> 01:45:43,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Something else that actually started as an idea from a CCSR project of a student that I was working with

437
01:45:44,928 --> 01:45:52,574
[SPEAKER_06]: He really wanted to increase the number of voters among the seniors, getting seniors to register to vote.

438
01:45:53,194 --> 01:46:01,280
[SPEAKER_06]: So his original plan didn't come to fruition, but what we were able to do was to get Sandy Gale from voter registration to come to the high schools.

439
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:02,841
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a voter registration table.

440
01:46:03,401 --> 01:46:08,625
[SPEAKER_06]: So it kind of, the civic piece enhanced the financial literacy piece.

441
01:46:13,455 --> 01:46:15,077
[SPEAKER_06]: just don't wanna miss anything.

442
01:46:16,518 --> 01:46:23,265
[SPEAKER_06]: The superintendent spoke to the students along with representative Paul Donato and Dr. Peter Cushing.

443
01:46:23,705 --> 01:46:28,230
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the interesting things, and this is something that I'm glad they walked away with.

444
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:36,418
[SPEAKER_06]: So when asked what they learned most, the overwhelming comment was that credit scores are really important.

445
01:46:36,878 --> 01:46:40,381
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think, you know, hopefully they learned, you know, more than that.

446
01:46:40,441 --> 01:46:41,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they did.

447
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:54,851
[SPEAKER_06]: But to walk away with that concept, that having a good credit score, you know, making sure you fill your obligations, that you can't spend wildly without any repercussions, if they walked away with that, I feel really good.

448
01:46:56,632 --> 01:47:01,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this point, I would be happy to entertain any questions or comments that you have.

449
01:47:02,036 --> 01:47:05,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for organizing the event and for the presentation.

450
01:47:06,195 --> 01:47:06,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

451
01:47:07,055 --> 01:47:08,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you for the presentation.

452
01:47:08,815 --> 01:47:11,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And you said there was 237.

453
01:47:12,616 --> 01:47:15,357
[SPEAKER_10]: And did you say from all classes or from the senior class?

454
01:47:15,377 --> 01:47:15,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Senior class.

455
01:47:16,017 --> 01:47:16,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Senior class, so that's good.

456
01:47:16,857 --> 01:47:17,677
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a good turnout.

457
01:47:18,257 --> 01:47:19,357
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was volunteer, you said?

458
01:47:20,458 --> 01:47:21,598
[SPEAKER_06]: It was volunteer.

459
01:47:22,078 --> 01:47:26,519
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we did this a couple of years ago, we had, I think the first year we did juniors and seniors.

460
01:47:27,619 --> 01:47:33,260
[SPEAKER_06]: We decided to stick with seniors this year because of the bandwidth.

461
01:47:34,224 --> 01:47:40,892
[SPEAKER_06]: We had, you know, technology set up specifically in the gym and we didn't think that we'd be able to handle more than 250 users.

462
01:47:46,436 --> 01:47:52,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I just want to say thank you for the credit for life and thank you to, again, all the volunteers and community partners.

463
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:55,661
[SPEAKER_13]: There is an excitement or energy.

464
01:47:55,861 --> 01:48:03,125
[SPEAKER_13]: I was surprised at how quickly the apps allowed the students to go through all of the stations.

465
01:48:03,905 --> 01:48:07,247
[SPEAKER_13]: But I am hoping, I think it's such a great learning activity.

466
01:48:07,407 --> 01:48:11,649
[SPEAKER_13]: And when the students did respond and say like, your credit score is everything.

467
01:48:11,709 --> 01:48:12,910
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said to them, yes.

468
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:16,492
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's not only just now, it's for the rest of your life.

469
01:48:17,153 --> 01:48:18,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Your credit score is very, very important.

470
01:48:19,415 --> 01:48:23,458
[SPEAKER_13]: So I felt like it was such a great aha learning moment for them.

471
01:48:23,478 --> 01:48:26,881
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope that we're able to continue doing the credit for life.

472
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:37,349
[SPEAKER_13]: And if possible, do it for juniors and seniors so they have the opportunity to do it junior year and then senior year before they go off to college or their careers.

473
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:42,052
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, I think, a great learning experience for our students.

474
01:48:42,353 --> 01:48:42,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

475
01:48:43,518 --> 01:48:43,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

476
01:48:44,339 --> 01:48:44,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

477
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:45,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Great job.

478
01:48:47,121 --> 01:48:55,568
[SPEAKER_09]: We have number four fiscal year 23 Medford public schools, operating budget update assistant superintendent of finance and operations, Mr. David Murphy.

479
01:48:58,975 --> 01:49:02,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mayor members of the school committee it's good to be with you again.

480
01:49:02,499 --> 01:49:15,035
[SPEAKER_00]: As the committee knows and for members of the community that have been following along this is our, our third substantive discussion related to the developing FY 23 budget.

481
01:49:16,557 --> 01:49:32,705
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some slides this evening, many of them are very familiar to based on that familiarity I'm going to try to move through them with efficiency, with the expectation that will be convening again in the coming weeks to ultimately move forward with the apply 23 budget request.

482
01:49:34,841 --> 01:49:35,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

483
01:49:35,843 --> 01:49:49,504
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just with respect to our objectives and I won't go through the entire statutory process that we've discussed in the previous budget meetings but for those looking for that context with regard to

484
01:49:50,385 --> 01:50:00,597
[SPEAKER_00]: The chapter 70 appropriation from the state that supports approximately 20% of our budget and the local contribution from the city of Medford that supports approximately 80% of our budget.

485
01:50:01,337 --> 01:50:06,143
[SPEAKER_00]: And just know that either our main ninth or may 10 budget meetings.

486
01:50:06,967 --> 01:50:14,050
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a somewhat detailed recitation of those and again happy to answer any questions for the committee but for purposes of efficiency.

487
01:50:14,070 --> 01:50:16,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to move past those quickly this evening.

488
01:50:17,512 --> 01:50:18,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the.

489
01:50:18,793 --> 01:50:20,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is our third discussion.

490
01:50:21,314 --> 01:50:27,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to pick up on a point that a couple of points that we were discussing at the end of our May 10 meeting, where we were talking about.

491
01:50:29,468 --> 01:50:42,090
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a couple of parallel facts, and I think it was in response to member Hays question related to the budgetary priorities that had been articulated through the budget surveys and the point that I was trying to make and I wanted to.

492
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:59,556
[SPEAKER_00]: reiterate tonight is that the budget development process is an attempt to balance transparency, where we articulate for the committee and to the community, the collection of budgetary priorities that we feel could benefit the organization.

493
01:51:00,136 --> 01:51:07,839
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, it is not a contest to see how high we can drive the number up that we ultimately request from the municipal government.

494
01:51:08,459 --> 01:51:26,987
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, because there is a long standing tradition and I think a good one of transparency in the budget process and the Medford public schools, we provide you a tremendous amount of information in response to survey data and ideas, not all of which frankly are Dr Christian we just zoom in on that just a little bit.

495
01:51:31,757 --> 01:51:39,824
[SPEAKER_00]: not every single idea that you're receiving with regard to the survey data is necessarily equally baked with regard to our goal of having coherency.

496
01:51:39,864 --> 01:51:59,940
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately what we're trying to drive toward and what we'll discuss a little bit about tonight is taking the committee's feedback so that we can present a goal, a recommendation rather from the superintendent to the committee that fits together and is a coordinated strategic and coherent budgetary request.

497
01:52:00,914 --> 01:52:21,814
[SPEAKER_00]: The other point that I, and there's some sub bullets there on the screen that I wanted to make is that as this budget process develops, our obligation is to continue to try to identify efficiencies and to look for areas of potential savings in the FY22 budget that can help us to sort of develop a budget that's within realistic expectations.

498
01:52:23,055 --> 01:52:25,818
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the same time, we're starting with a tremendous amount of information.

499
01:52:26,808 --> 01:52:33,293
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to identify for you why it is these are priorities and how they fit together in the context of our strategic plan.

500
01:52:33,953 --> 01:52:51,866
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are internally scrubbing these numbers on a daily basis to see if we can identify ways in which we can free up additional flexibility and or fit within the parameters, the budgetary boundaries that are ultimately established for us by the city and state governments.

501
01:52:53,794 --> 01:53:05,107
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to the objectives, and again this whole intro is so we can move through the slides faster I promise this is an attempt at efficiency, is that, first and foremost, our budget like everything we do here has to be focused on the well being of students.

502
01:53:05,527 --> 01:53:11,674
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can't connect the budgetary priority to a concrete way in which student outcomes will be approved, then that's a way in which we have

503
01:53:12,555 --> 01:53:15,257
[SPEAKER_00]: gauge the overall value of the implications of that budget.

504
01:53:15,737 --> 01:53:18,438
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be strategic in the sense that it has to fit together.

505
01:53:18,938 --> 01:53:24,041
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be responsible because again, it is not a contest to just see how far up we can push the number.

506
01:53:24,521 --> 01:53:29,144
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be ambitious because we have high ambitions for our students and for our school district.

507
01:53:29,664 --> 01:53:41,310
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we go through these numbers tonight, we're gonna go through the categories that you saw on May 9th and May 10th, identified in terms of what their budgetary impacts would be estimated to be right now.

508
01:53:42,208 --> 01:53:50,890
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would ask you to please remember that point that as we continue to look and to try to find efficiencies, it is possible some of those numbers might come down.

509
01:53:51,511 --> 01:53:53,351
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get to a few examples of that in a second.

510
01:53:53,371 --> 01:53:54,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

511
01:53:59,993 --> 01:54:00,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again.

512
01:54:03,714 --> 01:54:04,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

513
01:54:07,975 --> 01:54:11,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So a point that we, nope, you gotta go back, sorry.

514
01:54:12,322 --> 01:54:22,171
[SPEAKER_00]: A point that we can't emphasize enough with nine open collective bargaining agreements and 54 out of $67 million going toward personnel because those negotiations are ongoing.

515
01:54:22,571 --> 01:54:26,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Our budgetary numbers are very fluid and we have to keep in mind that context.

516
01:54:26,995 --> 01:54:27,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

517
01:54:30,138 --> 01:54:30,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

518
01:54:37,605 --> 01:54:37,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

519
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:39,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

520
01:54:40,401 --> 01:54:46,613
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mentioned right now so I fixed costs right now projected at 2.6 million I am hopeful.

521
01:54:47,386 --> 01:54:50,987
[SPEAKER_00]: that when we present before you again, that that number could be lower.

522
01:54:51,347 --> 01:55:05,190
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be significantly lower because we know already that some of these costs that are built in, we know that there's $1.3 million that are built in and contractual personnel costs that the district is already obligated to fulfill.

523
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:09,051
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there's a contractual increase in our primary bus vendor of $50,000.

524
01:55:09,371 --> 01:55:13,331
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an obligation that's preexisting that's going to be there in FY23.

525
01:55:13,371 --> 01:55:15,272
[SPEAKER_00]: We're estimating right now,

526
01:55:16,413 --> 01:55:23,730
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to special education fixed costs that's specialized transportation and tuitions, we're estimating that at $750,000.

527
01:55:26,789 --> 01:55:31,413
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that's another area that we look to on a daily basis to see how there could be some fluctuations there.

528
01:55:31,773 --> 01:55:41,802
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that it's a very modest decrease, but as we factored in the RICO agreement that I've mentioned previously, that fixed cost was able to fall from 155 to 135.

529
01:55:42,862 --> 01:55:47,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, $20,000 on a $2.6 million fixed cost increase is very modest.

530
01:55:49,048 --> 01:55:54,832
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that as we present later in the budget process, we might be able to identify greater savings.

531
01:55:55,233 --> 01:55:55,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

532
01:56:00,573 --> 01:56:09,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at these charts again, these are numbers that you've seen before, but I've mentioned before the $65 million represents our foundation budget.

533
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:19,389
[SPEAKER_00]: 67.4 is inclusive of our ARPA funding, our current operating budget in FY22, and then $70 million factors in those fixed costs that I mentioned a moment ago.

534
01:56:25,114 --> 01:56:25,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Again,

535
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:43,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for by way of transparency, the FY, the current operating budget for FY 22, as well as our projections that we've laid before you during this budget process for FY 23, both include a 2% cost of living increase.

536
01:56:44,026 --> 01:57:03,107
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've heard me say this parts of this before but there was a point in response to some questions that we received subsequent to our last budget meeting that I just wanted to emphasize the projected 2% cost of living increase which has not yet been implemented in FY 22, it is merely projected for FY 23 because of those ongoing negotiations that I mentioned a moment ago.

537
01:57:04,668 --> 01:57:19,976
[SPEAKER_00]: We are we base that off of the essentially the property tax limitation in the state of Massachusetts, and the, we know that anything over 2% the on the either in the municipal government or in the school department, we are taking on some degree of risk.

538
01:57:20,516 --> 01:57:43,233
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say that there's never been a cost of living increase in excess of 2%, but it's to say that we have to gauge anything above 2% against the risk of revenues not necessarily being there in succeeding years and the compounding financial impact that that has on wage scales in an organization that, as I said before, is driven primarily, as all school districts are, by personnel costs.

539
01:57:44,574 --> 01:57:44,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

540
01:57:46,215 --> 01:57:46,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

541
01:57:46,655 --> 01:57:48,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

542
01:57:50,662 --> 01:57:57,429
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we get to our priorities here again, you heard me say last week that this is not a strict hierarchy.

543
01:57:58,430 --> 01:58:12,464
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to priorities it's not the case that we would want not want to pursue anything in Category B before we fulfilled everything in Category A. There is a correlation with respect to priorities in terms of in descending order from A to F, but this is more about.

544
01:58:13,122 --> 01:58:17,388
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying how essentially how to pay for something.

545
01:58:17,528 --> 01:58:27,722
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is the significant variable in our current budget process as compared to pre coven is that we have a large injection of temporary funding.

546
01:58:28,941 --> 01:58:44,005
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of course about the opera funding that's helped sustain our operating budget and FY 22 on the school department side, it is the Esther budget estimated to be approximately $6.2 million over the course of the next three years that we can put toward eligible expenses.

547
01:58:44,825 --> 01:58:53,728
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally speaking in this analysis, it is the priorities listed in category B or category C that the administration

548
01:58:54,959 --> 01:59:00,242
[SPEAKER_00]: suggests is both eligible and it would be prudent to use the ESSER funding.

549
01:59:00,742 --> 01:59:14,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, the two sort of prongs for that analysis are a nexus between the investment and the impact of COVID-19 and the disruption caused to students, and whether or not the investment is of a temporary nature.

550
01:59:15,049 --> 01:59:20,292
[SPEAKER_00]: The third piece of that analysis though, we talked a lot about this in developing the FY22 budget,

551
01:59:21,608 --> 01:59:38,475
[SPEAKER_00]: is that if there is a urgency because of the impact of COVID-19, there are instances in which while we might prefer to recognize something as a recurring cost, we will use the ESSER funding to make sure that we address the immediate needs of students coming out of the pandemic.

552
01:59:40,016 --> 01:59:40,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

553
01:59:41,637 --> 01:59:41,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

554
01:59:43,893 --> 01:59:54,988
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, in response to questions from the committee last week, this, these slides will that I'll provide to you this evening, organize the priorities, based on category.

555
01:59:55,289 --> 01:59:57,051
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here that this is category A.

556
01:59:59,202 --> 02:00:03,825
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we've discussed these and the sort of underlying rationale behind them.

557
02:00:04,646 --> 02:00:12,372
[SPEAKER_00]: This amounts to less than a half million dollars, but these are the items that, well, frankly, we can make an argument that anything is related to COVID.

558
02:00:12,392 --> 02:00:25,401
[SPEAKER_00]: These priorities that really do transcend the specific challenges caused by the pandemic and are more about just making sure that we're instilling best practices and or capitalizing on other funding decisions.

559
02:00:25,782 --> 02:00:27,343
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, I mean that the math coaches

560
02:00:27,919 --> 02:00:44,926
[SPEAKER_00]: funding, one of the top priorities, coming into FY 23, not just because we believe the organization is now well situated to benefit from that personnel, but because in order to fully capitalize on the investment in the investigations three funding priority, we need to make sure that we have corresponding staff.

561
02:00:46,827 --> 02:00:47,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

562
02:00:48,302 --> 02:01:12,375
[SPEAKER_00]: So on category B, these are the items that, again, we get into that sort of strategic conundrum of identifying personnel that may be temporary and may be permanent, but what we know is that there's an urgency to it, and there's a specific correlation between, and perhaps even a causation, between the need for this personnel and the work that they'll do and the pandemic.

563
02:01:13,156 --> 02:01:13,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

564
02:01:15,167 --> 02:01:24,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Category C, these are generally one-time expenses that all things being equal, we would recommend that we do avail ourselves of the grant funding that is available.

565
02:01:28,009 --> 02:01:39,312
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have a few other specific pieces along the lines of the professional development initiatives that we discussed on May 10th that we still are working to identify specific cost associations.

566
02:01:40,092 --> 02:01:40,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And so,

567
02:01:41,698 --> 02:01:43,800
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that we will have more details on.

568
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:45,681
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move to the next one as well.

569
02:01:45,721 --> 02:01:46,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

570
02:01:46,041 --> 02:01:49,204
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have more information on that the next time that we meet.

571
02:01:50,705 --> 02:01:55,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I do not anticipate anything in category C being a recommended portion of the operating budget.

572
02:01:58,250 --> 02:01:59,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably some of the most difficult

573
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:03,901
[SPEAKER_00]: components of this, thanks, we can go to the next one.

574
02:02:05,282 --> 02:02:15,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Category D, I think is the one that is sort of the most challenging, frankly, because these are the priorities that we may well be situated to pursue right now.

575
02:02:16,989 --> 02:02:28,276
[SPEAKER_00]: But in looking at all the uncertainty around the collective bargaining component, and ultimately understanding that one way or another, we're going to have to fit the operating budget into certain financial boundaries.

576
02:02:29,997 --> 02:02:30,918
[SPEAKER_00]: These are priorities that,

577
02:02:32,218 --> 02:02:52,153
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that they should be discussed and there should be an awareness of the their implications for the organization, but they're ones that even more so than anything else we're talking about the administration is engaged in contingency planning, so that if in fact we don't have the capacity to address, we will have plans in place to make sure that students do not bear the brunt of that impact.

578
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:55,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

579
02:02:56,721 --> 02:03:03,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you that's just a continuation of D and then category is part of an extension of the exercise that the committee has been very clear with the administration.

580
02:03:04,643 --> 02:03:18,388
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a priority of you as the governing body is making sure that we're continuing to articulate priorities, even if there's a general awareness that it's not likely to fit into the capacity of this operating budget, but we want to make sure that the community is aware.

581
02:03:18,868 --> 02:03:22,670
[SPEAKER_00]: that in order to fully realize the goals of our strategic planning.

582
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:25,311
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that have to be considered at some point.

583
02:03:25,971 --> 02:03:28,893
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this is part of just keeping that conversation going.

584
02:03:28,973 --> 02:03:40,158
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also frankly an opportunity for the school committee as the governing body of the school system to inform the administration with respect to our priorities, so that we can make adjustments as necessary, either in terms of the categorization

585
02:03:40,918 --> 02:03:50,525
[SPEAKER_00]: of individual priorities or in capitalizing on flexibilities or efficiencies that are identified as part of that scrubbing process that I mentioned before.

586
02:03:51,366 --> 02:03:51,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

587
02:03:53,167 --> 02:04:00,733
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I committed on May 9th to returning to you with more information as it was developed and I told the committee on Friday.

588
02:04:01,562 --> 02:04:14,493
[SPEAKER_00]: in our update that right now, the school lunch program initiative that we understand is a top priority of this district and of the school committee right now.

589
02:04:15,474 --> 02:04:17,775
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is this this estimate of 600,000 to 1.1 million

590
02:04:20,277 --> 02:04:37,246
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, it's still a work in progress, and I would ask the committee's indulgence to return to you with more specificity in the coming weeks, understanding that, as I said on May 9, there is an unavoidable financial impact of having

591
02:04:38,663 --> 02:04:40,944
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the free lunch program at the local level.

592
02:04:41,405 --> 02:04:47,949
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that the administration completely concurs with the school committee on and something that it would be a tremendous value to our school communities.

593
02:04:48,469 --> 02:04:52,092
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that thankfully at the moment is part of the developing state budget.

594
02:04:52,512 --> 02:04:57,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hopeful that that will continue to be the case and that will be realized in FY23.

595
02:04:58,656 --> 02:05:05,180
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that it is of a scale and of a magnitude that I think would be better addressed at a state or federal level.

596
02:05:06,021 --> 02:05:20,602
[SPEAKER_00]: given the uncertainty of the financial implications at the local level so we're still in conversations, both with other districts and some of our outside experts that we consult on these types of issues and the hope that we can come up with.

597
02:05:21,163 --> 02:05:26,044
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially some more creative solutions to advance the well understood goal of the committee.

598
02:05:26,825 --> 02:05:50,651
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, if essentially if the free lunch program is not included in the state budget and Medford chooses to go forward in FY23, so the 22-23 school year, we would be looking at a sizable budgetary impact that it will be difficult given the full context of all the priorities we've been discussing here to address in a responsible fashion.

599
02:05:51,779 --> 02:05:56,300
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we go to the next slide, I will say that we're gonna be looking at the estimates of these categories.

600
02:05:56,921 --> 02:06:21,248
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna emphasize what I said before, as we continue to look at how we can identify potential efficiencies and savings, which is our responsibility, frankly, as a school administration, it is my hope that the overall budgetary impact can be lessened so that there are more goals that can be advanced, but all of that is qualified significantly by the uncertainty that comes with the open collective bargaining agreements.

601
02:06:22,005 --> 02:06:22,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

602
02:06:25,049 --> 02:06:25,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

603
02:06:25,369 --> 02:06:25,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

604
02:06:29,053 --> 02:06:34,099
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is what the budgetary impacts would be.

605
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:37,984
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if we were to pursue each of these categories, and.

606
02:06:39,882 --> 02:06:49,588
[SPEAKER_00]: It's presented to you like this, again, understanding that if the fixed cost increases are each lessened, then all of these budgetary impacts would see a corresponding reduction.

607
02:06:49,648 --> 02:06:56,432
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, we've sort of built this information so that you have the totality of the priorities that could be pursued.

608
02:06:57,013 --> 02:06:59,074
[SPEAKER_00]: You can provide us the feedback that we need.

609
02:07:00,014 --> 02:07:06,198
[SPEAKER_00]: We will then go continue to look for the efficiencies that potentially can lessen that overall budgetary impact.

610
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:13,122
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I wanted to point out, and I think there's just sort of a strategic question here that I'll defer to the committee.

611
02:07:13,602 --> 02:07:28,867
[SPEAKER_00]: In none of these options will you see category C. Category C, as I mentioned as we went through, is the items that, regardless of the strategic implications of it, we would recommend are included as part of the ESSER budget, not the operating budget.

612
02:07:30,267 --> 02:07:37,950
[SPEAKER_00]: So to submit those as part of, excuse me, as part of a request to the municipal government, I think could be confusing and sort of imprudent.

613
02:07:38,291 --> 02:07:39,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't recommend it.

614
02:07:40,351 --> 02:07:54,297
[SPEAKER_00]: The same could, but not necessarily needs to be said for category B. Because category B are the items that, well, if we lived in a perfect world, at least a perfect budgetary world,

615
02:07:56,153 --> 02:08:00,602
[SPEAKER_00]: they would be part of the operating budget and we would recommend that they be part of your request to the municipal government.

616
02:08:01,399 --> 02:08:27,353
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a world where we know that there are financial boundaries in which the municipal government has to operate, and where we think we have the ESSER funding that is both available and appropriate, it would seem prudent to potentially just plan for that to be part of our ESSER budget, as opposed to advocating for something that we have another funding resource available to us.

617
02:08:28,314 --> 02:08:30,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all things being equal,

618
02:08:31,612 --> 02:08:33,254
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be better if it was part of the operating budget.

619
02:08:33,795 --> 02:08:37,439
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is we have a series of priorities that we want to advance.

620
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:40,503
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the municipal government operates within financial boundaries.

621
02:08:41,344 --> 02:08:50,315
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there is, it would be a potentially more strategically prudent course to plan for that to be part of the ESSER budget.

622
02:08:53,456 --> 02:08:57,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident that the students that will benefit from the mental health Councilors, I think we're good on the slides.

623
02:08:57,419 --> 02:08:58,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dr. Pershing.

624
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:12,290
[SPEAKER_00]: The students that will benefit from the additional school adjustment Councilors, from the additional newcomer strand, or for the floating nurse, will not get hung up on whether that personnel is being charged to the ESSER budget or the operating budget.

625
02:09:12,510 --> 02:09:21,077
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to go back to where the original goal of staying focused on the best interests of students, it would seem that the ESSER budget, planning for that to be part of the ESSER budget

626
02:09:27,428 --> 02:09:29,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, member Rousseau then member Graham.

627
02:09:30,991 --> 02:09:31,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor.

628
02:09:31,611 --> 02:09:33,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy for the presentation.

629
02:09:35,534 --> 02:09:45,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I do hope that when we whatever we send up the city council, at least as it is currently constituted is certainly going to want to discuss

630
02:09:46,767 --> 02:09:52,308
[SPEAKER_05]: food insecurity, that was the resolution came from them as well as the school committee.

631
02:09:53,449 --> 02:10:01,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So those numbers that we just saw on the last slide excluded free universal food.

632
02:10:02,811 --> 02:10:10,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think you should be prepared at the meeting for those kinds of questions from them about how

633
02:10:10,918 --> 02:10:25,701
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, how we're as a city going to meet our commitment to this resolution to make Medford, to resolve food security in Medford, it's only going to happen through actual action and spending.

634
02:10:27,062 --> 02:10:40,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think we've kind of beaten it a bit in this meeting in the last couple of meetings to death, but we should be prepared for them to also have a little something to say on the matter, since we're not

635
02:10:41,325 --> 02:10:46,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Those numbers do not include that, and I just think you should be prepared for that.

636
02:10:47,310 --> 02:10:47,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

637
02:10:57,658 --> 02:11:00,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, can you press it yourself, Mr. Murphy.

638
02:11:01,641 --> 02:11:07,265
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little person's face, or Mr. McLaughlin Can you turn on Mr. Murphy's microphone please.

639
02:11:08,066 --> 02:11:08,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

640
02:11:13,247 --> 02:11:15,430
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognize now that it is.

641
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:17,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you, Mr. So I appreciate that.

642
02:11:17,712 --> 02:11:21,597
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, again, this is a work in progress.

643
02:11:21,797 --> 02:11:31,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as a school department, we want to continue to think about if there are budgetary limitations that are going to prevent us from realizing the full stated goal.

644
02:11:32,910 --> 02:11:40,454
[SPEAKER_00]: As articulated by the committee's action, I think our responsibility is to see what we can do to potentially advance that goal.

645
02:11:40,874 --> 02:11:48,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it may be a moot point, as I know the committee knows, because if this is incorporated into the state budget, then it's not something that we will have to address at the local level.

646
02:11:48,538 --> 02:11:49,419
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be our preference.

647
02:11:49,819 --> 02:11:50,999
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be more appropriate.

648
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:57,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I would say is that, well, I don't know that I'll be able to provide answers that are considered

649
02:11:58,423 --> 02:12:05,289
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable or good answers, I will do my best to provide consistent answers whether I'm in front of the school committee or the city council.

650
02:12:07,591 --> 02:12:07,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

651
02:12:08,071 --> 02:12:08,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

652
02:12:11,654 --> 02:12:12,995
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually didn't have my hand up.

653
02:12:13,055 --> 02:12:16,358
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still thinking, so I'll yield the floor to somebody else if they have questions.

654
02:12:16,378 --> 02:12:18,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

655
02:12:18,079 --> 02:12:24,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham, we'll give you a couple seconds.

656
02:12:24,945 --> 02:12:26,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're good for questions.

657
02:12:27,807 --> 02:12:28,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

658
02:12:29,769 --> 02:12:34,872
[SPEAKER_11]: I think my question is really about the next steps.

659
02:12:34,972 --> 02:12:44,580
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think based on what you've outlined here, we will need to take a vote to send a request.

660
02:12:46,401 --> 02:12:49,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it one of those numbers on the final summary page?

661
02:12:49,743 --> 02:12:51,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what you're suggesting?

662
02:12:51,585 --> 02:12:54,167
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think my question is, when can we do that?

663
02:12:54,972 --> 02:13:04,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I would say a couple things, I think, feedback as to how it's organized would be helpful so that we can try to bring forth a recommendation that's in keeping with the committee's expectations.

664
02:13:04,774 --> 02:13:14,817
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I would say is more time will be helpful as we continue to scrub this process and go through where potential savings could be identified.

665
02:13:16,217 --> 02:13:26,482
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, one of the members commented at one of the meetings last week that a constant refrain that you've heard me say is the administration's responsibility to plan for any contingency.

666
02:13:26,962 --> 02:13:28,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true that is part of our responsibility.

667
02:13:29,784 --> 02:13:37,968
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time we want to support the school committee and providing as solid a basis for your request to the municipal government as possible.

668
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:51,826
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to do that, it will be helpful if when we present to you that superintendent's recommendation, probably at your next meeting, that we not have overestimated any potential costs.

669
02:13:53,346 --> 02:14:03,050
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't overestimated any potential costs by a substantial magnitude, but again, it is a day-to-day process of going through the 67.4 that we currently have

670
02:14:05,111 --> 02:14:11,796
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2.6 projection that we have for costs that we can't control and the incorporation of potential increases.

671
02:14:12,376 --> 02:14:29,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a way in which we can identify those efficiencies, it both gives you as a committee more flexibility in terms of the priorities you direct us to pursue, but also I think builds a more credible request and recommendation to the municipal government and that will take some time.

672
02:14:29,209 --> 02:14:33,452
[SPEAKER_00]: So feedback on sort of the strategic

673
02:14:35,891 --> 02:14:39,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing, if you want to go to slide 26 really quickly, if we could do that.

674
02:14:43,414 --> 02:14:43,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 26.

675
02:14:43,854 --> 02:15:00,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, there is that open question around the category B. Before that, I think that's it right there.

676
02:15:02,535 --> 02:15:02,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

677
02:15:03,596 --> 02:15:08,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, so I think that if you look at these rows.

678
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:17,425
[SPEAKER_00]: The second, third and fourth rows include a category that we've identified a funding source that would not require municipal appropriation.

679
02:15:19,005 --> 02:15:28,490
[SPEAKER_00]: For purposes, and again, since it's not a contest to see how high we can get the number to go, I think some feedback as to whether the committee concurs with that assessment would be helpful.

680
02:15:28,990 --> 02:15:30,331
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can send us an email.

681
02:15:30,351 --> 02:15:32,172
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need necessarily, you can think about it.

682
02:15:32,212 --> 02:15:33,993
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to decide at this moment.

683
02:15:35,334 --> 02:15:44,939
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think the question of understanding that not every priority that we've shared with you, as I said, is equally baked.

684
02:15:45,039 --> 02:15:45,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, I mean,

685
02:15:46,126 --> 02:15:51,210
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, we want to have a coherent budget, and we even if there are things that would be a good idea in a vacuum.

686
02:15:51,891 --> 02:15:58,076
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the pieces of the budget to fit cohesively together so that we can maximize the investment of every dollar.

687
02:16:00,138 --> 02:16:06,443
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why last year, when we initially identified the math coaches but you had not yet adopted a new math curriculum.

688
02:16:07,108 --> 02:16:19,672
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not that was not a critical priority and when we needed to bridge the delta between the municipal appropriation and the request that was sort of an easy an easier cut to make at that time, now that we have the math curriculum that would be a harder cut to make.

689
02:16:20,308 --> 02:16:22,549
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's still room for flexibility there.

690
02:16:22,630 --> 02:16:27,393
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think feedback on whether that makes sense in terms of the category B piece.

691
02:16:28,013 --> 02:16:29,914
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think there's the other strategic question again.

692
02:16:29,934 --> 02:16:39,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think category E is the ones that we feel as strongly about as we do in category A and D. I'm not being transparent if I don't acknowledge that.

693
02:16:41,322 --> 02:16:47,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the event that the request exceeds the appropriation, which again, we'll be completely prepared for,

694
02:16:48,382 --> 02:16:51,844
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the area in which we would plan to right-size.

695
02:16:53,705 --> 02:16:53,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor.

696
02:16:55,326 --> 02:16:55,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

697
02:16:56,807 --> 02:17:00,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the presentation, Mr. Murphy.

698
02:17:00,549 --> 02:17:09,113
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you could just articulate again, just sort of, and maybe it's in an email as well, just sort of specifically what feedback you want from us and when.

699
02:17:09,745 --> 02:17:15,869
[SPEAKER_10]: and then also when we'll have the budget books so that we can offer feedback in sort of the, in a macro way.

700
02:17:16,029 --> 02:17:31,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the draft budget books by next week, understanding that if we were to print your traditional budget book right now, and I have no reason to think that this will not be the case next week, the salaries reflected in the budget book are not accurate.

701
02:17:32,338 --> 02:17:35,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, they are accurate right now, but they're not what we're planning for.

702
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:36,781
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's,

703
02:17:37,851 --> 02:17:43,716
[SPEAKER_00]: there's sort of a different implication in the budget book than there has been in years past, given the sort of timing of the negotiations.

704
02:17:44,837 --> 02:17:54,266
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with regard to the feedback, I think it's specific as to one, if the committee concurs with the assessment around, if you want category B included in the recommendation.

705
02:17:55,047 --> 02:18:01,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a, I think you can argue that one either way and understand that category B are things that we're prepared to do.

706
02:18:01,352 --> 02:18:03,194
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a funding source, we're going to do that.

707
02:18:05,156 --> 02:18:18,301
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think the same sort of question around category E, that our... E. As in it would be excellent to have all the money in the world, but we don't.

708
02:18:20,002 --> 02:18:20,802
[SPEAKER_00]: B and E, correct.

709
02:18:24,154 --> 02:18:26,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Category B, we have a funding source identified.

710
02:18:26,616 --> 02:18:37,264
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a strategic question and I'm not trying to, I don't think I can, truthfully can understand on a principle basis how the committee would feel one way or another.

711
02:18:37,764 --> 02:18:46,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trying to lead you to any particular conclusion, but understand that if category B is not included in the appropriation, we have a funding source identified for that.

712
02:18:46,591 --> 02:18:50,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's, it's worth the strategic consideration as to whether to include that in the request.

713
02:19:02,238 --> 02:19:02,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

714
02:19:03,138 --> 02:19:19,425
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to be honest with everybody on the city side, we're working through, our CFO came on a few weeks ago, we're working very actively to figure out our revenue replacement number, which will be much less than fiscal year 22.

715
02:19:20,985 --> 02:19:29,168
[SPEAKER_09]: But once we have a better picture, hopefully in the next week or so, we will update the school finance team and the school committee.

716
02:19:29,668 --> 02:19:31,109
[SPEAKER_09]: So just being upfront about that.

717
02:19:33,089 --> 02:19:36,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

718
02:19:36,530 --> 02:19:36,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

719
02:19:37,050 --> 02:19:56,514
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of the questions about the presentation of the information around our request, I think, I don't know, I feel like I'm of the mind that the budget book in its prior form may be more appropriate when we are talking about, down the line when we are talking about how

720
02:19:58,230 --> 02:20:09,643
[SPEAKER_11]: We will implement the city's appropriation, then in the right now I think my fear about putting out a big giant book right now is.

721
02:20:11,147 --> 02:20:22,630
[SPEAKER_11]: those people who are interested in like digging in and thinking about what's happening it's misleading like everything you need to know about the strategic priorities really can be summed up in this presentation.

722
02:20:22,650 --> 02:20:33,954
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say making sure that you know when we decide on you know which combination of items belongs in our request that we should absolutely

723
02:20:34,994 --> 02:20:42,703
[SPEAKER_11]: make the City Council aware of how much ESSER money we also plan to use and what those priorities are on the same page.

724
02:20:43,645 --> 02:20:49,752
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would say make, you know, make it clear on that same page what the

725
02:20:54,037 --> 02:21:16,680
[SPEAKER_11]: the free lunch costs could be so that they're clear about what our request is, what an additional request might be if the legislature does not come through with their free meal request, and then what other money we're planning to use out of our ESSER funds and what that brings our ESSER balance to so that they have that full picture.

726
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:45,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if one slide could tell that story along with the details of what the things are that we're saying we think are going to go up in fixed costs and then the strategic priorities, I do think this presentation is a more concise way to tell the entire story of what our request is and that the details of that budget book almost seem more appropriate when we're saying, specifically, we have this amount of money, specifically, this is how we're going to spend it.

727
02:21:45,127 --> 02:21:46,627
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like doing that right now is

728
02:21:48,821 --> 02:21:49,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

729
02:21:50,302 --> 02:21:58,307
[SPEAKER_11]: just too early and I think it could just send people sort of down the rabbit hole without much value and really trying to understand what's going on.

730
02:21:58,847 --> 02:22:03,250
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess the other question I had was you said something about our June 6th meeting.

731
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:08,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that mean you're not thinking that we need to send this request to City Hall sooner than June 6th?

732
02:22:08,633 --> 02:22:17,179
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I was thinking there was some urgency to us getting our request finalized so that the request in its

733
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:30,707
[SPEAKER_11]: sort of unfettered form can go to the municipal government and give them enough time to do the work that they need to do on the city side and then through the council and then to get back to us all before June 30th.

734
02:22:31,347 --> 02:22:34,628
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess I was sort of expecting we might need to meet before June 6th.

735
02:22:35,669 --> 02:22:38,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when I said your next meeting, that's the next time you can meet.

736
02:22:38,831 --> 02:22:41,032
[SPEAKER_00]: I would expect your request to be prior to June 6th.

737
02:22:41,825 --> 02:22:45,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I don't think it needs to be and I wouldn't recommend that it be this week.

738
02:22:46,631 --> 02:22:49,655
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I do think that we would need to convene prior to June 6.

739
02:22:51,157 --> 02:22:55,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, I am wondering if the rest of the committee sort of shares.

740
02:22:57,577 --> 02:23:02,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, my thoughts about the timing of our request.

741
02:23:02,319 --> 02:23:04,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe, maybe we meet next Monday to do that.

742
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:13,182
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that the budget books would wait with our final hearing, which is statutorily required into June when we have our appropriation number.

743
02:23:13,202 --> 02:23:20,925
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, so if it's possible to wait at least a few days as to the scheduling of that meeting, I think that might be helpful.

744
02:23:20,945 --> 02:23:24,566
[SPEAKER_00]: What I don't want to do is convene on the 23rd.

745
02:23:24,606 --> 02:23:26,747
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a week from tonight and.

746
02:23:28,419 --> 02:23:31,081
[SPEAKER_00]: convene to tell you that we want you back here on the 25th.

747
02:23:31,182 --> 02:23:35,085
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that would be I'm guessing that wouldn't go over well with everyone.

748
02:23:35,185 --> 02:23:43,692
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think we'll have a clearer sense of that timeline though before the end of this week and then I, we could report back to the, to the committee on that.

749
02:23:45,793 --> 02:23:45,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

750
02:23:46,614 --> 02:23:53,039
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I concur there would be, it would be before June 6th and there's only so much time between the 23rd and June 6th.

751
02:23:53,059 --> 02:23:56,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's a limited, maybe, maybe it'll end up being on the 23rd but I think

752
02:23:57,795 --> 02:24:04,399
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more time to make sure that we're presenting you with as factually based assessment as possible, I think would be good.

753
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:06,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

754
02:24:06,421 --> 02:24:16,927
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am wondering what my colleagues, my other colleagues think about the timing of this presentation and the changes that I suggested versus what we'll ultimately do in June.

755
02:24:19,429 --> 02:24:21,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin and then Member Hays.

756
02:24:22,228 --> 02:24:22,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays.

757
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:23,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

758
02:24:24,151 --> 02:24:35,285
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a question about, so what we got in our pack this week was the slides from the first two meetings, I found, especially tonight the slide that actually kept

759
02:24:36,463 --> 02:24:42,464
[SPEAKER_12]: put the priorities out by categories, because I think, I don't know, I might have some questions about some of the categories.

760
02:24:42,484 --> 02:24:43,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.

761
02:24:43,184 --> 02:24:49,665
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you need that, just that, understand that, like, if I gave that to you an hour ago, it would look different than it did when it was just up on the screen.

762
02:24:49,745 --> 02:24:53,186
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have this version, and then it gets updated through the week.

763
02:24:53,426 --> 02:24:54,686
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue to update you.

764
02:24:55,026 --> 02:24:58,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I'm just curious, so obviously this is my first time going through the budget.

765
02:24:58,727 --> 02:25:02,948
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of the timing and the process, as Member Graham was talking about,

766
02:25:05,805 --> 02:25:15,450
[SPEAKER_12]: when would be the opportunity to ask questions about some of those, some of the detailed priorities, things that might be in category C or D or, you know.

767
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:15,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

768
02:25:16,431 --> 02:25:23,555
[SPEAKER_00]: I think right now or at our next meeting and also, you know, you're available to answer your questions anytime.

769
02:25:23,575 --> 02:25:24,555
[SPEAKER_12]: So, okay.

770
02:25:25,155 --> 02:25:29,678
[SPEAKER_12]: I do have, I mean, if we have a moment or if we want to, I don't remember Graham had something else.

771
02:25:31,078 --> 02:25:38,404
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could go back to look at some of the category D, I think it was category D and E. Can I ask a question while we're doing that?

772
02:25:38,725 --> 02:25:39,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin?

773
02:25:40,166 --> 02:25:45,190
[SPEAKER_10]: So is there an opportunity for, I know we talked last time for an opportunity for public feedback.

774
02:25:45,230 --> 02:25:47,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that going to be the sixth or when is that going to be?

775
02:25:47,793 --> 02:25:58,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I defer to the committee on that, but I think from a statutory perspective, it would be better to have the hearing when we have a census to the actual budget that we'll be managing as opposed to the one that we're requesting.

776
02:25:59,287 --> 02:26:02,291
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's definitely out in the sphere, we have to have that.

777
02:26:02,531 --> 02:26:03,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have to have that.

778
02:26:05,118 --> 02:26:17,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to have a, I just, we've tried to have as transparent a process as possible, but as a result, I think it can lead to some confusion if there are things that we know ultimately we're not going to have the capacity to do.

779
02:26:17,764 --> 02:26:25,588
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to address, we want to advocate, we want to inform, but we don't want to lead to confusion and people say, you know, what happened to the register?

780
02:26:27,008 --> 02:26:27,569
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an easy one.

781
02:26:27,949 --> 02:26:34,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Cushing, you had to put the slides up for member Hays, which slide?

782
02:26:35,226 --> 02:26:36,290
[SPEAKER_09]: You looking for a member Hays?

783
02:26:37,634 --> 02:26:37,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

784
02:26:38,457 --> 02:26:41,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So the category D and E. Category D.

785
02:27:32,031 --> 02:27:41,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You just scroll through to category D. It's right after C. There you go.

786
02:27:48,545 --> 02:27:59,614
[SPEAKER_12]: So the question I had, and I've already asked this privately of a couple of administrators, and I don't know if it's on this slide, but I did have a question about the math interventionists.

787
02:27:59,634 --> 02:28:00,535
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the next one.

788
02:28:00,555 --> 02:28:01,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the next one, Dr. Cushing.

789
02:28:02,457 --> 02:28:02,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

790
02:28:05,119 --> 02:28:06,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying, I guess.

791
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:08,361
[SPEAKER_00]: The one between the last one and the one you're on now.

792
02:28:08,501 --> 02:28:09,182
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

793
02:28:10,663 --> 02:28:11,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

794
02:28:11,884 --> 02:28:13,386
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's in category D. Right.

795
02:28:15,781 --> 02:28:18,083
[SPEAKER_12]: So that might be different than what I remembered before.

796
02:28:18,103 --> 02:28:19,844
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was, might've been a lower case.

797
02:28:19,864 --> 02:28:23,768
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did want to just bring that up as, you know.

798
02:28:24,408 --> 02:28:29,132
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just say, you know, we've received feedback on an ongoing basis.

799
02:28:29,172 --> 02:28:30,413
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of these things shift.

800
02:28:30,453 --> 02:28:36,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is part of how it ended up in category D was the feedback that we heard from members of the committee.

801
02:28:36,558 --> 02:28:37,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just speak very briefly about this.

802
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:45,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year in the FY22 budget, we discussed as part of the way to try to combat the impact of the pandemic, we funded

803
02:28:45,525 --> 02:28:52,689
[SPEAKER_00]: or attempted to fund four literacy intervention positions at the elementary level, one per school.

804
02:28:53,669 --> 02:29:14,420
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an ESSER funded position at the time, even though if we had used the exact same system last year, probably would have been category B, because of the urgency we felt with students having been outside of the school environment for so long and needing to have that foundation reading capacity established in order to continue to move through their educational career.

805
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:19,685
[SPEAKER_00]: that a very similar argument can be made with respect to the math interventionists.

806
02:29:20,285 --> 02:29:23,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is something that we think would have value.

807
02:29:25,030 --> 02:29:28,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every priority, it has to be weighed against all the other personnel needs.

808
02:29:29,495 --> 02:29:36,022
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the combination of the math coaching and that will support staff,

809
02:29:37,269 --> 02:29:50,438
[SPEAKER_00]: and the new curriculum that we're adopting, we're looking at it right now as something that may have more value and that we'll be able to capitalize on more in succeeding fiscal years when that curriculum is more ingrained within our elementary system.

810
02:29:50,938 --> 02:30:00,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the other thing I would say, the other sort of variable, and this is true for most, but not all of the priorities that we've listed, that's a four FTE priority with a hefty price tag of $280,000.

811
02:30:00,985 --> 02:30:03,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are all estimates, these are projections.

812
02:30:04,367 --> 02:30:13,677
[SPEAKER_00]: It may well be the case that at some point between now and throughout, FY 23, we identified some capacity that is not that is not equal to 280,000.

813
02:30:14,477 --> 02:30:19,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, based on what we're seeing in terms of learning gaps and.

814
02:30:20,203 --> 02:30:26,646
[SPEAKER_00]: what the data is showing us as to other areas that we may have to bridge, I think it's entirely possible that that may be something that we want to pursue.

815
02:30:27,287 --> 02:30:46,377
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of discussing it here in this forum is that when we think that we engender greater trust from the community in terms of the sizable investment that Medford makes in education, if we're able to be very transparent and talk about these objectives and the strategic priorities as early as possible, essentially.

816
02:30:47,762 --> 02:30:49,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that helpful?

817
02:30:49,503 --> 02:30:49,803
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.

818
02:30:49,823 --> 02:31:13,471
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I just wanted to make that or to suggest from my point of view, or from thinking about the math interventionists, I'm concerned if we wait, you know, I think we have, we have at least two cohorts of kids who were not physically present in school at a time when the hands-on math foundations are built.

819
02:31:14,010 --> 02:31:18,874
[SPEAKER_12]: So those kids will now be going into third and fourth grade, second, third, fourth grade.

820
02:31:19,395 --> 02:31:25,860
[SPEAKER_12]: If we wait another couple of years and those foundations are still shaky, it doesn't matter what the math program is because the foundation is shaky.

821
02:31:26,221 --> 02:31:30,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I don't know, we haven't talked a lot about what the math assessments may have shown.

822
02:31:30,685 --> 02:31:39,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'm wrong in that assumption that kids don't have that foundation because they weren't in school at that time physically full time.

823
02:31:40,893 --> 02:31:43,075
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's, I just wanted to put that out there.

824
02:31:43,535 --> 02:31:44,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're onto something.

825
02:31:45,417 --> 02:31:55,244
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the data will bear that out at what this really comes down to and it's true for large, maybe all of category D, is that this whole process is about making difficult choices between.

826
02:31:56,970 --> 02:31:58,771
[SPEAKER_00]: a variety of very compelling priorities.

827
02:31:58,811 --> 02:32:07,656
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that your articulation of the basis of the math positions definitely is well taken.

828
02:32:08,297 --> 02:32:11,579
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to anticipate budgetary boundaries.

829
02:32:12,339 --> 02:32:16,041
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to plan accordingly, why should we plan for every contingency?

830
02:32:16,081 --> 02:32:19,764
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're going to have effective planning, we have to have some degree of prioritization.

831
02:32:19,784 --> 02:32:21,645
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really what this issue is.

832
02:32:22,525 --> 02:32:22,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, understood.

833
02:32:22,865 --> 02:32:23,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

834
02:32:23,065 --> 02:32:23,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your comments.

835
02:32:25,689 --> 02:32:29,870
[SPEAKER_00]: and for your advocacy for all the future mathematicians of Medford.

836
02:32:35,232 --> 02:32:36,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Or people that have jobs that have to fake it.

837
02:32:38,713 --> 02:32:39,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau?

838
02:32:41,914 --> 02:32:43,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm okay, thank you.

839
02:32:48,117 --> 02:32:48,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

840
02:32:49,097 --> 02:32:49,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, ma'am.

841
02:32:58,957 --> 02:33:01,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor, before we move on, can I just ask one more question?

842
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:02,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sure.

843
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:03,761
[SPEAKER_11]: One more question, sorry.

844
02:33:05,462 --> 02:33:05,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

845
02:33:06,322 --> 02:33:06,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

846
02:33:07,783 --> 02:33:20,313
[SPEAKER_11]: When I'm thinking about, you know, I think with the question we're being asked to think about is like, which sort of combination of these things are we going to send as the component of our request?

847
02:33:21,073 --> 02:33:41,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I think as I looked at those lists, I'm sort of like, I feel like my brain is heading towards saying A plus B plus D, but I would also say there may be some things in D that I might sort of throw into E to make that D slightly smaller than it is.

848
02:33:43,908 --> 02:33:47,431
[SPEAKER_11]: That's sort of where my head is at in terms of what the request might look like.

849
02:33:49,913 --> 02:33:59,661
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can definitely talk about that at the next meeting, but I just didn't, I wanted to share that with my colleagues and on the floor in terms of like,

850
02:34:00,467 --> 02:34:10,093
[SPEAKER_11]: just trying to have a framework of thinking about all like there's, you know, any very, any, you know, number of options of how we could put this together.

851
02:34:10,313 --> 02:34:14,316
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just thought I might put that out there for us to be able to start somewhere.

852
02:34:16,597 --> 02:34:17,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Graham.

853
02:34:19,379 --> 02:34:21,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe we have any presentations by the public.

854
02:34:21,740 --> 02:34:23,261
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to go on to continued business.

855
02:34:23,542 --> 02:34:28,865
[SPEAKER_09]: We have 2022-11 policy BDG school attorney be referred.

856
02:34:29,688 --> 02:34:32,230
[SPEAKER_09]: to the Rules and Policy Subcommittee for recommended updates.

857
02:34:32,250 --> 02:34:35,992
[SPEAKER_09]: The policy below was thereby approved by the Rules and Policy Subcommittee on 4-25-22.

858
02:34:36,052 --> 02:34:38,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Committee attorney.

859
02:34:40,155 --> 02:34:40,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

860
02:34:41,716 --> 02:34:49,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to waive the reading of this policy as it's a particularly non-controversial policy and it's printed on the agenda.

861
02:34:51,942 --> 02:34:52,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

862
02:34:53,924 --> 02:34:54,584
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

863
02:34:55,164 --> 02:34:55,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

864
02:34:55,685 --> 02:34:55,765
Aye.

865
02:34:56,005 --> 02:34:56,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

866
02:34:56,345 --> 02:34:56,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

867
02:34:57,526 --> 02:34:57,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Policy.

868
02:34:59,485 --> 02:35:00,485
[SPEAKER_09]: reading is waived.

869
02:35:01,646 --> 02:35:04,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to speak on it, Member Ruseau?

870
02:35:05,427 --> 02:35:06,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, I'll speak briefly.

871
02:35:07,068 --> 02:35:10,229
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did change the name of the policy.

872
02:35:10,269 --> 02:35:12,991
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of the biggest, most noticeable change, frankly.

873
02:35:14,431 --> 02:35:20,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess school attorney is a historical, has some kind of historical reasons for being called that.

874
02:35:22,340 --> 02:35:25,761
[SPEAKER_05]: makes me feel like was this back when there was one school in a school district.

875
02:35:26,242 --> 02:35:36,645
[SPEAKER_05]: But the policy that we have before us, our current school attorney, committee attorney, which we're gonna continue to call school attorney, thought it looked great.

876
02:35:37,105 --> 02:35:43,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't really have anything to add to it other than I'd motion to approve the policy.

877
02:35:44,568 --> 02:35:44,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

878
02:35:45,588 --> 02:35:49,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by member Ruseau, seconded by member Graham.

879
02:35:50,050 --> 02:35:50,690

[SPEAKER_09]: Under new business, we have 2022-29 offered by member Rousseau.

897
02:36:27,959 --> 02:36:33,540
[SPEAKER_09]: The policy on public comment and presentations of the public will be the following section appended.

898
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:40,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Number four, employees of the Medford Public Schools are exempt from the residency requirement of this policy.

899
02:36:40,521 --> 02:36:44,082
[SPEAKER_09]: The voice of our employees is welcomed on all matters before this body.

900
02:36:44,482 --> 02:36:49,083
[SPEAKER_09]: When non-Medford resident employees participating in public comment or submitting a presentation

901

[SPEAKER_09]: of the public, they will include their home address and identify themselves as an employee of the Medford Public Schools.

902
02:36:55,767 --> 02:36:59,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Submitted 5-3-2022, meeting date requested is tonight.

[SPEAKER_09]: And I did let somebody know there's no AC in here, so they will make sure the rest of the meetings are covered.

925
02:37:49,510 --> 02:38:01,538
[SPEAKER_09]: 2022-30 offered by member Rousseau, the following changes do not change the policy of the member school committee, but merely bring the language and clients with our recently approved updates as part of our rules adoption on March 21st, 2022.

926
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:04,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

927
02:38:05,041 --> 02:38:08,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to make a motion to waive the reading of the details.

928
02:38:09,272 --> 02:38:12,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

929
02:38:12,537 --> 02:38:13,338
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

930
02:38:13,358 --> 02:38:13,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

931
02:38:13,859 --> 02:38:14,580
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

932
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:15,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

933
02:38:15,201 --> 02:38:16,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Reading is approved.

934
02:38:16,142 --> 02:38:16,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

935
02:38:18,145 --> 02:38:23,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this is when we when we finalized our rules

936
02:38:23,892 --> 02:38:35,285
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the motions we had was to authorize me to go through and look for policies that were no longer up to date based on our adopted rules.

937
02:38:36,106 --> 02:38:37,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is an example of that.

938
02:38:37,768 --> 02:38:42,032
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the current policy in the policy manual, it says

939
02:38:42,813 --> 02:38:44,614
[SPEAKER_05]: a bunch of things that are no longer the case.

940
02:38:44,814 --> 02:38:56,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So I won't go through the gory details, but we do not accept public comment as in the form of an email, where the secretary or vice chair reads it out loud.

941
02:38:57,380 --> 02:38:58,320
[SPEAKER_05]: We get away with that.

942
02:38:58,600 --> 02:39:01,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And this just brings the policy up to date.

943
02:39:04,303 --> 02:39:08,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin seconded by

944
02:39:10,825 --> 02:39:10,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

945
02:39:11,005 --> 02:39:12,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Haynes, roll call, please.

946
02:39:13,987 --> 02:39:14,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

947
02:39:15,167 --> 02:39:15,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

948
02:39:16,328 --> 02:39:16,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hays?

949
02:39:17,829 --> 02:39:18,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

950
02:39:19,189 --> 02:39:20,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

951
02:39:20,890 --> 02:39:21,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

952
02:39:22,231 --> 02:39:23,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

953
02:39:23,992 --> 02:39:24,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

954
02:39:26,093 --> 02:39:26,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone?

955
02:39:27,594 --> 02:39:27,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

956
02:39:28,935 --> 02:39:29,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau, yes.

957
02:39:30,395 --> 02:39:31,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lockhart?

958
02:39:32,016 --> 02:39:34,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so it's in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the mover passes.

959
02:39:37,548 --> 02:39:48,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Offered by member Graham 2022-31, be it resolved the school committee will hold a committee of the whole no later than 5-27-2022 to receive the superintendent's self-evaluation.

960
02:39:49,152 --> 02:40:00,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that committee members will individually complete their rankings no later than 6-3-2022 using the Google form created for this purpose and sent to the secretary for compilation.

961
02:40:00,336 --> 02:40:03,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it also resolved that a second committee of the whole will be convened no later than 6-10-2022

962
02:40:05,082 --> 02:40:09,003
[SPEAKER_09]: where the school committee will discuss and deliver its evaluation of our superintendent.

963
02:40:10,024 --> 02:40:11,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion for approval?

964
02:40:11,044 --> 02:40:11,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question there.

965
02:40:11,964 --> 02:40:12,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is there questions?

966
02:40:12,964 --> 02:40:13,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

967
02:40:14,185 --> 02:40:14,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

968
02:40:15,005 --> 02:40:21,947
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanna reiterate, I know the process was new last year with the Google Docs and it took a little while for everybody to sort of get up to speed on that.

969
02:40:21,987 --> 02:40:30,410
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't remember, did we, maybe one of my colleagues might remember, did we, especially for new members, did we have like a primer on the process

970
02:40:31,565 --> 02:40:36,829
[SPEAKER_10]: that went along with the document, just sort of that people could understand, or do we need to create that?

971
02:40:36,869 --> 02:40:37,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Does anybody remember?

972
02:40:41,052 --> 02:40:41,953
[SPEAKER_09]: There was an outline.

973
02:40:41,973 --> 02:40:45,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I, there was my recollection described it.

974
02:40:48,137 --> 02:40:51,980
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I understand this motion correctly, the secretary is going to

975
02:40:52,948 --> 02:41:03,583
[SPEAKER_10]: As, as was the case last year the Secretary will sort of initiate this process with the rest of the members with a sort of description of what needs to be done is that accurate assumption to the chest.

976
02:41:05,266 --> 02:41:05,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yep.

977
02:41:06,227 --> 02:41:07,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Secretary would.

978
02:41:09,449 --> 02:41:15,492
[SPEAKER_11]: send it out to us, make sure that there's enough time for us to complete, compile, just like we have done in years past.

979
02:41:15,933 --> 02:41:25,518
[SPEAKER_11]: And I assume that if member Hays needs to be read into the process that I'm happy to do that or member Ruseau could do it as well.

980
02:41:26,658 --> 02:41:26,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

981
02:41:27,018 --> 02:41:33,502
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess I just would ask that we have it for posterity so that in the event that member Hays, myself, you, member Ruseau aren't around,

982
02:41:34,962 --> 02:41:37,663
[SPEAKER_10]: in any time in the near future, just that it's sort of there.

983
02:41:37,683 --> 02:41:43,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm happy to help with that too, but just that there's a description of what we're doing and that it's outlined for everybody.

984
02:41:43,964 --> 02:41:59,567
[SPEAKER_10]: If I might make a friendly amendment to that, if we don't already have it, that there will be a description of the process for the using the Google form that was created last year that the secretary will initiate with the rest of the committee, if I may.

985
02:41:59,587 --> 02:42:00,907
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm fine with that amendment.

986
02:42:02,025 --> 02:42:04,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval as amended by Member McLaughlin.

987
02:42:04,687 --> 02:42:05,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve.

988
02:42:05,607 --> 02:42:08,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by?

989
02:42:08,789 --> 02:42:09,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

990
02:42:09,390 --> 02:42:12,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz, roll call, please, as amended.

991
02:42:12,151 --> 02:42:14,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

992
02:42:14,593 --> 02:42:14,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

993
02:42:16,174 --> 02:42:16,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hays.

994
02:42:17,755 --> 02:42:17,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

995
02:42:19,075 --> 02:42:19,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz.

996
02:42:20,516 --> 02:42:20,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

997
02:42:21,737 --> 02:42:22,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

998
02:42:24,078 --> 02:42:24,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

999
02:42:25,259 --> 02:42:26,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

1000
02:42:27,801 --> 02:42:28,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1001
02:42:29,342 --> 02:42:30,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

1002
02:42:30,182 --> 02:42:30,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1003
02:42:30,502 --> 02:42:31,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Leclerc.

1004
02:42:31,954 --> 02:42:33,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1005
02:42:34,896 --> 02:42:36,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes as amended.

1006
02:42:37,398 --> 02:42:41,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Number 2022-32 offered by member Rousseau.

1007
02:42:41,761 --> 02:42:44,843
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford School Committee will add a regular meeting on June 13th, 2022.

1008
02:42:45,323 --> 02:42:52,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And are we eliminating the holiday June 20th, 2022 is my question.

1009
02:42:52,868 --> 02:42:53,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's a holiday.

1010
02:42:54,149 --> 02:42:56,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

1011
02:42:57,411 --> 02:42:58,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, mayor.

1012
02:42:59,795 --> 02:43:03,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at the calendar, we don't have another meeting in June scheduled.

1013
02:43:03,477 --> 02:43:06,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I added the 13th.

1014
02:43:06,579 --> 02:43:14,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think when we approved our official calendar schedule, there were some things up in the air.

1015
02:43:15,163 --> 02:43:19,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm pretty sure we need to have another meeting in June.

1016
02:43:20,706 --> 02:43:21,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve.

1017
02:43:22,727 --> 02:43:25,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by member McLaughlin, seconded by?

1018
02:43:25,369 --> 02:43:25,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1019
02:43:28,381 --> 02:43:31,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody, member Kreatz, roll call, please.

1020
02:43:32,063 --> 02:43:32,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

1021
02:43:33,124 --> 02:43:33,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1022
02:43:34,805 --> 02:43:36,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hays.

1023
02:43:36,586 --> 02:43:36,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1024
02:43:37,207 --> 02:43:39,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz.

1025
02:43:39,868 --> 02:43:40,088

[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

1027
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:43,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1028
02:43:43,751 --> 02:43:44,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

1029
02:43:45,332 --> 02:43:45,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1030
02:43:46,272 --> 02:43:46,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

1031
02:43:47,033 --> 02:43:47,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1032
02:43:47,873 --> 02:43:48,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Locker.

1033
02:43:48,374 --> 02:43:48,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1034
02:43:50,655 --> 02:43:52,757
[SPEAKER_09]: On the affirmative, zero on the negative, motion passes.

1035
02:43:53,457 --> 02:43:57,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Offered by Member Graham, 2022-33, be it resolved that the school committee will meet

1036
02:43:58,537 --> 02:44:04,260
[SPEAKER_09]: in a committee of the whole to discuss the superintendent's goals for 2022-2023 school year no later than 6-17-2022.

1037
02:44:04,340 --> 02:44:15,307
[SPEAKER_09]: We had further resolved that the school committee finalize and approve the superintendent's goal on a regular school committee meeting or special school committee meeting no later than 9-30-2022.

1038
02:44:16,848 --> 02:44:17,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve.

1039
02:44:19,529 --> 02:44:20,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays.

1040
02:44:21,770 --> 02:44:24,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just wondering about that turnaround time from the 10th.

1041
02:44:25,172 --> 02:44:26,153
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm sorry, what are the dates?

1042
02:44:27,293 --> 02:44:29,214
[SPEAKER_09]: 6-17-2022, not to 9-30-2022.

1043
02:44:30,155 --> 02:44:35,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, from the 10th that we give the evaluation and then the 17th for the new goals, I'm just curious.

1044
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:37,360
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little tight.

1045
02:44:37,860 --> 02:44:39,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, how's the superintendent?

1046
02:44:41,643 --> 02:44:42,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor, could I respond to that?

1047
02:44:43,565 --> 02:44:48,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think Dr. Maurice Edwards.

1048
02:44:48,788 --> 02:44:51,370
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think, you know, in thinking about the timeline,

1049
02:44:52,911 --> 02:44:56,502
[SPEAKER_11]: always run out of time to do all these things at the end of the year.

1050
02:44:56,522 --> 02:44:58,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I was

1051
02:45:00,035 --> 02:45:17,884
[SPEAKER_11]: discussing this with the superintendent back and forth, you know, I originally was really wanting us to agree on goals between now and the end of June, so that in my mind, the administrative team can spend the summer thinking about how to implement those goals.

1052
02:45:18,704 --> 02:45:24,287
[SPEAKER_11]: And the superintendent did aptly point out that, you know,

1053
02:45:25,087 --> 02:45:45,947
[SPEAKER_11]: there is a lot of considerable amount of data that comes in over the summer and that you know we we'd really be best positioned to provide some space to allow that that set of information and data that's going to come in over the summer to help guide the the ultimate and finalized goals that we hold her accountable for which I think is great.

1054
02:45:45,968 --> 02:45:46,768
[SPEAKER_11]: I think

1055
02:45:48,023 --> 02:45:50,204
[SPEAKER_11]: what this does is sort of change the process.

1056
02:45:50,264 --> 02:45:59,187
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the past, the superintendent brings us a draft of her goals and then, you know, it's usually sometime in the fall, the year has already started.

1057
02:45:59,207 --> 02:46:14,792
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not, you know, there's an opportunity for us to sort of tweak here and there, but there isn't really a great opportunity for her to be able to hear from the committee in a wholesale way what we want to see the goals be.

1058
02:46:15,332 --> 02:46:17,593
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think what this does is say, you know,

1059
02:46:18,033 --> 02:46:35,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Between now and June, the school committee will have a discussion, that's it, we will have a committee of the whole, where we will talk about the kinds of things that we want the superintendent to take into consideration as from a goals perspective, as she heads into the summer.

1060
02:46:36,287 --> 02:46:44,515
[SPEAKER_11]: so that she can then pair that with the data and the work that her academic team is doing, but that we not finalize or ask her to put anything in draft until September.

1061
02:46:45,056 --> 02:46:51,702
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's critically important that she hear from us proactively about what we think those goals should be.

1062
02:46:51,722 --> 02:46:55,346
[SPEAKER_11]: And that piece has always sort of been missing in our process.

1063
02:46:56,167 --> 02:46:56,807
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this,

1064
02:46:57,788 --> 02:47:09,312
[SPEAKER_11]: adding this now gives us an opportunity to do that without really expecting the superintendent to draft or document anything along the way between now and the end of the school year.

1065
02:47:09,392 --> 02:47:13,593
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, I think it's more an opportunity for her to be able to hear from us.

1066
02:47:19,215 --> 02:47:20,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Maurice Edwards.

1067
02:47:20,888 --> 02:47:36,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I had the opportunity to talk with member Graham about this, and I welcome the conversation and the discussion with the committee to be able to get an idea of what the committee members are thinking about for the following school year.

1068
02:47:37,302 --> 02:47:47,812
[SPEAKER_13]: But I did share that it's critically important to take time over the summer months to look at our data, to reflect as a team, to regroup,

1069
02:47:48,512 --> 02:47:58,338
[SPEAKER_13]: and be able to make data informed decisions about what our priorities are going to be, whether it's a district improvement goal or the student learning goal.

1070
02:47:58,858 --> 02:48:02,020
[SPEAKER_13]: And that it's the data that comes over the summer.

1071
02:48:02,280 --> 02:48:06,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, embargo data that comes right at the end of the summer and into September.

1072
02:48:06,683 --> 02:48:13,907
[SPEAKER_13]: So the September 30th date, that will give us time to at least have a good amount of new data.

1073
02:48:16,288 --> 02:48:20,592
[SPEAKER_13]: to feel more confident in the recommendations that are being made to the committee by that date.

1074
02:48:21,273 --> 02:48:31,282
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is in keeping in agreement with many other districts, because I did consult with other superintendents to figure out what timetable they were on.

1075
02:48:31,642 --> 02:48:36,587
[SPEAKER_13]: And most of them said September, October, they submit their goals for the year.

1076
02:48:37,168 --> 02:48:41,752
[SPEAKER_13]: So I look forward to that discussion next month with you all.

1077
02:48:44,710 --> 02:48:45,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I second?

[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in favor, zero against, motion passes.

1098
02:49:52,176 --> 02:49:53,997
[SPEAKER_11]: But these are the policies there.

1099
02:49:54,357 --> 02:49:58,420
[SPEAKER_11]: As you can see, there are quite a number of them are at that circle attendance and truancy.

1100
02:49:59,621 --> 02:50:03,644
[SPEAKER_11]: So the my request here is that we that we send this to the

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor.

1123
02:51:43,068 --> 02:51:45,449
[SPEAKER_05]: This may be causing you all some deja vu.

1124
02:51:46,270 --> 02:51:58,256
[SPEAKER_05]: In June of 2020, this was on the agenda and we decided that since we weren't sure anybody was going to be going to school, recess seemed kind of far away as a concern.

1125
02:51:59,036 --> 02:52:00,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

1126
02:52:01,818 --> 02:52:05,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have brought this back as it's very important and

1127
02:52:07,307 --> 02:52:21,715
[SPEAKER_05]: recent yet more news articles and more research keeps coming out, making it very evident that taking away recess has the opposite desired effect and harms all the children, not just those that actually had their recess taken away.

1128
02:52:22,395 --> 02:52:26,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I wanna get this work going in subcommittee.

1129
02:52:26,818 --> 02:52:27,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1130

1145
02:53:15,888 --> 02:53:17,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's actually anything to discuss yet.

1146
02:53:19,089 --> 02:53:19,249
Okay.

02:53:49,823 --> 02:53:50,183
