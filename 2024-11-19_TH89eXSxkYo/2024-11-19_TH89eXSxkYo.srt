1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:05,528
[SPEAKER_04]: to clear the public hearing open.

2
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:08,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Open to those in favor of the petition.

00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:12,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anyone with us online tonight that is in favor of the petition?

8
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:33,316

11
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:37,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak in favor of the petition?

12
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

14
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone in opposition of the petition?

15
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:51,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone in opposition?

16
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:57,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

17
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:04,177
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point in time, I'd call upon the Chair of Personal Licensing, Councilor Scott Beall.

00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:05,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

19
00:01:05,618 --> 00:01:06,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Mr. Shakes.

20
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:06,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

21
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:07,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for being here this evening.

22
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:14,001
[SPEAKER_09]: We see everything that is asked for you is in place.

23
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,022
[SPEAKER_09]: All the documents are in place.

24
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:18,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody looks to have approved it moving forward.

25
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:25,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you just give us a brief synopsis of what was there prior and what you're doing at the site now?

26
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:34,747
[SPEAKER_23]: So I can't confirm what was here prior, but I'm pretty sure that it was the same type of business, automotive and body shop.

27
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:38,348
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what we're doing now, too, automotive and body.

28
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:39,068
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

29
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:43,909
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, in the hours of operations, following the city guidelines, everything looks like it's in place.

30
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I know before I make the motion to approve, if any councilors have any questions.

31
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:54,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any councilors that have questions regarding this matter?

32
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:55,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

33
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:56,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

34
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, if the petitioner could just state how much off-street parking that they have.

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,231
[SPEAKER_23]: Eight.

36
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:06,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight spots off-street?

37
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:08,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight spots in the parking lot.

38
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:09,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

39
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:11,153

00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:11,673

48
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:33,304
[SPEAKER_09]: That's everything.

49
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:34,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I rest my case.

50
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:35,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I have nothing to add.

51
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so everything's in order.

52
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:38,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's in order, Mr. President.

53
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:39,505

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:03,185

[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night.

77
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:12,330
[SPEAKER_25]: You too.

78
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:12,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

79
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:23,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 20-647, offered by Councilor Marks, Councilor Scarpelli, and Vice President Caraviello.

80
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the City Council request the presence of

81
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:40,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley, Chief Buckley, Chief of the Medford Police Department, Chief Gilberti, Lieutenant Mark Rudolph, and Officer Harold McGill to discuss public safety concerns dealing with our 911 system at our next scheduled meeting.

82
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:41,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

83
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:45,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I'll just defer to Councilor Scarpelli.

84
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:46,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Councilor Scarpelli.

85
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:47,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Mr. President.

86
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:52,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it on?

87
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:53,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

88
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:57,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not familiar with who's present.

89
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Are the chiefs present?

90
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:01,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Officer McGilvrey?

91
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:04,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I see both chiefs.

92
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:09,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Harold McGilvrey is with us and Lieutenant Mark Rudolph is with us as well.

93
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And both chiefs, yes.

94
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:14,124
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so this is important because I think that

95
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:26,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Out of nowhere we received a letter from the mayor stating that we need to move forward with some concerns dealing with the 911 system.

96
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:34,852
[SPEAKER_09]: And that I believe it was a public health crisis, a safety crisis that we needed to address.

97
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:35,492
[SPEAKER_09]: It was something that

98
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:44,438
[SPEAKER_09]: put a red flag out to alert us and that this is the first time the council heard that.

99
00:04:45,018 --> 00:05:06,166
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought it was important that both the leaders of the police and fire come and just fill us in if there's things we should know that are this dire, that something's been going on and we need to adjust as a council and move some initiatives through to make sure that we're supporting them in any way.

100
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:12,649
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody could share some comments or any insight into this.

101
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Would the other Councilors like to speak first or would you like to hear from- That's just to my question, so.

102
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:22,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

103
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:23,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

104
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:24,633
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could, thank you, Mr. President.

105
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:31,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the fact that both chiefs are on tonight, as well as the union representative.

106
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:38,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe both on the police and fire side are both with us tonight as well, Mr. President.

107
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:56,314
[SPEAKER_05]: As Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, the concern I have and the reason why I added my name to this resolution was the fact that we did receive a correspondence from Mayor Lungo-Koehn regarding the urgent need and the emergency of

108
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,058
[SPEAKER_05]: putting this particular position forward.

109
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:09,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I saw that email, Mr. President, it kind of alarmed me that there was a concern of that urgency within 9-1-1.

110
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:15,457
[SPEAKER_05]: First, that I'm hearing that 9-1-1 has existed for the past year and a half.

111
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:19,260
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would hope that there was proper supervision.

112
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:25,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I would hope there was proper training policies and procedures set up in that past year and a half.

113
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:38,972
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm eager to hear tonight from both chiefs to hopefully dispel the emergency that was stated by the mayor in her email.

114
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:43,875
[SPEAKER_05]: And hear from both chiefs, Mr. President, and the union representatives as well.

115
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:44,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

116
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:45,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

117
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:46,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

118
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:48,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

119
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:52,158
[SPEAKER_18]: I echo Councilor Marks' comments there.

120
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,959
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll wait to hear what the two chiefs have to say.

121
00:06:55,359 --> 00:07:00,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, like everyone else, I didn't hear of any grave emergency that was going on there.

122
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:08,064
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, I'll hold any further questions until we hear from all the officials that are on the call.

123
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:10,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

124
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, we have a number of people.

125
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lungo-Koehnan has her hand up.

126
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:18,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to try to, there you go.

127
00:07:18,534 --> 00:07:19,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lungo-Koehnan.

128
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:22,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Falco.

129
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:26,901
[SPEAKER_21]: I do want to thank both chiefs for being on the call as well as Lieutenant Rudolph.

130
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:32,666
[SPEAKER_21]: We have President McGilvery from the police union.

131
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:37,670
[SPEAKER_21]: We also have President Buckley from the fire union and Lieutenant Mon from the fire department.

132
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,371
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just want to,

133
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:45,232
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to give them all the floor, but I just want to let you know that I do stand by the email that was sent.

134
00:07:45,473 --> 00:08:04,620
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's really important that we get a 911 supervisor in there for a number of reasons, some personnel, but one of the main personnel reasons for doing so is because we're having a really hard time hiring for the four empty positions.

135
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:13,500
[SPEAKER_21]: that are in dispatch, which is creating forced overtimes, and it's creating almost an emergency situation just to get personnel in there anyway.

136
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,944
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a number of good candidates that we've offered the job to, but they've turned it down due to the pay.

137
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:32,472
[SPEAKER_21]: We also feel that now more than ever, after hearing the concerns, especially from the fire union, that it is an emergency to get a supervisor in that role for any additional training

138
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:41,457
[SPEAKER_21]: to make sure that the first responders we want to make sure we have a supervisor in there.

139
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:45,759
[SPEAKER_21]: We cannot wait for this until next budget cycle.

140
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,980
[SPEAKER_21]: This is something that I just want to let you know.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,161
[SPEAKER_21]: I stand by as being an emergency.

142
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:50,221
[SPEAKER_21]: We

143
00:08:58,181 --> 00:09:00,383
[SPEAKER_21]: and he is just recently started.

144
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:03,044
[SPEAKER_21]: He is going to be working with us for the next couple months.

145
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:19,496
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's imperative that we do get a supervisor in there to work with both unions, both chiefs, Lieutenant Rudolph, who runs the department, and get a supervisor in there ready to go while Mr. Richard makes recommendations for how to fix all the problems that is

146
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:25,515
[SPEAKER_21]: if there are any that will be explained to you tonight in 9-1-1 dispatch.

147
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:26,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

148
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I could.

149
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:28,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor Longo.

150
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:29,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

151
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

152
00:09:31,157 --> 00:09:33,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the mayor being on the call tonight.

153
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:39,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question I have to the mayor, Mr. President, is the fact that

154
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:48,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I can appreciate, and it's the mayor's opinion, that this is a critical need for the operation of public safety in the community.

155
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:51,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And she has every right to state that if she believes that.

156
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:55,548
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is that since January of this year,

157
00:09:56,648 --> 00:10:11,714
[SPEAKER_05]: The fire department has reached out on several occasions to not only the city administration, but to both Chiefs, Chief Gilberti and Chief Buckley regarding their concerns with 911 and some of the concerns that they had.

158
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,075
[SPEAKER_05]: that they raised back in January of this year.

159
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:26,177
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just wondering when the mayor figured out that this was a public safety emergency and why did it take almost 11 months to do so?

160
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:29,078
[SPEAKER_21]: I thank you, Councilor Marks.

161
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:33,719
[SPEAKER_21]: In January, February, it was brought to my attention.

162
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:36,039
[SPEAKER_21]: There was some issues with the training manuals.

163
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:40,540
[SPEAKER_21]: So at that point, I think Chief Gilberti and I did meet

164
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:49,549
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it could have been March, April, May, depending on the surge in coronavirus cases, which set us back a bit.

165
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:58,790
[SPEAKER_21]: But the manual was brought to me, and at that time, I did let my chief of staff know that I've reviewed the manual.

166
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,911
[SPEAKER_21]: It's in-depth, but the fire union still had concerns.

167
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,232
[SPEAKER_21]: So as of recent, over the last two months, we've had two

168
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:15,737
[SPEAKER_21]: very in-depth meetings to review what the problems are and how do we fix these problems.

169
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:32,682
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've been able to work on a plan collaboratively, one that I feel the police and the fire is happy with, but part of that plan, which I feel is an emergency, is to get a supervisor on board as soon as possible.

170
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:45,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, so Mr. President, if I could follow up, and I appreciate that statement, but it still doesn't answer what happened from January to the past, even if we say two months that they've been working on this.

171
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,919
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened to the seven months in between that, Mr. President?

172
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:59,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm looking at a correspondence from Union President Eddie Buckley from January 21st of this year, raising concern, Mr. President.

173
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:03,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And that email was sent to Fire Chief Gilberti.

174
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:09,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Police Chief Buckley, Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez, and Union Rep Harold McGilvery.

175
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:13,193
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you could, Mr. President, I'd like to just read it briefly.

176
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:14,754
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, good morning, gentlemen.

177
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:21,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to formally request a meeting with all interested parties to discuss the future of dispatching.

178
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:29,785
[SPEAKER_05]: There are too many rumors and scuttlebutt going around, and we as a union would like to meet face to face to communicate our concerns.

179
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,061
[SPEAKER_05]: get a grasp on the future of fire dispatch.

180
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:40,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Please let me know at your convenience when we would be able to be a good time to sit down and talk.

181
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:45,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your attention to this matter, Eddie Buckley, Union President 1032.

182
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:53,565
[SPEAKER_05]: The same day, Mr. President, Union Rep Harold McGillivray reached out and gave his availability.

183
00:12:54,917 --> 00:13:05,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, but the part that I'm troubled by is Fire Chief Gilberti never responded to the request by the union.

184
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:11,256
[SPEAKER_05]: The Mayor's Chief of Staff, Dave Rodriguez, never responded to their request.

185
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chief Buckley responded saying, thank you for your concerns.

186
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:18,314
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, I will decline.

187
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:33,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to figure out, Mr. President, if this was an issue that's been brought up, and this actually dates back actually even prior to January, when a letter was sent out in June 2019 to the former mayor, Burke, asking for a meeting.

188
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,269
[SPEAKER_05]: which was never responded to.

189
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:47,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So this has been a year and a half, and now 10 or 11 months under this administration, going on 12 months.

190
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:55,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just concerned, Mr. President, with the lack of attention for the last, from January to just say September, October.

191
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:03,045
[SPEAKER_05]: when nothing was done and now all of a sudden meetings are being held and we're being told it's an emergency, Mr. President.

192
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:11,932
[SPEAKER_05]: But from what I'm being told, there was concerns all along, Mr. President, from day one when this 911 center opened.

193
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:16,335
[SPEAKER_05]: From day one, there was a lack of a manual, a lack of policies and procedures.

194
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:22,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And there has been very little put into trying to get to the bottom of what's happening.

195
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:28,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think everyone behind this room, I won't speak for them, no one's opposed to the position, Mr. President.

196
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,842
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some legitimate questions regarding the position, and I'm hoping to hear tonight what's being worked on.

197
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:42,285
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have other questions, and I'll wait to hear as soon as both chiefs respond, and hopefully the union representatives.

198
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:44,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

199
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Would either of the chiefs like to respond at this point?

200
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:51,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Markswell, do you want to hear from the chiefs next or?

201
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:54,495
[SPEAKER_05]: If they'd like to respond, Mr. President.

202
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:56,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley.

203
00:14:58,476 --> 00:14:59,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Councilors, how are you?

204
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:01,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Good, thank you.

205
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:11,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me start by responding to the initial premise of the meeting and the request, and that was the mayor's letter.

206
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:12,719
[SPEAKER_15]: And it clearly said that

207
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:21,075
[SPEAKER_15]: we have an emergency in filling a staff position, and that is a public safety supervisor position.

208
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:27,742
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is, you know, we're able to talk about that.

209
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:30,506
[SPEAKER_15]: I can talk about that in depth, but it appears to me that,

210
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,820
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not really the intent of this council, that they are doing some other bidding here and talking about subject matter.

211
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President.

212
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:40,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

213
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Publicly.

214
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:43,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

215
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:47,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure we're all on the same page here, Mr. President.

216
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:50,584
[SPEAKER_05]: When exactly, because

217
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:54,886
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hearing that they need a coordinator or supervisor for 911.

218
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:58,447
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been set up for a year and a half, Mr. President.

219
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:12,134
[SPEAKER_05]: When exactly did the administration and both chiefs figure out that this is now so urgent that it's an emergency now where it hasn't had supervision for the last 15 months, Mr. President?

220
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:13,355
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I said.

221
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,496
[SPEAKER_15]: That's blatantly false.

222
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:17,599
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have to stop with the rhetoric, Mr. President.

223
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:21,543
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been under supervision of the police department since day one.

224
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:24,085
[SPEAKER_15]: We've conducted proper training, right?

225
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,908
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't have a public hearing when Councilors are

226
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:30,131
[SPEAKER_15]: using the torque that is causing public alarm.

227
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:32,393
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no public health emergency.

228
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,455
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no public safety emergency.

229
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:39,119
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can't keep saying this stuff out loud on your soapbox.

230
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

231
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

232
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:49,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be honest, I get a little tired that we have a chief that comes out here accusing us of doing something that we are not.

233
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,432
[SPEAKER_08]: You're making accusations that I would never do to you, sir.

234
00:16:53,912 --> 00:17:00,897
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm telling you is, we haven't heard anything about this, and we get a letter from the mayor saying that there's a crisis at 911.

235
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:09,143
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is the only intent why this councilor is asking for this meeting for the leaders of both the firemen and police to answer these questions, period.

236
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:14,267
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't leave the community on like I'm trying to put any fear mongering in anybody.

237
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:21,049
[SPEAKER_08]: The intent of this- The intent of the meeting is to find out if there is a crisis.

238
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:22,630
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the intent of this meeting.

239
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,790
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

240
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,331
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no crisis.

241
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:26,932
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a crisis.

242
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Chief, we wouldn't know, Chief.

243
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:35,536
[SPEAKER_08]: We wouldn't know because the only thing we heard was a letter from the mayor saying there was a crisis in 911.

244
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:37,396
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we're here.

245
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:38,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing else.

246
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:42,159
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the second time that you've come out here and done this.

247
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,719
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's trying to leave anybody on a negative way.

248
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,919
[SPEAKER_08]: We've done nothing but support the police and fire.

249
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scampelli.

250
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,481
[SPEAKER_15]: If we're talking about the same letter that the mayor sent, the letter says, I feel strongly that filling this position is an emergency.

251
00:17:57,982 --> 00:18:00,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Filling a position is an emergency.

252
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Not a public health crisis or some public safety issue.

253
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:12,064
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to put this all in context, and I really want Lieutenant Rudolph to talk about this, because he's handled this.

254
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:20,127
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the need to fill 13 in one part-time position for public safety dispatches.

255
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:22,268
[SPEAKER_15]: We currently have 10 dispatches.

256
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,571
[SPEAKER_15]: That's 14 shifts per week that we cannot fill for dispatching.

257
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:31,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Currently, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will not train dispatches for us.

258
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:35,535
[SPEAKER_15]: They have been shut down since the beginning of the spring due to COVID.

259
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:44,059
[SPEAKER_15]: The only way we can get dispatches and hire them is if we get already current certified trained dispatches.

260
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,822
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have been unsuccessful in doing that.

261
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:51,007
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been trying since the beginning of this to fill these shifts.

262
00:18:52,218 --> 00:19:16,558
[SPEAKER_15]: What the state has told us is that if we can get a supervisor who has our, excuse me, they don't use this term supervisor, a dispatcher who has certain training and certifications, we can conduct our own training in-house and train virtually through the state and in-house through the city of Medford to hire our own dispatchers to fill these vacancies.

263
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:24,231
[SPEAKER_15]: The strain that 14 open positions is creating on our civilian dispatches is at critical point.

264
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:28,153
[SPEAKER_15]: The strain it creates on budgets is at a critical point.

265
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:32,794
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what this letter is about, but it has this letter from the mayor.

266
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:40,917
[SPEAKER_15]: In that situation, we can talk all day long and I'll let Lieutenant Rudolph discuss it, but it went way off target with what Councilor Marks is talking about.

267
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:45,759
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been addressing this dispatch since its inception.

268
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,120
[SPEAKER_15]: The fire chief and I have met numerous times.

269
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Mr. President.

270
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley, one minute.

271
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

272
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:55,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

273
00:19:55,743 --> 00:20:01,266
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great that both chiefs are meeting, but they fail to include the membership, Mr. President.

274
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:08,449
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a problem when you have the union, at least on the fire side, that has reached out on several occasions, Mr. President.

275
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:09,829
[SPEAKER_05]: June 14, 2019, July 27, 2020, October 26, 2020.

276
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:15,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Raising questions, Mr. President, requesting a meeting to discuss ongoing issues and concerns with Method Fire Alarm.

277
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:29,219
[SPEAKER_05]: In particular, with delays in dispatching and calls for lack of supervision.

278
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:34,262
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from the Method Fire Union, local 1032, Mr. President.

279
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:37,024
[SPEAKER_05]: They also raised concerns on July 27th.

280
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:43,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Union raises concerns on manpower assignments on multiple alarm fires.

281
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:49,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Dispatch policy regarding this subject was changed without input from the fire department.

282
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:52,334
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not coming from this council, Mr. President.

283
00:20:52,654 --> 00:21:03,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the chief is working out of a vacuum, which seems to be how he operates, Mr. President, and not hearing what's happening in the community, or at least in the 911 center, then shame on him.

284
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:11,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't point the finger at this council because we're raising concerns that we're hearing from membership of the police and fire, Mr. President.

285
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:13,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

286
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:15,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley.

287
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,462
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been meeting since the inception of this dispatch program, civilian dispatch program.

288
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:28,164
[SPEAKER_15]: And the chief and I have been dealing with all of the issues as it relates to training.

289
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:34,947
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have been putting together a new program and it has been successful from where we were.

290
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:37,489
[SPEAKER_15]: That does not mean we have not had hiccups.

291
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:40,530
[SPEAKER_15]: That does not mean that there haven't been training issues.

292
00:21:42,136 --> 00:22:00,485
[SPEAKER_15]: Think about what we're doing, where we went from decades of police officers dispatching police calls and decades of firefighters dispatching fire calls to combining one unit and one civilian dispatch situation where they have to do both.

293
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:05,948
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know fire dispatching and the fire department doesn't know police dispatching.

294
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:12,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Combined, we put together a program that has been successful.

295
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:20,890
[SPEAKER_15]: They have been operating on the police side independently since October and operating on the fire side independently since around February.

296
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:26,114
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, when I say successful, that doesn't mean there isn't hiccups.

297
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:31,860
[SPEAKER_15]: To Council Box's point, in the beginning of this program, we were putting,

298
00:22:34,782 --> 00:22:36,603
[SPEAKER_15]: training modules in place.

299
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:39,344
[SPEAKER_15]: We're having difficulties with some training.

300
00:22:39,804 --> 00:22:42,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are administrative issues.

301
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:52,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Every issue that the fire union brought forth to chief Gilliberti, chief Gilliberti and I discussed, but there's no need to have meetings with the fire on my side.

302
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:52,768
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a police chief.

303
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:54,328
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't need to meet with the fire union.

304
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:58,610
[SPEAKER_15]: We were dealing with issues and we continue to deal with issues as they arise.

305
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:02,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President?

306
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:04,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

307
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, it's my understanding that the police oversees the 911 center.

308
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:09,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that not correct?

309
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:12,205
[SPEAKER_05]: It is correct.

310
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:24,855
[SPEAKER_05]: So why would the chief of police, who oversees the entire picture, not want to sit down with the fire side, who does not have someone that's up there supervising, and listen to their concerns?

311
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:31,757
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's sort of missing the point.

312
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:38,002
[SPEAKER_15]: I was meeting with the fire chief, the deputy chief, discussing their training.

313
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:40,104
[SPEAKER_15]: We were meeting with the fire all along.

314
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,728
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no need at that time and at that point to meet with the fire union on this.

315
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:45,989
[SPEAKER_15]: I meet with their staff.

316
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:59,930
[SPEAKER_15]: To say that we weren't meeting and talking in the fire department and the police department, we're not working to resolve the issues, is just not true.

317
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,151
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't.

318
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:03,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, point of information.

319
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:05,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

320
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:13,235
[SPEAKER_05]: With all due respect, Mr. President, I'll let the union reps that are on the phone now dictate whatever their narrative is, Mr. President.

321
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:17,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Because clearly, that's not their feedback that I received, Mr. President.

322
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:21,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess there's two different realities going on in this community.

323
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:26,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd like to hear from the union representatives as well, Mr. President.

324
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:26,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

325
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:27,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

326
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:30,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to hear from them right now or do you want to leave?

327
00:24:30,324 --> 00:24:38,150
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point, Mr. President, I'd like maybe for the chief to finish his presentation, but I'd like to hear from them too, Mr. President.

328
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Chief Buckley, if you want to continue.

329
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:46,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, just to wrap it up, there is an overwhelming need to fill this supervisory dispatcher position.

330
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:56,459
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't train new dispatchers because the state has prohibited us from doing so, unless we have certain qualified personnel in that unit.

331
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:04,345
[SPEAKER_15]: So we need to do this, and COVID is not going to go away anytime soon, and we are not going to be able to train

332
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:07,367
[SPEAKER_15]: in the normal fashion by sending them off to the state.

333
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,567
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have to take care of this problem in-house.

334
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:17,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Currently, we have a strain on the system of personnel and on the budgets for these positions, and we have to go and fill these positions.

335
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:25,832
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to get, increase our training on dispatches for the yearly, so-called in-service training for dispatches.

336
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:31,534
[SPEAKER_15]: And in order to do that, we need the certified, this certified personnel to come in here and handle that.

337
00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:34,275
[SPEAKER_15]: So that on its basic is the need, the overwhelming,

338
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:47,142
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is a crisis vote to hire a dispatcher who has certain supervisory and certifications in-house to do this.

339
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:49,624
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to do this and we need to do it soon.

340
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:51,164
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the point.

341
00:25:51,344 --> 00:26:01,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I'm comfortable with you talking to both unions, and I'd love to hear their positions on this, because I think for the most part, they're going to tell you similar concerns, but maybe not.

342
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:02,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe the fire union will surprise them.

343
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:04,941
[SPEAKER_04]: We will.

344
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:06,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chief Buckley.

345
00:26:07,062 --> 00:26:13,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Gilberti, did you want to speak before I recognize the union representatives?

346
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:15,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

347
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:22,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, and city councilors.

348
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:31,588
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as the supervisor's position goes, my union has been asking for a supervisor,

349
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:35,849
[SPEAKER_13]: in the dispatch center from the beginning.

350
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:47,178
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had asked the previous administration on at least two occasions, if we could get a supervisor into the dispatch center, but that didn't materialize.

351
00:26:47,278 --> 00:27:01,548
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to thank Mayor Lungo-Koehn for stepping up and hearing our cries for a supervisor and taking the necessary steps for us to move forward with that.

352
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:06,934
[SPEAKER_13]: I meet with my union on these issues.

353
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:10,137
[SPEAKER_13]: We talk about it.

354
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:12,239
[SPEAKER_13]: They bring me issues.

355
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:17,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Chief Buckley wanted to hear their concerns, but he wanted to hear them through me.

356
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:25,850
[SPEAKER_13]: And I asked my union and anyone in the department, if they have any concerns to send me a communication and I will address them with Chief Buckley.

357
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,192
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've done that on a number of occasions.

358
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:29,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Have we had our hiccups?

359
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:31,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we have.

360
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:32,395
[SPEAKER_13]: But we try to deal with them.

361
00:27:33,393 --> 00:27:34,113
[SPEAKER_13]: as they come up.

362
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:44,376
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe Chief Buckley had a discussion last night with the union, the dispatch union.

363
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:49,018
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm hoping, and I believe that we are on the right track.

364
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:56,080
[SPEAKER_13]: And as soon as we can get the supervisor in there, things will be a little different.

365
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,140
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll have some oversight.

366
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:58,716
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll have retraining.

367
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:02,300
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll have a one encompassing manual.

368
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:08,266
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's my statement for right now.

369
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:11,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chief Gilbert.

370
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:11,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

371
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:17,875
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, I recognize, do you prefer police or fire?

372
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:18,356
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

373
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:19,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

374
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:26,233
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go with, let's see, let's go with Eddie Buckley from the local 1032 Medford Fire Department.

375
00:28:26,393 --> 00:28:28,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to unmute you, Eddie Buckley.

376
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:33,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, sorry I'm at work.

377
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:34,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Can anyone hear me?

378
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:35,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we can hear you.

379
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:36,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining us tonight.

380
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:41,423
[SPEAKER_11]: So what questions do you have?

381
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,064
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad to answer anything, sure.

382
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:49,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Members, do you have any specific questions that you'd like to ask Mr. Buckley?

383
00:28:50,747 --> 00:29:04,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my question would be to Mr. Buckley is what have been the concerns for the past year and a half that have been raised by the fire department regarding their concerns with 911 in the community?

384
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:10,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Beginning with the lack of a training manual, there was no training manual.

385
00:29:10,978 --> 00:29:16,261
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty much a couple papers put together at the last second.

386
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:18,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So our members didn't have the

387
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,664
[SPEAKER_11]: correct training in order to train the new members of the civilian dispatch.

388
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,847
[SPEAKER_11]: We raised our concerns early about that.

389
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:31,590
[SPEAKER_11]: There still is no training manual.

390
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:42,881
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when the civilians started taking over in around February, we were noticing a lot of errors and we were trying to address it and see how we could fix it.

391
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:52,180
[SPEAKER_11]: We did ask in the beginning for a fire department supervisor over there, as well as did the dispatchers themselves.

392
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,101
[SPEAKER_11]: They were asking first they needed a fire department supervisor.

393
00:29:58,362 --> 00:30:02,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Would we love a fire department supervisor?

394
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:03,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

395
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:07,184
[SPEAKER_11]: But if the mayor's going to hire somebody to do that job, that's fine.

396
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:10,585
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as the job is being done and we're being dispatched,

397
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:16,793
[SPEAKER_11]: to all the calls in a timely fashion, we don't have a problem with who's doing the supervising.

398
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:22,554
[SPEAKER_11]: In our opinion, yeah, it should be someone on the fire side, as the police have on the police side.

399
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:25,154
[SPEAKER_11]: But I understand that the police are in charge of it.

400
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:40,317
[SPEAKER_11]: But we need to have a way of fixing any errors that take place in dispatch in a timely fashion, not sending communications and talking about it a week or two later.

401
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:44,819
[SPEAKER_11]: These are emergency situations that need to be addressed immediately.

402
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Those were our concerns.

403
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:52,265
[SPEAKER_11]: From what I know, Chief Buckley and Chief Gilberti met.

404
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:54,707
[SPEAKER_11]: They're addressing the situation.

405
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,468
[SPEAKER_11]: They're addressing our concerns that we have.

406
00:30:56,748 --> 00:31:04,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is 11 months later, but they did meet and allegedly they're addressing those issues.

407
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:09,799
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'd like to see that go forward and hopefully there's no issues going forward.

408
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:13,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, if I could.

409
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Please continue, Councilor Marks.

410
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:31,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on the October 26th letter that was written by local 1032 regarding concerns of method fire and in particular delays in dispatching calls and lack of supervision.

411
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:38,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if you can address that particular letter that was sent to the city administration.

412
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:42,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I sent that letter in October.

413
00:31:42,557 --> 00:31:44,038
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a meeting in November.

414
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:45,758
[SPEAKER_11]: I addressed our issues.

415
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:59,564
[SPEAKER_11]: This union doesn't feel that we really got listened to as the chiefs met last night, which is, you know, over a month since we had the meeting to discuss it.

416
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:07,668
[SPEAKER_11]: But those were our concerns from day one, delays and dispatches and not getting sent the calls that we should be.

417
00:32:10,702 --> 00:32:25,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, also, maybe if you can address the July 27th letter, which discusses manpower on assignments on multiple alarm fires and the dispatch policy that was created without any input from the fire department.

418
00:32:25,787 --> 00:32:26,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Has that been rectified?

419
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:28,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

420
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:33,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Gilberti spoke with the police department.

421
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:38,371
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe Chief Buckley, I don't know if he spoke with Lieutenant Rudolph or if he was in charge at that point, but

422
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:50,079
[SPEAKER_11]: He readdressed the, we have a dispatch paper for second alarm fires, and he reiterated that everyone is to be, I gotta go to a call, sorry.

423
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm at work right now.

424
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, be safe.

425
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,501
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so we don't have a, so Mr. Buckley's not with us.

426
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:00,082
[SPEAKER_20]: He had a call, so he's,

427
00:33:04,135 --> 00:33:05,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll hear from Harold McGillivray.

428
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:08,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to hear from Harold, Mr. President, Mr. McGillivray.

429
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:18,583
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, Mr. President, I guess what it takes to get things done in this community is a resolution by this Medford City Council to get people to act on certain items.

430
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:26,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad to see both chiefs met last night, Mr. President, after many emails going out regarding concerns of

431
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:34,253
[SPEAKER_05]: a lack of supervision and delays in dispatching over the past 11 months.

432
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:36,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they're being addressed, Mr. President.

433
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:52,968
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anything, I am happy that I put my name on this, Mr. President, to make sure on behalf of the 58,000 residents of this community that 911 indeed protects the residents of this community, Mr. President.

434
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:54,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

435
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:58,290
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually, before I move forward, we got a message.

436
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mr. Buckley is actually still with us.

437
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:04,093
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's recognize Eddie Buckley.

438
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:06,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

439
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:08,435
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a call for another station.

440
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:12,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

441
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:16,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any further questions for Mr. Buckley?

442
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I just made my statement, Mr. President.

443
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

444
00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:24,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Buckley.

445
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:25,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Buckley, do you have any further comments?

446
00:34:27,546 --> 00:34:28,006
[SPEAKER_11]: No, sir.

447
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:37,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, I'm just, I'm happy that the mayor is hiring a supervisor and I'm hoping that the chiefs have resolved the issues that this union has.

448
00:34:37,472 --> 00:34:38,052
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate it.

449
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:38,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

450
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:42,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I see the chiefs have their hands up.

451
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:49,939
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go to Chief Gilberti and then we'll go to Chief Buckley.

452
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:52,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

453
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:58,803
[SPEAKER_13]: These issues have come up that had been brought to my attention.

454
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:12,226
[SPEAKER_13]: And as soon as they were brought to my attention, I would sit down with Chief Buckley and Lieutenant Rudolph, and we would discuss the issues that the union had and that I had.

455
00:35:12,906 --> 00:35:19,287
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to say that they've both been very receptive in dealing with the issues.

456
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:27,885
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want you to think that we met last night for the first time to try and, you know,

457
00:35:29,476 --> 00:35:31,097
[SPEAKER_13]: address everybody's concerns.

458
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:32,997
[SPEAKER_13]: We have been meeting right along.

459
00:35:33,517 --> 00:35:38,039
[SPEAKER_13]: And as I said, Chief Buckley and Lieutenant Rudolph have been very receptive.

460
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:43,721
[SPEAKER_13]: And last night's meeting was very, very reassuring.

461
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:51,223
[SPEAKER_13]: As I said, Chief Buckley spoke with the dispatch union last night, and we had spoke this morning.

462
00:35:52,603 --> 00:35:57,185
[SPEAKER_13]: And going forward, I think that things will be, will be,

463
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:01,382
[SPEAKER_13]: everybody will be satisfied with the way we move forward.

464
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:03,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chief Gilberti.

465
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:04,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

466
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:06,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lox.

467
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:26,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, since we trained and lost a number of dispatches, I was wondering if there was any exit interviews given, and if so, what were the sentiments of the candidates that were trained and given a job here in the city of Medford, and then after a short period of time decided to leave, Mr. President.

468
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:29,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Lieutenant Rudolph has his hand up.

469
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:30,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

470
00:36:30,415 --> 00:36:33,657
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

471
00:36:33,697 --> 00:36:34,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Lieutenant Rudolph.

472
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:35,258
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

473
00:36:35,378 --> 00:36:35,899
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

474
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,139
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Lieutenant Mark Rudolph.

475
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:37,860
[SPEAKER_24]: Can everyone hear me?

476
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

477
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:39,781
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

478
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:45,725
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, first of all, I'd like to thank all of you for asking me to come before the council tonight via zoom.

479
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,007
[SPEAKER_24]: And I do want to answer a couple of quick questions for you.

480
00:36:50,228 --> 00:36:53,710
[SPEAKER_24]: Most recently, the three individuals that had left us,

481
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:55,985
[SPEAKER_24]: all left for a very similar reason.

482
00:36:56,005 --> 00:37:01,629
[SPEAKER_24]: They all lived within 5 to 15 minutes of the location that they got jobs at.

483
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:09,693
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was up in the north side of Route 93 and 495.

484
00:37:10,614 --> 00:37:16,598
[SPEAKER_24]: Each one of them lived only a very short time away from the location they went to, which was Tewksbury Regional.

485
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:23,382
[SPEAKER_24]: So having said that, we lost 3 very, very good dispatchers who were also excellent trainers.

486
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:26,947
[SPEAKER_24]: They had experience doing the training.

487
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:33,114
[SPEAKER_24]: One of them had previous experience with another agency anyway and was a good training officer there as well.

488
00:37:33,574 --> 00:37:38,220
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was a big hit on our ability to continue a solid in-service training.

489
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:50,961
[SPEAKER_24]: Beyond that, that was the only reason that all three of them chose to leave, was simply because they were matched with salary by that location as to what they were making in Medford.

490
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:55,963
[SPEAKER_24]: Because they wanted to lure them away, they went because they simply moved to where they lived.

491
00:37:56,623 --> 00:37:59,764
[SPEAKER_24]: So having that is a major concern for most people.

492
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:05,925
[SPEAKER_24]: The commute, which typically for two of them was up to 45 minutes every morning, and now it's five to 11 minutes.

493
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:10,466
[SPEAKER_24]: And the third moved to just southern New Hampshire, so it was very similar for the three of them.

494
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:14,587
[SPEAKER_24]: Those were the only things they gave to me as reasons for going.

495
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:15,727
[SPEAKER_24]: They loved the job.

496
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:17,287
[SPEAKER_24]: They enjoyed working in Medford.

497
00:38:17,648 --> 00:38:22,649
[SPEAKER_24]: They found it to be extremely challenging, even the person that came to us from Tewksbury originally.

498
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:37,020
[SPEAKER_24]: Had they not been, you know, wooed away basically by another agency that was similar to where they lived, we probably would still have those three and we wouldn't be going through the crisis situation that we are right now.

499
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:42,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Lieutenant Rudolph.

500
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:43,946
[SPEAKER_24]: You're welcome.

501
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:44,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

502
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:47,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions for Lieutenant Rudolph while we have him?

503
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:48,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

504
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley, I believe you had your hand up and Chief Buckley.

505
00:38:54,857 --> 00:39:06,104
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to add briefly to Chief Gilberti's comments that, you know, we have been meeting all along with this, on this, the dispatcher situation.

506
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:11,228
[SPEAKER_15]: And it wasn't just last night that we met and resolved these matters.

507
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:14,610
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been meeting all along, taking all these into considerations.

508
00:39:16,082 --> 00:39:17,884
[SPEAKER_15]: You just have to accept that that's been going on.

509
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:20,406
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't been ignoring these situations.

510
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:28,012
[SPEAKER_15]: And to add secondarily to the reasons that the three dispatchers left,

511
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:40,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Up in Tewksbury area, they have a regional dispatch center that the state funded and they needed bodies to fill that dispatch center.

512
00:39:40,513 --> 00:39:42,075
[SPEAKER_15]: And they were in a similar position as us.

513
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:46,580
[SPEAKER_15]: They could not hire dispatchers because the state wasn't capable of training dispatchers.

514
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:49,243
[SPEAKER_15]: So they went out and basically

515
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:53,841
[SPEAKER_15]: like head hunted active dispatchers left and right.

516
00:39:54,282 --> 00:40:04,551
[SPEAKER_15]: We actually paid more for dispatchers down here and they actually raised their prices up there to attract dispatchers to their center so they could open and they had state funding to do it.

517
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:11,578
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that hurt us and probably hurt a couple of other police departments and fire dispatchers in the area.

518
00:40:11,638 --> 00:40:15,081
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a number of reasons associated with why they left and,

519
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:22,098
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just really wanted my point was that we have been meeting all along on this issue.

520
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:23,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Dispatching, no problem.

521
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:24,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

522
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chief Buckley.

523
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviellola.

524
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:27,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

525
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:33,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I'm going to make it clear that the only agenda of this city council is the safety of the residents of Medford.

526
00:40:33,853 --> 00:40:37,195
[SPEAKER_18]: We have no other agenda other than that.

527
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:44,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Chief, whoever wants to answer, is the pay that we pay these dispatchers, is it on par with other cities and towns?

528
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:45,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we not paying enough money?

529
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:51,520
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what they get for salary, but are we on par with other communities?

530
00:40:58,778 --> 00:40:58,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

531
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:01,219
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

532
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:02,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Council, we are.

533
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,420
[SPEAKER_15]: We're better than most communities.

534
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:09,102
[SPEAKER_15]: We pay very respectful.

535
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:17,425
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that if it wasn't for, you know, the shutdown of state 9-1-1 training, we would have our ranks filled here very easily.

536
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:18,425
[SPEAKER_15]: What's

537
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:27,528
[SPEAKER_15]: demand for qualified, trained dispatchers.

538
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:33,071
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we've had a couple of interviews and we've brought a number of them in here, but they're looking for top dollar.

539
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:40,435
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can't pay one new dispatcher differently than the other dispatchers because they are technically unionized now.

540
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:42,836
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can only offer them what we can offer them.

541
00:41:42,856 --> 00:41:47,198
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a healthy, but some of the dispatchers that are out there looking for jobs are looking for a higher rate of pay.

542
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:47,539
[SPEAKER_15]: And so

543
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:52,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but very clearly we are very competitive in our salary dispatcher.

544
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:58,807
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just the only ones out there right now are, you know, qualified trained dispatchers who are looking for something better.

545
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:00,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

546
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:01,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chief Buckley.

547
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:01,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Lieutenant Rudolph.

548
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want to comment on that as well?

549
00:42:04,612 --> 00:42:07,774
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I just want to echo the same thing that Chief Buckley said.

550
00:42:08,355 --> 00:42:15,120
[SPEAKER_24]: Myself and Chief Gilberti have participated in every single interview of multiple applicants, along with Mr. Neil Osborne.

551
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:24,013
[SPEAKER_24]: We've had some unique candidates that came before us, several that really stood out with tremendous levels of experience.

552
00:42:24,633 --> 00:42:35,419
[SPEAKER_24]: And unfortunately, those two individuals, one did decide to take the job, and then at the last moment decided that it was still too big a pay cut for him to take it.

553
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,921
[SPEAKER_24]: The other person said the same thing.

554
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:39,402
[SPEAKER_24]: It was just much too big a pay cut.

555
00:42:39,762 --> 00:42:43,484
[SPEAKER_24]: Because they were both working at one, was at a state regional

556
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,353
[SPEAKER_24]: center, and the other was at a major metropolitan location.

557
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:53,717
[SPEAKER_24]: And that person chose not to take it as well, simply because it would have been too big a pay cut.

558
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,979
[SPEAKER_24]: Are we in a decent range?

559
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:04,005
[SPEAKER_24]: I think right now, as Chief Buckley said, we are actually in a better position than a lot of departments that don't pay very much around us.

560
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:10,110
[SPEAKER_24]: So we are very reasonable as far as what we have for salaries.

561
00:43:11,248 --> 00:43:23,858
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to reemphasize, though, that there is a distinct need for a qualified civilian dispatch supervisor who is not a police officer, who is not a firefighter, because neither one of myself or my

562
00:43:25,565 --> 00:43:33,530
[SPEAKER_24]: My partners on the far side even have any level of qualified training to actually do the job of a true dispatch supervisor.

563
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:39,814
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now, the dispatches, they're under the watchful eye of a shift commander on the police side.

564
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:43,417
[SPEAKER_24]: It's always been that way since the center opened in 1997.

565
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:51,622
[SPEAKER_24]: That does not mean that person who is watching them has any level of knowledge regarding the actual 911 process.

566
00:43:51,722 --> 00:43:53,423
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not qualified to use it at all.

567
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,491
[SPEAKER_24]: We're there to give guidance, and that's it.

568
00:43:56,711 --> 00:44:03,335
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't qualify them, we can't instruct them, we can't teach them anything other than basic common actions.

569
00:44:03,415 --> 00:44:07,737
[SPEAKER_24]: But as far as 911 equipment goes, we're dead in the water as supervisors there.

570
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:17,963
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's the need for a true civilian dispatcher who has the American Professional Communications Office's supervised training program, who has the APCO certified

571
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:21,184
[SPEAKER_24]: police training, the APCO certified fire training.

572
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:25,045
[SPEAKER_24]: They're literally trained as instructors and supervisors.

573
00:44:25,425 --> 00:44:33,728
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the key for us to become truly successful here and have one of the best run 9-1-1 centers locally in a small city the size of ours.

574
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:38,550
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we have the luxury of being a Boston or some other metropolitan city?

575
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:39,630
[SPEAKER_24]: Not really.

576
00:44:40,751 --> 00:44:44,312
[SPEAKER_24]: Most of those places all have civilian dispatchers running their operation.

577
00:44:45,395 --> 00:44:55,158
[SPEAKER_24]: They may report to a command officer in the police or the fire department, whoever manages it, but the reality is that dispatch supervisor is a dispatcher at heart.

578
00:44:55,618 --> 00:45:02,440
[SPEAKER_24]: They live it, they breathe it, and they train those around them to do the job that they can do as well.

579
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:10,603
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's the true reasoning why we need someone who is highly qualified, has a huge skill set to be able to do that type of work.

580
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:14,804
[SPEAKER_24]: And there isn't a police officer in Medford or a firefighter in Medford,

581
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:21,726
[SPEAKER_24]: that has that level of skill set and capabilities and licensed certifications to be able to perform that job.

582
00:45:22,146 --> 00:45:24,829
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to let the council know that as well.

583
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:26,590
[SPEAKER_24]: And I thank you for allowing me to speak.

584
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

585
00:45:28,011 --> 00:45:33,817
[SPEAKER_18]: So do we do we have candidates in the pipeline that were interviewing for this job?

586
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:37,620
[SPEAKER_24]: Lieutenant Rudolph again.

587
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:44,128
[SPEAKER_24]: We, Chief Gilberti, myself and Mr. Osborne interviewed a gentleman about a week and a half ago.

588
00:45:44,148 --> 00:45:47,649
[SPEAKER_24]: I will have the results of the background investigation tomorrow.

589
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:55,752
[SPEAKER_24]: And depending on what the background investigation reveals or confirms, we should be able to move forward with a potential offer.

590
00:45:57,332 --> 00:46:01,274
[SPEAKER_24]: But again, it depends on the full results and I don't have that report until tomorrow.

591
00:46:01,314 --> 00:46:02,594
[SPEAKER_24]: We were still waiting for a couple of

592
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:06,253
[SPEAKER_24]: previous employers to supply us with their paperwork on it.

593
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:11,558
[SPEAKER_24]: So I should be able to answer that question probably within the next 48 to 72 hours.

594
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:16,822
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we eligible for any state or federal funds to pay for this person?

595
00:46:16,922 --> 00:46:24,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Or maybe to sweeten the salary to get, as we're being purged, we may have to purge other departments.

596
00:46:26,448 --> 00:46:36,411
[SPEAKER_24]: As far as police funding goes, we don't have any capability of using 9-1-1 state grant money for hiring personnel.

597
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:46,935
[SPEAKER_24]: It's used for equipment purchases, it's used for upgrade purposes of equipment, it's used for training for our personnel, but it doesn't pay salaries and you can't use it as part of that.

598
00:46:47,675 --> 00:46:50,316
[SPEAKER_24]: It does pay for overtime to send them to training only.

599
00:46:51,068 --> 00:46:51,408
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

600
00:46:51,648 --> 00:46:58,471
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, please understand, please understand that the only agenda of this council is the safety of the citizens of Medford.

601
00:46:59,031 --> 00:46:59,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

602
00:46:59,752 --> 00:47:02,233
[SPEAKER_24]: And I agree with you 100% Councilor.

603
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:07,115
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's the role that I try to ensure that our dispatchers are doing their very best.

604
00:47:07,155 --> 00:47:10,256
[SPEAKER_24]: But again, keep in mind, I have 39 years of police experience.

605
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:17,739
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not a firefighter, I'm not an EMT, and I'm certainly not a dispatcher, but I'm probably in my position

606
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:25,894
[SPEAKER_24]: the single person right now that has the highest level of authority over them, but I can't train them.

607
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:34,777
[SPEAKER_24]: I can only provide the proper training through the right venues to get them increased certifications and increased training programs.

608
00:47:36,558 --> 00:47:37,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

609
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:40,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Lieutenant Rudolph.

610
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

611
00:47:42,741 --> 00:47:43,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

612
00:47:43,221 --> 00:47:47,243
[SPEAKER_21]: Just to answer Vice President Caraviello's

613
00:47:48,585 --> 00:48:12,222
[SPEAKER_21]: question because Lieutenant Rudolph did answer the most recent interview, which is in process, but I just wanted to also make you aware of about six to eight weeks ago, approximately, I did do final interviews for two strong candidates, both of whom were very well trained, had a great deal of experience, both probably capable of being supervisors.

614
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:18,327
[SPEAKER_21]: We did offer the job of dispatcher to both of those candidates, and they both turned them down due to the

615
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:19,572
[SPEAKER_21]: the salary.

616
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:33,240
[SPEAKER_21]: One of those candidates was very well-versed on the police side only, and one was well-versed on police and had an extreme amount of experience on the fire side.

617
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,922
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is a potential for this job.

618
00:48:35,982 --> 00:48:37,843
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just wanted to be extremely clear.

619
00:48:39,244 --> 00:48:43,407
[SPEAKER_21]: We did have two strong candidates about six to eight weeks ago, but we did lose them both.

620
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:45,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

621
00:48:45,848 --> 00:48:46,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

622
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,285
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Mr. President.

623
00:48:48,305 --> 00:49:02,157
[SPEAKER_09]: So to revert back to the first comment we made, and just to be clear, this is why we asked for this meeting.

624
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:12,987
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter how it went out, the letter went out to the mayor, the word got out to the community that there was a safety crisis with 911.

625
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:20,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it's with hiring, whether it's with policy, whichever it is, we needed to get answers, and that's it.

626
00:49:21,691 --> 00:49:30,474
[SPEAKER_09]: And from what I've heard from the chief of police, from what I've heard from the chief of fire, from what I've heard from the union representation so far, is to me,

627
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:37,090
[SPEAKER_09]: exactly what we needed to share to our constituents that brought these questions and these concerns to us.

628
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:38,891
[SPEAKER_09]: No other reason.

629
00:49:39,912 --> 00:49:40,192
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

630
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:45,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not trying to dig anything up or trying to find something that's not there or say that it's not safe.

631
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:55,003
[SPEAKER_09]: It's refreshing that Lieutenant Rudolph, frightening but refreshing that he said that we don't have anybody qualified

632
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:03,261
[SPEAKER_09]: to run that office right now, and that's probably the most important public safety position right now.

633
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:12,106
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the first line of safety and help for all our constituents, whether it's with violence or whether it's with health.

634
00:50:13,306 --> 00:50:24,912
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the reason why having the communication, having the chief of police and the chief of fire here to answer these questions publicly to us is why it's so important that we did this.

635
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:25,853
[SPEAKER_09]: No other reason.

636
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:28,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank them for coming out and doing that.

637
00:50:30,811 --> 00:50:42,428
[SPEAKER_09]: And understand, this won't be the last time, Mr. President, that this councilor will contact or put a resolution through if I feel that we need some answers by leaders in our community.

638
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:48,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much, and I appreciate the answers that were given.

639
00:50:48,406 --> 00:50:55,748
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that we have a strong understanding of what now these concerns are and where we're moving to.

640
00:50:56,028 --> 00:50:56,528
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

641
00:50:56,608 --> 00:50:57,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

642
00:50:57,629 --> 00:50:59,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

643
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:00,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

644
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to be able to understand, Mr. President,

645
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:09,772
[SPEAKER_05]: This issue of civilian 911 was being discussed.

646
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:25,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time when they decided to move forward, I'd like to be privy to what the discussions were around hiring a civilian 911 supervisor at that time, a year and a half ago, if any.

647
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:34,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think it's important, Mr. President, there's not one member behind this reel that I've heard once say, we don't need the position.

648
00:51:35,422 --> 00:51:41,986
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not one person for the last three weeks, I've never heard one person say, this is not needed, Mr. President.

649
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:47,329
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been asking questions on why it's an emergency right now, absolutely.

650
00:51:47,629 --> 00:51:52,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll continue to ask them, like Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello have mentioned.

651
00:51:53,672 --> 00:52:02,958
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd like to know, Mr. President, a year and a half ago, when the powers to be sat down and started discussing how this 911 center was going to work.

652
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:13,263
[SPEAKER_05]: What were the discussions around hiring someone from the start that had that supervisory skill to oversee this department, Mr. President?

653
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:19,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And to make sure that the proper unified training manuals were set up, Mr. President.

654
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:28,270
[SPEAKER_05]: To make sure the rules and procedures and policies were set up to set up our workers for success, Mr. President.

655
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,431
[SPEAKER_05]: and not failure.

656
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,913
[SPEAKER_05]: People leave for a lot of different reasons.

657
00:52:32,353 --> 00:52:46,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Some may be location, but others may leave, Mr. President, for other reasons, such as lack of supervision and lack of a clear, defined training manual and other reasons, Mr. President.

658
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:51,750
[SPEAKER_05]: They may not state it, Mr. President, but they leave for a host of reasons.

659
00:52:52,050 --> 00:53:00,536
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd like to know why from the inception that we did not hire, don't forget we just went through the budget this June 2020.

660
00:53:01,657 --> 00:53:08,823
[SPEAKER_05]: If this has been discussed for the last year and a half, why was it in the June 2020 budget, Mr. President?

661
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:12,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we looking at a supplemental after the fact?

662
00:53:13,465 --> 00:53:22,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to know why this wasn't discussed, and if it was, I'd like to know why and why it didn't get in to the planning of this 911 center.

663
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:37,345
[SPEAKER_05]: As Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, to me that's critical to have someone that oversees and has the experience in both police and fire and able to put this together and create the policies and manuals and the hiring and the training.

664
00:53:39,326 --> 00:53:41,767
[SPEAKER_05]: 101, Mr. President, of creating a dispatch center.

665
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:44,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to know why that didn't happen originally.

666
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

667
00:53:46,788 --> 00:53:48,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Would anybody like to comment on that?

668
00:53:48,688 --> 00:53:49,548
[SPEAKER_21]: I can comment on that.

669
00:53:50,229 --> 00:53:51,949
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't around a year and a half ago.

670
00:53:51,969 --> 00:54:05,872
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that the only one present probably, because I know it was Chief Sacco and Mayor Burke at the time, and I know Chief Gilberti can probably comment, but I just want to reiterate that we did have police

671
00:54:06,399 --> 00:54:12,280
[SPEAKER_21]: and then we had fire in dispatch up until February, March, right around when COVID hit.

672
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,541
[SPEAKER_21]: And at that time, the issues of the training manual were being worked on.

673
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:20,142
[SPEAKER_21]: So I know it did take time, and we got to this point.

674
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:32,285
[SPEAKER_21]: We had almost a semi-emergency meeting on this in October, and then a second one in November, which is leading us to where we are today, requesting a 911 supervisor, which we did in the supplemental budget.

675
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:34,866
[SPEAKER_21]: But I understand your reasonings for not

676
00:54:36,177 --> 00:54:40,640
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm here tonight to explain why we're here, how we're planning to fix it and why we think this is so essential.

677
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:10,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

678
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:12,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

679
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:24,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Since the beginning, the union has, my union has always looked to have a supervisor from the fire side in the dispatch center.

680
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:38,248
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what I was advocating for with the prior administration to have a, at least at the rank of lieutenant into the dispatch center to oversee just the fire side.

681
00:55:39,387 --> 00:55:49,955
[SPEAKER_13]: The police at the time had their commanding officer was in the dispatch center, and we felt that we needed representation on the fire side.

682
00:55:50,816 --> 00:55:52,537
[SPEAKER_13]: That never came to fruition.

683
00:55:53,538 --> 00:56:08,530
[SPEAKER_13]: When Mayor Longo Hearn took over, we approached that subject again, and we worked on, now we're here at a civilian dispatcher who's qualified at both disciplines, and will be able to oversee

684
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:10,303
[SPEAKER_13]: the center.

685
00:56:11,044 --> 00:56:14,631
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where it was back a year and a half ago.

686
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:20,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I was advocating always for a fire dispatch supervisor only.

687
00:56:22,307 --> 00:56:29,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. President, just so I understand, and I appreciate Chief Gilberti's response.

688
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:40,354
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the chief was advocating for a fire supervisor, and I'm sure the police were advocating for a police supervisor, we ended up instead of having

689
00:56:41,717 --> 00:56:47,941
[SPEAKER_05]: both Mr. President, no trained supervisor at all for the past year and a half.

690
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:56,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is no reflection on Lieutenant Rudolph, because he stated himself that this is not really his expertise.

691
00:56:56,886 --> 00:57:03,130
[SPEAKER_05]: And he can't really train, he can't really oversee, because he's not aware of what's taking place.

692
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:08,412
[SPEAKER_05]: in the dispatch to really supervise it, Mr. President.

693
00:57:08,432 --> 00:57:18,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I just don't understand how you may be advocating for something, but it resulted in no supervision at all for the past year and a half.

694
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:26,258
[SPEAKER_05]: And I should say no trained supervision, no expertise in 911 for the last year and a half.

695
00:57:26,618 --> 00:57:29,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the shortcoming, Mr. President, that I have a concern with.

696
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:35,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've had the last 11 months to do something, and finally we're getting a paper.

697
00:57:35,442 --> 00:57:41,525
[SPEAKER_05]: In my opinion, if this was such an emergency, I would have sent it out as its own paper, Mr. President.

698
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:50,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Having a reverse 911 supervisor as its own paper, not mixed in with nine other items, like an interpreter.

699
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:53,333
[SPEAKER_05]: and other things, Mr. President, in there.

700
00:57:53,613 --> 00:57:55,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be how I would have handled it.

701
00:57:55,856 --> 00:58:00,361
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I'm not the chief executive officer of this city, Mr. President.

702
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how they chose to handle it.

703
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:07,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Because maybe if it was submitted in that fashion, this would have been handled three weeks ago.

704
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:18,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, so I'm still not happy with the answers regarding the lack of supervision, the lack of a trained personnel to oversee this department, Mr. President.

705
00:58:19,536 --> 00:58:27,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't know what this has resulted in, the lack of manuals, policies, and procedures over the last year and a half.

706
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,523
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know potential lawsuits or anything else that may be brewing in this community, Mr. President.

707
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:39,525
[SPEAKER_05]: over this 9-1-1, and I guess that'll speak for itself, Mr. President, at some point.

708
00:58:39,705 --> 00:58:40,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Council Members.

709
00:58:40,425 --> 00:58:46,386
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a number of Councilors that have questions, but we also haven't heard from Harold McGilvery from the Police Department Union.

710
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Council care if we hear from him and then we move forward with the questions?

711
00:58:51,688 --> 00:59:01,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because he was supposed to follow Mr. Buckley, but when Mr. Buckley went, or Eddie Buckley went, then the Chiefs weighed back on, they responded to his concerns.

712
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,431
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's hear from,

713
00:59:03,447 --> 00:59:06,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give away from the method Police Department.

714
00:59:06,988 --> 00:59:07,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Union president.

715
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Mister Montgomery.

716
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:15,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, president.

717
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:16,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?

718
00:59:16,491 --> 00:59:17,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we can.

719
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:17,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

720
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:19,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

721
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:21,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Harry McGilvery 100 Main Street.

722
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:24,553
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm the president of the method Police Patrolman's Association.

723
00:59:25,808 --> 00:59:29,730
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to get off topic real quick before I get going.

724
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:34,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to acknowledge the fact that the new police station opened last week.

725
00:59:35,532 --> 00:59:39,874
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's pretty impressive building.

726
00:59:40,895 --> 00:59:44,676
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to acknowledge former Mayor Burke for

727
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:47,961
[SPEAKER_14]: getting that done.

728
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:55,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Current mayor, Longo Curran, councillors Caraviello, Mox, Dello Russo, Scott, Kelly, Layton, Falco.

729
00:59:55,927 --> 01:00:01,993
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a really long time coming, and it's now come to fruition.

730
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,855
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's an impressive building.

731
01:00:05,515 --> 01:00:13,042
[SPEAKER_14]: And the membership of the Patrolmen's Union and the Supervisors' Union, I don't think we realized the

732
01:00:13,812 --> 01:00:18,796
[SPEAKER_14]: the conditions we were working under until we got into that new building.

733
01:00:18,936 --> 01:00:31,647
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really something to be in a new building with 21st century technology and some real nice comforts of working in a clean office space.

734
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:35,010
[SPEAKER_14]: And like I said, when we broke ground

735
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:41,449
[SPEAKER_14]: the red side is still working in the same building.

736
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:48,214
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope that the city does move quickly to rectify that situation.

737
01:00:49,235 --> 01:00:52,778
[SPEAKER_14]: So now I'll get on to the 9, 1, 1, situation.

738
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:57,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to create a timeline, I was approached by a few of the 9-1-1

739
01:01:06,812 --> 01:01:09,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke with them at the TPW building when they were down there.

740
01:01:10,673 --> 01:01:18,294
[SPEAKER_14]: And I gave them an explanation of what being members of the union would entail.

741
01:01:19,295 --> 01:01:28,096
[SPEAKER_14]: I recommended that they also reach out to Steve Salt of the Teamsters, Eddie Barclay of 1032, and then make a decision.

742
01:01:29,057 --> 01:01:35,578
[SPEAKER_14]: They contacted me a week or so later, said they wanted to really go forward and join our union.

743
01:01:36,617 --> 01:01:43,883
[SPEAKER_14]: And we went, you know, we contacted our office and we put the process in place.

744
01:01:44,264 --> 01:01:47,607
[SPEAKER_14]: They signed union cards and they became members of our union.

745
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:52,731
[SPEAKER_14]: From the moment they became members of the union, we've been representing them.

746
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:54,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I have met

747
01:01:56,261 --> 01:02:01,045
[SPEAKER_14]: on a regular basis with Chief Barclay and with Chief Gilberti.

748
01:02:01,086 --> 01:02:05,389
[SPEAKER_14]: I met with Chief Barclay one-on-one.

749
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:11,315
[SPEAKER_14]: I've met with Chief Barclay and Chief Gilberti together in the old police station.

750
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:15,578
[SPEAKER_14]: And I am the representative.

751
01:02:16,661 --> 01:02:18,642
[SPEAKER_14]: I am the bargaining agent for those folks.

752
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:26,626
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to say that I never had any impression that there was ever a public safety emergency.

753
01:02:28,887 --> 01:02:36,571
[SPEAKER_14]: It was brought to my attention by one of the dispatchers when he saw an agenda item on the council.

754
01:02:37,091 --> 01:02:41,173
[SPEAKER_14]: I reached out to several Councilors, and it was the first time I was hearing all of that.

755
01:02:43,834 --> 01:02:45,135
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say right now that

756
01:02:45,609 --> 01:02:50,051
[SPEAKER_14]: these individuals that are working here as public safety dispatchers.

757
01:02:51,592 --> 01:02:54,353
[SPEAKER_14]: They're working hard to do a good job.

758
01:02:54,393 --> 01:02:56,795
[SPEAKER_14]: They're getting better every day.

759
01:02:56,915 --> 01:02:58,275
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to do a good job.

760
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:03,438
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're not reinventing the wheel here.

761
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:10,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Civilian dispatching takes place pretty much around the country, around the Commonwealth.

762
01:03:11,442 --> 01:03:13,163
[SPEAKER_14]: We're probably getting into this late.

763
01:03:13,881 --> 01:03:17,282
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't speak for the fire union, but we negotiated those jobs away.

764
01:03:18,402 --> 01:03:24,784
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm taken back by some of the things I've heard here tonight.

765
01:03:24,824 --> 01:03:26,925
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm surprised we're not in an executive session.

766
01:03:27,885 --> 01:03:30,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd probably be more comfortable in an executive session.

767
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:40,089
[SPEAKER_14]: I can clearly state for a fact that the three dispatchers that left did not leave because of a lack of supervision.

768
01:03:43,594 --> 01:03:47,596
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to get into the reasons because this isn't the time or place to be doing this.

769
01:03:48,456 --> 01:03:52,398
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor set up several meetings at City Hall.

770
01:03:53,118 --> 01:03:58,740
[SPEAKER_14]: They brought in an individual who is a professional civilian dispatcher.

771
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:02,782
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had a plan in place as to how to

772
01:04:10,288 --> 01:04:22,077
[SPEAKER_14]: to go into an executive session and speak as to what's been going on behind the scenes, but I'm not going to do it here.

773
01:04:23,558 --> 01:04:25,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never seen anything like this, actually.

774
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,204
[SPEAKER_14]: My 15 years as a union president that my membership is being talked about like this.

775
01:04:33,886 --> 01:04:34,726
[SPEAKER_14]: It's disheartening.

776
01:04:36,688 --> 01:04:39,610
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not very happy right now.

777
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:44,534
[SPEAKER_14]: They're working without a contract, growing pains.

778
01:04:45,454 --> 01:04:54,415
[SPEAKER_14]: We, both police and fire side, have to adjust to not having police officers and firefighters dispatching us.

779
01:04:55,715 --> 01:05:00,356
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just, it's heartening as to some of the things that I heard here tonight.

780
01:05:03,657 --> 01:05:06,277
[SPEAKER_14]: If anybody has any questions, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

781
01:05:06,297 --> 01:05:10,438
[SPEAKER_14]: But like I said, I think this is something that should have been done in executive session.

782
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:12,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Harold.

783
01:05:13,638 --> 01:05:16,159
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Councilor Bears and Vice President Caraviello.

784
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:16,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

785
01:05:16,939 --> 01:05:18,040
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

786
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:25,341
[SPEAKER_22]: I think what Councilor Mark said and what Mayor Legault-Kern previously said actually gets to the heart of the issue around this paper.

787
01:05:25,362 --> 01:05:34,804
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think there's any disagreement with hiring a 911 supervisor or whatever else is needed to make sure that this office has everything it needs to function effectively.

788
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:38,025
[SPEAKER_22]: But that's not the decision that this council has.

789
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:41,421
[SPEAKER_22]: We can't just hire, approve the 9-1-1 supervisor.

790
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:45,605
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been lumped into a large package, and that package has been tabled.

791
01:05:45,665 --> 01:05:59,657
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd like to ask the mayor, if the mayor's still here, do you intend to put a standalone 9-1-1 supervisor item before the council, or will a revised appropriation be put before the council to address the issues that we've laid out?

792
01:05:59,677 --> 01:06:01,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

793
01:06:02,399 --> 01:06:02,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Longo-Kurt.

794
01:06:03,802 --> 01:06:06,063
[SPEAKER_21]: that we're able to fund that going forward until fiscal year 22.

795
01:06:06,103 --> 01:06:06,983
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is what we've

796
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:42,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Dave, I don't know if you have any clarifications on any legalities that need to happen with regard to that, but I think that it's as simple as that.

797
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:45,719
[SPEAKER_25]: Point of information, Mr. President.

798
01:06:45,779 --> 01:06:47,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

799
01:06:47,801 --> 01:07:00,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, and I don't want to speak for my colleague, but I think what he was asking was if the paper for $740,000 was amended or the police supervisor position was sliced out, I don't think you'd get much pushback from this council.

800
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:01,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all understand that there's a need for that,

801
01:07:02,421 --> 01:07:22,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the question is whether or not we want to support a supplemental budget for 740 K. Um, and there are some items in there that, um, some of us have concern over and some items in there that some of us, um, uh, some items that aren't in there that some of us have, um, but I think all of us behind this rail would be supportive of a standalone paper to amend the supplemental budget.

802
01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:26,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that we didn't have to go through the process of using the existing funds in the police budget.

803
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:29,731
[SPEAKER_03]: so that we can use those funds to hire the dispatchers that we so need.

804
01:07:30,032 --> 01:07:36,495
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to hire this police dispatch supervisor, a dispatch center supervisor, so that they can perform in-house training.

805
01:07:37,776 --> 01:07:40,617
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can't get the training done at the state level, we need to get it done somewhere.

806
01:07:41,198 --> 01:07:43,479
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to keep their continuing ed certifications up.

807
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:44,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard from

808
01:07:45,889 --> 01:07:51,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Lieutenant Rudolph saying that, you know, there's really no one that's in either department that's qualified to perform the functions of training.

809
01:07:52,437 --> 01:07:56,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just trying to clarify, Zach, I think that's what you were getting at, right?

810
01:07:56,943 --> 01:08:01,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that if you give us a paper that's for the, you know, whatever it is, $100,000 or whatever that line item was,

811
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:05,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the council will stand in the way of that.

812
01:08:05,813 --> 01:08:10,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that still leaves the argument relative to the other items that the council has been discussing and the other items that are on that paper.

813
01:08:11,439 --> 01:08:17,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, however, you know, I think it'll address the issue of the nine one one call center supervisor, uh, in relatively short order.

814
01:08:20,868 --> 01:08:21,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your point of information.

815
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:22,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

816
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:23,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

817
01:08:24,631 --> 01:08:26,032
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, well, Councilor Knight's right.

818
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:28,535
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's one way out of this as one option.

819
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:32,379
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would think we'd all be happy to vote for approving a standalone paper.

820
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:44,331
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the other option would be to have a revised paper that reflects the request of this council so that we're not throwing out anything else that's in the appropriation that we might want to approve as well.

821
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:48,475
[SPEAKER_22]: So it sounds to me like the answer to my question is no.

822
01:08:48,942 --> 01:08:50,804
[SPEAKER_22]: There isn't an intent to put a standalone paper.

823
01:08:50,844 --> 01:08:52,225
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to use existing funds.

824
01:08:53,526 --> 01:09:00,191
[SPEAKER_22]: Does the administration have any intent to revise supplemental appropriation before this council, before the end of the year?

825
01:09:02,994 --> 01:09:10,400
[SPEAKER_21]: The supplemental budget has to be approved by tonight because you have your tax classification hearing next week on December 8th.

826
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,844
[SPEAKER_21]: So for lack of time, we won't be able to put on a separate paper.

827
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:21,494
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm hopeful that maybe tonight you will take it off the table and discuss the supplemental budget as a whole.

828
01:09:22,154 --> 01:09:24,635
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel that those are the needs of the community right now.

829
01:09:25,055 --> 01:09:32,979
[SPEAKER_21]: And I hear you loud and clear that there's an election supervisor position that we are currently working on reviewing.

830
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:43,685
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have meetings set up as early as next week to continue that review in hopes to make sure we do the best we can for our elections department and city clerk.

831
01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:47,657
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we don't approve that tonight, what's going to happen?

832
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:53,161
[SPEAKER_22]: Is the intent just that we will no longer appropriate any of the funds that have been proposed in the supplemental budget?

833
01:09:54,682 --> 01:09:59,245
[SPEAKER_21]: Since tonight is the last night to approve the supplemental budget, yes, the paper will die.

834
01:09:59,565 --> 01:10:07,810
[SPEAKER_21]: And the funds will be reverted to free cash after the fiscal year 21 is over.

835
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:10,872
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

836
01:10:10,892 --> 01:10:11,673
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

837
01:10:12,183 --> 01:10:12,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

838
01:10:13,163 --> 01:10:15,424
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Vice President Caraviello and then Councilor Knight.

839
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:16,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

840
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:17,585
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

841
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:21,547
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think Councilor Marks brought up a point earlier in his discussion.

842
01:10:23,087 --> 01:10:32,191
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is no reflection on this current merit, but why in the beginning when this department was started, why didn't the two chiefs insist on a supervisor?

843
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:36,473
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, how do you start a department with no supervision?

844
01:10:38,118 --> 01:10:39,539
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's really the biggest question.

845
01:10:39,879 --> 01:10:48,846
[SPEAKER_18]: This should have been dealt with 15 months ago, right from day one, not at this time when the horse was out of the barn.

846
01:10:50,627 --> 01:11:00,434
[SPEAKER_18]: As I said, in business, if you're in a business and you start a department up with nobody to run the department, how do you expect that department to ever be successful?

847
01:11:01,055 --> 01:11:03,697
[SPEAKER_18]: These people have no manuals, no training, nothing.

848
01:11:05,698 --> 01:11:10,060
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, this is no reflection on this mayor, because she wasn't there for that.

849
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:21,064
[SPEAKER_18]: But as I said, the two chiefs should have got together and insisted on this way back when this first came out, and not now at this late stage in the game.

850
01:11:24,005 --> 01:11:24,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Gilberti.

851
01:11:26,246 --> 01:11:27,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

852
01:11:27,186 --> 01:11:27,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

853
01:11:27,546 --> 01:11:29,747
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of things I want to touch on.

854
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:46,336
[SPEAKER_13]: When this whole civilian dispatch began, I was advocating for a fire supervisor.

855
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:58,604
[SPEAKER_13]: My office training division had oversight of the 911 center for the police side when it was in our building.

856
01:11:59,665 --> 01:12:06,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Years ago, there used to be a lieutenant who was part of the dispatching crew in the fire

857
01:12:06,841 --> 01:12:07,661
[SPEAKER_13]: dispatch center.

858
01:12:08,202 --> 01:12:13,725
[SPEAKER_13]: And when he retired, that position was eliminated and then they were all firefighters.

859
01:12:14,085 --> 01:12:18,147
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was the supervision of that was taken over by the training division.

860
01:12:18,788 --> 01:12:25,291
[SPEAKER_13]: So there was always oversight on our side through my training division.

861
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:35,297
[SPEAKER_13]: But when I was unsuccessful in getting a fire supervisor, that's when Mayor Lungo-Koehn,

862
01:12:36,774 --> 01:12:40,897
[SPEAKER_13]: we began to talk about a supervisor for the entire center.

863
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:45,841
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a little bit more difficult now to have oversight now that they're in the new building.

864
01:12:47,422 --> 01:13:00,612
[SPEAKER_13]: So having said that, as far as the money paper goes, I just want to, and the mayor can correct me if I'm wrong, I believe a part of that money that's on the paper before you,

865
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:04,093
[SPEAKER_13]: has to do with repairs to fire stations.

866
01:13:05,374 --> 01:13:18,219
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would ask that you really consider passing that paper this evening, because a large chunk of that money is going to go towards some major repairs that we have in the outlying stations.

867
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:20,700
[SPEAKER_21]: That's correct, Chief.

868
01:13:21,253 --> 01:13:21,793
[SPEAKER_21]: That's correct.

869
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:31,039
[SPEAKER_21]: The stations, the schools and routine maintenance for our new police station and new library that's coming online over the summer.

870
01:13:31,059 --> 01:13:40,545
[SPEAKER_21]: 200,000 can go a long way along with the facilities director that the council me included when I was on the council advocated for year after year after year.

871
01:13:40,565 --> 01:13:46,089
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've been asking for that for two, two administrations.

872
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:46,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

873
01:13:49,941 --> 01:13:51,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chief Gilberti.

874
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:54,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Vice President Caraviello, did you have any further questions?

875
01:13:55,225 --> 01:13:55,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

876
01:13:56,486 --> 01:13:57,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Layton.

877
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:58,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

878
01:13:59,629 --> 01:14:07,875
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor said something relative to the supplemental budget and how if it's not passed this evening, then it dies and the money would revert to free cash come the next fiscal year.

879
01:14:09,316 --> 01:14:17,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anybody from the administration that can speak to the impact that this will have on our levy limit, our new growth?

880
01:14:18,669 --> 01:14:20,210
[SPEAKER_03]: for the upcoming fiscal year?

881
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:24,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe we have Alicia- In terms of dollars and cents, Mr. President.

882
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:24,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

883
01:14:26,891 --> 01:14:29,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia, would you like to take that question from Councilor Knight?

884
01:14:30,072 --> 01:14:31,533
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, Honorable Councilors.

885
01:14:31,573 --> 01:14:31,793
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

886
01:14:32,473 --> 01:14:34,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Through the Chair to Councilor Knight.

887
01:14:34,894 --> 01:14:39,475
[SPEAKER_26]: So what will happen is we want to raise as much as we can towards the tax levy limit.

888
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:46,297
[SPEAKER_26]: If this money isn't appropriate to amend the budget, we would have to take it from reserves, which would be free cash.

889
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:52,218
[SPEAKER_26]: part of the tax rate recap calculation.

890
01:14:52,378 --> 01:15:00,741
[SPEAKER_26]: So because it's coming from unrestricted government aid as a program to the budget, that's why we would need it to be passed before the tax rate is set.

891
01:15:01,221 --> 01:15:05,803
[SPEAKER_26]: If you do not pass it, it just means you'd have to appropriate it from free cash.

892
01:15:05,843 --> 01:15:08,304
[SPEAKER_26]: You could not appropriate it after the tax rate is set.

893
01:15:09,424 --> 01:15:11,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wouldn't apply to the levy limit for the next fiscal year?

894
01:15:13,366 --> 01:15:13,826
[SPEAKER_26]: It would not.

895
01:15:14,386 --> 01:15:16,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And is any of this money applying to new growth for the next fiscal year?

896
01:15:18,493 --> 01:15:18,693
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

897
01:15:19,593 --> 01:15:30,637
[SPEAKER_26]: We had new growth already certified at the 1.77, which your honorable body rescinded 703,000 back to free cash of the new growth.

898
01:15:31,097 --> 01:15:31,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

899
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:32,338
[SPEAKER_26]: Certified.

900
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:43,562
[SPEAKER_26]: And this is the unrestricted government aid from local aid that we're trying to use to increase the city budget appropriation for the positions on the paper.

901
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:52,042
[SPEAKER_03]: and the benefit of increasing the city budget is because it would allow you to have an increased levy limit next fiscal year?

902
01:15:52,062 --> 01:15:56,643
[SPEAKER_26]: Your levy limit is based on the 2.5% of your previous fiscal year's budget, right?

903
01:15:56,883 --> 01:15:57,763
[SPEAKER_26]: Plus your new growth.

904
01:15:58,323 --> 01:16:00,644
[SPEAKER_26]: This paper is just amending the budget.

905
01:16:01,024 --> 01:16:06,606
[SPEAKER_26]: Whenever you're setting the tax rate, what the tax rate's actually doing is it's raising taxes to pay for the budget that was voted.

906
01:16:07,446 --> 01:16:12,567
[SPEAKER_26]: So if we amend right now to add more positions to last year's budget,

907
01:16:13,138 --> 01:16:14,839
[SPEAKER_26]: It has to be raised through the tax rate.

908
01:16:15,059 --> 01:16:18,621
[SPEAKER_26]: Otherwise, the only other funding source is free cash.

909
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:20,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Mr. President.

910
01:16:21,163 --> 01:16:22,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one second, Michael, if I can.

911
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:29,027
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm saying is if the budget is amended, the levy limit is based upon the previous year's budget, correct?

912
01:16:30,289 --> 01:16:31,229
[SPEAKER_26]: The levy limit is the 2.5%.

913
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:33,310
[SPEAKER_03]: How much money we were able to generate?

914
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,070
[SPEAKER_03]: How much money we spent?

915
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:34,610
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, yes.

916
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:42,571
[SPEAKER_26]: So we had estimated a 10% cut, and because the governor level funded local aid, we have additional aid that we can use towards the budget.

917
01:16:43,111 --> 01:16:44,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and what's the total amount?

918
01:16:47,772 --> 01:16:50,933
[SPEAKER_26]: So for Chapter 70, we had estimated $11,053,769.

919
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:51,353
[SPEAKER_26]: We actually got $12,143,306.

920
01:16:58,232 --> 01:17:01,934
[SPEAKER_26]: For unrestricted government aid, we had estimated $11 million.

921
01:17:02,154 --> 01:17:10,299
[SPEAKER_26]: You can just give me the bottom line for the increase over what we- Okay, so the increase to unrestricted government aid is $963,457.

922
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:11,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

923
01:17:12,821 --> 01:17:14,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks, point of information.

924
01:17:14,482 --> 01:17:16,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a point of information, Mr. President.

925
01:17:16,103 --> 01:17:22,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It was stated that this paper would die tonight because the tax rate

926
01:17:24,537 --> 01:17:26,658
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't vote on it after the tax rate's set.

927
01:17:27,798 --> 01:17:29,619
[SPEAKER_05]: When are we setting the tax rate, Mr. President?

928
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:36,542
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a committee the whole next Tuesday night, and I believe that will be next Tuesday night's agenda, if I'm correct.

929
01:17:37,642 --> 01:17:41,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have another week if the mayor wanted to submit a paper, a revised paper.

930
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:50,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Withdraw the current $740,000 supplemental amendment amount and submit a revised paper.

931
01:17:51,148 --> 01:17:54,209
[SPEAKER_05]: The tax rate won't be set before next Tuesday, correct?

932
01:17:55,321 --> 01:17:56,903
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds correct to me.

933
01:17:58,024 --> 01:17:59,125
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have another week.

934
01:18:00,326 --> 01:18:03,269
[SPEAKER_26]: The tax rate is set to be set next week.

935
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:05,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

936
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:10,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we vote on the paper Tuesday night, that'll be prior to us setting the tax rate.

937
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,280
[SPEAKER_05]: correct?

938
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:16,545
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but I have to, if you're going to do that, I have to put it into the recap to DLR.

939
01:18:16,585 --> 01:18:18,866
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's not that simple as you just pass it.

940
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:22,449
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually have to go in and put numbers into the recap.

941
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:27,774
[SPEAKER_26]: So I can't do it a few hours, you know, an hour before and then sit and hit submit.

942
01:18:27,914 --> 01:18:29,155
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not, no.

943
01:18:29,815 --> 01:18:35,100
[SPEAKER_26]: And when we give you your presentation for the committee of the whole, we have to give you the numbers.

944
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,462
[SPEAKER_26]: The numbers will change if you voted the paper.

945
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:42,596
[SPEAKER_26]: So the package we would give you wouldn't be the correct package for the tax rate.

946
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:55,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, so if the mayor submits a new paper next week amended to approve the supervisory position in 911, you know what the dollar amount is already.

947
01:18:56,143 --> 01:19:00,765
[SPEAKER_05]: This council, I think, has stated, and I won't speak for everyone, a commitment for that paper.

948
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:10,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why that can't be done next week, Mr. President, and added into the paperwork that Alicia is saying, because she's right, she probably needs time to do that.

949
01:19:10,072 --> 01:19:15,296
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think we're able to forecast now, we have a week to forecast that, Mr. President.

950
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why that can't be done.

951
01:19:19,499 --> 01:19:21,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that sounds correct to me.

952
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:24,883
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost seems like people don't want it done, Mr. President.

953
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:39,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alicia, if I may just kind of throw a wrench into it really quick, but I mean, I think there've been in years past where we've not necessarily set the tax rate on that night of the meeting.

954
01:19:39,037 --> 01:19:41,699
[SPEAKER_04]: We've, I think, tabled it for a week before in the past.

955
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so does the tax rate have to be set next Tuesday night?

956
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:47,324
[SPEAKER_04]: What if it was tabled to the 15th, the next meeting after that?

957
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:51,486
[SPEAKER_26]: And Alan.

958
01:19:51,506 --> 01:19:57,568
[SPEAKER_26]: I just noticed that DOR is behind on setting a lot of things.

959
01:19:57,648 --> 01:19:58,849
[SPEAKER_26]: I've submitted paper.

960
01:19:58,909 --> 01:20:01,429
[SPEAKER_26]: I've already submitted to them the balance sheet for free cash certification.

961
01:20:01,449 --> 01:20:01,890
[SPEAKER_26]: They're behind.

962
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,730
[SPEAKER_26]: They said they're behind trying to set tax rates.

963
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:07,271
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're a little concerned to be completely honest with you.

964
01:20:08,091 --> 01:20:12,133
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure if the inundation or why they're moving behind is because of COVID.

965
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:16,694
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't speak to that, but I'm honestly a little concerned

966
01:20:17,387 --> 01:20:20,430
[SPEAKER_26]: about pushing our tax rate out too far.

967
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:28,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Council March is all set.

968
01:20:28,487 --> 01:20:32,069
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Councilor Scarpelli, and then Ellen's waving a hand, so we're gonna call on Ellen next.

969
01:20:32,109 --> 01:20:33,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Councilor Scarpelli.

970
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:48,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that, obviously, to make it clear, this councilor didn't go put this paper on to get to an unresolved, it seems like this is, like it was being held hostage, now we're discussing the real issue, and that's not the true intent from this councilor.

971
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:52,980
[SPEAKER_09]: We had concerns about this issue, I wanna make sure that stands alone.

972
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,321
[SPEAKER_09]: But now that we're talking about it,

973
01:20:55,042 --> 01:20:56,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go a little bit through the timeline.

974
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,171
[SPEAKER_09]: We all want what's on that paper.

975
01:20:59,552 --> 01:21:01,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important that we get that facilities position in.

976
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:09,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I think most of those things that we were given some information, the positions without any job descriptions.

977
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:10,901
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the job descriptions.

978
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:12,663
[SPEAKER_09]: We understand how important they are.

979
01:21:12,723 --> 01:21:13,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's in order.

980
01:21:13,924 --> 01:21:15,945
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked to the Chief of Staff a few weeks ago.

981
01:21:16,526 --> 01:21:19,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez mentioned that he would set aside $100,000.

982
01:21:20,569 --> 01:21:24,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that one of the scenarios this council brought up is if we could

983
01:21:25,517 --> 01:21:30,703
[SPEAKER_09]: look at a date certain saying like I believe he said 90 days and he said he would not do that.

984
01:21:31,824 --> 01:21:42,495
[SPEAKER_09]: So now that we have the mayor on the call and I believe you said that the mayor said that she's already been in discussions moving that position that we're interested in moving it forward.

985
01:21:44,905 --> 01:22:00,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would assume that our committee would support, I think that's what we're going with a few weeks ago, that if it was a date certain that we would support the paper knowing that we're coming to a resolution for the position that's needed in the elections office.

986
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:03,227
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm right, if I'm wrong, forgive me, but

987
01:22:04,564 --> 01:22:14,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Could we possibly look at a date certain this evening saying that the 90 days, I believe that's what the Chief of Staff Rodriguez said, that 90 days is the process.

988
01:22:14,988 --> 01:22:25,232
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like, if I could remember it then, but he wouldn't commit to that because he's, I believe that he's not the mayor and he wouldn't do that to the mayor.

989
01:22:25,272 --> 01:22:27,973
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if maybe the mayor can add some light to that.

990
01:22:28,013 --> 01:22:29,113
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's not, I understand that.

991
01:22:29,693 --> 01:22:31,635
[SPEAKER_09]: If she doesn't feel comfortable, that's fine.

992
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:52,090
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we can have that assurance tonight, I would move this off the table, and I would vote forward with, you know, because from what I gather from Cora Kirby's, we're hoping that three months will give us enough time for our next election, unless the special elections come up after the Georgia runoff.

993
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:55,993
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you can, Madam Mayor, that'd be appreciative.

994
01:22:56,073 --> 01:22:56,313
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

995
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:57,014
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

996
01:22:57,034 --> 01:22:58,755
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

997
01:23:00,244 --> 01:23:13,352
[SPEAKER_21]: What I can do is, within three or four months, give you a full report of my review and investigation and let you know what we find with regards to if there is a need for that position.

998
01:23:13,972 --> 01:23:19,055
[SPEAKER_21]: And that position, three or four months would be far before the next election.

999
01:23:19,556 --> 01:23:21,317
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's something I can commit to.

1000
01:23:21,837 --> 01:23:28,761
[SPEAKER_21]: But I can't go and say I will institute an election coordinator when the clerk's office and the

1001
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:33,743
[SPEAKER_21]: board of registrar voters, it is completely fully staffed.

1002
01:23:34,624 --> 01:23:38,525
[SPEAKER_21]: And I cannot commit to that until I know that there is 100% need for it.

1003
01:23:39,345 --> 01:23:47,368
[SPEAKER_21]: If I could use that money for a teacher, a firefighter, a police officer, there's need there.

1004
01:23:47,448 --> 01:23:48,968
[SPEAKER_21]: There are other departments in this city.

1005
01:23:49,408 --> 01:23:54,390
[SPEAKER_21]: We have two missing positions that need to be hired in the treasurer's office.

1006
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:57,071
[SPEAKER_21]: In our assessing office, we have

1007
01:23:57,447 --> 01:23:59,408
[SPEAKER_21]: the need for an additional assessor.

1008
01:23:59,948 --> 01:24:03,770
[SPEAKER_21]: Engineering office, need for additional personnel.

1009
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:10,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Poor Todd Blake, need for our traffic engineer for an assistant.

1010
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:12,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Diversity, need for an assistant.

1011
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:17,356
[SPEAKER_21]: My communications director, 18 hour days, need for an assistant.

1012
01:24:17,556 --> 01:24:27,220
[SPEAKER_21]: There are so many needs in this community that I have to do my due diligence as your mayor to make sure that any position I implement is necessary and

1013
01:24:28,082 --> 01:24:28,982
[SPEAKER_21]: is the right decision.

1014
01:24:29,362 --> 01:24:30,583
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear you loud and clear.

1015
01:24:30,723 --> 01:24:31,543
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear the clerk.

1016
01:24:31,883 --> 01:24:32,744
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a plan.

1017
01:24:33,244 --> 01:24:37,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Rodriguez, Mr. Osborne, Mr. Hurtubise, and myself, we sat.

1018
01:24:37,725 --> 01:24:39,346
[SPEAKER_21]: We discussed the primary.

1019
01:24:39,426 --> 01:24:45,388
[SPEAKER_21]: We discussed the issues, the successes, and the setbacks, and how we were going to go and address that.

1020
01:24:45,948 --> 01:24:48,729
[SPEAKER_21]: After the election was certified, we were going to sit down again.

1021
01:24:48,749 --> 01:24:52,010
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was going to meet with additional personnel, as well as the board,

1022
01:24:53,081 --> 01:24:54,542
[SPEAKER_21]: that we need to figure out what the need is.

1023
01:24:54,842 --> 01:25:04,250
[SPEAKER_21]: There's also other issues that I spoke to many about over the phone that I need to make sure if it's necessary that we have the right person in that position.

1024
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,852
[SPEAKER_21]: And I want to do what's best for our clerk.

1025
01:25:07,272 --> 01:25:08,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Believe me, I do.

1026
01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:09,214
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear you loud and clear.

1027
01:25:09,454 --> 01:25:10,215
[SPEAKER_21]: But there's a lot.

1028
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:16,540
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very difficult to manage many, many departments with hundreds of employees and to do the right thing.

1029
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:22,465
[SPEAKER_21]: And what is absolutely the need of this community, it's my job and I take it very seriously.

1030
01:25:23,621 --> 01:25:31,725
[SPEAKER_21]: With that being said, I can commit to giving you a review of my investigation within 90 to 120 days, three to four months.

1031
01:25:31,945 --> 01:25:38,588
[SPEAKER_21]: We can get that done.

1032
01:25:39,828 --> 01:25:40,749
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1033
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:45,631
[SPEAKER_22]: I would hope that it could be done faster than that.

1034
01:25:45,831 --> 01:25:49,353
[SPEAKER_22]: But in any case, just to Director Nunley-Benjamin,

1035
01:25:51,107 --> 01:26:01,476
[SPEAKER_22]: If we do not, and this is just going off of what Councilor Knight was saying earlier, if we do not approve the supplemental appropriation, it will not affect the revenues for next fiscal year.

1036
01:26:01,536 --> 01:26:02,157
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that correct?

1037
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:04,819
[SPEAKER_26]: That is correct.

1038
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:10,083
[SPEAKER_26]: What I'm saying is if you don't pass it before the tax rate, then you have to fund it through free cash.

1039
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:10,804
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1040
01:26:10,904 --> 01:26:13,987
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the free cash would come in at the end of the fiscal year.

1041
01:26:14,407 --> 01:26:14,707
[SPEAKER_22]: Got it.

1042
01:26:14,767 --> 01:26:17,269
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to make that clear for myself.

1043
01:26:19,558 --> 01:26:21,638
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we're still at an impasse, to be quite frank.

1044
01:26:21,878 --> 01:26:22,799
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1045
01:26:23,299 --> 01:26:24,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Council of Peers.

1046
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:28,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the council regarding this issue?

1047
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1048
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:35,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions out?

1049
01:26:38,041 --> 01:26:39,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk, do you see anyone with their hand up?

1050
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:41,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure I don't see anyone, but.

1051
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:43,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval, place on file.

1052
01:26:45,523 --> 01:26:47,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scarapelli.

1053
01:26:49,394 --> 01:26:51,816
[SPEAKER_04]: You approve the paper and place on file?

1054
01:26:52,757 --> 01:26:54,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1055
01:26:55,179 --> 01:27:04,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Receive and place on file.

1056
01:27:04,346 --> 01:27:06,327
[SPEAKER_09]: 9-1-1, right, it's off of the paper.

1057
01:27:06,407 --> 01:27:08,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so it's 9-1-1, it has nothing to do with the paper.

1058
01:27:08,449 --> 01:27:09,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, 2-0-6-4-7, nothing to do with the table of paper.

1059
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:10,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, correct.

1060
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:12,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So on 2-0-6-4-7, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli,

01:28:22,513 --> 01:28:25,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1105
01:28:25,594 --> 01:28:36,460

1113
01:29:37,855 --> 01:29:41,977
[SPEAKER_21]: We have our assessor on to answer questions, Ellen Burdeaux.

1114
01:29:42,037 --> 01:29:45,419
[SPEAKER_21]: We have Aleesha Nunley, our finance director, on as well.

1115
01:29:45,579 --> 01:29:46,320
[SPEAKER_21]: We have Ms.

1116
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:52,663
[SPEAKER_21]: Hunt, Office of Community Development, is present, as well as Jeff Monica and Maria DeStefano.

1117
01:29:52,703 --> 01:29:57,845
[SPEAKER_21]: So I want to take you through this slideshow with the help of the team.

1118
01:29:59,306 --> 01:30:06,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Monogram Gourmet Foods LLC, this is a proposed, as I said,

1119
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:20,220
[SPEAKER_21]: For the past several weeks, the administration has been in discussions with Monogram Gourmet Foods LLC, located, hopefully, at 300 Middlesex Ave, which is the old Whole Foods Bakery site.

1120
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:26,485
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the site in front of BJ's Wholesale across from Dunkin' Donuts on Middlesex Ave.

1121
01:30:27,266 --> 01:30:35,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Monogram Foods has been looking at several sites, including additional locations in Massachusetts, and we are one of those sites.

1122
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:48,155
[SPEAKER_21]: If Monogram comes to Medford, they're going to be putting $40 million into the property as well as providing 250 new jobs to the community with Medford residents having preference.

1123
01:30:49,056 --> 01:30:55,780
[SPEAKER_21]: We are seeking a 10-year tax increment finance agreement with Monogram if the council approves this tonight.

1124
01:30:59,505 --> 01:31:00,445
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President?

1125
01:31:01,046 --> 01:31:07,529
[SPEAKER_21]: The property right now, you'll see on the screen, this is the location, this is the condition the property is in.

1126
01:31:08,109 --> 01:31:14,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Currently, it's generating about $118,000 in taxes each year.

1127
01:31:15,552 --> 01:31:22,896
[SPEAKER_21]: With no improvements and without Monogram Foods, we would be estimating the taxes that we would bring in at about $150,890 by the year 2031.

1128
01:31:29,728 --> 01:31:42,639
[SPEAKER_21]: At this point, I can turn it over to Mr. Monica, if you have any questions with regards to the improvements, the $40 million in improvements that will be brought to this property if this agreement is approved.

1129
01:31:44,321 --> 01:31:46,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Or Jeff, if you wanna just elaborate a bit.

1130
01:31:46,262 --> 01:31:48,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have one quick question before you pass it off, Mr. President.

1131
01:31:48,184 --> 01:31:50,686
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a question, Councilor Morell first, and then Councilor Knight.

1132
01:31:50,706 --> 01:31:51,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell?

1133
01:31:55,143 --> 01:32:03,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard if Monogram Foods comes here as opposed to is Monogram Foods coming here or is it contingent upon whether or not we give them this tax incremented financing?

1134
01:32:04,605 --> 01:32:16,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I'd hate to see us pass it and have them shopping around from city to city to city and then say wherever they get the best deal they're gonna go but we're making a commitment to them is there a commitment back you know I mean that this is where they want to be or is this a shopping spree?

1135
01:32:17,508 --> 01:32:20,929
[SPEAKER_21]: No I believe there's there is a commitment and I can let Mr. Monica

1136
01:32:21,539 --> 01:32:22,600
[SPEAKER_21]: explain further.

1137
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:23,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1138
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:23,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1139
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:23,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1140
01:32:24,521 --> 01:32:24,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1141
01:32:24,961 --> 01:32:26,202
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Jeff Monica.

1142
01:32:26,282 --> 01:32:30,684
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm the vice president of warehousing and logistics for Monogram Foods.

1143
01:32:30,704 --> 01:32:40,389
[SPEAKER_16]: We're based in Medford, Tennessee, where I currently reside and appreciate the opportunity to appear before the council and the mayor this evening.

1144
01:32:40,449 --> 01:32:43,071
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll be happy to answer any specific questions.

1145
01:32:43,231 --> 01:32:47,073
[SPEAKER_16]: The question appears that, you know, this facility

1146
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:49,934
[SPEAKER_16]: would meet our needs.

1147
01:32:50,095 --> 01:32:56,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Our decision to make this our site is contingent upon the TIF award.

1148
01:32:56,999 --> 01:33:04,364
[SPEAKER_16]: It is critical to help us with our investment of approximately $40 million in the facility.

1149
01:33:04,984 --> 01:33:09,407
[SPEAKER_16]: It is our preferred site for a couple of reasons.

1150
01:33:09,747 --> 01:33:10,848
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to operate

1151
01:33:11,368 --> 01:33:14,689
[SPEAKER_16]: and open a state-of-the-art USDA bakery.

1152
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:20,131
[SPEAKER_16]: And in combination, a USDA bakery is unique.

1153
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:32,096
[SPEAKER_16]: There aren't many of them in the United States that allows us to do unique products with meats and proteins that aren't available in a normal FDA bakery like the Whole Foods bakery.

1154
01:33:32,176 --> 01:33:35,777
[SPEAKER_16]: So we need this facility to support our rapid growth.

1155
01:33:35,837 --> 01:33:37,098
[SPEAKER_16]: We have two other plants.

1156
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:40,279
[SPEAKER_16]: in Wilmington, Massachusetts.

1157
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:44,161
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have been a strong employer within the state of Massachusetts.

1158
01:33:44,881 --> 01:34:02,308
[SPEAKER_16]: This is going to involve the complete renovation of the bakery, which is detailed in our application, but it's a complete renovation of the walls, the floors, the HVAC, the refrigeration system, complete floor drain systems, as well as

1159
01:34:02,928 --> 01:34:09,670
[SPEAKER_16]: the installation of a state-of-the-art continuous bakery oven product, oven equipment, I should say.

1160
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,471
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's all new equipment.

1161
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:16,913
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an substantial investment for Monogram Foods in the range of $40 million.

1162
01:34:17,493 --> 01:34:25,316
[SPEAKER_16]: We anticipate employing over 250 employees after the facility is up and running with two full shifts.

1163
01:34:25,436 --> 01:34:32,458
[SPEAKER_16]: We have been told by the city that there is an experienced pool of bakery employees with experience

1164
01:34:32,998 --> 01:34:37,182
[SPEAKER_16]: either with Whole Foods or other previous tenants of this facility.

1165
01:34:37,662 --> 01:34:48,092
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are excited about that opportunity to put 250 employees to work, are back to work if they were employed previously, and particularly with experience in a bakery.

1166
01:34:48,132 --> 01:34:49,533
[SPEAKER_16]: So that is a positive.

1167
01:34:49,954 --> 01:34:56,440
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the reasons why this would be a primary location, as well as we have a substantial commitment

1168
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:03,386
[SPEAKER_16]: within Massachusetts, and this would fit well with this, with our other two plants that we currently have.

1169
01:35:03,646 --> 01:35:09,492
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll pause there, Mayor, and hopefully that answered Councilor's question.

1170
01:35:10,633 --> 01:35:12,234
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much, Mr. Monaco.

1171
01:35:14,196 --> 01:35:14,897
[SPEAKER_21]: Next slide, please.

1172
01:35:17,574 --> 01:35:18,434
[SPEAKER_21]: to be able to do that.

1173
01:35:18,454 --> 01:35:20,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Mister Rodriguez, do you want to explain this one?

1174
01:35:20,935 --> 01:35:29,639
[SPEAKER_17]: background for folks watching at home or on the zoom that are familiar with tax increment financing agreements and kind of mechanics of how they work.

1175
01:35:30,059 --> 01:35:34,421
[SPEAKER_17]: So they're public-private partnerships that are used to encourage redevelopment or development in the community.

1176
01:35:34,921 --> 01:35:38,542
[SPEAKER_17]: The tax incentives only realize that the developer makes the investment.

1177
01:35:39,003 --> 01:35:39,883
[SPEAKER_17]: It's made in that there's

1178
01:35:42,764 --> 01:35:49,588
[SPEAKER_17]: So as you can see on the chart here, in the blue area that's marked as number one, this is the property taxes before the investment, what we call our base value.

1179
01:35:50,168 --> 01:35:57,372
[SPEAKER_17]: And so on the spreadsheet that you'll see in just a little bit, the base value that we see is just under $6.5 million.

1180
01:35:57,812 --> 01:35:59,133
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a base tax level.

1181
01:35:59,173 --> 01:36:02,115
[SPEAKER_17]: We're always derived taxes on the taxable level for that amount.

1182
01:36:03,085 --> 01:36:05,307
[SPEAKER_17]: that's the area that the exemption would apply to.

1183
01:36:05,327 --> 01:36:06,689
[SPEAKER_17]: So anything that's

1184
01:36:26,068 --> 01:36:27,249
[SPEAKER_17]: That's your increment finance.

1185
01:36:27,869 --> 01:36:29,930
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the, that's where the exemption would apply.

1186
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:36,034
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's, we have some, some analyses that were sent over to the council previously that kind of map out how we think that's going to go.

1187
01:36:36,454 --> 01:36:43,098
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's the area that would, would receive the tax exemption as, as agreed to in principle with bottom line.

1188
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:45,819
[SPEAKER_17]: it's only good for the duration of the agreement.

1189
01:36:45,839 --> 01:36:47,340
[SPEAKER_17]: So this agreement is for 10 years.

1190
01:36:48,241 --> 01:36:54,484
[SPEAKER_17]: After that 10 year period, the entire value of the property comes online and is taxed at the regular value with no exemption.

1191
01:36:55,045 --> 01:36:58,587
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know Maria DeStefano from MOBD is on the call as well.

1192
01:36:58,627 --> 01:36:59,787
[SPEAKER_17]: She's a tremendous resource.

1193
01:36:59,827 --> 01:37:07,592
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that a couple of folks have spoken with her about the TIF process and the TIF structure and kind of the state role in the EDIP program.

1194
01:37:08,332 --> 01:37:16,394
[SPEAKER_17]: So if she wants to add in anything that I may have missed, which I'm sure is plenty, as well as Ellen Purdell, please feel free, Ellen and Maria.

1195
01:37:22,716 --> 01:37:23,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, David.

1196
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:25,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, you did an excellent job.

1197
01:37:26,617 --> 01:37:28,578
[SPEAKER_17]: The blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while.

1198
01:37:29,978 --> 01:37:36,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, be careful, because if we're missing a regional director, I think I know where to find one.

1199
01:37:44,795 --> 01:37:44,915
[SPEAKER_21]: that.

1200
01:37:44,975 --> 01:37:45,516
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1201
01:37:45,596 --> 01:37:48,902
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want to the next slide, Dave?

1202
01:37:48,922 --> 01:37:49,483
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we have

1203
01:37:58,295 --> 01:38:01,657
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an excellent overview of what a TIF does for the community.

1204
01:38:03,258 --> 01:38:05,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And truly, we have a baseline.

1205
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:15,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping commercial properties in Medford and growing commercial properties is what we need to do to stabilize the diversity of the tax base.

1206
01:38:16,046 --> 01:38:18,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is definitely a win for the city.

1207
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:27,473
[SPEAKER_21]: This slide shows you the proposed TIF agreement terms, and it

1208
01:38:27,952 --> 01:38:33,275
[SPEAKER_21]: It breaks down the percentage of the exemption over the course of the 10 years.

1209
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:39,158
[SPEAKER_21]: It also breaks down the personal property exemption schedule 10% from year 1 to 5 and 0% year 6 to 10.

1210
01:38:46,031 --> 01:38:47,012
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just admire that.

1211
01:38:48,213 --> 01:38:57,541
[SPEAKER_17]: So the reason that it was broken down as such is because of the breakdown of the investment that's being made by Monogram and a cross section between building improvements as well as equipment improvements.

1212
01:38:57,961 --> 01:38:59,482
[SPEAKER_17]: So we wanted this agreement.

1213
01:38:59,562 --> 01:39:06,548
[SPEAKER_17]: We want the city's offer to be assertive, not overly aggressive, but to be assertive and welcoming to the investor.

1214
01:39:07,549 --> 01:39:10,512
[SPEAKER_17]: If these conditions aren't met and we have every expectation that they will be met,

1215
01:39:11,032 --> 01:39:15,996
[SPEAKER_17]: there is the option for the state to decertify the agreement through the EIP process and through the AEACC.

1216
01:39:16,777 --> 01:39:29,728
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, God forbid that, you know, when the investment doesn't hit the projected value or the jobs aren't met, we will be able to go to the state and ask them to decertify that, the agreement and bring the value of the property back online.

1217
01:39:30,362 --> 01:39:33,884
[SPEAKER_17]: with every TIF, there's a but-for test that's applied.

1218
01:39:33,984 --> 01:39:39,666
[SPEAKER_17]: So the but-for that goes, so monogram will come if they get the agreement, but they won't come if they don't.

1219
01:39:39,966 --> 01:39:49,811
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's kind of how it falls down to it.

1220
01:39:49,831 --> 01:39:52,772
[SPEAKER_21]: This slide shows you the value to the city of Medford.

1221
01:39:52,912 --> 01:39:57,374
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you take the total real estate tax revenue to the city from 2022 to

1222
01:39:59,434 --> 01:40:01,116
[SPEAKER_21]: $1,421,000.

1223
01:39:59,454 --> 01:40:01,116
[SPEAKER_21]: With this TIF agreement, including the

1224
01:40:25,427 --> 01:40:27,889
[SPEAKER_21]: total of 3 million 432,000 and then a total property tax revenue $2,040,972.

1225
01:40:27,929 --> 01:40:33,854
[SPEAKER_21]: The exemptions would be the $668,000 and that would bring a total tax paid from 2022 to 2031 $5,473,273, which would be an increase in tax revenue

1226
01:40:51,084 --> 01:40:55,727
[SPEAKER_21]: over that 10 year span of over $4 million to the city of Medford.

1227
01:41:00,531 --> 01:41:14,681
[SPEAKER_21]: This just breaks it down a little bit further, and I know the council was provided this prior to this meeting, because I know it's a lot to digest, but we did want you to have all of this prior to, and we're happy to answer any other questions.

1228
01:41:15,932 --> 01:41:16,493
[SPEAKER_21]: that you have.

1229
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:19,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, we have a number of council questions.

1230
01:41:19,895 --> 01:41:25,840
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Councilor Morell, Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Marks, Councilor Knight, Council Bates.

1231
01:41:27,482 --> 01:41:28,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

1232
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:29,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1233
01:41:29,363 --> 01:41:31,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I have a number of questions.

1234
01:41:31,865 --> 01:41:40,012
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, we're looking, I guess, the main incentive to the community that is being touted, or really the only incentive, is the 250 permanent jobs.

1235
01:41:40,072 --> 01:41:42,134
[SPEAKER_12]: What type of wages are we looking at for these jobs?

1236
01:41:45,356 --> 01:41:46,498
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could address it, yeah.

1237
01:41:46,838 --> 01:41:51,565
[SPEAKER_16]: These wages are in the approximate $20 an hour wage.

1238
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:58,215
[SPEAKER_16]: That includes full benefits, health insurance, and participation in the retirement plan.

1239
01:41:59,132 --> 01:41:59,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

1240
01:41:59,872 --> 01:42:08,095
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the permanent in this terminology, obviously it's not contract work, but what does permanent mean?

1241
01:42:08,115 --> 01:42:15,458
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the entirety of the 10-year agreement or just to your best ability to keep these jobs that are being promised?

1242
01:42:19,446 --> 01:42:22,049
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that a question for me, Dave, or is that?

1243
01:42:22,189 --> 01:42:23,430
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure whoever can answer it.

1244
01:42:23,931 --> 01:42:26,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think it's 250 jobs.

1245
01:42:26,393 --> 01:42:31,979
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the labor force that they need to maintain throughout the life of the agreement.

1246
01:42:32,019 --> 01:42:33,300
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Maria had her hand up as well.

1247
01:42:33,661 --> 01:42:34,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, you're saying?

1248
01:42:34,201 --> 01:42:42,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just a quick addition to that is, so when the state talks about full-time jobs, I'm sorry, when we talk about jobs created,

1249
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:46,753
[SPEAKER_07]: we're only talking about full-time job, not equivalents or part-time.

1250
01:42:47,353 --> 01:42:53,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, and I'm sorry, the chief of staff's point, I believe it was, so these do need to, are required to be maintained for the 10 years?

1251
01:42:55,933 --> 01:42:56,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1252
01:42:56,634 --> 01:42:56,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1253
01:42:56,954 --> 01:42:57,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1254
01:42:57,735 --> 01:42:57,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1255
01:42:58,615 --> 01:43:01,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and then, uh, another question.

1256
01:43:01,257 --> 01:43:03,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Just, I don't, forgive me.

1257
01:43:03,759 --> 01:43:09,804
[SPEAKER_12]: I do not know what unique meats and proteins mean when it comes to, to bakery products.

1258
01:43:10,225 --> 01:43:13,027
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're talking about something that runs continually.

1259
01:43:13,067 --> 01:43:14,008
[SPEAKER_12]: So 24 hours a day.

1260
01:43:14,468 --> 01:43:21,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there any impact as far as, you know, smell exhaust odors, you know, to the, to the dense neighborhoods that surround this?

1261
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,803
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's a great question.

1262
01:43:24,843 --> 01:43:27,207
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, let me, I can bring this home.

1263
01:43:27,607 --> 01:43:31,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Two of our largest customers are large coffee companies.

1264
01:43:32,474 --> 01:43:38,122
[SPEAKER_16]: One starts with the letter S and the other one starts with the letter D and it's Duncan.

1265
01:43:39,043 --> 01:43:46,248
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you've ever had the pleasure of having a ham and cheese croissant at a Dunkin Donuts, that is probably our croissant.

1266
01:43:46,748 --> 01:43:52,152
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's got ham and cheese combined as opposed to just a bakery croissant with butter.

1267
01:43:52,532 --> 01:43:55,254
[SPEAKER_16]: So that hopefully that explains what I mean by the proteins.

1268
01:43:55,634 --> 01:44:01,177
[SPEAKER_16]: No, there are no odorous orders that will permeate in the community.

1269
01:44:01,638 --> 01:44:04,720
[SPEAKER_16]: There is no other than normal sanitation

1270
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:07,801
[SPEAKER_16]: There are no hazardous chemicals involved.

1271
01:44:08,481 --> 01:44:11,162
[SPEAKER_16]: There will be no noise, big noise issues.

1272
01:44:11,522 --> 01:44:15,783
[SPEAKER_16]: We do plan on operating two full shifts, two full time shifts.

1273
01:44:15,823 --> 01:44:26,586
[SPEAKER_16]: So there will be activity for approximately, I'm going to say 18 hours of a 24 hour day, primarily Monday through Friday with some Saturday work as well.

1274
01:44:27,871 --> 01:44:28,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1275
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:28,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1276
01:44:28,611 --> 01:44:35,515
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if I guess someone from the city or yourself as well, what is remind me that the square footage of this actual facility?

1277
01:44:39,297 --> 01:44:42,559
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe it's approximately 65,000 square feet.

1278
01:44:43,279 --> 01:44:44,480
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have that in front of me.

1279
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:45,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1280
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:47,231
[SPEAKER_12]: So either to yourself or representative to the city.

1281
01:44:47,291 --> 01:45:06,760
[SPEAKER_12]: So this would qualify under the requirements of the solar ordinance that was recently passed in the city that I believe the qualifying part of this is that non-residential or residential projects which involve the substantial rehabilitation of a structure containing 10,000 square feet or more, a floor area,

1282
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:18,905
[SPEAKER_12]: or the addition of 10,000 square feet or more of the growth floor area would be required to have the, I believe, 50% solar on the building.

1283
01:45:18,965 --> 01:45:19,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that correct?

1284
01:45:19,505 --> 01:45:22,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Can someone from the city confirm that, or have you been looped into this?

1285
01:45:26,288 --> 01:45:27,689
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Alicia Hunt is on the call.

1286
01:45:28,209 --> 01:45:29,329
[SPEAKER_17]: She might be able to answer the question.

1287
01:45:29,349 --> 01:45:30,590
[SPEAKER_17]: The building commissioner isn't on the call.

1288
01:45:31,755 --> 01:45:39,202
[SPEAKER_20]: I would definitely want Paul Moki, our building commissioner, to confirm it.

1289
01:45:39,242 --> 01:45:55,418
[SPEAKER_20]: What is the definition of rehabilitation or renovation, major renovation of a building, which may qualify it, which would mean that they'd be required to submit to us an assessment of the ability to put solar on the roof of the building.

1290
01:45:56,658 --> 01:46:13,642
[SPEAKER_20]: And then if the assessment shows that the building could handle solar with no additional structural other than what was already part of the rehabilitation, then we would ask them to move forward with the solar on up to 50% of the roof area.

1291
01:46:17,544 --> 01:46:19,766
[SPEAKER_20]: which do monogram foods.

1292
01:46:19,866 --> 01:46:28,074
[SPEAKER_20]: We've found that many large businesses have found that to be a very lucrative and profitable thing for them to be doing in our region.

1293
01:46:29,295 --> 01:46:38,865
[SPEAKER_20]: But I would want Paul Moki to confirm whether what they are proposing qualifies under the rehabilitation portion of that ordinance.

1294
01:46:39,668 --> 01:46:40,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

1295
01:46:40,128 --> 01:46:44,091
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I would hope that $40 million counts as substantial rehabilitation.

1296
01:46:44,691 --> 01:46:53,896
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just curious to Mr. Modica, is this $40 million inclusive of potentially a solar array, should it be deemed possible?

1297
01:46:53,976 --> 01:47:01,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Or are there any other sustainability improvements that are included in this proposed $40 million rehabilitation?

1298
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,961
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm, I'm not aware.

1299
01:47:05,221 --> 01:47:10,522
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not aware of any specific solar modifications planned for this.

1300
01:47:10,643 --> 01:47:14,464
[SPEAKER_16]: We're in our final construction forecasting.

1301
01:47:14,504 --> 01:47:19,406
[SPEAKER_16]: No work has started obviously because there's approvals not been granted at this point.

1302
01:47:19,446 --> 01:47:25,128
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can't answer if there's been any specific, I will tell you the monogram foods is a very green conscious company.

1303
01:47:26,008 --> 01:47:29,169
[SPEAKER_16]: In our other eight facilities across the country, we have,

1304
01:47:30,169 --> 01:47:34,291
[SPEAKER_16]: a methane digester system in Martinsville, Virginia.

1305
01:47:34,752 --> 01:47:38,454
[SPEAKER_16]: We have solar gardens in Minnesota with Xcel Energy.

1306
01:47:38,474 --> 01:47:40,655
[SPEAKER_16]: I personally worked on that project.

1307
01:47:40,995 --> 01:47:43,736
[SPEAKER_16]: So we would be supportive of that.

1308
01:47:44,016 --> 01:47:47,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously it would be contingent upon the amount of investment.

1309
01:47:47,718 --> 01:47:48,859
[SPEAKER_16]: it would take to do that.

1310
01:47:49,039 --> 01:48:06,528
[SPEAKER_16]: And if that has an economic return, obviously, if it's a city ordinance or state law that we would have to comply with, we would ask that we'd be given the opportunity to review the regulations and the expected costs, but we're all, we are supportive of green energy.

1311
01:48:06,789 --> 01:48:07,149
[SPEAKER_16]: So yes.

1312
01:48:07,935 --> 01:48:08,715
[SPEAKER_16]: we're going to look at that.

1313
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:10,456
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have not today.

1314
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:11,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1315
01:48:11,576 --> 01:48:11,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1316
01:48:12,436 --> 01:48:18,998
[SPEAKER_12]: And then my final question, if the chief of staff could confirm this, and I did, I had the opportunity to speak with Maria yesterday as well.

1317
01:48:19,778 --> 01:48:30,921
[SPEAKER_12]: When presenting the benefit of this project tax-wise to the city, it is under the assumption that this benefit of $3 million is if no other company were to come in and not ask for a TIF, correct?

1318
01:48:30,941 --> 01:48:32,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

1319
01:48:32,741 --> 01:48:32,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1320
01:48:33,201 --> 01:48:33,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1321
01:48:33,942 --> 01:48:34,362
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I have.

1322
01:48:35,525 --> 01:48:36,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1323
01:48:36,947 --> 01:48:38,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

1324
01:48:38,168 --> 01:48:38,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1325
01:48:38,849 --> 01:48:44,236
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Monica, for coming here and considering our community with your company.

1326
01:48:44,276 --> 01:48:50,944
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, the $40 million you're talking about, that also includes the buying of the property, correct?

1327
01:48:51,144 --> 01:48:52,606
[SPEAKER_16]: We are leasing the property.

1328
01:48:55,826 --> 01:48:58,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we're just going to be a tenant of the property.

1329
01:48:58,548 --> 01:49:06,792
[SPEAKER_16]: It is owned by Medford Bakery Realty LLC is going to be the continued owner.

1330
01:49:06,812 --> 01:49:08,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe they're the owner of record today.

1331
01:49:09,274 --> 01:49:10,695
[SPEAKER_18]: And how long will you lease me for?

1332
01:49:10,715 --> 01:49:10,835
[SPEAKER_18]: 50 years.

1333
01:49:10,855 --> 01:49:10,875
5-0?

1334
01:49:16,055 --> 01:49:21,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it's a 20-year lease with six five-year options.

1335
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:28,042
[SPEAKER_16]: So a 50-year commitment, which is very similar to the other commitments we have made in our other plants.

1336
01:49:28,082 --> 01:49:31,604
[SPEAKER_16]: We're a long-term player in the food space.

1337
01:49:33,565 --> 01:49:42,590
[SPEAKER_18]: And you did say you're only going to operate two shifts because I know Whole Foods, when they were in their bread and circus, they operated a 24-hour facility, correct?

1338
01:49:44,446 --> 01:49:47,747
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're only going to operate two shifts, correct?

1339
01:49:49,048 --> 01:49:51,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Our current plan is to operate two shifts.

1340
01:49:51,949 --> 01:49:57,890
[SPEAKER_16]: As business volume needs dictated, we could go to a 24-7 operation.

1341
01:49:58,711 --> 01:50:04,113
[SPEAKER_16]: But we would prefer to commit to what we can deliver and not over promise at this point.

1342
01:50:04,853 --> 01:50:07,414
[SPEAKER_18]: And you mentioned about the jobs.

1343
01:50:07,694 --> 01:50:11,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Are these union jobs or just jobs paid through your company?

1344
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:15,813
[SPEAKER_16]: They are not currently union jobs.

1345
01:50:17,034 --> 01:50:20,318
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have union representation in our other plants.

1346
01:50:20,878 --> 01:50:21,659
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1347
01:50:21,839 --> 01:50:26,084
[SPEAKER_18]: And how many trucks are you going to have at this facility?

1348
01:50:27,965 --> 01:50:34,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, by trucks, do you mean trucks that monogram gourmet foods would operate?

1349
01:50:34,592 --> 01:50:34,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1350
01:50:35,855 --> 01:50:36,855
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1351
01:50:37,475 --> 01:50:42,997
[SPEAKER_16]: That's to be determined, but I would estimate that we'll probably operate three transfer trucks.

1352
01:50:44,257 --> 01:50:50,239
[SPEAKER_16]: The finished product produced there, there is a small freezer, about 1300 pallet locations.

1353
01:50:50,739 --> 01:50:55,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Our customers normally pick up at our plant and they use common carriers in most cases.

1354
01:50:55,960 --> 01:51:03,082
[SPEAKER_16]: So there, our own assets would probably be three to four trucks to move ingredients between our warehouses.

1355
01:51:03,642 --> 01:51:05,804
[SPEAKER_16]: and our other plants into here and out of there.

1356
01:51:05,904 --> 01:51:13,010
[SPEAKER_16]: We currently ship a lot of our products out of a cold storage, public cold storage located down in Taunton.

1357
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:16,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, and will those trucks be registered here in Medford?

1358
01:51:17,691 --> 01:51:22,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, they would be, and those would be part of the employment base of our employees.

1359
01:51:22,974 --> 01:51:29,838
[SPEAKER_16]: And when I, I should clarify the $20 an hour wages, that's for the hourly production workers.

1360
01:51:29,919 --> 01:51:35,762
[SPEAKER_16]: We would obviously have supervisors, managers, and a plant manager and a management team as well.

1361
01:51:35,862 --> 01:51:43,787
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a lot of, quite a few higher level paying jobs, management jobs within this plant facility.

1362
01:51:44,668 --> 01:51:46,289
[SPEAKER_18]: And how many,

1363
01:51:47,512 --> 01:51:53,235
[SPEAKER_18]: How many vehicles will be coming and going off the property during the working hours of the day?

1364
01:51:55,677 --> 01:52:09,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, if we took the 250 employees and assumed that 80% of those were- Well, I mean, aside from the employees, I mean, commercial grade trucks coming in there.

1365
01:52:12,507 --> 01:52:13,568
[SPEAKER_16]: How many commercial grade trucks?

1366
01:52:15,356 --> 01:52:17,158
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a little hard to determine.

1367
01:52:17,218 --> 01:52:21,101
[SPEAKER_16]: The facility we believe has operating flower silos.

1368
01:52:21,621 --> 01:52:24,524
[SPEAKER_16]: So that cuts down the amount of dock unloading.

1369
01:52:24,584 --> 01:52:27,767
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be able to bulk fill the flower tanks and such.

1370
01:52:27,827 --> 01:52:40,858
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to guess, I'm going to estimate maybe three to four trucks a day unloading materials, finished goods, probably three to four, maybe as many as six picking up product a day, finished goods.

1371
01:52:42,091 --> 01:52:43,872
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems to be less than we were doing there before.

1372
01:52:44,392 --> 01:52:47,914
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, I want to thank the mayor for bringing this forward.

1373
01:52:47,954 --> 01:52:52,497
[SPEAKER_18]: I think projects like this are always good for the community to hear about them.

1374
01:52:52,557 --> 01:52:57,499
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's a good private-public partnership.

1375
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,982
[SPEAKER_18]: So I look forward to possibly having you in our community.

1376
01:53:03,775 --> 01:53:06,677
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could add one more comment, I forgot to mention.

1377
01:53:07,237 --> 01:53:15,341
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the other things that Monogram Foods does, we believe in giving back to our communities where we have plants and employees.

1378
01:53:15,401 --> 01:53:22,465
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have a charitable 501C3 Monogram Loves Kids Foundation, which is independent of the company.

1379
01:53:23,065 --> 01:53:31,610
[SPEAKER_16]: And last year we gave almost $600,000 worth of grants to our six different communities, cities where we have plants.

1380
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:40,836
[SPEAKER_16]: And those funds or grants are given to organizations to support children, whether it's the boys and girls clubs, a variety of things.

1381
01:53:41,016 --> 01:53:49,022
[SPEAKER_16]: And the decisions of where that money is given back to the community of Medford would be made by the local management staff.

1382
01:53:49,142 --> 01:53:51,944
[SPEAKER_16]: None of us in Medford have any say over that.

1383
01:53:52,024 --> 01:53:54,546
[SPEAKER_16]: So we want to be an employer of choice.

1384
01:53:55,086 --> 01:53:56,948
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to be a good corporate citizen.

1385
01:53:57,648 --> 01:54:02,411
[SPEAKER_16]: And we want to support the community, the children of the community, where that makes sense.

1386
01:54:02,471 --> 01:54:05,574
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's part of the culture of Monogram Foods.

1387
01:54:05,634 --> 01:54:07,695
[SPEAKER_16]: We are a rapidly growing company.

1388
01:54:08,195 --> 01:54:15,120
[SPEAKER_16]: The plant in Wilmington, when we bought it five years ago, was doing $25 million in revenue.

1389
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:19,803
[SPEAKER_16]: This year, it will do over $150 million in revenue.

1390
01:54:19,863 --> 01:54:21,665
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have the opportunity to grow.

1391
01:54:22,425 --> 01:54:29,489
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are thankful that Medford is considering supporting us and our growth in your fine city, so.

1392
01:54:30,149 --> 01:54:35,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, and I appreciate the fact that you're looking to be a good neighbor and contribute to the community.

1393
01:54:36,233 --> 01:54:37,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1394
01:54:37,553 --> 01:54:38,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

1395
01:54:40,335 --> 01:54:42,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank the

1396
01:54:44,845 --> 01:54:50,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I have a few questions on the same line as Councilor Caraviello.

1397
01:54:51,388 --> 01:54:59,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you get a little more specific on the types of trucks that will be entering and exiting your particular facility?

1398
01:55:00,472 --> 01:55:01,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we looking at 18 wheelers?

1399
01:55:02,392 --> 01:55:04,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we looking at refrigerated trucks?

1400
01:55:04,553 --> 01:55:05,694
[SPEAKER_05]: What type of truck?

1401
01:55:07,469 --> 01:55:15,699
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be a traditional Class 8 semi-tractor, most likely 53-foot refrigerated trailers.

1402
01:55:15,759 --> 01:55:21,786
[SPEAKER_16]: The majority of the bakery products are produced and shipped frozen.

1403
01:55:22,427 --> 01:55:30,614
[SPEAKER_16]: So reefer trailers, we anticipate live loading, which means we will load that trailer, they'll back up, we load it and they leave.

1404
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:34,657
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going to be leaving trailers idling on the lot.

1405
01:55:34,797 --> 01:55:39,261
[SPEAKER_16]: As I said earlier, we're not a noisy business from that perspective.

1406
01:55:39,981 --> 01:55:48,388
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a 1300 pallet freezer that's inside the building that if we retrofit it, should meet our needs for inside storage.

1407
01:55:49,125 --> 01:55:53,726
[SPEAKER_16]: So class eight tractors, 53 foot trailers are the equipment.

1408
01:55:54,906 --> 01:56:02,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and you're aware that you have residential neighbors on both sides, correct?

1409
01:56:03,527 --> 01:56:03,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1410
01:56:04,728 --> 01:56:18,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and regarding your plant that after full build out, compared to what's there currently, how much more manufacturing will be done on that site?

1411
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:21,874
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have, yeah.

1412
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:24,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you give us a rough percentage?

1413
01:56:26,304 --> 01:56:30,325
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have, I don't know how much business Whole Foods was doing out of there.

1414
01:56:30,345 --> 01:56:33,286
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not privy to that confidential information.

1415
01:56:34,247 --> 01:56:38,688
[SPEAKER_16]: I can tell you that, and our revenue is we're a privately held company.

1416
01:56:39,088 --> 01:56:46,230
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would tell you we're going to be producing probably more poundage, more annual poundage than was produced before.

1417
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:49,532
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know why Whole Foods closed that bakery down.

1418
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:53,693
[SPEAKER_16]: It was part of the Amazon acquisition is what I believe we heard.

1419
01:56:54,153 --> 01:57:03,337
[SPEAKER_16]: through the trade industry, so I would anticipate us to be producing more annual pounds once we're up to full speed than was previously produced there.

1420
01:57:04,178 --> 01:57:08,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and did you state that you do both retail and wholesale?

1421
01:57:10,233 --> 01:57:13,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, I would say we do retail food service.

1422
01:57:14,377 --> 01:57:18,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of our largest customers are large consumer.

1423
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:20,282
[SPEAKER_16]: We produce products for ConAgra Foods.

1424
01:57:20,842 --> 01:57:26,587
[SPEAKER_16]: We produce products in Wilmington for B&G Foods, which is the Green Giant brand.

1425
01:57:27,007 --> 01:57:34,493
[SPEAKER_16]: If you've ever had their, or your children have had their breaded vegetables, cauliflower and broccoli, we produce that product in Wilmington.

1426
01:57:34,513 --> 01:57:39,097
[SPEAKER_16]: So both food service and retail grocery, we are not a branded company.

1427
01:57:39,137 --> 01:57:43,180
[SPEAKER_16]: You will not find Monogram branded foods in your local grocery store.

1428
01:57:45,097 --> 01:57:48,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so regarding, get back to the trucks.

1429
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:57,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you aware that there are many surrounding roads where you're located that do not accept heavy trucking?

1430
01:58:00,435 --> 01:58:05,459
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we are aware that there are streets that do have weight restrictions.

1431
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:11,704
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess I'll have to defer to our operations team and we can look further into that.

1432
01:58:11,744 --> 01:58:18,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Were there problems in the past with ingress and egress of trucks into the site when it was Whole Foods Bakery?

1433
01:58:18,742 --> 01:58:28,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a tough question to answer because as you just alluded to, you're not sure what the older capacity was at the existing site.

1434
01:58:29,209 --> 01:58:31,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like you're going to be growing the site.

1435
01:58:32,571 --> 01:58:35,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could just tell you from a first hand experience that

1436
01:58:36,353 --> 01:58:40,636
[SPEAKER_05]: The Fellsway, many of your class A trucks cannot use the Fellsway.

1437
01:58:41,117 --> 01:58:43,138
[SPEAKER_05]: They cannot use Mystic Valley Parkway.

1438
01:58:43,899 --> 01:58:52,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would be very curious to see if this work has been done ahead of time to see what the potential truck routes would be.

1439
01:58:53,385 --> 01:58:56,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in my opinion, they would be cutting through many neighborhoods.

1440
01:58:57,370 --> 01:59:05,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's extremely important for us to know, as a council, the impact this may have on surrounding neighbors.

1441
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:09,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And that leads to my other point that

1442
01:59:11,363 --> 01:59:17,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, Mr. President, before we move forward with this, this would require community input.

1443
01:59:17,785 --> 01:59:21,327
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realize this is a council meeting and it's open to the public.

1444
01:59:21,807 --> 01:59:24,548
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it's the first time it's appeared on the agenda.

1445
01:59:25,108 --> 01:59:34,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the neighborhood where this is, I realized there was a baking facility there on a smaller scale.

1446
01:59:35,691 --> 01:59:39,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is going to have a much larger impact on the Wellington area.

1447
01:59:40,615 --> 01:59:41,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know.

1448
01:59:42,947 --> 01:59:45,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Haines Square and so forth, Mr. President.

1449
01:59:45,468 --> 02:00:00,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask that we have a public meeting on this where we invite the Wellington, Haines Square area, Mr. President, and notify them of what is taking place to see if residents would have any particular questions.

1450
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:09,666
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a host of questions that I rather do in committee of the whole regarding, I could just tell you first hand, I go to that Wendy's.

1451
02:00:11,366 --> 02:00:13,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to say it, quite often.

1452
02:00:14,929 --> 02:00:20,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you at night, Mr. President, that the rats are rampant in that back area.

1453
02:00:20,934 --> 02:00:25,177
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to check out rats, go by the back of the Wendy's.

1454
02:00:25,898 --> 02:00:34,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's a lot of issues regarding, and I'm sure these are addressed by the company, but there are a lot of issues I'm sure residents are going to have.

1455
02:00:35,126 --> 02:00:38,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I know my colleagues already asked about odor and smell and so forth.

1456
02:00:38,809 --> 02:00:40,210
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a number of issues.

1457
02:00:40,910 --> 02:00:44,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, with docking stations.

1458
02:00:44,911 --> 02:00:50,613
[SPEAKER_05]: We've experienced them in Salt Method with the Dunkin' Donuts that has a distributor off of Mystic Ave.

1459
02:00:51,253 --> 02:01:01,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though businesses say they're quiet, when you take pallets to and from the trucks, especially if they're outdoor docking stations, that noise travels.

1460
02:01:02,597 --> 02:01:09,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you know, we just built 145 condos behind the Wendy's in that particular area.

1461
02:01:09,504 --> 02:01:17,951
[SPEAKER_05]: We have residents off to the left, which is right next to BJ, which is probably 100, 200 yards away, a couple hundred yards away.

1462
02:01:18,412 --> 02:01:24,458
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's definitely a neighborhood in that area, Mr. President, and I would ask that we set up a committee of whole.

1463
02:01:25,158 --> 02:01:38,065
[SPEAKER_05]: or if we want to have a next council meeting, serve as a public meeting to invite the neighborhood, Mr. President, and area residents so they can have input and see this presentation and ask questions.

1464
02:01:39,128 --> 02:01:48,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate also the fact that the administration is looking into bringing in additional businesses in our community.

1465
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:54,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always stated the Office of Community Development is supposed to be out there soliciting new businesses into the community.

1466
02:01:54,972 --> 02:01:56,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So a TIF is another way.

1467
02:01:57,172 --> 02:02:00,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Would I rather do it differently and not give any incentive?

1468
02:02:00,713 --> 02:02:07,975
[SPEAKER_05]: And I probably would prefer that, Mr. President, but that remains a vote of this council and to see how this works.

1469
02:02:09,795 --> 02:02:20,199
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, the last TIF I voted for, which was the sausage establishment on 9th Street, seems to be running very successful.

1470
02:02:20,519 --> 02:02:21,339
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a good neighbor.

1471
02:02:21,659 --> 02:02:29,942
[SPEAKER_05]: They're located within a residential area, but there were a lot of issues on that TIF that we had to work out, Mr. President.

1472
02:02:30,262 --> 02:02:37,585
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of neighborhood issues, as this gentleman mentioned, with the silos, noise, trucking, trucks that are idling.

1473
02:02:38,365 --> 02:02:39,767
[SPEAKER_05]: It always happens, Mr. President.

1474
02:02:40,047 --> 02:02:45,572
[SPEAKER_05]: The BJ parking lot, which is a giant parking lot right next to this building, go there at night.

1475
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:48,795
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 18 wheelers idling there at night, Mr. President.

1476
02:02:49,056 --> 02:02:52,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not trying to get it to BJ's, but just a place to stay.

1477
02:02:52,659 --> 02:02:57,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Mr. President, the city just approved a gas station for the BJ's parking lot.

1478
02:02:57,784 --> 02:03:07,630
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to add a brand new gas station with, I believe, eight pumps located right in the frontage on Middlesex Ave of a new gas station there.

1479
02:03:08,051 --> 02:03:10,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot going on in this area, Mr. President.

1480
02:03:10,752 --> 02:03:14,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be quite frank, Middlesex Ave is deplorable.

1481
02:03:16,296 --> 02:03:19,938
[SPEAKER_05]: The sidewalks, the street, it looks like a third world country.

1482
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:21,219
[SPEAKER_05]: It really does.

1483
02:03:21,579 --> 02:03:25,302
[SPEAKER_05]: It's deplorable, it's a state owned road, it gets zero attention.

1484
02:03:26,337 --> 02:03:29,722
[SPEAKER_05]: from the state, and Natural History City has zero responsibility.

1485
02:03:30,322 --> 02:03:41,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we do move forward, Mr. President, and the TIF is with the state and so forth, I'd like to see a commitment from the state to do some work, Mr. President, on Middlesex Ave.

1486
02:03:42,118 --> 02:03:53,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And bring it up to the 21st century regarding crossings, pedestrian safety, cars, and everything else, Mr. President, bike lanes, and everything else that needs to take place on Middlesex Ave.

1487
02:03:53,524 --> 02:03:57,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask that, Mr. President, I am not going to vote on this tonight.

1488
02:03:57,446 --> 02:03:58,906
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't mean I don't support it.

1489
02:03:59,447 --> 02:04:09,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I want neighborhood input and I want the questions to be asked about the roadway and neighborhood concerns addressed.

1490
02:04:09,712 --> 02:04:10,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1491
02:04:10,512 --> 02:04:11,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1492
02:04:11,973 --> 02:04:12,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1493
02:04:14,394 --> 02:04:15,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1494
02:04:16,716 --> 02:04:20,358
[SPEAKER_03]: It appears to me that this would be what's classified as a bakery wholesaler.

1495
02:04:20,638 --> 02:04:23,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I correct in making that assumption?

1496
02:04:25,141 --> 02:04:26,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Monaco, would you be able to answer that?

1497
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:36,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we would be a producer of bakery products for both wholesale and food service and retail.

1498
02:04:36,748 --> 02:04:41,792
[SPEAKER_16]: So wholesalers end up delivering it to retailers in the end.

1499
02:04:41,872 --> 02:04:44,514
[SPEAKER_16]: So yes, sir, I can live with that definition.

1500
02:04:44,995 --> 02:04:48,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I do believe that.

1501
02:04:49,317 --> 02:04:58,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you'd be considered a bakery wholesaler and you'd be subject to USDA approval and inspection, you wouldn't be subject to the authority of the local board of health, is that correct?

1502
02:04:59,386 --> 02:05:00,087
[SPEAKER_16]: That is correct.

1503
02:05:00,127 --> 02:05:07,354
[SPEAKER_16]: As I stated earlier, this would be a USDA federally inspected bakery under all regulations.

1504
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:08,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1505
02:05:10,241 --> 02:05:15,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked a little bit about the jobs that Monogram's going to bring.

1506
02:05:15,065 --> 02:05:20,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm relatively familiar with Monogram Foods from my day job working in the insurance industry.

1507
02:05:20,609 --> 02:05:25,452
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand a lot of these positions are packaging jobs and manufacturing almost type jobs?

1508
02:05:27,674 --> 02:05:27,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1509
02:05:28,815 --> 02:05:36,160
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd have also a smaller array of positions that were mid to upper level management and then you'd have some drivers?

1510
02:05:37,928 --> 02:05:49,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Quality assurance people, supervisors, financial accounting people, general plant management, drivers, warehouse men, yes.

1511
02:05:50,358 --> 02:05:54,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there any local hiring preference that's part of the TIF?

1512
02:05:55,302 --> 02:06:02,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, any local- Local hiring, if you're located in Medford and you have two applicants, and one of them's from Medford and one of them's from Everett.

1513
02:06:03,142 --> 02:06:04,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the Medford person get the job?

1514
02:06:05,043 --> 02:06:06,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a local hiring preference?

1515
02:06:06,965 --> 02:06:17,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Our plan is to give Medford, experienced Medford employees, those that particularly have bakery experience, that's of great interest to us.

1516
02:06:18,693 --> 02:06:21,115
[SPEAKER_16]: As you covered earlier on your other topics,

1517
02:06:21,915 --> 02:06:27,180
[SPEAKER_16]: employees in your particular area of greater Boston, proximity to work is important.

1518
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:28,582
[SPEAKER_16]: The commutes can be terrible.

1519
02:06:28,662 --> 02:06:34,567
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're hopeful there's a good pool of applicants within the greater Medford City area that will work for us.

1520
02:06:36,028 --> 02:06:37,149
[SPEAKER_16]: And there is a Medford hiring.

1521
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:39,271
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a Medford provision built within the agreement.

1522
02:06:39,532 --> 02:06:39,832
[SPEAKER_03]: There is.

1523
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:40,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1524
02:06:40,352 --> 02:06:40,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1525
02:06:40,573 --> 02:06:40,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1526
02:06:40,753 --> 02:06:41,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Dave.

1527
02:06:41,754 --> 02:06:42,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in there.

1528
02:06:43,535 --> 02:06:43,755
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1529
02:06:45,517 --> 02:06:45,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Well.

1530
02:06:47,077 --> 02:06:49,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally have supported tips in the past.

1531
02:06:50,042 --> 02:06:54,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's a great way to jumpstart our economy and bring jobs to the community.

1532
02:06:55,612 --> 02:06:58,877
[SPEAKER_03]: The jobs that pay $20 an hour, the jobs that pay $800 a week.

1533
02:07:00,987 --> 02:07:02,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Those aren't necessarily the jobs I'm crazy about.

1534
02:07:03,310 --> 02:07:07,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see jobs that pay a living wage so the people that work here can live here.

1535
02:07:07,414 --> 02:07:11,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And that hiring preference isn't going to go too far if the people working there are going to make 800 bucks a week.

1536
02:07:12,439 --> 02:07:17,405
[SPEAKER_03]: With that being said, there are other positions and other jobs and other benefits that come with having an employer of this size in the community.

1537
02:07:18,045 --> 02:07:19,346
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would agree with Councilor Marks.

1538
02:07:19,386 --> 02:07:29,069
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past when we've done this, we've taken a slow and deliberate approach to be sure that we don't all arise cross LRTs and also listen to the concerns that the residents have.

1539
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:35,472
[SPEAKER_03]: In looking at the location of this facility, it's, I believe, located in an industrially zoned district.

1540
02:07:36,212 --> 02:07:38,633
[SPEAKER_03]: a wholesale bakery can be stationed there by right.

1541
02:07:39,834 --> 02:07:45,576
[SPEAKER_03]: The option, the ability for the council to bring this entity to the table right now is purely based around this TIF.

1542
02:07:46,497 --> 02:07:55,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it would be a good exercise for us to allow the opportunity to entertain Councilor Mark's motion, and I would second it or support it if he offers it.

1543
02:07:56,281 --> 02:08:05,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And move from there, but this is something that historically I've supported, and I certainly see no problem with it based upon the preliminary presentation that's been made, but I would like to hear from the residents as well.

1544
02:08:06,127 --> 02:08:06,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1545
02:08:07,008 --> 02:08:09,849
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, Councilor Bears.

1546
02:08:12,211 --> 02:08:13,151
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1547
02:08:14,212 --> 02:08:17,254
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I've done a dive on this, done some research around TIFs.

1548
02:08:17,474 --> 02:08:19,815
[SPEAKER_22]: I spoke with Maria from MOBD as well.

1549
02:08:21,737 --> 02:08:31,543
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, and from what I've understood, these have been used as an incentive to address areas of low demand, areas of blight, kind of that's the intent here.

1550
02:08:33,535 --> 02:08:37,139
[SPEAKER_22]: I wouldn't necessarily say that Medford is an area of low demand or an area of blight.

1551
02:08:37,539 --> 02:08:43,125
[SPEAKER_22]: I know this has, you know, bakery has not been operated in for a little while, so there might be a little wiggle room there.

1552
02:08:43,205 --> 02:08:48,190
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, that's one of the concerns I have.

1553
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:55,077
[SPEAKER_22]: And also in my research and speaking with MOBD, it does seem that tips are mostly going to large corporations versus

1554
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:57,801
[SPEAKER_22]: looking at small businesses.

1555
02:08:57,861 --> 02:09:02,162
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's another area of concern that I have in general around the process.

1556
02:09:03,062 --> 02:09:08,384
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have a couple questions for Mr. Monica from Monogram Foods.

1557
02:09:09,305 --> 02:09:18,768
[SPEAKER_22]: The first of which is, have you discussed or would you consider any curbing, driveway, or traffic improvements around the property?

1558
02:09:22,071 --> 02:09:30,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you be referring to on the actual property we would be leasing, or are you talking on city-owned property?

1559
02:09:30,575 --> 02:09:32,936
[SPEAKER_22]: It seems to me it might even be state-owned property.

1560
02:09:34,337 --> 02:09:36,358
[SPEAKER_22]: Essentially, I drive that road a lot.

1561
02:09:36,458 --> 02:09:37,959
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not a very safe area.

1562
02:09:38,079 --> 02:09:41,720
[SPEAKER_22]: I would expect that trucks are going to have some issues coming out of your location.

1563
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:46,463
[SPEAKER_22]: And during your study of this location as a potential location,

1564
02:09:47,403 --> 02:09:56,406
[SPEAKER_22]: have you noticed or considered working with the state or the city around state-owned or city-owned property as well as your property?

1565
02:09:57,987 --> 02:09:58,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we do.

1566
02:09:59,007 --> 02:10:14,652
[SPEAKER_16]: Normally, as part of a plant remodel of this size, we would look at all ingresses and egresses, primarily from employee safety and where the employees would park, where trucks would come in and unload or back trailers in.

1567
02:10:14,672 --> 02:10:15,733
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yes, we would look at that.

1568
02:10:15,793 --> 02:10:16,573
[SPEAKER_16]: We'd be open to

1569
02:10:17,313 --> 02:10:22,696
[SPEAKER_16]: improving curb cuts, making sure they were in the right locations and they were safe.

1570
02:10:22,816 --> 02:10:25,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously we can't have damaged equipment.

1571
02:10:25,297 --> 02:10:34,081
[SPEAKER_16]: So if the facility's parking lot is in bad shape and has potholes, we're going to fix those things as part of our normal rehab of a facility.

1572
02:10:35,582 --> 02:10:35,822
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

1573
02:10:35,942 --> 02:10:36,403
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1574
02:10:38,083 --> 02:10:45,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Next question is, you know, are you considering any other locations for this plant other than Medford?

1575
02:10:47,472 --> 02:10:59,419
[SPEAKER_16]: We have considered four alternative locations, two of which are in Massachusetts and two of which are not, are located in other states where we have plants.

1576
02:11:01,120 --> 02:11:03,321
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's as much as I can say on that.

1577
02:11:04,542 --> 02:11:11,965
[SPEAKER_16]: We have two substantial plants in Wisconsin and that was one of our other sites as well.

1578
02:11:12,045 --> 02:11:14,706
[SPEAKER_16]: So yes, we went through a complete search.

1579
02:11:15,826 --> 02:11:18,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the original list had eight potential sites.

1580
02:11:18,527 --> 02:11:19,748
[SPEAKER_16]: We narrowed that down to four.

1581
02:11:20,868 --> 02:11:21,829
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, gotcha.

1582
02:11:21,909 --> 02:11:30,512
[SPEAKER_22]: And I do have a few more questions, but I think on the note that Councilor Knight was sending and my fellow councilors as well, you know,

1583
02:11:31,182 --> 02:11:34,383
[SPEAKER_22]: If we make a commitment to you, we'd want a shared commitment there.

1584
02:11:34,563 --> 02:11:38,365
[SPEAKER_22]: So I do think that should be part of a deliberative process to move forward.

1585
02:11:39,786 --> 02:11:41,006
[SPEAKER_22]: It sounded like you're privately held.

1586
02:11:41,026 --> 02:11:47,969
[SPEAKER_22]: You might not be able or willing to answer this question, but what is Monogram's net revenue annually?

1587
02:11:51,901 --> 02:11:55,643
[SPEAKER_16]: This year, it will approximate 750 million.

1588
02:11:56,243 --> 02:11:59,285
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not sure what you consider to be a large company.

1589
02:12:00,045 --> 02:12:02,466
[SPEAKER_16]: We are only 16 years old.

1590
02:12:03,087 --> 02:12:09,570
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we're very proud of our growth, but we don't consider ourselves a large company at that revenue level.

1591
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:10,410
[SPEAKER_22]: Got it.

1592
02:12:10,810 --> 02:12:13,852
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's just kind of goes to my next question, which is

1593
02:12:16,234 --> 02:12:19,956
[SPEAKER_22]: Is $600,000 really going to be the difference for you?

1594
02:12:19,976 --> 02:12:28,359
[SPEAKER_22]: I would consider you, maybe we'll call you medium-sized, but $750 million sounds like a lot of money to me.

1595
02:12:28,519 --> 02:12:42,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this $600,000 really the difference maker for you in making this kind of long-term decision versus all of the other factors that you've mentioned, like the location and the building and the silos and all of the other conditions?

1596
02:12:42,704 --> 02:12:43,864
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it really the $600,000 that's the make or break?

1597
02:12:47,462 --> 02:12:54,587
[SPEAKER_16]: All state incentives and local TIF incentives are relevant to every decision that we make.

1598
02:12:55,428 --> 02:12:59,031
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not the only decision, but in this case, it is a relevant decision.

1599
02:12:59,451 --> 02:13:05,455
[SPEAKER_16]: As I said, we're not a large company, and between the real estate tax incentive

1600
02:13:07,177 --> 02:13:12,040
[SPEAKER_16]: and the personal property, it's approximately, David can answer this, I think it was 950,000.

1601
02:13:12,721 --> 02:13:17,825
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is material to our decision, yes.

1602
02:13:18,786 --> 02:13:19,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1603
02:13:19,787 --> 02:13:26,552
[SPEAKER_17]: The 950,000 number that Jeff mentioned is what we view as the upper limit of what it would be.

1604
02:13:26,672 --> 02:13:32,137
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I was talking about a TIF, there's always some flexibility, there's always some unknown variables.

1605
02:13:32,497 --> 02:13:33,578
[SPEAKER_17]: So in the modeling that we did

1606
02:13:33,778 --> 02:13:36,341
[SPEAKER_17]: that showed the $4 million net value back to the city.

1607
02:13:36,981 --> 02:13:44,588
[SPEAKER_17]: The more Monogram invests, the more market forces impact the value, the larger the exemption, but also larger the revenue back to the city.

1608
02:13:44,749 --> 02:13:55,399
[SPEAKER_17]: So there will be some fluctuation there, but based on Ellen's best guess and Ellen's hard work, I think that that number is exactly where, it's definitely gonna be in that window.

1609
02:13:56,478 --> 02:13:56,698
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1610
02:13:57,058 --> 02:13:57,759
[SPEAKER_22]: And I understand.

1611
02:13:57,839 --> 02:14:06,385
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just saying, you know, regardless 600,000 at the low end, 950 at the high end, we're talking about like 0.1% of the annual revenue for a 50 year investment.

1612
02:14:06,425 --> 02:14:20,355
[SPEAKER_22]: It just, you know, it's a small relative to this amount that you mentioned of $750 million a year and that you're a quickly growing company and that you sextupled the amount of revenue that was coming from your plant in Wilmington.

1613
02:14:20,395 --> 02:14:25,038
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's, it seems like in some sense in your account book, it might be,

1614
02:14:26,095 --> 02:14:27,456
[SPEAKER_22]: worth a little bit less to you than to us.

1615
02:14:27,756 --> 02:14:32,799
[SPEAKER_22]: Our revenue is not $750 million a year here in Medford.

1616
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:35,720
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you for answering my questions.

1617
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:49,447
[SPEAKER_22]: I think maybe more directed towards Alicia Hunt or Dave Rodriguez, I do have some concerns that this sets a bad precedent, considering that we are a pretty high demand community.

1618
02:14:49,487 --> 02:14:50,748
[SPEAKER_22]: Our property values are growing.

1619
02:14:50,768 --> 02:14:55,270
[SPEAKER_22]: It seems that that's going to continue for the foreseeable future in the greater Boston area.

1620
02:14:56,093 --> 02:15:03,634
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have any concerns that this sets a precedent for offering public subsidies and discounts in order to get new businesses in the future after this project?

1621
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:09,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I can't speak for and I think this is a good conversation for the mayor as well.

1622
02:15:09,832 --> 02:15:11,953
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've always viewed TIFs as case by case.

1623
02:15:12,853 --> 02:15:14,894
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't view this as precedent setting.

1624
02:15:14,934 --> 02:15:23,237
[SPEAKER_17]: I view this as looking at bringing this business to this location and for the city and the value that it provides to the city based on that analysis.

1625
02:15:23,677 --> 02:15:28,119
[SPEAKER_17]: Every TIF is going to be case by case based upon some of the factors that you talked about.

1626
02:15:28,899 --> 02:15:42,025
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not worried about creating a precedent because there is a strong check on this through the council process to say, you know, some cities and towns have given out TIFs pretty tightly.

1627
02:15:42,265 --> 02:15:43,886
[SPEAKER_17]: Others have given it out pretty loosely.

1628
02:15:44,766 --> 02:15:53,290
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a case by, I've always viewed this as case by case, what's best for the community, for the business that they're bringing in and the site that they're being located at.

1629
02:15:53,330 --> 02:15:56,392
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll defer to Alicia as well as to her thoughts.

1630
02:15:56,992 --> 02:16:06,537
[SPEAKER_17]: on that, but I'm not concerned about setting a precedent.

1631
02:16:06,597 --> 02:16:08,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Alicia not my Alicia?

1632
02:16:09,838 --> 02:16:11,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the wrong Alicia, sorry.

1633
02:16:12,139 --> 02:16:12,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia Hunt.

1634
02:16:14,908 --> 02:16:20,972
[SPEAKER_20]: that we've been seeing is that Medford is a hot demand for residential.

1635
02:16:21,512 --> 02:16:29,117
[SPEAKER_20]: And every developer that has been knocking on our door, almost every developer, has been wanting to build a large multifamily residence.

1636
02:16:29,717 --> 02:16:33,540
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is something that has caused this council a lot of angst.

1637
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:35,221
[SPEAKER_20]: It's caused the mayor a lot of angst.

1638
02:16:35,941 --> 02:16:42,065
[SPEAKER_20]: And one of the things we have been looking to do is to bring in more commercial entities that bring jobs with them.

1639
02:16:42,806 --> 02:16:45,249
[SPEAKER_20]: and this business is bringing jobs.

1640
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:49,895
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have another business knocking on the door saying, can we give you jobs?

1641
02:16:50,316 --> 02:16:57,746
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't make a big deal of it when Whole Foods closed last winter, but they did close and all of those people were laid off.

1642
02:16:58,408 --> 02:17:12,020
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is somebody who actually wants to not just put another business there, but actually a business with the hopes of rehiring the people in this area who were recently laid off by that entity there.

1643
02:17:12,501 --> 02:17:14,763
[SPEAKER_20]: They'll be bringing back similar jobs.

1644
02:17:14,943 --> 02:17:16,865
[SPEAKER_20]: They'll be doing similar kinds of work.

1645
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:22,341
[SPEAKER_20]: it'll be no more disruption to the community than we had there previously.

1646
02:17:22,721 --> 02:17:30,943
[SPEAKER_20]: We're hoping because it's a new business and we're having conversations with them, that disruption that notice would be less than what we had there.

1647
02:17:31,763 --> 02:17:39,465
[SPEAKER_20]: But the basis, bottom line is, those people don't have jobs right now unless they've gone off and found them in other areas.

1648
02:17:40,086 --> 02:17:42,586
[SPEAKER_20]: This is something that we would like to see here in the city.

1649
02:17:44,307 --> 02:17:45,907
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I understand the idea of jobs,

1650
02:17:46,752 --> 02:17:54,073
[SPEAKER_22]: And no disrespect, if it's been 11 months, I would guess that they've had to get another job at this point just to pay the rent.

1651
02:17:54,913 --> 02:18:02,935
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand bringing in jobs, but to Councilor Knight's point as well, it might cost more than $20 an hour to live in Medford.

1652
02:18:02,955 --> 02:18:04,795
[SPEAKER_22]: At least that's my personal experience.

1653
02:18:07,816 --> 02:18:16,057
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess- We have a large number of people that actually make and live here that make below the area median income.

1654
02:18:17,377 --> 02:18:22,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Our area median income is lower than the regional area median income.

1655
02:18:23,401 --> 02:18:25,322
[SPEAKER_20]: So that is something to consider.

1656
02:18:25,382 --> 02:18:28,864
[SPEAKER_20]: It is very expensive to live in Medford because of the housing prices.

1657
02:18:29,684 --> 02:18:33,407
[SPEAKER_20]: But we've also been going through a pandemic and we have very high unemployment rates.

1658
02:18:33,867 --> 02:18:39,430
[SPEAKER_20]: We're seeing unprecedented usage of the food pantries here in Medford.

1659
02:18:39,910 --> 02:18:46,194
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would not assume that the people who were working there have found jobs.

1660
02:18:46,888 --> 02:18:48,969
[SPEAKER_20]: that there's a high unemployment rate going on.

1661
02:18:49,389 --> 02:18:50,609
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that wasn't what I was saying.

1662
02:18:50,629 --> 02:18:54,051
[SPEAKER_22]: I was saying I assume they've had to find some way to make money in the interim period.

1663
02:18:54,091 --> 02:18:57,852
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not just waiting for Monogram to move in here to take an old job back.

1664
02:18:59,593 --> 02:19:02,974
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, I guess it sounds like it's case by case.

1665
02:19:03,034 --> 02:19:04,574
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not setting a precedent.

1666
02:19:06,115 --> 02:19:08,075
[SPEAKER_22]: At least that's the position of the administration.

1667
02:19:08,816 --> 02:19:10,436
[SPEAKER_22]: And I understand all the other factors.

1668
02:19:11,177 --> 02:19:12,137
[SPEAKER_22]: I do think it is a

1669
02:19:13,101 --> 02:19:20,049
[SPEAKER_22]: of concern to set a precedent to say, if we want a business here, we're going to have to give them hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks to do it.

1670
02:19:20,169 --> 02:19:25,455
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's a concern that I have, in addition to the other concerns that have been raised by fellow councilors.

1671
02:19:25,976 --> 02:19:28,999
[SPEAKER_22]: And I look forward to more deliberation on the matter.

1672
02:19:29,339 --> 02:19:30,340
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1673
02:19:30,761 --> 02:19:31,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1674
02:19:31,942 --> 02:19:32,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1675
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:35,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1676
02:19:35,061 --> 02:19:36,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information from the Vice President.

1677
02:19:37,683 --> 02:19:42,806
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been on this council ten years, and this is only the second TIF that's come my way.

1678
02:19:42,906 --> 02:19:44,287
[SPEAKER_18]: Council March has been here longer.

1679
02:19:44,747 --> 02:19:45,888
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if anything has come.

1680
02:19:47,229 --> 02:19:51,532
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's say, so TIF's not given up very generously in this community.

1681
02:19:52,292 --> 02:19:54,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's say this is only the second one that I've been involved with in ten years.

1682
02:19:56,848 --> 02:20:05,710
[SPEAKER_18]: And by the way, I think they're a useful tool to bring business to the community, especially where things are very competitive these days.

1683
02:20:05,730 --> 02:20:07,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1684
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:08,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1685
02:20:08,730 --> 02:20:10,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Villescaz, I'll start with your question.

1686
02:20:11,331 --> 02:20:22,673
[SPEAKER_22]: I would just add, just for the notes, for the record, for the future, that we look into using some of the proceeds if the TIF is approved,

1687
02:20:23,537 --> 02:20:35,382
[SPEAKER_22]: into tip accountability that's been one of the recommendations, policy recommendations around tips recently, making sure that they are being held up, that the agreements are being held to.

1688
02:20:35,462 --> 02:20:40,084
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd just like to put that for the record, maybe for a future committee of the whole meeting to discuss further.

1689
02:20:41,185 --> 02:20:43,026
[SPEAKER_22]: And I understand it's not something we've done in the past.

1690
02:20:43,066 --> 02:20:45,567
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm more concerned about what we're going to do in the future.

1691
02:20:46,407 --> 02:20:47,708
[SPEAKER_22]: We do have a new administration.

1692
02:20:47,728 --> 02:20:50,409
[SPEAKER_22]: We're hiring economic development director.

1693
02:20:51,111 --> 02:20:56,854
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this going to be our economic development plan going forward to bring in this business because we have this high residential demand?

1694
02:20:56,874 --> 02:20:58,594
[SPEAKER_22]: So I understand we haven't done it in the past.

1695
02:20:58,654 --> 02:21:02,556
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's probably a good thing, good stewardship, that we're not just giving these out willy-nilly.

1696
02:21:02,616 --> 02:21:06,758
[SPEAKER_22]: I know there are a lot of communities that do that and have found themselves in trouble.

1697
02:21:07,318 --> 02:21:12,201
[SPEAKER_22]: City of Chicago, 33% of their property tax revenue is wrapped up in TIFs right now.

1698
02:21:12,261 --> 02:21:12,661
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that's

1699
02:21:13,225 --> 02:21:19,470
[SPEAKER_22]: A little different from Medford, but I also know Malden, Salem, and other communities have used these tools pretty extensively.

1700
02:21:20,631 --> 02:21:24,453
[SPEAKER_22]: So just saying we need to keep a close eye on the future.

1701
02:21:24,493 --> 02:21:29,557
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the last thing we want to have is that if a business is coming here, they expect a TIF.

1702
02:21:30,058 --> 02:21:30,378
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1703
02:21:30,755 --> 02:21:31,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1704
02:21:31,756 --> 02:21:32,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1705
02:21:33,177 --> 02:21:34,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

1706
02:21:34,418 --> 02:21:44,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, again, I echo the sentiments of my colleagues and the, uh, fact of really stretching this out for the fact that we have public input as we move forward with this.

1707
02:21:45,105 --> 02:21:46,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a great idea.

1708
02:21:46,446 --> 02:21:55,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is, uh, you know, uh, be interesting to see if there's any data that shows the amount of method residents that worked in the whole foods plant.

1709
02:21:56,513 --> 02:21:56,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

1710
02:21:57,370 --> 02:22:08,767
[SPEAKER_09]: prior to their closure and just so they could reinforce the need and the support that we'll be giving if voted with this TIF.

1711
02:22:08,787 --> 02:22:10,990
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, I think.

1712
02:22:12,472 --> 02:22:14,033
[SPEAKER_09]: all of our cows will bring up some good points.

1713
02:22:14,653 --> 02:22:22,275
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, one thing we're seeing, especially during the COVID times, there's a lot of empty spaces and this is a big space.

1714
02:22:22,575 --> 02:22:33,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, as long as we do it correctly and get the input from our neighbors, um, I think this is, uh, an area that, um, we'd like to see some growth and some movement.

1715
02:22:33,219 --> 02:22:33,339
[SPEAKER_09]: So

1716
02:22:34,030 --> 02:22:57,255
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be interesting to see if I could it would be interesting to see if our traffic engineer Has done we could ask them if we can't to invite him to the next meeting just to get a traffic assessment moving forward with this this company this company and its growth and and and again you know with the weight restrictions for

1717
02:22:57,880 --> 02:23:00,341
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, our major thoroughways, the Middlesex and Fellsway.

1718
02:23:00,981 --> 02:23:08,624
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fear that some neighbors have always stressed, even with Bianchi's, is that are the trucks going to be going down the side streets?

1719
02:23:08,684 --> 02:23:17,028
[SPEAKER_09]: And especially those side streets are full with children playing in a pretty tight-knit residential neighborhood and making sure we keep those streets safe.

1720
02:23:17,568 --> 02:23:21,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure this company will support us in moving forward any decision.

1721
02:23:21,169 --> 02:23:26,792
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm excited for the process and appreciate them for coming to Medford.

1722
02:23:27,772 --> 02:23:29,133
[SPEAKER_09]: looking to make Medford their home.

1723
02:23:29,213 --> 02:23:34,976
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, but again, supporting, uh, Councilor Marks is resolution, a thousand percent.

1724
02:23:35,416 --> 02:23:42,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that, uh, community, uh, involvement to get the communities impact behind this decision, I think would be very important.

1725
02:23:42,859 --> 02:23:44,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1726
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:51,103
[SPEAKER_22]: One thing I'd just like to add to the records, uh, for the committee report, um, for the committee of the whole to be held.

1727
02:23:51,183 --> 02:23:55,065
[SPEAKER_22]: If that motion passes, which I expect that it will, um, is that we amend,

1728
02:23:55,717 --> 02:24:07,581
[SPEAKER_22]: the TIF or add language to the TIF agreement that Monogram Foods would not contest a card check or an LRB election if the workers chose to unionize at this facility.

1729
02:24:10,582 --> 02:24:12,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something you want to discuss in committee at all?

1730
02:24:13,623 --> 02:24:13,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1731
02:24:14,123 --> 02:24:14,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1732
02:24:14,963 --> 02:24:15,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1733
02:24:15,624 --> 02:24:15,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1734
02:24:16,844 --> 02:24:19,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank all the councilors for their questions.

1735
02:24:19,605 --> 02:24:21,606
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may, I have a couple of quick questions.

1736
02:24:23,327 --> 02:24:26,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mr. Monica, thank you very much for your interest in the city of Medford.

1737
02:24:27,473 --> 02:24:31,479
[SPEAKER_04]: With regard to the construction, when would the construction begin and how long would it last?

1738
02:24:34,215 --> 02:24:41,178
[SPEAKER_16]: At this point, the facility is becoming available.

1739
02:24:42,299 --> 02:24:46,020
[SPEAKER_16]: We would not start any construction until we make a decision.

1740
02:24:46,201 --> 02:24:51,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously it's contingent upon the approval of a TIF program with the city of Medford.

1741
02:24:52,023 --> 02:24:55,685
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this point, it would be very soon after that,

1742
02:24:56,305 --> 02:25:02,908
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a demand and a commitment to have production up and running within six months.

1743
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:10,552
[SPEAKER_16]: And if it isn't going to be in Medford, it will be somewhere and it'll be within six, I'm going to say six to eight months.

1744
02:25:10,612 --> 02:25:14,774
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are ready to move forward quickly if approved.

1745
02:25:15,814 --> 02:25:25,619
[SPEAKER_16]: And if not approved with City of Medford, we'll have to move forward and go anywhere because we have a large customer who is asking for the production as soon as possible.

1746
02:25:26,927 --> 02:25:31,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So would the construction be done by July 1st?

1747
02:25:33,781 --> 02:25:38,083
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say right now we're estimating it's going to take six to eight months.

1748
02:25:38,123 --> 02:25:39,164
[SPEAKER_16]: So pretty close to that.

1749
02:25:40,144 --> 02:25:45,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Sir, again, you never know when you're doing a major remodeling, if you run into any issues, right?

1750
02:25:45,567 --> 02:25:50,709
[SPEAKER_16]: If there's a structural issue with the roof or a wall or drainage or something.

1751
02:25:50,769 --> 02:25:52,150
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can't commit that.

1752
02:25:52,730 --> 02:25:57,092
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an older facility and they're all different and they're all unique.

1753
02:25:58,553 --> 02:25:58,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1754
02:25:58,893 --> 02:25:59,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1755
02:25:59,833 --> 02:26:00,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have another question.

1756
02:26:00,694 --> 02:26:01,614
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be for Alan.

1757
02:26:04,538 --> 02:26:07,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing it's 2020, anything can happen.

1758
02:26:08,339 --> 02:26:24,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean to sound negative, but what happens with regard to the TIF, if Monogram was to be sold or if you were to go out of business, what happens with the TIF and are there any safeguards to the city?

1759
02:26:27,107 --> 02:26:27,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me unmute you.

1760
02:26:40,147 --> 02:26:40,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying.

1761
02:26:40,587 --> 02:26:40,987
[SPEAKER_04]: One second.

1762
02:26:48,631 --> 02:26:56,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you try and mute it?

1763
02:26:57,075 --> 02:26:58,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you let me ask my question?

1764
02:27:01,778 --> 02:27:02,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

1765
02:27:12,342 --> 02:27:14,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Mr. President, I think Maria can answer the question.

1766
02:27:14,703 --> 02:27:15,463
[SPEAKER_17]: I can also weigh in.

1767
02:27:15,563 --> 02:27:16,804
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fine.

1768
02:27:16,844 --> 02:27:18,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Maria, if you wouldn't mind weighing in, that'd be great.

1769
02:27:19,565 --> 02:27:20,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1770
02:27:20,085 --> 02:27:21,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Council President.

1771
02:27:22,306 --> 02:27:24,708
[SPEAKER_07]: So actually, Ellen and I had this conversation.

1772
02:27:25,228 --> 02:27:26,688
[SPEAKER_07]: She had asked a similar question.

1773
02:27:27,129 --> 02:27:33,391
[SPEAKER_07]: So the TIF is for the company, so not the location.

1774
02:27:33,451 --> 02:27:36,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, you know,

1775
02:27:38,346 --> 02:27:48,393
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in the event of, as you said, you know, another 2020 happens, um, and, uh, monogram foods, you know, leaves in three years.

1776
02:27:48,713 --> 02:27:48,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1777
02:27:49,034 --> 02:27:53,237
[SPEAKER_07]: So they, um, that tip ends on that location.

1778
02:27:54,818 --> 02:27:55,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1779
02:27:56,099 --> 02:27:57,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone else moves in.

1780
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:04,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want, and if you were so inclined to want to give them a tip, the new company, they'd have to go through the process again.

1781
02:28:04,305 --> 02:28:04,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1782
02:28:05,167 --> 02:28:08,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And are there any callbacks with regard to the TIF, if that was to happen?

1783
02:28:11,509 --> 02:28:14,630
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could do that.

1784
02:28:14,670 --> 02:28:19,872
[SPEAKER_07]: That would require, you know, going to an EACC meeting and, but yes, certainly.

1785
02:28:20,612 --> 02:28:20,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1786
02:28:20,832 --> 02:28:25,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And with regard to, Councilor Beeson had a question about, I think it was TIF accountability.

1787
02:28:25,914 --> 02:28:28,795
[SPEAKER_04]: And with regard to that, I believe if I'm correct that,

1788
02:28:30,250 --> 02:28:34,292
[SPEAKER_04]: monogram would be subject to regulatory filings.

1789
02:28:34,332 --> 02:28:34,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct?

1790
02:28:34,813 --> 02:28:35,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that?

1791
02:28:36,514 --> 02:28:36,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1792
02:28:38,615 --> 02:28:40,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Annual reporting to the city and to the state.

1793
02:28:40,576 --> 02:28:40,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1794
02:28:40,836 --> 02:28:49,040
[SPEAKER_04]: So the annual reporting to the city with regard to, was it the amount of investment they made and to the amount of employees that reside in Medford that were hired?

1795
02:28:49,060 --> 02:28:50,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct in that?

1796
02:28:51,902 --> 02:28:53,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct, there's different things.

1797
02:28:53,163 --> 02:28:58,007
[SPEAKER_17]: So usually with TIF accountability, it's done at the staff level.

1798
02:28:59,348 --> 02:29:06,793
[SPEAKER_17]: We can request information from the TIF holder, but we can ask for whatever information that we'd like.

1799
02:29:07,534 --> 02:29:16,780
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of that, there is specific information that needs to be reported back to the state through the EACC, including a monetary amount of improvements, the number of jobs created, et cetera.

1800
02:29:18,482 --> 02:29:19,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

1801
02:29:22,844 --> 02:29:24,165
[SPEAKER_22]: Just one last quick question.

1802
02:29:24,386 --> 02:29:28,970
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you currently leasing the facility right now or are you under agreement to lease the facility?

1803
02:29:31,533 --> 02:29:44,125
[SPEAKER_16]: We have got, I'm aware of a signed letter of intent to lease subject to final financing and any incentives, either state or local.

1804
02:29:45,827 --> 02:29:46,408
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

1805
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:50,383
[SPEAKER_17]: And just to clarify, the lease and the lease structure will be a triple net lease.

1806
02:29:50,903 --> 02:29:55,067
[SPEAKER_17]: So Monogram will be accountable for all taxes, water, electricity, et cetera.

1807
02:29:55,467 --> 02:29:59,291
[SPEAKER_17]: So the property owner, just a property owner at that point, they're not on the hook for any of this.

1808
02:30:01,132 --> 02:30:02,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1809
02:30:02,253 --> 02:30:03,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the council?

1810
02:30:03,474 --> 02:30:04,295
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Councilor Morell.

1811
02:30:04,835 --> 02:30:05,536
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1812
02:30:05,556 --> 02:30:07,798
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if this is a question for you or the administration.

1813
02:30:07,818 --> 02:30:11,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Does council approval of this, is it a simple majority or two thirds vote?

1814
02:30:14,113 --> 02:30:15,314
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if you know.

1815
02:30:15,894 --> 02:30:17,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Simple majority, I believe would.

1816
02:30:17,915 --> 02:30:18,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1817
02:30:18,655 --> 02:30:19,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1818
02:30:20,476 --> 02:30:20,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1819
02:30:21,136 --> 02:30:21,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1820
02:30:24,098 --> 02:30:25,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the council?

1821
02:30:26,739 --> 02:30:26,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1822
02:30:26,999 --> 02:30:27,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?

1823
02:30:27,879 --> 02:30:29,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have a question here.

1824
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Will Mavar.

1825
02:30:35,242 --> 02:30:38,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Will, name and address for the record, Will.

1826
02:30:40,078 --> 02:30:44,420
[SPEAKER_00]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1827
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:47,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for recognizing me, President Falco.

1828
02:30:48,522 --> 02:30:48,842
Thank you.

1829
02:30:49,363 --> 02:30:52,664
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, this TIF makes a lot of sense to me.

1830
02:30:53,625 --> 02:30:55,986
[SPEAKER_00]: We want this company to invest in our community.

1831
02:30:56,306 --> 02:30:58,887
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them to bring these jobs to Medford.

1832
02:31:00,008 --> 02:31:00,688
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's true.

1833
02:31:01,148 --> 02:31:06,611
[SPEAKER_00]: If we tax their improvements in the usual way, they don't want to come and make those improvements.

1834
02:31:06,991 --> 02:31:08,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't make the jobs, et cetera.

1835
02:31:10,451 --> 02:31:16,976
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the obvious question to me is why can't this sort of incentive be given to all taxpayers?

1836
02:31:18,558 --> 02:31:37,714
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've often said, by switching to a system where we reduce the tax on improvements and increase the bill rate as needed to make up for it on the land, businesses and homeowners and anybody else generally would be encouraged to invest in our community, just as this step will encourage monogram.

1837
02:31:39,145 --> 02:31:52,794
[SPEAKER_00]: As you go forward with considering this stuff, I hope you'll think about how lowering taxes on improvements generally will encourage investment without requiring that businesses strike a special deal.

1838
02:31:53,374 --> 02:32:01,059
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not for any corrupt reason, as Councilor Bears alluded to, that this tends to go to larger corporations.

1839
02:32:01,299 --> 02:32:05,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes a lot of sense, because you're only going to bother to go through this process if you have a large project going in.

1840
02:32:06,273 --> 02:32:08,254
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to do it for a very small process.

1841
02:32:08,274 --> 02:32:09,334
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be worth the time.

1842
02:32:10,795 --> 02:32:34,003
[SPEAKER_00]: But an across-the-board swap over to land value taxation would remove the burden of taxation on every investment, no matter who's making it, rather than just those projects that are large enough to go through the process of getting a TIF, where you have a specific company going through a process and they're concerned of, you know, it's not available to everyone.

1843
02:32:35,177 --> 02:32:44,203
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you'll consider that point and how this idea relates to the idea of land value taxation I brought before you so many times before.

1844
02:32:44,523 --> 02:32:44,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1845
02:32:45,304 --> 02:32:45,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Will.

1846
02:32:48,646 --> 02:32:49,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?

1847
02:32:52,068 --> 02:32:52,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hearing and seeing none.

1848
02:32:53,429 --> 02:32:54,890
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Marks.

1849
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:56,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, if I could just clarify.

1850
02:32:56,751 --> 02:32:57,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, Councilor Marks.

1851
02:32:57,651 --> 02:33:04,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So my motion was to, as part of the regular agenda, have a public meeting

1852
02:33:05,201 --> 02:33:17,811
[SPEAKER_06]: in which we notify the residents of Hague Square and Wellington via the reverse 9-1-1 on the public meeting that we're going to have.

1853
02:33:17,911 --> 02:33:21,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And to also give, Mr. President, because I don't believe we can have

1854
02:33:24,867 --> 02:33:37,170
[SPEAKER_05]: that we provide in the reverse 911 call, a description of the project, a very brief description and the intent and how to get onto the Zoom call, Mr. President.

1855
02:33:37,310 --> 02:33:38,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can do that.

1856
02:33:38,850 --> 02:33:42,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to make that as part of the regular agenda and not a separate committee?

1857
02:33:42,511 --> 02:33:45,192
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way I would prefer it rather than the committee of the whole.

1858
02:33:48,487 --> 02:33:50,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have that, Clerk Hurtubise?

1859
02:33:50,369 --> 02:33:54,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on that motion, offered by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1860
02:33:57,174 --> 02:33:58,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1861
02:34:01,717 --> 02:34:02,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears?

1862
02:34:02,498 --> 02:34:02,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1863
02:34:03,599 --> 02:34:04,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello?

1864
02:34:04,499 --> 02:34:04,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1865
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:05,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

1866
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:05,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1867
02:34:06,261 --> 02:34:06,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks?

1868
02:34:06,981 --> 02:34:07,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1869
02:34:07,542 --> 02:34:08,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell?

1870
02:34:08,382 --> 02:34:08,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1871
02:34:09,203 --> 02:34:09,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1872
02:34:09,984 --> 02:34:10,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1873
02:34:10,364 --> 02:34:11,064
[SPEAKER_10]: President Falco?

1874
02:34:11,285 --> 02:34:11,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1875
02:34:11,525 --> 02:34:15,348
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 in the affirmative, adjourned, the motion passes.

1876
02:34:19,864 --> 02:34:27,211
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor, Vice President Caraviello, to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1877
02:34:27,251 --> 02:34:27,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Please call the roll.

1878
02:34:32,196 --> 02:34:32,696

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1880
02:34:33,637 --> 02:34:34,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello?

1881
02:34:34,478 --> 02:34:34,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1882
02:34:34,958 --> 02:34:35,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

1883
02:34:35,439 --> 02:34:36,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1884
02:34:36,140 --> 02:34:36,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks?

1885
02:34:36,860 --> 02:34:37,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1886
02:34:37,441 --> 02:34:38,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell?

1887
02:34:38,222 --> 02:34:38,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1888
02:34:38,742 --> 02:34:39,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1889
02:34:39,503 --> 02:34:39,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1890
02:34:39,883 --> 02:34:40,444
[SPEAKER_10]: President Falco?

1891
02:34:40,464 --> 02:34:40,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1892
02:34:40,845 --> 02:34:43,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1893
02:34:43,445 --> 02:34:48,386
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-650, this is on the motions, orders and resolutions offered by Councilor Knight.

1894
02:34:49,007 --> 02:34:54,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford implement a no trucking ban, I'm sorry.

1895
02:34:55,148 --> 02:35:05,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford implement no trucking along Boston Ave between Route 16 and Route 60 until such time as the gas leaks are repaired and the roadway resurfaced.

1896
02:35:06,410 --> 02:35:06,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1897
02:35:07,955 --> 02:35:09,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1898
02:35:09,756 --> 02:35:18,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the course of what's been about two summers now, two and a half years now, I've been working with National Grid to get the level two gas leaks repaired.

1899
02:35:19,239 --> 02:35:25,502
[SPEAKER_03]: They would be right on Boston Ave, right around the corner of Harvard Canal, right in that stretch.

1900
02:35:26,062 --> 02:35:36,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been getting a lot of complaints, Mr. President, from residents in the neighborhood when I'm out down the park walking and the like, that the condition of the roadway is so poor,

1901
02:35:37,852 --> 02:35:39,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Coupled with the gas leaks, the people are very concerned.

1902
02:35:40,134 --> 02:35:46,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Their houses are shaking when trucks are coming down off Route 16, down Boston Ave to Route 60.

1903
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:57,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hoping that we can provide these residents with some relief from the heavy trucking and the noise and impact that it's having on their quality of life and the foundations of their homes.

1904
02:35:57,649 --> 02:36:02,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Through no fault of their own, but for the fault of the fact that our public utilities repair our roadways terrible.

1905
02:36:03,033 --> 02:36:05,535
[SPEAKER_03]: and that street maintenance is not the greatest, Mr. President.

1906
02:36:06,096 --> 02:36:17,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I'm asking that my council colleagues support this resolution to request that no trucking be posted or implemented along that stretch of the roadway until such times as these infrastructure and public utility problems can be addressed.

1907
02:36:19,668 --> 02:36:20,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

1908
02:36:22,270 --> 02:36:23,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions for the Council?

1909
02:36:23,371 --> 02:36:23,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comments?

1910
02:36:24,212 --> 02:36:24,572
[SPEAKER_22]: Second.

1911
02:36:25,013 --> 02:36:25,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1912
02:36:25,723 --> 02:36:27,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a second from Councilor Bears.

1913
02:36:27,105 --> 02:36:28,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone online here?

1914
02:36:28,607 --> 02:36:28,787
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1915
02:36:28,807 --> 02:36:31,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the motion for Councilor Wright, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1916
02:36:31,871 --> 02:36:33,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Urnavies, please call the roll.

1917
02:36:34,595 --> 02:36:35,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears?

1918
02:36:35,356 --> 02:36:35,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1919
02:36:35,916 --> 02:36:36,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello?

1920
02:36:36,818 --> 02:36:36,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1921
02:36:37,619 --> 02:36:38,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

1922
02:36:38,159 --> 02:36:38,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1923
02:36:38,820 --> 02:36:39,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks?

1924
02:36:39,521 --> 02:36:39,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1925
02:36:40,102 --> 02:36:40,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell?

1926
02:36:40,923 --> 02:36:41,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1927
02:36:41,825 --> 02:36:45,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli, looks like he's briefly absent from the chamber.

1928
02:36:45,307 --> 02:36:45,967
[SPEAKER_10]: President Falco.

1929
02:36:46,247 --> 02:36:48,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

1930
02:36:48,829 --> 02:36:49,709
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

1931
02:36:49,729 --> 02:37:04,356
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-0-651 offered by Council and I. Be it resolved that the City of Medford apply to participate in the Google Tree Canopy Lab, a mapping tool designed to identify where trees are needed most in urban communities.

1932
02:37:04,977 --> 02:37:05,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Council and I.

1933
02:37:05,988 --> 02:37:23,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Mr. President, this was brought to my attention through a very famous resident on Mystic Street, one of Councilor Caraviello's neighbors, a gentleman who's very involved in a number of issues in the community, whether it be the Chevalier Organ Society, or Trees for Medford, or the Shepard Brooks Estates, and the like, Mr. President.

1934
02:37:23,193 --> 02:37:33,436
[SPEAKER_03]: But Mr. Krause sent an email out identifying this tool that Google's put out, allowing communities to use Google's mapping technology

1935
02:37:33,876 --> 02:37:45,159
[SPEAKER_03]: to determine what areas in their community could benefit from more tree cover and tree canopy to address the issues of urban heat and the like.

1936
02:37:45,239 --> 02:37:57,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I thought it was a very good idea and a very good opportunity for the city of Medford to implement some technology that we haven't had in the past and for us to move forward in addressing some of these concerns that we have over the degradation of our tree canopy.

1937
02:37:57,422 --> 02:38:00,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the paper and move approved.

1938
02:38:01,587 --> 02:38:02,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1939
02:38:02,808 --> 02:38:05,428
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of council, actually, any questions from the councilors?

1940
02:38:06,209 --> 02:38:07,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, Councilor Morell.

1941
02:38:07,969 --> 02:38:08,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1942
02:38:08,589 --> 02:38:10,870
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

1943
02:38:11,310 --> 02:38:15,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Tree canopies are a moving target with development, disease, and age.

1944
02:38:15,572 --> 02:38:22,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And as we look at the number of high heat days only increasing due to climate change, our tree canopy is more important than ever.

1945
02:38:22,874 --> 02:38:27,415
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully this can aid our very small, but very in demand forestry division.

1946
02:38:27,475 --> 02:38:29,536
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thank the council for bringing this forward.

1947
02:38:32,353 --> 02:38:33,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1948
02:38:33,854 --> 02:38:35,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the council?

1949
02:38:35,735 --> 02:38:36,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone online?

1950
02:38:37,136 --> 02:38:38,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, seeing and hearing none.

1951
02:38:38,598 --> 02:38:41,420
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

1952
02:38:41,440 --> 02:38:44,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk, please call the roll.

1953
02:38:44,182 --> 02:38:44,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears?

1954
02:38:44,942 --> 02:38:45,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1955
02:38:45,563 --> 02:38:46,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello?

1956
02:38:46,503 --> 02:38:46,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1957
02:38:46,984 --> 02:38:47,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

1958
02:38:47,544 --> 02:38:47,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1959
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:48,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks?

1960
02:38:48,685 --> 02:38:49,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1961
02:38:49,285 --> 02:38:49,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell?

1962
02:38:50,106 --> 02:38:50,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1963
02:38:50,686 --> 02:38:51,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1964
02:38:51,527 --> 02:38:51,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1965
02:38:51,887 --> 02:38:52,608
[SPEAKER_10]: President Franco?

1966
02:38:52,728 --> 02:38:52,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1967
02:38:53,188 --> 02:38:55,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Senate affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1968
02:38:57,042 --> 02:39:02,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I will withdraw paper 20652 as the matter is scheduled for a committee of the whole tomorrow evening.

1969
02:39:03,824 --> 02:39:11,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I will withdraw paper 20653 as the paper is scheduled for a committee of the whole tomorrow evening.

1970
02:39:11,605 --> 02:39:13,906
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a committee of the whole regarding these papers tomorrow night.

1971
02:39:21,601 --> 02:39:23,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, 20-654 offered by Councilor Morell.

1972
02:39:23,682 --> 02:39:32,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the city administration work to establish and promote an internet exchange safe zone in Medford.

1973
02:39:32,250 --> 02:39:32,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

1974
02:39:33,441 --> 02:39:34,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1975
02:39:34,502 --> 02:39:35,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, this is just a simple request.

1976
02:39:36,004 --> 02:39:37,647
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a resident reach out about this.

1977
02:39:37,667 --> 02:39:50,864
[SPEAKER_12]: A number of cities have established these safe exchange zones for people purchasing exchanging items through Craigslist, Facebook and having an area that whether I know a lot of communities do it in the parking lot of police station or somewhere that

1978
02:39:51,685 --> 02:40:02,795
[SPEAKER_12]: They know there is our cameras to add a level of safety so that people can support the circular economy, keep things out of the landfill and get them to new owners, but do so in a safe way.

1979
02:40:02,935 --> 02:40:08,160
[SPEAKER_12]: And noting that there actually has been some incidents in the past in Medford where people were going.

1980
02:40:09,882 --> 02:40:17,109
[SPEAKER_12]: They were lured by online sales that were not to be, I believe, over in Duggar Park a little, a year or two ago.

1981
02:40:17,570 --> 02:40:26,779
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think just seeing if the administration can see working with the police are the best way they see fit to establish this safe zone, promote it, and

1982
02:40:27,580 --> 02:40:30,725
[SPEAKER_12]: I think cities, you know, just go as far as putting a sign up and letting people know where it is.

1983
02:40:30,885 --> 02:40:37,814
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe I've heard about this incidentally in the past, but if it's something that is still being offered, it's very hard to find.

1984
02:40:37,894 --> 02:40:43,282
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be great if we could offer this for the safety of our residents and people looking to buy and sell online.

1985
02:40:45,652 --> 02:40:46,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1986
02:40:47,093 --> 02:40:48,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

1987
02:40:48,213 --> 02:40:48,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1988
02:40:48,933 --> 02:40:50,714
[SPEAKER_18]: I thank my colleague for bringing this forward.

1989
02:40:51,394 --> 02:41:02,578
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we've all heard many horror stories, both in the news and other things, about people buying stuff online and getting robbed and beaten up and our homes getting robbed.

1990
02:41:02,598 --> 02:41:06,500
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, I think this is a good motion.

1991
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:08,041
[SPEAKER_18]: I will second the motion.

1992
02:41:08,501 --> 02:41:12,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1993
02:41:13,343 --> 02:41:14,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from the council?

1994
02:41:15,288 --> 02:41:16,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone online?

1995
02:41:16,489 --> 02:41:18,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, seeing and hearing none.

1996
02:41:18,511 --> 02:41:22,976
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Morell, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Bernabeu, please call the roll.

1997
02:41:23,797 --> 02:41:24,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears?

1998
02:41:24,477 --> 02:41:24,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1999
02:41:25,058 --> 02:41:25,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello?

2000
02:41:25,959 --> 02:41:26,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2001
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:26,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

2002
02:41:27,280 --> 02:41:27,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

2003
02:41:29,285 --> 02:41:29,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2004
02:41:29,785 --> 02:41:30,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2005
02:41:30,126 --> 02:41:30,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Marks.

2006
02:41:30,846 --> 02:41:31,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2007
02:41:31,387 --> 02:41:31,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell.

2008
02:41:32,167 --> 02:41:32,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2009
02:41:32,568 --> 02:41:33,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2010
02:41:33,428 --> 02:41:33,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2011
02:41:33,729 --> 02:41:34,429
[SPEAKER_10]: President Falco.

2012
02:41:34,509 --> 02:41:34,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2013
02:41:35,070 --> 02:41:36,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven affirmative, zero negative.

2014
02:41:36,711 --> 02:41:37,612
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

2015
02:41:37,632 --> 02:41:42,016
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-655 offered by Councilor Marks.

2016
02:41:42,356 --> 02:41:51,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the Massport Community Advisory Committee, MCAC requested the FAA conduct an early feasibility assessment on runway 33L

2017
02:41:53,045 --> 02:42:12,523
[SPEAKER_04]: departure solutions, and whereas due to the August 14th, 2020 letter sent by the Northeast Regional Administrator for the FAA, indicating the FAA had rejected all eight dispersion proposals for further study, then be it resolved that our state federal delegation continue

2018
02:42:13,344 --> 02:42:39,161
[SPEAKER_04]: to communicate a message to the FAA that due to continued noise concentration, which has created a permanent problem in Bedford that will not go away until the FAA commits to address the problem and develop a procedure for runway 33L at Logan International Airport that geographically disperses jet departures more equitably than the current plan.

2019
02:42:39,661 --> 02:42:40,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

2020
02:42:41,356 --> 02:42:50,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I know myself and other members of this council, I believe Councilor Morell put this on within the last couple of months.

2021
02:42:50,621 --> 02:43:05,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Asking for an update of our Massport Community Advisory Committee, who have been doing yeoman's work, representing this community for issues that are confronting the noise pollution that we experience on a daily basis.

2022
02:43:07,388 --> 02:43:14,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently we received a response from a representative to the MCAC who is.

2023
02:43:18,707 --> 02:43:22,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter Hauk is our representative, he's been doing a great job.

2024
02:43:22,470 --> 02:43:32,158
[SPEAKER_05]: But Mr. President, the reason why I bring this up is he made a recommendation of this council and also for our state and federal delegation.

2025
02:43:32,759 --> 02:43:38,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to make sure, because this council has been on top of this issue for many years now,

2026
02:43:40,085 --> 02:43:50,874
[SPEAKER_05]: back in 2010, and then back in 2016 when the MIT study was initiated to look at departure and arrival procedures at Logan Airport.

2027
02:43:51,475 --> 02:43:57,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And how to more equitably find solutions to dispersing flight traffic over the city of Medford.

2028
02:43:58,801 --> 02:44:06,867
[SPEAKER_05]: As was stated in my resolution on August 14th, 2020, the North Regional Administrator for the FAA,

2029
02:44:07,788 --> 02:44:18,195
[SPEAKER_05]: sent a letter to Massport Community Advisory Committee stating that they were no longer going to look at the dispersion proposals that came out of the MIT study.

2030
02:44:19,155 --> 02:44:34,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a big hit to us as a community, because we were really counting on having at least someone from the FAA consider how to ease up and disperse some of the flights that are impacting our community so daily.

2031
02:44:34,605 --> 02:45:00,365
[SPEAKER_05]: On October 15th, the leaderships in Method, Cambridge, Arlington, and Malden responded to the FAA, their feasibility assessment with a request back to the FAA to earnestly and promptly apply the considerable resources at its disposal to propose an alternative departure procedure for runway 33L that would disperse jet noise more equitably.

2032
02:45:01,265 --> 02:45:05,888
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was sent out on behalf of the four communities, Mr. President.

2033
02:45:06,308 --> 02:45:27,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Then on October 21st, six members of the federal delegation sent a letter to the FAA regional administrator reinforcing the October 15th letter sent by the municipalities and their proposed ideas to reduce overflight noise over the city of Medford and the surrounding communities.

2034
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:47,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just ask, Mr. President, in follow up to the response that we received from Peter Hulk, dated November 16th, 2020, that we request that our state and federal delegation commit to reinforce the message.

2035
02:45:48,925 --> 02:45:56,629
[SPEAKER_05]: That noise concentration has created permanent problem that will not go away until the FAA addresses the problem with a procedure change.

2036
02:45:57,169 --> 02:46:13,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask that we send that to our local delegation as well as our federal delegation, Mr. President, asking that they keep up the request to make sure that the FAA and Massport realize

2037
02:46:14,016 --> 02:46:25,482
[SPEAKER_05]: that this is considerable noise, pollution, and destruction to the quality of life for area residents, and that we stay on top of the issue, Mr. President.

2038
02:46:25,922 --> 02:46:37,427
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate, once again, our representatives on the MCAC for their due diligence, Mr. President, and their foresight on this issue.

2039
02:46:38,107 --> 02:46:38,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2040
02:46:39,048 --> 02:46:40,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2041
02:46:41,799 --> 02:46:43,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk, do you have these?

2042
02:46:43,082 --> 02:46:43,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you do, okay.

2043
02:46:44,204 --> 02:46:44,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, council.

2044
02:46:44,965 --> 02:46:48,231
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a councilor Morell, councilor Bears, councilor Morell.

2045
02:46:48,863 --> 02:46:49,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2046
02:46:49,624 --> 02:46:52,286
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to thank Councilor Marks for raising this.

2047
02:46:52,366 --> 02:46:59,071
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I did have the resolution a few weeks back, really piggybacking on one of his previous to get an update on this.

2048
02:46:59,151 --> 02:47:01,573
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the recommendation that came out.

2049
02:47:01,833 --> 02:47:16,926
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's worth noting that with our federal delegation, with Representative Clark, now Assistant Speaker, and her being a member of the Quiet Skies Caucus, hopefully she can hear what we're saying above the airplane noise and really be able to make some moves on this.

2050
02:47:17,046 --> 02:47:18,047
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also want to credit

2051
02:47:19,007 --> 02:47:35,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Our representatives, the administration, the previous administration for taking the approach of working with our neighboring cities on this, because in the Globe today, there was a story about Milton and Quincy kind of going at each other as far as plans to mitigate their airplane traffic and noise.

2052
02:47:35,398 --> 02:47:40,121
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think moving forward together, hopefully, hopefully we'll get some movement on this.

2053
02:47:40,461 --> 02:47:42,323
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, I thank Councilor Marks for raising this.

2054
02:47:43,884 --> 02:47:44,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

2055
02:47:45,044 --> 02:47:45,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Peers.

2056
02:47:46,123 --> 02:47:46,904
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2057
02:47:46,924 --> 02:47:51,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you to Councilor Morell, Councilor Marks for your work on this issue.

2058
02:47:51,448 --> 02:47:54,452
[SPEAKER_22]: It was particularly bad this weekend.

2059
02:47:54,772 --> 02:48:01,359
[SPEAKER_22]: I live in North Medford, but it wasn't the departures, it was the arrivals.

2060
02:48:02,079 --> 02:48:07,505
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would just propose an amendment that, I don't know about the

2061
02:48:07,905 --> 02:48:17,412
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess the FAA, but especially Massport, explore alternatives to using runway 15R for arrivals.

2062
02:48:19,874 --> 02:48:26,540
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a little bit different than the issue with departures, which as we know is complicated by these waypoints and all the other things that have been discussed for years.

2063
02:48:27,622 --> 02:48:32,585
[SPEAKER_22]: But there's been a huge spike in the number of arrivals coming in on runway 15R in 2020.

2064
02:48:32,745 --> 02:48:37,528
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the highest, I think, since 2014 or 2015, literally in the thousands.

2065
02:48:38,768 --> 02:48:40,349
[SPEAKER_22]: So permanent alternatives would be great.

2066
02:48:40,409 --> 02:48:53,376
[SPEAKER_22]: I also think alternatives during the pandemic, if maybe for the language for the amendment, if Massport can't find alternatives, permanent alternatives, consider alternatives for the duration of the pandemic.

2067
02:48:53,897 --> 02:48:55,998
[SPEAKER_22]: As we know, people are still spending a lot of time at home.

2068
02:48:56,758 --> 02:48:57,658
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm trying to work.

2069
02:48:57,698 --> 02:48:58,799
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a huge disruption.

2070
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:04,721
[SPEAKER_22]: The noise to people trying to work, people trying to go to school online, et cetera.

2071
02:49:05,621 --> 02:49:18,085
[SPEAKER_22]: So if the amendment would be that Massport review alternatives for arrivals on runway 15R and also review pandemic related options for those arrivals.

2072
02:49:22,327 --> 02:49:23,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears, thank you.

2073
02:49:27,308 --> 02:49:28,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the council?

2074
02:49:29,369 --> 02:49:32,130

2095
02:50:25,031 --> 02:50:27,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a site visit that was well attended.

2096
02:50:28,433 --> 02:50:36,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a really good discussion regarding, it was actually at the intersection of Fulton Spring Road and Fern Road.

2097
02:50:36,797 --> 02:50:41,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the safety concerns related to the traffic in the North Bedford neighborhood

2098
02:50:42,393 --> 02:50:44,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks, you brought forward that resolution.

2099
02:50:44,575 --> 02:50:56,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a really good discussion and conversation about the issues that are going on, the traffic issues specifically with regards to everything that from, and that whole North Bedford neighborhood there.

2100
02:50:57,046 --> 02:51:03,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to let everyone know, the crosswalks have been installed and the stop lines have been installed as well.

2101
02:51:03,832 --> 02:51:07,315
[SPEAKER_04]: So some work has begun on that initiative.

2102
02:51:07,876 --> 02:51:07,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

2103
02:51:10,790 --> 02:51:12,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will have a follow up meeting.

2104
02:51:12,551 --> 02:51:14,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to, I'm sorry.

2105
02:51:15,313 --> 02:51:16,193
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all working.

2106
02:51:16,254 --> 02:51:17,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a good question.

2107
02:51:18,035 --> 02:51:18,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually.

2108
02:51:18,475 --> 02:51:20,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually had enforcement there the other day as well.

2109
02:51:21,077 --> 02:51:22,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So the police were there enforcing them.

2110
02:51:22,618 --> 02:51:25,159
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, there's a number of people get pulled over.

2111
02:51:25,179 --> 02:51:28,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it actually got someone, someone get pulled over tonight too.

2112
02:51:28,421 --> 02:51:33,625
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, with that being said, it looks like they're working on some of these, uh, things.

2113
02:51:33,845 --> 02:51:37,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I believe we're going to have a follow up meeting on this as well.

2114
02:51:37,767 --> 02:51:38,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, just to, uh,

2115
02:51:40,126 --> 02:51:43,288
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of see how we'll move forward in the future with some of the other suggestions that were made.

2116
02:51:43,868 --> 02:51:45,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

2117
02:51:45,409 --> 02:51:46,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2118
02:51:47,090 --> 02:51:54,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank you for setting up that meeting and inviting all the city players to the table.

2119
02:51:54,955 --> 02:52:02,700
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great meeting and my council colleagues couldn't ask better questions to get results on behalf of the neighborhood.

2120
02:52:03,340 --> 02:52:07,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just ask that we do set up the follow-up meeting because that was our commitment.

2121
02:52:07,903 --> 02:52:22,273
[SPEAKER_05]: to the neighborhood and also I know we met at the corner of Fulton Spring and Fern, but there were a number of other hotspot areas going up Fulton Spring Road that also need to be addressed.

2122
02:52:22,313 --> 02:52:31,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping that on this next meeting, we can start picking away little by little on some of the other areas and staying on top of them.

2123
02:52:31,579 --> 02:52:36,803
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to thank my colleagues for taking a Saturday out and going down there and thank the residents for coming out.

2124
02:52:38,524 --> 02:52:45,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I firmly believe we have to do more of that because I think it's a good way.

2125
02:52:46,308 --> 02:52:47,669
[SPEAKER_05]: We can talk and talk and talk.

2126
02:52:48,029 --> 02:52:50,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good way of getting issues addressed.

2127
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:54,833
[SPEAKER_05]: We bring the department heads and actually witness firsthand what's going on.

2128
02:52:55,073 --> 02:52:58,195
[SPEAKER_05]: How many cars do we see roll through that four way stop?

2129
02:52:58,335 --> 02:52:59,356
[SPEAKER_04]: You are correct, many.

2130
02:53:00,056 --> 02:53:02,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Many, we could have given out 100 tickets.

2131
02:53:03,598 --> 02:53:07,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, it was really, it was a dangerous area, but we slowed them down.

2132
02:53:07,880 --> 02:53:15,764
[SPEAKER_05]: There were so many of us, we actually slowed them down, but I think it shows you what's happening in our community, in every neighborhood of this community.

2133
02:53:15,824 --> 02:53:20,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank you for your leadership, Mr. President, and look forward to the upcoming meeting.

2134
02:53:20,967 --> 02:53:22,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2135
02:53:24,869 --> 02:53:30,112
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just, you know, there were 50 of us out there and they were still blowing through the intersection.

2136
02:53:30,452 --> 02:53:32,613
[SPEAKER_22]: So it was just amazing.

2137
02:53:34,343 --> 02:53:35,344

2142
02:53:40,730 --> 02:53:47,616

[SPEAKER_05]: This truly is a big loss for the community.

2212
02:56:10,007 --> 02:56:18,130
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Sandy was one of the first people I met in public office back some 26 years ago.

2213
02:56:20,572 --> 02:56:35,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And you couldn't meet a kinder, gentler person that just, for many years she served as the Program Administrator for the Early Child Care Program within the Medford Public Schools.

2214
02:56:36,342 --> 02:56:38,284
[SPEAKER_05]: She was just a sweetheart of a person.

2215
02:56:39,064 --> 02:56:44,850
[SPEAKER_05]: She was devoted to her family and friends, a truly loving mother, wife, sister.

2216
02:56:45,650 --> 02:56:54,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I didn't know about Sandy, and she was a woman of many talents, she was an accomplished and published poet, which I never knew.

2217
02:56:55,479 --> 02:56:57,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was an accomplished world traveler.

2218
02:56:59,222 --> 02:57:01,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, she really is,

2219
02:57:03,290 --> 02:57:06,912
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a hole in this community that's missing, Mr. President.

2220
02:57:06,932 --> 02:57:17,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when you lose someone of that character, someone of that stature, someone that put kids first, I don't know if you can recover from that.

2221
02:57:18,319 --> 02:57:26,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to, on behalf of the city council, wish her family well and her husband Rick, who we all know.

2222
02:57:28,765 --> 02:57:32,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish him well, Mr. President, in this very difficult time.

2223
02:57:33,252 --> 02:57:34,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2224
02:57:35,212 --> 02:57:36,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpell.

2225
02:57:36,373 --> 02:57:37,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2226
02:57:37,533 --> 02:57:42,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think Councilor Marks really hit it right on the head.

2227
02:57:43,074 --> 02:57:43,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

2228
02:57:43,334 --> 02:57:44,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Sacco was a great person.

2229
02:57:46,375 --> 02:57:48,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Two great sons, Eric and Brian.

2230
02:57:49,575 --> 02:57:55,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Brian's actually a teacher in the system now, and she handed those traits off to her children.

2231
02:57:56,777 --> 02:57:58,457
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, a great family.

2232
02:58:00,318 --> 02:58:22,606
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that if you drive down Ridgeway Road, you know that they were they were very very committed to that neighborhood and the safety of that neighborhood and just just great people and like we said we'll lose you too many of the patriarchs of this community and It's it's sad to see so our heartfelt sympathy to the family.

2233
02:58:22,966 --> 02:58:28,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Our thoughts and prayers going to the

2234
02:58:29,526 --> 02:58:39,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacco family on the motion of on behalf of the city council clerk her to be as could you please call the roll.

2235
02:58:42,495 --> 02:58:43,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2242
02:58:49,799 --> 02:58:50,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2243
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:50,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2244
02:58:51,160 --> 02:58:51,841
[SPEAKER_10]: President Falco.

2245
02:58:51,941 --> 02:58:52,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2246
02:58:52,541 --> 02:58:55,123
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 affirmative zero in the negative motion passes.

2247
02:58:56,667 --> 02:59:04,168
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-658 offered by the Medford City Council, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for a long time after resident Ralph Surrett on his recent passing.

2248
02:59:04,687 --> 02:59:05,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Locks.

2249
02:59:05,707 --> 02:59:06,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2250
02:59:07,268 --> 02:59:16,151
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that have been around this city for a number of years, Ralph Surrett was our faithful cameraman for a lot of years in this corner room.

2251
02:59:16,871 --> 02:59:29,655
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably never saw him because he was very behind the scenes, never wanted any public light, was truly a kind, gentle man when you talk to him.

2252
02:59:30,155 --> 02:59:45,784
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd always tell you about what's going on in local news and he was a real animal lover and someone that was an advocate for animals within this community and a graduate of the Medford Vocational School and someone that

2253
02:59:47,305 --> 02:59:50,768
[SPEAKER_05]: was a true Methodite for a lot of years, Mr. President.

2254
02:59:51,388 --> 03:00:09,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And on behalf of his family, I want to dedicate this meeting and dedication to Ralph Surrett for his many years of service to this community and to the Method City Council, Mr. President.

2255
03:00:10,302 --> 03:00:11,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilman Marks.

2256
03:00:11,103 --> 03:00:11,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2257
03:00:13,204 --> 03:00:15,105
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion, seconded by?

2258
03:00:16,197 --> 03:00:18,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the motion of the city council, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2259
03:00:19,480 --> 03:00:20,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2260
03:00:22,122 --> 03:00:22,662

03:00:23,503 --> 03:00:24,384

2267
03:00:26,686 --> 03:00:27,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2268
03:00:27,186 --> 03:00:27,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell?

2269
03:00:27,967 --> 03:00:28,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2270
03:00:28,407 --> 03:00:29,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2271
03:00:29,308 --> 03:00:29,508

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2274
03:00:30,829 --> 03:00:32,271
[SPEAKER_04]: And the affirmative is zero and the negative.

2275
03:00:32,291 --> 03:00:33,031
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

2276
03:00:33,071 --> 03:00:37,395
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point in time, I would ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

2277
03:00:58,283 --> 03:00:59,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2278
03:00:59,604 --> 03:01:00,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

2279
03:01:03,107 --> 03:01:04,208
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2280
03:01:04,228 --> 03:01:07,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Before we adjourn this evening, I'd like to reach out to the community.

2281
03:01:08,611 --> 03:01:11,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Christmas is three weeks away.

2282
03:01:11,073 --> 03:01:14,696
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of need in the community this year.

2283
03:01:14,716 --> 03:01:15,957
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of families are going to need some help.

2284
03:01:18,052 --> 03:01:24,117
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of good organizations that are out there doing some work, the Rotary, the Kiwanis, the Medford Family Network.

2285
03:01:25,137 --> 03:01:29,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Reach out to them, help them out with the donation for this year's holidays.

2286
03:01:31,432 --> 03:01:38,354
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, and if you don't want to reach out to them, ask around your neighborhood, ask for a family that could use some help, some food, some things.

2287
03:01:38,955 --> 03:01:46,117
[SPEAKER_18]: I've already sent out five families for adoption, and you'd be surprised what the kids ask for.

2288
03:01:46,157 --> 03:01:50,439
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not asking for toys, they're asking for clothes, things for their mother, so again.

2289
03:01:51,379 --> 03:01:55,960
[SPEAKER_18]: I would hope people in the community step up and help all these families.

2290
03:01:56,020 --> 03:01:57,781
[SPEAKER_18]: If you need a family, call me, I'll help you out.

2291
03:01:58,481 --> 03:02:04,623
[SPEAKER_18]: But let's say a lot of organizations in the city that are all stepping up and businesses stepping up to help out these families.

2292
03:02:04,663 --> 03:02:11,105
[SPEAKER_18]: Indeed, especially during, let's say, this year more than other years, people need more help than ever.

2293
03:02:11,145 --> 03:02:13,546
[SPEAKER_18]: So reach out and help them out.

2294
03:02:14,246 --> 03:02:15,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

2295
03:02:15,666 --> 03:02:15,966
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2296
03:02:16,387 --> 03:02:17,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we have a hand up here?

2297
03:02:26,765 --> 03:02:27,925
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, Harold.

2298
03:02:28,286 --> 03:02:28,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Harold McGill.

2299
03:02:30,727 --> 03:02:32,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Falco.

2300
03:02:32,667 --> 03:02:37,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Harry McGill, 100 Main Street, president of the Metropolitan Police Patrolmen's Association.

2301
03:02:39,290 --> 03:02:53,375
[SPEAKER_14]: I brought up the new building earlier during the meeting, and it's been brought to my attention that as of right now, we do not have a contractor or a maintenance company working in this building to keep the building clean.

2302
03:02:56,985 --> 03:03:00,706
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to use the word emergency because I think it's been thrown around too much tonight.

2303
03:03:00,746 --> 03:03:04,127
[SPEAKER_14]: But that needs to be addressed, and it needs to be addressed quickly.

2304
03:03:04,507 --> 03:03:05,947
[SPEAKER_14]: The building's been open for a week now.

2305
03:03:05,967 --> 03:03:07,428
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a 24-7 building.

2306
03:03:08,348 --> 03:03:09,968
[SPEAKER_14]: The city seemed to get this right.

2307
03:03:10,729 --> 03:03:15,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's not get something right and then turn it into a wrong by not maintaining this building.

2308
03:03:16,910 --> 03:03:22,352
[SPEAKER_14]: The council needs, the council, the mayor, however it has to happen, that needs to happen as quickly as possible.

2309
03:03:22,772 --> 03:03:26,573
[SPEAKER_14]: We need some people in here to get the building clean and to maintain the building.

2310
03:03:28,969 --> 03:03:40,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember specifically asking that question during the budget because building maintenance has always been a big concern, not only to me, but I think the entire city council.

2311
03:03:40,714 --> 03:03:46,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we are, we're building new facilities and we need to make sure that they're maintained.

2312
03:03:47,137 --> 03:03:52,301
[SPEAKER_04]: and we need to make sure that the preventive maintenance gets done, because if it doesn't get done, you know what happens.

2313
03:03:52,961 --> 03:03:56,584
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a huge, to me, it needs to be a huge focus.

2314
03:03:57,124 --> 03:03:57,945
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't in the budget.

2315
03:03:57,985 --> 03:04:06,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if Dave wants to take that question or answer on behalf of the administration, but to me, and I think to many of the councils, it's a major concern.

2316
03:04:06,731 --> 03:04:07,351
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President.

2317
03:04:07,371 --> 03:04:09,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I just, can I add something?

2318
03:04:09,913 --> 03:04:10,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, please.

2319
03:04:10,714 --> 03:04:14,837
[SPEAKER_14]: The first weekend we were in the building, we had barrels all flowing.

2320
03:04:16,132 --> 03:04:17,793
[SPEAKER_14]: We have nowhere to put this trash on.

2321
03:04:19,214 --> 03:04:27,620
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know there's something about a facilities manager that's supposed to take care of the police department, the library, and other cities' buildings.

2322
03:04:29,302 --> 03:04:30,322
[SPEAKER_14]: That should be looked at.

2323
03:04:31,463 --> 03:04:34,185
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually were in the old building today.

2324
03:04:34,205 --> 03:04:35,846
[SPEAKER_14]: We did some training in the old building.

2325
03:04:36,687 --> 03:04:38,888
[SPEAKER_14]: And that building's not being maintained either.

2326
03:04:38,908 --> 03:04:40,650
[SPEAKER_14]: The contract over there is expired.

2327
03:04:44,712 --> 03:04:49,215
[SPEAKER_14]: If the city doesn't address these issues, that building is going to deteriorate rapidly.

2328
03:04:49,916 --> 03:04:52,958
[SPEAKER_14]: So I urge the council.

2329
03:04:53,038 --> 03:04:58,202
[SPEAKER_14]: I urge the mayor to, to, to get that done as quickly as possible.

2330
03:04:58,422 --> 03:04:58,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2331
03:04:59,803 --> 03:05:00,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2332
03:05:00,123 --> 03:05:00,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2333
03:05:04,408 --> 03:05:05,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Carol, thank you very much, appreciate it.

2334
03:05:06,469 --> 03:05:20,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, just very briefly in response to Mr. McElroy, there's two separate issues, the preventative maintenance facilities management aspect of it, which we've kind of talked a great deal about the last couple of weeks.

2335
03:05:20,699 --> 03:05:23,841
[SPEAKER_17]: The other issue is the cleaning contracts that have since expired.

2336
03:05:24,282 --> 03:05:26,603
[SPEAKER_17]: There were several contracts that were expired.

2337
03:05:26,623 --> 03:05:32,948
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking to, procurement is working on consolidating those and getting a better value and a better service based upon those.

2338
03:05:33,448 --> 03:05:37,469
[SPEAKER_17]: working closely with Chief Buckley in order to make sure that that building does get clean.

2339
03:05:38,089 --> 03:05:41,150
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll take all the steps we need to in order to make sure that that building is taken care of.

2340
03:05:41,210 --> 03:05:42,830
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a priority of the mayor that that's done.

2341
03:05:43,291 --> 03:05:49,772
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't want it to go down the tubes at all, especially not in the first week that we've got the building open.

2342
03:05:49,812 --> 03:05:51,473
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are working on it as quickly as possible.

2343
03:05:51,633 --> 03:05:52,333
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

2344
03:05:52,373 --> 03:05:56,654
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, just if Dave could, how long is as quickly as possible?

2345
03:05:58,013 --> 03:06:00,754
[SPEAKER_17]: we're going to be able to do that within the next couple of weeks.

2346
03:06:00,774 --> 03:06:02,975
[SPEAKER_17]: As long as it's he has to be procured under 30 day.

2347
03:06:02,995 --> 03:06:04,756
[SPEAKER_17]: So procurement office is working on that very.

2348
03:06:05,016 --> 03:06:08,797
[SPEAKER_17]: We had people walk through all the buildings recently to give us an adequate price.

2349
03:06:08,817 --> 03:06:14,840
[SPEAKER_17]: There is going to be a price differential between this is a big new that has to be that has to be clean.

2350
03:06:14,860 --> 03:06:18,821
[SPEAKER_17]: So there is a price differential, but they're working as quickly as they can within the confines of

2351
03:06:29,833 --> 03:06:32,178
[SPEAKER_17]: is there a cleaner working in the police station now?

2352
03:06:32,198 --> 03:06:33,520
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll have to check with the chief.

2353
03:06:33,921 --> 03:06:39,372
[SPEAKER_17]: It was my impression that the contract has since expired for that particular service and we're in the process of looking into it.

2354
03:06:40,243 --> 03:06:42,925
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like that trash is just piling up.

2355
03:06:42,965 --> 03:06:47,548
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a point of information offered by Councilor Scott Peli.

2356
03:06:47,588 --> 03:06:48,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scott Peli.

2357
03:06:49,509 --> 03:06:55,673
[SPEAKER_09]: To the chief of staff, we don't have an active member of DPW that can at least empty the barrels.

2358
03:06:56,574 --> 03:06:58,815
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the options that we're looking into.

2359
03:06:58,835 --> 03:07:01,397
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not going to let it go to waste.

2360
03:07:01,717 --> 03:07:02,778
[SPEAKER_17]: We're working on it now.

2361
03:07:03,098 --> 03:07:03,439
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2362
03:07:06,821 --> 03:07:07,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2363
03:07:09,101 --> 03:07:09,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2364
03:07:10,282 --> 03:07:12,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2365
03:07:12,763 --> 03:07:14,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Harold McGillivray.

2366
03:07:15,505 --> 03:07:15,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2367
03:07:17,346 --> 03:07:21,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I did say the barrels are overflowing, but they are getting empty by administrative personnel over here.

2368
03:07:21,988 --> 03:07:22,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

2369
03:07:23,189 --> 03:07:30,573
[SPEAKER_14]: They are getting empty, but I'm not quite sure that lieutenants, captains, and chiefs of police should be emptying barrels.

2370
03:07:32,954 --> 03:07:34,255
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we need a cleaning company.

2371
03:07:36,422 --> 03:07:38,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good point.

2372
03:07:41,206 --> 03:07:43,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Harold, thank you very much.

2373
03:07:44,389 --> 03:07:48,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we are on to the records.

2374
03:07:52,152 --> 03:07:57,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Records, the records of the meeting of November 24th, 2012 were passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

2375
03:07:58,274 --> 03:08:00,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, how did you find those records?

2376
03:08:00,174 --> 03:08:02,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I found them in order, Mr. President, move approval.

2377

[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve the records, seconded by Councilor Bears.
