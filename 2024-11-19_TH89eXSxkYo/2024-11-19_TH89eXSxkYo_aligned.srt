1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:05,528
to clear the public hearing open.

2
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:08,630
Open to those in favor of the petition.

3
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:12,713
Is there anyone with us online tonight that is in favor of the petition?

4
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:22,259
Okay, Mr. Shakes, can we please have your name and address for the record?

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,482
Okay, Eric Shakes, the home address.

6
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:27,634
That's fine, that's fine.

7
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:30,375
Eddie Bradbury of Medford, Mass.

8
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:33,316
Okay, and you are in favor of the petition?

9
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:34,257
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:35,137
Okay, thank you.

11
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:37,938
Is there anyone else that would like to speak in favor of the petition?

12
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,979
Okay.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,981
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

14
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,542
Anyone in opposition of the petition?

15
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:51,563
Anyone in opposition?

16
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:57,463
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

17
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:04,177
At this point in time, I'd call upon the Chair of Personal Licensing, Councilor Scott Beall.

18
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:05,598
Thank you, Mr. President.

19
00:01:05,618 --> 00:01:06,338
Hi, Mr. Shakes.

20
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:06,718
Good evening.

21
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:07,698
Thanks for being here this evening.

22
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:14,001
We see everything that is asked for you is in place.

23
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,022
All the documents are in place.

24
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:18,263
Everybody looks to have approved it moving forward.

25
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:25,967
Could you just give us a brief synopsis of what was there prior and what you're doing at the site now?

26
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:34,747
So I can't confirm what was here prior, but I'm pretty sure that it was the same type of business, automotive and body shop.

27
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:38,348
And that's what we're doing now, too, automotive and body.

28
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:39,068
OK.

29
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:43,909
All right, in the hours of operations, following the city guidelines, everything looks like it's in place.

30
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,071
I know before I make the motion to approve, if any councilors have any questions.

31
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:54,732
Are there any councilors that have questions regarding this matter?

32
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:55,573
Mr. President.

33
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:56,733
Councilor Marks.

34
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,250
Yes, if the petitioner could just state how much off-street parking that they have.

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,231
Eight.

36
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:06,031
Eight spots off-street?

37
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:08,592
Eight spots in the parking lot.

38
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:09,832
Thank you.

39
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:11,153
Thank you, Mr. President.

40
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:11,673
I move approval.

41
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:12,893
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

42
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:16,034
On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by?

43
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:16,434
Second.

44
00:02:16,974 --> 00:02:18,535
Councilor Pierce, Councilor Knight.

45
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:26,137
I, too, support the application, Mr. President.

46
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:26,777
Everything's in order.

47
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,824
Councilor Knight, I apologize.

48
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:33,304
That's everything.

49
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:34,704
I rest my case.

50
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:35,444
I have nothing to add.

51
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,525
Okay, so everything's in order.

52
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:38,965
Everything's in order, Mr. President.

53
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:39,505
Move approval.

54
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:44,907
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Beers.

55
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:47,128
Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

56
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:50,328
Council Beers.

57
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:50,989
Yes.

58
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:52,289
Vice President Carabiello.

59
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:52,809
Yes.

60
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:53,769
Councilor Knight.

61
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:54,670
Yes.

62
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:55,690
Councilor Marks.

63
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:55,770
Yes.

64
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:57,042
Yes.

65
00:02:57,402 --> 00:02:58,023
Councilor Morrell?

66
00:02:58,263 --> 00:02:58,503
Yes.

67
00:02:58,783 --> 00:02:59,443
Councilor Scarpelli?

68
00:02:59,463 --> 00:02:59,543
Yes.

69
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:00,744
President Fevella?

70
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:01,184
Yes.

71
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:03,185
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

72
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:04,666
The motion passes.

73
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:06,907
Congratulations and good luck.

74
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,028
Congratulations.

75
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:09,728
Thank you.

76
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:10,949
Have a good night.

77
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:12,330
You too.

78
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:12,910
Thank you.

79
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:23,669
Motions, orders, and resolutions 20-647, offered by Councilor Marks, Councilor Scarpelli, and Vice President Carviello.

80
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,834
Be it resolved that the City Council request the presence of

81
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:40,666
Chief Buckley, Chief Buckley, Chief of the Memphis Police Department, Chief Gilberti, Lieutenant Mark Rudolph, and Officer Harold McGill to discuss public safety concerns dealing with our 911 system at our next scheduled meeting.

82
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:41,927
Councilor Marks.

83
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:45,330
Mr. President, I'll just defer to Councilor Scott Kelly.

84
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:46,712
Okay, Councilor Scott Kelly.

85
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:47,773
Thank you so much, Mr. President.

86
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:52,664
Is it on?

87
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:53,605
Thank you, Mr. President.

88
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:57,449
I'm not familiar with who's present.

89
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,571
Are the chiefs present?

90
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:01,452
Officer McGilvrey?

91
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:04,875
I see both chiefs.

92
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:09,520
I see Harold McGilvrey is with us and Lieutenant Mark Rudolph is with us as well.

93
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,121
And both chiefs, yes.

94
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:14,124
OK, so this is important because I think that

95
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:26,528
Out of nowhere we received a letter from the mayor stating that we need to move forward with some concerns dealing with the 911 system.

96
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:34,852
And that I believe it was a public health crisis, a safety crisis that we needed to address.

97
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:35,492
It was something that

98
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:44,438
put a red flag out to alert us and that this is the first time the council heard that.

99
00:04:45,018 --> 00:05:06,166
And I thought it was important that both the leaders of the police and fire come and just fill us in if there's things we should know that are this dire, that something's been going on and we need to adjust as a council and move some initiatives through to make sure that we're supporting them in any way.

100
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:12,649
If anybody could share some comments or any insight into this.

101
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,352
Would the other counselors like to speak first or would you like to hear from- That's just to my question, so.

102
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:22,432
Mr. President.

103
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:23,092
Counselor Marks.

104
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:24,633
If I could, thank you, Mr. President.

105
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:31,155
I appreciate the fact that both chiefs are on tonight, as well as the union representative.

106
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:38,380
I believe both on the police and fire side are both with us tonight as well, Mr. President.

107
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:56,314
As Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned, the concern I have and the reason why I added my name to this resolution was the fact that we did receive a correspondence from Mayor Lungo Kern regarding the urgent need and the emergency of

108
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,058
putting this particular position forward.

109
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:09,330
And when I saw that email, Mr. President, it kind of alarmed me that there was a concern of that urgency within 9-1-1.

110
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:15,457
First, that I'm hearing that 9-1-1 has existed for the past year and a half.

111
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:19,260
And I would hope that there was proper supervision.

112
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:25,103
I would hope there was proper training policies and procedures set up in that past year and a half.

113
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:38,972
So I'm eager to hear tonight from both chiefs to hopefully dispel the emergency that was stated by the mayor in her email.

114
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:43,875
And hear from both chiefs, Mr. President, and the union representatives as well.

115
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:44,355
Thank you.

116
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:45,535
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

117
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:46,756
Vice President Caviello.

118
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:48,897
Thank you, Mr. President.

119
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:52,158
I echo Councilor Marks' comments there.

120
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,959
I'll wait to hear what the two chiefs have to say.

121
00:06:55,359 --> 00:07:00,461
Again, like everyone else, I didn't hear of any grave emergency that was going on there.

122
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:08,064
So again, I'll hold any further questions until we hear from all the officials that are on the call.

123
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:10,225
Okay, thank you, Vice President Caviello.

124
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,028
Let's see, we have a number of people.

125
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,871
Mayor Longo-Kernan has her hand up.

126
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:18,033
So I'm going to try to, there you go.

127
00:07:18,534 --> 00:07:19,114
Mayor Longo-Kernan.

128
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:22,077
Thank you, President Falco.

129
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:26,901
I do want to thank both chiefs for being on the call as well as Lieutenant Rudolph.

130
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:32,666
We have President McGilvery from the police union.

131
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:37,670
We also have President Buckley from the fire union and Lieutenant Mon from the fire department.

132
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,371
And I just want to,

133
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:45,232
I want to give them all the floor, but I just want to let you know that I do stand by the email that was sent.

134
00:07:45,473 --> 00:08:04,620
I think it's really important that we get a 911 supervisor in there for a number of reasons, some personnel, but one of the main personnel reasons for doing so is because we're having a really hard time hiring for the four empty positions.

135
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:13,500
that are in dispatch, which is creating forced overtimes, and it's creating almost an emergency situation just to get personnel in there anyway.

136
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,944
We have a number of good candidates that we've offered the job to, but they've turned it down due to the pay.

137
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:32,472
We also feel that now more than ever, after hearing the concerns, especially from the fire union, that it is an emergency to get a supervisor in that role for any additional training

138
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:41,457
to make sure that the first responders we want to make sure we have a supervisor in there.

139
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:45,759
We cannot wait for this until next budget cycle.

140
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,980
This is something that I just want to let you know.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,161
I stand by as being an emergency.

142
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:50,221
We

143
00:08:58,181 --> 00:09:00,383
and he is just recently started.

144
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:03,044
He is going to be working with us for the next couple months.

145
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:19,496
And I think it's imperative that we do get a supervisor in there to work with both unions, both chiefs, Lieutenant Rudolph, who runs the department, and get a supervisor in there ready to go while Mr. Richard makes recommendations for how to fix all the problems that is

146
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:25,515
if there are any that will be explained to you tonight in 9-1-1 dispatch.

147
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:26,015
Thank you.

148
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,416
Mr. President, if I could.

149
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:28,436
Thank you, Mayor Longo.

150
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:29,677
Councilor Marks.

151
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,117
Thank you, Mr. President.

152
00:09:31,157 --> 00:09:33,938
I appreciate the mayor being on the call tonight.

153
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:39,461
So the question I have to the mayor, Mr. President, is the fact that

154
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:48,084
I can appreciate, and it's the mayor's opinion, that this is a critical need for the operation of public safety in the community.

155
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:51,266
And she has every right to state that if she believes that.

156
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:55,548
My question is that since January of this year,

157
00:09:56,648 --> 00:10:11,714
The fire department has reached out on several occasions to not only the city administration, but to both Chiefs, Chief Gilberti and Chief Buckley regarding their concerns with 911 and some of the concerns that they had.

158
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,075
that they raised back in January of this year.

159
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:26,177
So I'm just wondering when the mayor figured out that this was a public safety emergency and why did it take almost 11 months to do so?

160
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:29,078
I thank you, Councilor Marks.

161
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:33,719
In January, February, it was brought to my attention.

162
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:36,039
There was some issues with the training manuals.

163
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:40,540
So at that point, I think Chief Gilberti and I did meet

164
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:49,549
I mean, it could have been March, April, May, depending on the surge in coronavirus cases, which set us back a bit.

165
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:58,790
But the manual was brought to me, and at that time, I did let my chief of staff know that I've reviewed the manual.

166
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,911
It's in-depth, but the fire union still had concerns.

167
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,232
So as of recent, over the last two months, we've had two

168
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:15,737
very in-depth meetings to review what the problems are and how do we fix these problems.

169
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:32,682
And we've been able to work on a plan collaboratively, one that I feel the police and the fire is happy with, but part of that plan, which I feel is an emergency, is to get a supervisor on board as soon as possible.

170
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:45,277
Right, so Mr. President, if I could follow up, and I appreciate that statement, but it still doesn't answer what happened from January to the past, even if we say two months that they've been working on this.

171
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,919
What happened to the seven months in between that, Mr. President?

172
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:59,725
And I'm looking at a correspondence from Union President Eddie Buckley from January 21st of this year, raising concern, Mr. President.

173
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:03,247
And that email was sent to Fire Chief Gilberti.

174
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:09,131
Police Chief Buckley, Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez, and Union Rep Harold McGilvery.

175
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:13,193
And if you could, Mr. President, I'd like to just read it briefly.

176
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:14,754
It says, good morning, gentlemen.

177
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:21,419
I would like to formally request a meeting with all interested parties to discuss the future of dispatching.

178
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:29,785
There are too many rumors and scuttlebutt going around, and we as a union would like to meet face to face to communicate our concerns.

179
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,061
get a grasp on the future of fire dispatch.

180
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:40,862
Please let me know at your convenience when we would be able to be a good time to sit down and talk.

181
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:45,443
Thank you for your attention to this matter, Eddie Buckley, Union President 1032.

182
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:53,565
The same day, Mr. President, Union Rep Harold McGillivray reached out and gave his availability.

183
00:12:54,917 --> 00:13:05,269
Mr. President, but the part that I'm troubled by is Fire Chief Gilberti never responded to the request by the union.

184
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:11,256
The Mayor's Chief of Staff, Dave Rodriguez, never responded to their request.

185
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,433
And Chief Buckley responded saying, thank you for your concerns.

186
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:18,314
At this time, I will decline.

187
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:33,385
So I'm trying to figure out, Mr. President, if this was an issue that's been brought up, and this actually dates back actually even prior to January, when a letter was sent out in June 2019 to the former mayor, Burke, asking for a meeting.

188
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,269
which was never responded to.

189
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:47,174
So this has been a year and a half, and now 10 or 11 months under this administration, going on 12 months.

190
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:55,420
And I'm just concerned, Mr. President, with the lack of attention for the last, from January to just say September, October.

191
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:03,045
when nothing was done and now all of a sudden meetings are being held and we're being told it's an emergency, Mr. President.

192
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:11,932
But from what I'm being told, there was concerns all along, Mr. President, from day one when this 911 center opened.

193
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:16,335
From day one, there was a lack of a manual, a lack of policies and procedures.

194
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:22,917
And there has been very little put into trying to get to the bottom of what's happening.

195
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:28,280
And I think everyone behind this room, I won't speak for them, no one's opposed to the position, Mr. President.

196
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,842
We had some legitimate questions regarding the position, and I'm hoping to hear tonight what's being worked on.

197
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:42,285
But I have other questions, and I'll wait to hear as soon as both chiefs respond, and hopefully the union representatives.

198
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:44,406
Thank you, Counselor Marks.

199
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,954
Would either of the chiefs like to respond at this point?

200
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:51,754
Councilor Maxwell, do you want to hear from the chiefs next or?

201
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:54,495
If they'd like to respond, Mr. President.

202
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:56,915
Chief Buckley.

203
00:14:58,476 --> 00:14:59,636
Good evening, Councilors, how are you?

204
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:01,196
Good, thank you.

205
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:11,719
Let me start by responding to the initial premise of the meeting and the request, and that was the mayor's letter.

206
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:12,719
And it clearly said that

207
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:21,075
we have an emergency in filling a staff position, and that is a public safety supervisor position.

208
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:27,742
And that is, you know, we're able to talk about that.

209
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:30,506
I can talk about that in depth, but it appears to me that,

210
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,820
That's not really the intent of this council, that they are doing some other bidding here and talking about subject matter.

211
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,201
Point of information, Mr. President.

212
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:40,521
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

213
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,441
Publicly.

214
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:43,302
Thank you, Mr. President.

215
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:47,563
I just want to make sure we're all on the same page here, Mr. President.

216
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:50,584
When exactly, because

217
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:54,886
We're hearing that they need a coordinator or supervisor for 911.

218
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:58,447
This has been set up for a year and a half, Mr. President.

219
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:12,134
When exactly did the administration and both chiefs figure out that this is now so urgent that it's an emergency now where it hasn't had supervision for the last 15 months, Mr. President?

220
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:13,355
That's what I said.

221
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,496
That's blatantly false.

222
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:17,599
And we have to stop with the rhetoric, Mr. President.

223
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:21,543
They've been under supervision of the police department since day one.

224
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:24,085
We've conducted proper training, right?

225
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,908
We can't have a public hearing when counselors are

226
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:30,131
using the torque that is causing public alarm.

227
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:32,393
There is no public health emergency.

228
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,455
There is no public safety emergency.

229
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:39,119
And we can't keep saying this stuff out loud on your soapbox.

230
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,200
Point of information.

231
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,502
Point of information.

232
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:49,629
I'll be honest, I get a little tired that we have a chief that comes out here accusing us of doing something that we are not.

233
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,432
You're making accusations that I would never do to you, sir.

234
00:16:53,912 --> 00:17:00,897
What I'm telling you is, we haven't heard anything about this, and we get a letter from the mayor saying that there's a crisis at 911.

235
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:09,143
And that is the only intent why this councilor is asking for this meeting for the leaders of both the firemen and police to answer these questions, period.

236
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:14,267
So don't leave the community on like I'm trying to put any fear mongering in anybody.

237
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:21,049
The intent of this- The intent of the meeting is to find out if there is a crisis.

238
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:22,630
That's the intent of this meeting.

239
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,790
That's it.

240
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,331
There is no crisis.

241
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:26,932
There's not a crisis.

242
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,733
Well, Chief, we wouldn't know, Chief.

243
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:35,536
We wouldn't know because the only thing we heard was a letter from the mayor saying there was a crisis in 911.

244
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:37,396
That's why we're here.

245
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:38,017
Nothing else.

246
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:42,159
That's the second time that you've come out here and done this.

247
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,719
No one's trying to leave anybody on a negative way.

248
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,919
We've done nothing but support the police and fire.

249
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,720
Councilor Scampelli.

250
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,481
If we're talking about the same letter that the mayor sent, the letter says, I feel strongly that filling this position is an emergency.

251
00:17:57,982 --> 00:18:00,242
Filling a position is an emergency.

252
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,663
Not a public health crisis or some public safety issue.

253
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:12,064
You have to put this all in context, and I really want Lieutenant Rudolph to talk about this, because he's handled this.

254
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:20,127
We have the need to fill 13 in one part-time position for public safety dispatches.

255
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:22,268
We currently have 10 dispatches.

256
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,571
That's 14 shifts per week that we cannot fill for dispatching.

257
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:31,953
Currently, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will not train dispatches for us.

258
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:35,535
They have been shut down since the beginning of the spring due to COVID.

259
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:44,059
The only way we can get dispatches and hire them is if we get already current certified trained dispatches.

260
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,822
And we have been unsuccessful in doing that.

261
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:51,007
We have been trying since the beginning of this to fill these shifts.

262
00:18:52,218 --> 00:19:16,558
What the state has told us is that if we can get a supervisor who has our, excuse me, they don't use this term supervisor, a dispatcher who has certain training and certifications, we can conduct our own training in-house and train virtually through the state and in-house through the city of Medford to hire our own dispatchers to fill these vacancies.

263
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:24,231
The strain that 14 open positions is creating on our civilian dispatches is at critical point.

264
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:28,153
The strain it creates on budgets is at a critical point.

265
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:32,794
That's what this letter is about, but it has this letter from the mayor.

266
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:40,917
In that situation, we can talk all day long and I'll let Lieutenant Rudolph discuss it, but it went way off target with what Councilor Marks is talking about.

267
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:45,759
We have been addressing this dispatch since its inception.

268
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,120
The fire chief and I have met numerous times.

269
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,921
Point of information, Mr. President.

270
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,842
Chief Buckley, one minute.

271
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,343
Point of information, Counselor Marks.

272
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:55,723
Thank you, Mr. President.

273
00:19:55,743 --> 00:20:01,266
It's great that both chiefs are meeting, but they fail to include the membership, Mr. President.

274
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:08,449
And that's a problem when you have the union, at least on the fire side, that has reached out on several occasions, Mr. President.

275
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:09,829
June 14, 2019, July 27, 2020, October 26, 2020.

276
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:15,131
Raising questions, Mr. President, requesting a meeting to discuss ongoing issues and concerns with Method Fire Alarm.

277
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:29,219
In particular, with delays in dispatching and calls for lack of supervision.

278
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:34,262
This is from the Method Fire Union, local 1032, Mr. President.

279
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:37,024
They also raised concerns on July 27th.

280
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:43,028
Union raises concerns on manpower assignments on multiple alarm fires.

281
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:49,712
Dispatch policy regarding this subject was changed without input from the fire department.

282
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:52,334
That's not coming from this council, Mr. President.

283
00:20:52,654 --> 00:21:03,904
So if the chief is working out of a vacuum, which seems to be how he operates, Mr. President, and not hearing what's happening in the community, or at least in the 911 center, then shame on him.

284
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:11,611
Don't point the finger at this council because we're raising concerns that we're hearing from membership of the police and fire, Mr. President.

285
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:13,273
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

286
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:15,775
Chief Buckley.

287
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,462
We have been meeting since the inception of this dispatch program, civilian dispatch program.

288
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:28,164
And the chief and I have been dealing with all of the issues as it relates to training.

289
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:34,947
And we have been putting together a new program and it has been successful from where we were.

290
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:37,489
That does not mean we have not had hiccups.

291
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:40,530
That does not mean that there haven't been training issues.

292
00:21:42,136 --> 00:22:00,485
Think about what we're doing, where we went from decades of police officers dispatching police calls and decades of firefighters dispatching fire calls to combining one unit and one civilian dispatch situation where they have to do both.

293
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:05,948
I don't know fire dispatching and the fire department doesn't know police dispatching.

294
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:12,162
Combined, we put together a program that has been successful.

295
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:20,890
They have been operating on the police side independently since October and operating on the fire side independently since around February.

296
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:26,114
And again, when I say successful, that doesn't mean there isn't hiccups.

297
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:31,860
To Council Box's point, in the beginning of this program, we were putting,

298
00:22:34,782 --> 00:22:36,603
training modules in place.

299
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:39,344
We're having difficulties with some training.

300
00:22:39,804 --> 00:22:42,204
Those are administrative issues.

301
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:52,068
Every issue that the fire union brought forth to chief Gilliberti, chief Gilliberti and I discussed, but there's no need to have meetings with the fire on my side.

302
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:52,768
I'm a police chief.

303
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:54,328
I don't need to meet with the fire union.

304
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:58,610
We were dealing with issues and we continue to deal with issues as they arise.

305
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:02,178
Point of information, Mr. President?

306
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:04,520
Point of information, Counselor Marks.

307
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,463
Mr. President, it's my understanding that the police oversees the 911 center.

308
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:09,523
Is that not correct?

309
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:12,205
It is correct.

310
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:24,855
So why would the chief of police, who oversees the entire picture, not want to sit down with the fire side, who does not have someone that's up there supervising, and listen to their concerns?

311
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:31,757
I think that's sort of missing the point.

312
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:38,002
I was meeting with the fire chief, the deputy chief, discussing their training.

313
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:40,104
We were meeting with the fire all along.

314
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,728
There's no need at that time and at that point to meet with the fire union on this.

315
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:45,989
I meet with their staff.

316
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:59,930
To say that we weren't meeting and talking in the fire department and the police department, we're not working to resolve the issues, is just not true.

317
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,151
We weren't.

318
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:03,512
Mr. President, point of information.

319
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:05,032
Point of information, Counselor Marks.

320
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:13,235
With all due respect, Mr. President, I'll let the union reps that are on the phone now dictate whatever their narrative is, Mr. President.

321
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:17,396
Because clearly, that's not their feedback that I received, Mr. President.

322
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:21,498
So I guess there's two different realities going on in this community.

323
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:26,141
And so I'd like to hear from the union representatives as well, Mr. President.

324
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:26,642
Okay.

325
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:27,943
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

326
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:30,244
Do you want to hear from them right now or do you want to leave?

327
00:24:30,324 --> 00:24:38,150
At some point, Mr. President, I'd like maybe for the chief to finish his presentation, but I'd like to hear from them too, Mr. President.

328
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,571
Okay, Chief Buckley, if you want to continue.

329
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:46,452
Yeah, well, just to wrap it up, there is an overwhelming need to fill this supervisory dispatcher position.

330
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:56,459
We can't train new dispatchers because the state has prohibited us from doing so, unless we have certain qualified personnel in that unit.

331
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:04,345
So we need to do this, and COVID is not going to go away anytime soon, and we are not going to be able to train

332
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:07,367
in the normal fashion by sending them off to the state.

333
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,567
So we have to take care of this problem in-house.

334
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:17,330
Currently, we have a strain on the system of personnel and on the budgets for these positions, and we have to go and fill these positions.

335
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:25,832
We have to get, increase our training on dispatches for the yearly, so-called in-service training for dispatches.

336
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:31,534
And in order to do that, we need the certified, this certified personnel to come in here and handle that.

337
00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:34,275
So that on its basic is the need, the overwhelming,

338
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:47,142
And it is a crisis vote to hire a dispatcher who has certain supervisory and certifications in-house to do this.

339
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:49,624
We need to do this and we need to do it soon.

340
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:51,164
That's the point.

341
00:25:51,344 --> 00:26:01,369
Now, I'm comfortable with you talking to both unions, and I'd love to hear their positions on this, because I think for the most part, they're going to tell you similar concerns, but maybe not.

342
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:02,810
Maybe the fire union will surprise them.

343
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:04,941
We will.

344
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:06,061
Thank you, Chief Buckley.

345
00:26:07,062 --> 00:26:13,043
Chief Gilberti, did you want to speak before I recognize the union representatives?

346
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:15,724
Yes.

347
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:22,285
Thank you, Mr. President, Mayor Longo Kern, and city councilors.

348
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:31,588
As far as the supervisor's position goes, my union has been asking for a supervisor,

349
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:35,849
in the dispatch center from the beginning.

350
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:47,178
And I had asked the previous administration on at least two occasions, if we could get a supervisor into the dispatch center, but that didn't materialize.

351
00:26:47,278 --> 00:27:01,548
And I want to thank Mayor Lungo Kern for stepping up and hearing our cries for a supervisor and taking the necessary steps for us to move forward with that.

352
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:06,934
I meet with my union on these issues.

353
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:10,137
We talk about it.

354
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:12,239
They bring me issues.

355
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:17,843
Chief Buckley wanted to hear their concerns, but he wanted to hear them through me.

356
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:25,850
And I asked my union and anyone in the department, if they have any concerns to send me a communication and I will address them with Chief Buckley.

357
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,192
And I've done that on a number of occasions.

358
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:29,312
Have we had our hiccups?

359
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:31,014
Yes, we have.

360
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:32,395
But we try to deal with them.

361
00:27:33,393 --> 00:27:34,113
as they come up.

362
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:44,376
I believe Chief Buckley had a discussion last night with the union, the dispatch union.

363
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:49,018
And I'm hoping, and I believe that we are on the right track.

364
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:56,080
And as soon as we can get the supervisor in there, things will be a little different.

365
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,140
They'll have some oversight.

366
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:58,716
They'll have retraining.

367
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:02,300
They'll have a one encompassing manual.

368
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:08,266
So that's my statement for right now.

369
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:11,069
Thank you, Chief Gilbert.

370
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:11,169
Okay.

371
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:17,875
At this point, I recognize, do you prefer police or fire?

372
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:18,356
It doesn't matter.

373
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:19,197
Okay.

374
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:26,233
We'll go with, let's see, let's go with Eddie Buckley from the local 1032 Memphis Fire Department.

375
00:28:26,393 --> 00:28:28,514
I'm going to unmute you, Eddie Buckley.

376
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:33,398
Hello, sorry I'm at work.

377
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:34,758
Can anyone hear me?

378
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:35,759
Yes, we can hear you.

379
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:36,900
Thank you for joining us tonight.

380
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:41,423
So what questions do you have?

381
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,064
I'm glad to answer anything, sure.

382
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:49,268
Council Members, do you have any specific questions that you'd like to ask Mr. Buckley?

383
00:28:50,747 --> 00:29:04,575
I guess my question would be to Mr. Buckley is what have been the concerns for the past year and a half that have been raised by the fire department regarding their concerns with 911 in the community?

384
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:10,778
Beginning with the lack of a training manual, there was no training manual.

385
00:29:10,978 --> 00:29:16,261
It was pretty much a couple papers put together at the last second.

386
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:18,742
So our members didn't have the

387
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,664
correct training in order to train the new members of the civilian dispatch.

388
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,847
We raised our concerns early about that.

389
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:31,590
There still is no training manual.

390
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:42,881
And then when the civilians started taking over in around February, we were noticing a lot of errors and we were trying to address it and see how we could fix it.

391
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:52,180
We did ask in the beginning for a fire department supervisor over there, as well as did the dispatchers themselves.

392
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,101
They were asking first they needed a fire department supervisor.

393
00:29:58,362 --> 00:30:02,383
Would we love a fire department supervisor?

394
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:03,003
Absolutely.

395
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:07,184
But if the mayor's going to hire somebody to do that job, that's fine.

396
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:10,585
As long as the job is being done and we're being dispatched,

397
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:16,793
to all the calls in a timely fashion, we don't have a problem with who's doing the supervising.

398
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:22,554
In our opinion, yeah, it should be someone on the fire side, as the police have on the police side.

399
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:25,154
But I understand that the police are in charge of it.

400
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:40,317
But we need to have a way of fixing any errors that take place in dispatch in a timely fashion, not sending communications and talking about it a week or two later.

401
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:44,819
These are emergency situations that need to be addressed immediately.

402
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,901
Those were our concerns.

403
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:52,265
From what I know, Chief Buckley and Chief Gilberti met.

404
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:54,707
They're addressing the situation.

405
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,468
They're addressing our concerns that we have.

406
00:30:56,748 --> 00:31:04,355
Yes, it is 11 months later, but they did meet and allegedly they're addressing those issues.

407
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:09,799
So we'd like to see that go forward and hopefully there's no issues going forward.

408
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:13,933
Mr. President, if I could.

409
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,373
Please continue, Councilor Marks.

410
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:31,541
So based on the October 26th letter that was written by local 1032 regarding concerns of method fire and in particular delays in dispatching calls and lack of supervision.

411
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:38,104
I was wondering if you can address that particular letter that was sent to the city administration.

412
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:42,537
Yeah, I sent that letter in October.

413
00:31:42,557 --> 00:31:44,038
We had a meeting in November.

414
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:45,758
I addressed our issues.

415
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:59,564
This union doesn't feel that we really got listened to as the chiefs met last night, which is, you know, over a month since we had the meeting to discuss it.

416
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:07,668
But those were our concerns from day one, delays and dispatches and not getting sent the calls that we should be.

417
00:32:10,702 --> 00:32:25,547
Mr. President, also, maybe if you can address the July 27th letter, which discusses manpower on assignments on multiple alarm fires and the dispatch policy that was created without any input from the fire department.

418
00:32:25,787 --> 00:32:26,927
Has that been rectified?

419
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:28,288
Yes.

420
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:33,089
Chief Gilberti spoke with the police department.

421
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:38,371
I believe Chief Buckley, I don't know if he spoke with Lieutenant Rudolph or if he was in charge at that point, but

422
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:50,079
He readdressed the, we have a dispatch paper for second alarm fires, and he reiterated that everyone is to be, I gotta go to a call, sorry.

423
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,559
I'm at work right now.

424
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,779
Thank you, be safe.

425
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,501
Okay, so we don't have a, so Mr. Buckley's not with us.

426
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:00,082
He had a call, so he's,

427
00:33:04,135 --> 00:33:05,396
So we'll hear from Harold McGillivray.

428
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:08,297
I'd like to hear from Harold, Mr. President, Mr. McGillivray.

429
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:18,583
But also, Mr. President, I guess what it takes to get things done in this community is a resolution by this Memphis City Council to get people to act on certain items.

430
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:26,667
And I'm glad to see both chiefs met last night, Mr. President, after many emails going out regarding concerns of

431
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:34,253
a lack of supervision and delays in dispatching over the past 11 months.

432
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:36,775
And now they're being addressed, Mr. President.

433
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:52,968
So if anything, I am happy that I put my name on this, Mr. President, to make sure on behalf of the 58,000 residents of this community that 911 indeed protects the residents of this community, Mr. President.

434
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:54,288
Thank you very much.

435
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:58,290
We actually, before I move forward, we got a message.

436
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,391
I think Mr. Buckley is actually still with us.

437
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:04,093
So let's recognize Eddie Buckley.

438
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:06,414
Sorry.

439
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:08,435
That was a call for another station.

440
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:12,997
I apologize.

441
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:16,798
Do you have any further questions for Mr. Buckley?

442
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,880
I just made my statement, Mr. President.

443
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,500
Thank you.

444
00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:24,344
Thank you, Mr. Buckley.

445
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:25,985
Mr. Buckley, do you have any further comments?

446
00:34:27,546 --> 00:34:28,006
No, sir.

447
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:37,051
Like I said, I'm just, I'm happy that the mayor is hiring a supervisor and I'm hoping that the chiefs have resolved the issues that this union has.

448
00:34:37,472 --> 00:34:38,052
We appreciate it.

449
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:38,812
Okay, thank you.

450
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:42,314
Okay, I see the chiefs have their hands up.

451
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:49,939
So let's go to Chief Gilberti and then we'll go to Chief Buckley.

452
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:52,862
Thank you, Mr. President.

453
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:58,803
These issues have come up that had been brought to my attention.

454
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:12,226
And as soon as they were brought to my attention, I would sit down with Chief Buckley and Lieutenant Rudolph, and we would discuss the issues that the union had and that I had.

455
00:35:12,906 --> 00:35:19,287
And I want to say that they've both been very receptive in dealing with the issues.

456
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:27,885
I don't want you to think that we met last night for the first time to try and, you know,

457
00:35:29,476 --> 00:35:31,097
address everybody's concerns.

458
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:32,997
We have been meeting right along.

459
00:35:33,517 --> 00:35:38,039
And as I said, Chief Buckley and Lieutenant Rudolph have been very receptive.

460
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:43,721
And last night's meeting was very, very reassuring.

461
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:51,223
As I said, Chief Buckley spoke with the dispatch union last night, and we had spoke this morning.

462
00:35:52,603 --> 00:35:57,185
And going forward, I think that things will be, will be,

463
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:01,382
everybody will be satisfied with the way we move forward.

464
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:03,803
Thank you, Chief Gilberti.

465
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:04,784
Mr. President.

466
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:06,905
Councilor Lox.

467
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:26,413
Mr. President, since we trained and lost a number of dispatches, I was wondering if there was any exit interviews given, and if so, what were the sentiments of the candidates that were trained and given a job here in the city of Method, and then after a short period of time decided to leave, Mr. President.

468
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:29,775
Let's see, Lieutenant Rudolph has his hand up.

469
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:30,395
Let's see.

470
00:36:30,415 --> 00:36:33,657
There you go.

471
00:36:33,697 --> 00:36:34,278
Lieutenant Rudolph.

472
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:35,258
Good evening.

473
00:36:35,378 --> 00:36:35,899
Good evening.

474
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,139
This is Lieutenant Mark Rudolph.

475
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:37,860
Can everyone hear me?

476
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,260
Yes.

477
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:39,781
Okay.

478
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:45,725
Well, first of all, I'd like to thank all of you for asking me to come before the council tonight via zoom.

479
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,007
And I do want to answer a couple of quick questions for you.

480
00:36:50,228 --> 00:36:53,710
Most recently, the three individuals that had left us,

481
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:55,985
all left for a very similar reason.

482
00:36:56,005 --> 00:37:01,629
They all lived within 5 to 15 minutes of the location that they got jobs at.

483
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:09,693
So that was up in the north side of Route 93 and 495.

484
00:37:10,614 --> 00:37:16,598
Each one of them lived only a very short time away from the location they went to, which was Tewksbury Regional.

485
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:23,382
So having said that, we lost 3 very, very good dispatchers who were also excellent trainers.

486
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:26,947
They had experience doing the training.

487
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:33,114
One of them had previous experience with another agency anyway and was a good training officer there as well.

488
00:37:33,574 --> 00:37:38,220
So that was a big hit on our ability to continue a solid in-service training.

489
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:50,961
Beyond that, that was the only reason that all three of them chose to leave, was simply because they were matched with salary by that location as to what they were making in Medford.

490
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:55,963
Because they wanted to lure them away, they went because they simply moved to where they lived.

491
00:37:56,623 --> 00:37:59,764
So having that is a major concern for most people.

492
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:05,925
The commute, which typically for two of them was up to 45 minutes every morning, and now it's five to 11 minutes.

493
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:10,466
And the third moved to just southern New Hampshire, so it was very similar for the three of them.

494
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:14,587
Those were the only things they gave to me as reasons for going.

495
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:15,727
They loved the job.

496
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:17,287
They enjoyed working in Medford.

497
00:38:17,648 --> 00:38:22,649
They found it to be extremely challenging, even the person that came to us from Tewksbury originally.

498
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:37,020
Had they not been, you know, wooed away basically by another agency that was similar to where they lived, we probably would still have those three and we wouldn't be going through the crisis situation that we are right now.

499
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:42,285
Thank you, Lieutenant Rudolph.

500
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:43,946
You're welcome.

501
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:44,967
Okay.

502
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:47,009
Any questions for Lieutenant Rudolph while we have him?

503
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:48,710
Okay.

504
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,454
Chief Buckley, I believe you had your hand up and Chief Buckley.

505
00:38:54,857 --> 00:39:06,104
I just want to add briefly to Chief Gilberti's comments that, you know, we have been meeting all along with this, on this, the dispatcher situation.

506
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:11,228
And it wasn't just last night that we met and resolved these matters.

507
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:14,610
We've been meeting all along, taking all these into considerations.

508
00:39:16,082 --> 00:39:17,884
You just have to accept that that's been going on.

509
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:20,406
We haven't been ignoring these situations.

510
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:28,012
And to add secondarily to the reasons that the three dispatchers left,

511
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:40,493
Up in Tewksbury area, they have a regional dispatch center that the state funded and they needed bodies to fill that dispatch center.

512
00:39:40,513 --> 00:39:42,075
And they were in a similar position as us.

513
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:46,580
They could not hire dispatchers because the state wasn't capable of training dispatchers.

514
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:49,243
So they went out and basically

515
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:53,841
like head hunted active dispatchers left and right.

516
00:39:54,282 --> 00:40:04,551
We actually paid more for dispatchers down here and they actually raised their prices up there to attract dispatchers to their center so they could open and they had state funding to do it.

517
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:11,578
And so that hurt us and probably hurt a couple of other police departments and fire dispatchers in the area.

518
00:40:11,638 --> 00:40:15,081
So there's a number of reasons associated with why they left and,

519
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:22,098
But I just really wanted my point was that we have been meeting all along on this issue.

520
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:23,901
Dispatching, no problem.

521
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:24,602
Thank you.

522
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,630
Thank you, Chief Buckley.

523
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,631
Vice President Carviella.

524
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:27,431
Thank you, Mr. President.

525
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:33,473
Mr. President, I'm going to make it clear that the only agenda of this city council is the safety of the residents of Medford.

526
00:40:33,853 --> 00:40:37,195
We have no other agenda other than that.

527
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:44,777
Chief, whoever wants to answer, is the pay that we pay these dispatchers, is it on par with other cities and towns?

528
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:45,958
Are we not paying enough money?

529
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:51,520
I don't know what they get for salary, but are we on par with other communities?

530
00:40:58,778 --> 00:40:58,958
I'm sorry.

531
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:01,219
I'm sorry.

532
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:02,659
Yes, Council, we are.

533
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,420
We're better than most communities.

534
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:09,102
We pay very respectful.

535
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:17,425
And I think that if it wasn't for, you know, the shutdown of state 9-1-1 training, we would have our ranks filled here very easily.

536
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:18,425
What's

537
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:27,528
demand for qualified, trained dispatchers.

538
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:33,071
And so we've had a couple of interviews and we've brought a number of them in here, but they're looking for top dollar.

539
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:40,435
And we can't pay one new dispatcher differently than the other dispatchers because they are technically unionized now.

540
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:42,836
So we can only offer them what we can offer them.

541
00:41:42,856 --> 00:41:47,198
It is a healthy, but some of the dispatchers that are out there looking for jobs are looking for a higher rate of pay.

542
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:47,539
And so

543
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:52,422
Um, but very clearly we are very competitive in our salary dispatcher.

544
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:58,807
It's just the only ones out there right now are, you know, qualified trained dispatchers who are looking for something better.

545
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:00,348
Thank you.

546
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:01,109
Thank you, Chief Buckley.

547
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:01,990
Lieutenant Rudolph.

548
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,572
Did you want to comment on that as well?

549
00:42:04,612 --> 00:42:07,774
Yes, I just want to echo the same thing that Chief Buckley said.

550
00:42:08,355 --> 00:42:15,120
Myself and Chief Gilberti have participated in every single interview of multiple applicants, along with Mr Neil Osborne.

551
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:24,013
We've had some unique candidates that came before us, several that really stood out with tremendous levels of experience.

552
00:42:24,633 --> 00:42:35,419
And unfortunately, those two individuals, one did decide to take the job, and then at the last moment decided that it was still too big a pay cut for him to take it.

553
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,921
The other person said the same thing.

554
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:39,402
It was just much too big a pay cut.

555
00:42:39,762 --> 00:42:43,484
Because they were both working at one, was at a state regional

556
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,353
center, and the other was at a major metropolitan location.

557
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:53,717
And that person chose not to take it as well, simply because it would have been too big a pay cut.

558
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,979
Are we in a decent range?

559
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:04,005
I think right now, as Chief Buckley said, we are actually in a better position than a lot of departments that don't pay very much around us.

560
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:10,110
So we are very reasonable as far as what we have for salaries.

561
00:43:11,248 --> 00:43:23,858
I just want to reemphasize, though, that there is a distinct need for a qualified civilian dispatch supervisor who is not a police officer, who is not a firefighter, because neither one of myself or my

562
00:43:25,565 --> 00:43:33,530
My partners on the far side even have any level of qualified training to actually do the job of a true dispatch supervisor.

563
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:39,814
Right now, the dispatches, they're under the watchful eye of a shift commander on the police side.

564
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:43,417
It's always been that way since the center opened in 1997.

565
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:51,622
That does not mean that person who is watching them has any level of knowledge regarding the actual 911 process.

566
00:43:51,722 --> 00:43:53,423
We're not qualified to use it at all.

567
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,491
We're there to give guidance, and that's it.

568
00:43:56,711 --> 00:44:03,335
We can't qualify them, we can't instruct them, we can't teach them anything other than basic common actions.

569
00:44:03,415 --> 00:44:07,737
But as far as 911 equipment goes, we're dead in the water as supervisors there.

570
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:17,963
And that's the need for a true civilian dispatcher who has the American Professional Communications Office's supervised training program, who has the APCO certified

571
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:21,184
police training, the APCO certified fire training.

572
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:25,045
They're literally trained as instructors and supervisors.

573
00:44:25,425 --> 00:44:33,728
That's the key for us to become truly successful here and have one of the best run 9-1-1 centers locally in a small city the size of ours.

574
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:38,550
Do we have the luxury of being a Boston or some other metropolitan city?

575
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:39,630
Not really.

576
00:44:40,751 --> 00:44:44,312
Most of those places all have civilian dispatchers running their operation.

577
00:44:45,395 --> 00:44:55,158
They may report to a command officer in the police or the fire department, whoever manages it, but the reality is that dispatch supervisor is a dispatcher at heart.

578
00:44:55,618 --> 00:45:02,440
They live it, they breathe it, and they train those around them to do the job that they can do as well.

579
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:10,603
And that's the true reasoning why we need someone who is highly qualified, has a huge skill set to be able to do that type of work.

580
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:14,804
And there isn't a police officer in Medford or a firefighter in Medford,

581
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:21,726
that has that level of skill set and capabilities and licensed certifications to be able to perform that job.

582
00:45:22,146 --> 00:45:24,829
I just wanted to let the council know that as well.

583
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:26,590
And I thank you for allowing me to speak.

584
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,311
Thank you.

585
00:45:28,011 --> 00:45:33,817
So do we do we have candidates in the pipeline that were interviewing for this job?

586
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:37,620
Lieutenant Rudolph again.

587
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:44,128
We, Chief Gilberti, myself and Mr. Osborne interviewed a gentleman about a week and a half ago.

588
00:45:44,148 --> 00:45:47,649
I will have the results of the background investigation tomorrow.

589
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:55,752
And depending on what the background investigation reveals or confirms, we should be able to move forward with a potential offer.

590
00:45:57,332 --> 00:46:01,274
But again, it depends on the full results and I don't have that report until tomorrow.

591
00:46:01,314 --> 00:46:02,594
We were still waiting for a couple of

592
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:06,253
previous employers to supply us with their paperwork on it.

593
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:11,558
So I should be able to answer that question probably within the next 48 to 72 hours.

594
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:16,822
Are we eligible for any state or federal funds to pay for this person?

595
00:46:16,922 --> 00:46:24,930
Or maybe to sweeten the salary to get, as we're being purged, we may have to purge other departments.

596
00:46:26,448 --> 00:46:36,411
As far as police funding goes, we don't have any capability of using 9-1-1 state grant money for hiring personnel.

597
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:46,935
It's used for equipment purchases, it's used for upgrade purposes of equipment, it's used for training for our personnel, but it doesn't pay salaries and you can't use it as part of that.

598
00:46:47,675 --> 00:46:50,316
It does pay for overtime to send them to training only.

599
00:46:51,068 --> 00:46:51,408
Thank you.

600
00:46:51,648 --> 00:46:58,471
And again, please understand, please understand that the only agenda of this council is the safety of the citizens of Medford.

601
00:46:59,031 --> 00:46:59,351
Thank you.

602
00:46:59,752 --> 00:47:02,233
And I agree with you 100% counselor.

603
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:07,115
And that's the role that I try to ensure that our dispatchers are doing their very best.

604
00:47:07,155 --> 00:47:10,256
But again, keep in mind, I have 39 years of police experience.

605
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:17,739
I'm not a firefighter, I'm not an EMT, and I'm certainly not a dispatcher, but I'm probably in my position

606
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:25,894
the single person right now that has the highest level of authority over them, but I can't train them.

607
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:34,777
I can only provide the proper training through the right venues to get them increased certifications and increased training programs.

608
00:47:36,558 --> 00:47:37,819
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

609
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:40,320
Thank you, Lieutenant Rudolph.

610
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,660
Mayor Longo-Kern.

611
00:47:42,741 --> 00:47:43,181
Thank you.

612
00:47:43,221 --> 00:47:47,243
Just to answer Vice President Carviello's

613
00:47:48,585 --> 00:48:12,222
question because Lieutenant Rudolph did answer the most recent interview, which is in process, but I just wanted to also make you aware of about six to eight weeks ago, approximately, I did do final interviews for two strong candidates, both of whom were very well trained, had a great deal of experience, both probably capable of being supervisors.

614
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:18,327
We did offer the job of dispatcher to both of those candidates, and they both turned them down due to the

615
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:19,572
the salary.

616
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:33,240
One of those candidates was very well-versed on the police side only, and one was well-versed on police and had an extreme amount of experience on the fire side.

617
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,922
So that is a potential for this job.

618
00:48:35,982 --> 00:48:37,843
So I just wanted to be extremely clear.

619
00:48:39,244 --> 00:48:43,407
We did have two strong candidates about six to eight weeks ago, but we did lose them both.

620
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:45,268
Thank you.

621
00:48:45,848 --> 00:48:46,729
Counselor Scarpelli.

622
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,285
So thank you, Mr. President.

623
00:48:48,305 --> 00:49:02,157
So to revert back to the first comment we made, and just to be clear, this is why we asked for this meeting.

624
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:12,987
No matter how it went out, the letter went out to the mayor, the word got out to the community that there was a safety crisis with 911.

625
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:20,770
Whether it's with hiring, whether it's with policy, whichever it is, we needed to get answers, and that's it.

626
00:49:21,691 --> 00:49:30,474
And from what I've heard from the chief of police, from what I've heard from the chief of fire, from what I've heard from the union representation so far, is to me,

627
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:37,090
exactly what we needed to share to our constituents that brought these questions and these concerns to us.

628
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:38,891
No other reason.

629
00:49:39,912 --> 00:49:40,192
That's it.

630
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:45,956
I'm not trying to dig anything up or trying to find something that's not there or say that it's not safe.

631
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:55,003
It's refreshing that Lieutenant Rudolph, frightening but refreshing that he said that we don't have anybody qualified

632
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:03,261
to run that office right now, and that's probably the most important public safety position right now.

633
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:12,106
That's the first line of safety and help for all our constituents, whether it's with violence or whether it's with health.

634
00:50:13,306 --> 00:50:24,912
This is the reason why having the communication, having the chief of police and the chief of fire here to answer these questions publicly to us is why it's so important that we did this.

635
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:25,853
No other reason.

636
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:28,729
And I thank them for coming out and doing that.

637
00:50:30,811 --> 00:50:42,428
And understand, this won't be the last time, Mr. President, that this councilor will contact or put a resolution through if I feel that we need some answers by leaders in our community.

638
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:48,026
So thank you very much, and I appreciate the answers that were given.

639
00:50:48,406 --> 00:50:55,748
And I think that we have a strong understanding of what now these concerns are and where we're moving to.

640
00:50:56,028 --> 00:50:56,528
So thank you.

641
00:50:56,608 --> 00:50:57,609
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

642
00:50:57,629 --> 00:50:59,129
Councilor Marks.

643
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:00,189
Thank you, Mr. President.

644
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,230
I just want to be able to understand, Mr. President,

645
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:09,772
This issue of civilian 911 was being discussed.

646
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:25,998
And at the time when they decided to move forward, I'd like to be privy to what the discussions were around hiring a civilian 911 supervisor at that time, a year and a half ago, if any.

647
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:34,642
Because I think it's important, Mr. President, there's not one member behind this reel that I've heard once say, we don't need the position.

648
00:51:35,422 --> 00:51:41,986
There's not one person for the last three weeks, I've never heard one person say, this is not needed, Mr. President.

649
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:47,329
We have been asking questions on why it's an emergency right now, absolutely.

650
00:51:47,629 --> 00:51:52,872
And I'll continue to ask them, like Councilor Scott Kelly and Councilor Caviello have mentioned.

651
00:51:53,672 --> 00:52:02,958
But I'd like to know, Mr. President, a year and a half ago, when the powers to be sat down and started discussing how this 911 center was going to work.

652
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:13,263
What were the discussions around hiring someone from the start that had that supervisory skill to oversee this department, Mr. President?

653
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:19,846
And to make sure that the proper unified training manuals were set up, Mr. President.

654
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:28,270
To make sure the rules and procedures and policies were set up to set up our workers for success, Mr. President.

655
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,431
and not failure.

656
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,913
People leave for a lot of different reasons.

657
00:52:32,353 --> 00:52:46,586
Some may be location, but others may leave, Mr. President, for other reasons, such as lack of supervision and lack of a clear, defined training manual and other reasons, Mr. President.

658
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:51,750
They may not state it, Mr. President, but they leave for a host of reasons.

659
00:52:52,050 --> 00:53:00,536
But I'd like to know why from the inception that we did not hire, don't forget we just went through the budget this June 2020.

660
00:53:01,657 --> 00:53:08,823
If this has been discussed for the last year and a half, why was it in the June 2020 budget, Mr. President?

661
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:12,465
Why are we looking at a supplemental after the fact?

662
00:53:13,465 --> 00:53:22,593
So I'd like to know why this wasn't discussed, and if it was, I'd like to know why and why it didn't get in to the planning of this 911 center.

663
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:37,345
As Councilor Scott Pelly mentioned, to me that's critical to have someone that oversees and has the experience in both police and fire and able to put this together and create the policies and manuals and the hiring and the training.

664
00:53:39,326 --> 00:53:41,767
101, Mr. President, of creating a dispatch center.

665
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:44,007
So I'd like to know why that didn't happen originally.

666
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,748
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

667
00:53:46,788 --> 00:53:48,048
Would anybody like to comment on that?

668
00:53:48,688 --> 00:53:49,548
I can comment on that.

669
00:53:50,229 --> 00:53:51,949
I wasn't around a year and a half ago.

670
00:53:51,969 --> 00:54:05,872
I know that the only one present probably, because I know it was Chief Sacco and Mayor Burke at the time, and I know Chief Gilberti can probably comment, but I just want to reiterate that we did have police

671
00:54:06,399 --> 00:54:12,280
and then we had fire in dispatch up until February, March, right around when COVID hit.

672
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,541
And at that time, the issues of the training manual were being worked on.

673
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:20,142
So I know it did take time, and we got to this point.

674
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:32,285
We had almost a semi-emergency meeting on this in October, and then a second one in November, which is leading us to where we are today, requesting a 911 supervisor, which we did in the supplemental budget.

675
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:34,866
But I understand your reasonings for not

676
00:54:36,177 --> 00:54:40,640
I'm here tonight to explain why we're here, how we're planning to fix it and why we think this is so essential.

677
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:10,939
Thank you, Mr. President.

678
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:12,100
Thank you.

679
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:24,324
Since the beginning, the union has, my union has always looked to have a supervisor from the fire side in the dispatch center.

680
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:38,248
And that's what I was advocating for with the prior administration to have a, at least at the rank of lieutenant into the dispatch center to oversee just the fire side.

681
00:55:39,387 --> 00:55:49,955
The police at the time had their commanding officer was in the dispatch center, and we felt that we needed representation on the fire side.

682
00:55:50,816 --> 00:55:52,537
That never came to fruition.

683
00:55:53,538 --> 00:56:08,530
When Mayor Longo Hearn took over, we approached that subject again, and we worked on, now we're here at a civilian dispatcher who's qualified at both disciplines, and will be able to oversee

684
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:10,303
the center.

685
00:56:11,044 --> 00:56:14,631
So that's where it was back a year and a half ago.

686
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:20,222
I was advocating always for a fire dispatch supervisor only.

687
00:56:22,307 --> 00:56:29,210
So Mr. President, just so I understand, and I appreciate Chief Gilberti's response.

688
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:40,354
So if the chief was advocating for a fire supervisor, and I'm sure the police were advocating for a police supervisor, we ended up instead of having

689
00:56:41,717 --> 00:56:47,941
both Mr. President, no trained supervisor at all for the past year and a half.

690
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:56,266
And this is no reflection on Lieutenant Rudolph, because he stated himself that this is not really his expertise.

691
00:56:56,886 --> 00:57:03,130
And he can't really train, he can't really oversee, because he's not aware of what's taking place.

692
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:08,412
in the dispatch to really supervise it, Mr. President.

693
00:57:08,432 --> 00:57:18,035
And I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I just don't understand how you may be advocating for something, but it resulted in no supervision at all for the past year and a half.

694
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:26,258
And I should say no trained supervision, no expertise in 911 for the last year and a half.

695
00:57:26,618 --> 00:57:29,839
And that's the shortcoming, Mr. President, that I have a concern with.

696
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:35,082
And we've had the last 11 months to do something, and finally we're getting a paper.

697
00:57:35,442 --> 00:57:41,525
In my opinion, if this was such an emergency, I would have sent it out as its own paper, Mr. President.

698
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:50,590
Having a reverse 911 supervisor as its own paper, not mixed in with nine other items, like an interpreter.

699
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:53,333
and other things, Mr. President, in there.

700
00:57:53,613 --> 00:57:55,616
So that would be how I would have handled it.

701
00:57:55,856 --> 00:58:00,361
But again, I'm not the chief executive officer of this city, Mr. President.

702
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,384
And that's how they chose to handle it.

703
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:07,290
Because maybe if it was submitted in that fashion, this would have been handled three weeks ago.

704
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:18,936
Mr. President, so I'm still not happy with the answers regarding the lack of supervision, the lack of a trained personnel to oversee this department, Mr. President.

705
00:58:19,536 --> 00:58:27,660
And we don't know what this has resulted in, the lack of manuals, policies, and procedures over the last year and a half.

706
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,523
We don't know potential lawsuits or anything else that may be brewing in this community, Mr. President.

707
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:39,525
over this 9-1-1, and I guess that'll speak for itself, Mr. President, at some point.

708
00:58:39,705 --> 00:58:40,405
Thank you, Council Members.

709
00:58:40,425 --> 00:58:46,386
We have a number of Councilors that have questions, but we also haven't heard from Harold McGilvery from the Police Department Union.

710
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,668
Does Council care if we hear from him and then we move forward with the questions?

711
00:58:51,688 --> 00:59:01,431
Just because he was supposed to follow Mr. Buckley, but when Mr. Buckley went, or Eddie Buckley went, then the Chiefs weighed back on, they responded to his concerns.

712
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,431
So let's hear from,

713
00:59:03,447 --> 00:59:06,308
I'm going to give away from the method Police Department.

714
00:59:06,988 --> 00:59:07,628
Union president.

715
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,230
Mister Montgomery.

716
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:15,390
Thank you, president.

717
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:16,291
Can you hear me?

718
00:59:16,491 --> 00:59:17,051
Yes, we can.

719
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:17,451
Thank you.

720
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:19,011
Okay.

721
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:21,572
Harry McGilvery 100 Main Street.

722
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:24,553
I'm the president of the method Police Patrolman's Association.

723
00:59:25,808 --> 00:59:29,730
I just want to get off topic real quick before I get going.

724
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:34,512
I just want to acknowledge the fact that the new police station opened last week.

725
00:59:35,532 --> 00:59:39,874
And it's pretty impressive building.

726
00:59:40,895 --> 00:59:44,676
And I want to acknowledge former Mayor Burke for

727
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:47,961
getting that done.

728
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:55,227
Current mayor, Longo Curran, councillors Carriello, Mox, DelaRusso, Scott, Kelly, Layton, Falco.

729
00:59:55,927 --> 01:00:01,993
It was a really long time coming, and it's now come to fruition.

730
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,855
And it's an impressive building.

731
01:00:05,515 --> 01:00:13,042
And the membership of the Patrolmen's Union and the Supervisors' Union, I don't think we realized the

732
01:00:13,812 --> 01:00:18,796
the conditions we were working under until we got into that new building.

733
01:00:18,936 --> 01:00:31,647
It's really something to be in a new building with 21st century technology and some real nice comforts of working in a clean office space.

734
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:35,010
And like I said, when we broke ground

735
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:41,449
the red side is still working in the same building.

736
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:48,214
And I hope that the city does move quickly to rectify that situation.

737
01:00:49,235 --> 01:00:52,778
So now I'll get on to the 9, 1, 1, situation.

738
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:57,462
Just to create a timeline, I was approached by a few of the 9-1-1

739
01:01:06,812 --> 01:01:09,853
I spoke with them at the TPW building when they were down there.

740
01:01:10,673 --> 01:01:18,294
And I gave them an explanation of what being members of the union would entail.

741
01:01:19,295 --> 01:01:28,096
I recommended that they also reach out to Steve Salt of the Teamsters, Eddie Barclay of 1032, and then make a decision.

742
01:01:29,057 --> 01:01:35,578
They contacted me a week or so later, said they wanted to really go forward and join our union.

743
01:01:36,617 --> 01:01:43,883
And we went, you know, we contacted our office and we put the process in place.

744
01:01:44,264 --> 01:01:47,607
They signed union cards and they became members of our union.

745
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:52,731
From the moment they became members of the union, we've been representing them.

746
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:54,853
I have met

747
01:01:56,261 --> 01:02:01,045
on a regular basis with Chief Barclay and with Chief Gilberti.

748
01:02:01,086 --> 01:02:05,389
I met with Chief Barclay one-on-one.

749
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:11,315
I've met with Chief Barclay and Chief Gilberti together in the old police station.

750
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:15,578
And I am the representative.

751
01:02:16,661 --> 01:02:18,642
I am the bargaining agent for those folks.

752
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:26,626
And I want to say that I never had any impression that there was ever a public safety emergency.

753
01:02:28,887 --> 01:02:36,571
It was brought to my attention by one of the dispatchers when he saw an agenda item on the council.

754
01:02:37,091 --> 01:02:41,173
I reached out to several counselors, and it was the first time I was hearing all of that.

755
01:02:43,834 --> 01:02:45,135
I want to say right now that

756
01:02:45,609 --> 01:02:50,051
these individuals that are working here as public safety dispatchers.

757
01:02:51,592 --> 01:02:54,353
They're working hard to do a good job.

758
01:02:54,393 --> 01:02:56,795
They're getting better every day.

759
01:02:56,915 --> 01:02:58,275
They want to do a good job.

760
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:03,438
And we're not reinventing the wheel here.

761
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:10,982
Civilian dispatching takes place pretty much around the country, around the Commonwealth.

762
01:03:11,442 --> 01:03:13,163
We're probably getting into this late.

763
01:03:13,881 --> 01:03:17,282
I can't speak for the fire union, but we negotiated those jobs away.

764
01:03:18,402 --> 01:03:24,784
And I'm taken back by some of the things I've heard here tonight.

765
01:03:24,824 --> 01:03:26,925
I'm surprised we're not in an executive session.

766
01:03:27,885 --> 01:03:30,386
I'd probably be more comfortable in an executive session.

767
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:40,089
I can clearly state for a fact that the three dispatchers that left did not leave because of a lack of supervision.

768
01:03:43,594 --> 01:03:47,596
I'm not going to get into the reasons because this isn't the time or place to be doing this.

769
01:03:48,456 --> 01:03:52,398
The mayor set up several meetings at City Hall.

770
01:03:53,118 --> 01:03:58,740
They brought in an individual who is a professional civilian dispatcher.

771
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:02,782
And we had a plan in place as to how to

772
01:04:10,288 --> 01:04:22,077
to go into an executive session and speak as to what's been going on behind the scenes, but I'm not going to do it here.

773
01:04:23,558 --> 01:04:25,960
I've never seen anything like this, actually.

774
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,204
My 15 years as a union president that my membership is being talked about like this.

775
01:04:33,886 --> 01:04:34,726
It's disheartening.

776
01:04:36,688 --> 01:04:39,610
And I'm not very happy right now.

777
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:44,534
They're working without a contract, growing pains.

778
01:04:45,454 --> 01:04:54,415
We, both police and fire side, have to adjust to not having police officers and firefighters dispatching us.

779
01:04:55,715 --> 01:05:00,356
And it's just, it's heartening as to some of the things that I heard here tonight.

780
01:05:03,657 --> 01:05:06,277
If anybody has any questions, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

781
01:05:06,297 --> 01:05:10,438
But like I said, I think this is something that should have been done in executive session.

782
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:12,958
Thank you, Harold.

783
01:05:13,638 --> 01:05:16,159
We have Councilor Piers and Vice President Carvillo.

784
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:16,839
Councilor Piers.

785
01:05:16,939 --> 01:05:18,040
Thank you, Mr. President.

786
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:25,341
I think what Councilor Mark said and what Mayor Legault-Kern previously said actually gets to the heart of the issue around this paper.

787
01:05:25,362 --> 01:05:34,804
I don't think there's any disagreement with hiring a 911 supervisor or whatever else is needed to make sure that this office has everything it needs to function effectively.

788
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:38,025
But that's not the decision that this council has.

789
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:41,421
We can't just hire, approve the 9-1-1 supervisor.

790
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:45,605
It's been lumped into a large package, and that package has been tabled.

791
01:05:45,665 --> 01:05:59,657
So I'd like to ask the mayor, if the mayor's still here, do you intend to put a standalone 9-1-1 supervisor item before the council, or will a revised appropriation be put before the council to address the issues that we've laid out?

792
01:05:59,677 --> 01:06:01,959
Thank you, Councilor Peers.

793
01:06:02,399 --> 01:06:02,980
Mayor Longo-Kurt.

794
01:06:03,802 --> 01:06:06,063
that we're able to fund that going forward until fiscal year 22.

795
01:06:06,103 --> 01:06:06,983
So that is what we've

796
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:42,217
Dave, I don't know if you have any clarifications on any legalities that need to happen with regard to that, but I think that it's as simple as that.

797
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:45,719
Point of information, Mr. President.

798
01:06:45,779 --> 01:06:47,260
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

799
01:06:47,801 --> 01:07:00,089
I think, and I don't want to speak for my colleague, but I think what he was asking was if the paper for $740,000 was amended or the police supervisor position was sliced out, I don't think you'd get much pushback from this council.

800
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:01,770
I think we all understand that there's a need for that,

801
01:07:02,421 --> 01:07:22,208
Um, the question is whether or not we want to support a supplemental budget for 740 K. Um, and there are some items in there that, um, some of us have concern over and some items in there that some of us, um, uh, some items that aren't in there that some of us have, um, but I think all of us behind this rail would be supportive of a standalone paper to amend the supplemental budget.

802
01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:26,650
Um, so that we didn't have to go through the process of using the existing funds in the police budget.

803
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:29,731
so that we can use those funds to hire the dispatchers that we so need.

804
01:07:30,032 --> 01:07:36,495
We want to hire this police dispatch supervisor, a dispatch center supervisor, so that they can perform in-house training.

805
01:07:37,776 --> 01:07:40,617
If we can't get the training done at the state level, we need to get it done somewhere.

806
01:07:41,198 --> 01:07:43,479
They need to keep their continuing ed certifications up.

807
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:44,840
We've heard from

808
01:07:45,889 --> 01:07:51,256
Lieutenant Rudolph saying that, you know, there's really no one that's in either department that's qualified to perform the functions of training.

809
01:07:52,437 --> 01:07:56,863
So I'm just trying to clarify, Zach, I think that's what you were getting at, right?

810
01:07:56,943 --> 01:08:01,749
Is that if you give us a paper that's for the, you know, whatever it is, $100,000 or whatever that line item was,

811
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:05,233
I don't think the council will stand in the way of that.

812
01:08:05,813 --> 01:08:10,938
Um, that still leaves the argument relative to the other items that the council has been discussing and the other items that are on that paper.

813
01:08:11,439 --> 01:08:17,745
Um, however, you know, I think it'll address the issue of the nine one one call center supervisor, uh, in relatively short order.

814
01:08:20,868 --> 01:08:21,970
Thank you for your point of information.

815
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:22,490
Councilor Knight.

816
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:23,631
Councilor Pierce.

817
01:08:24,631 --> 01:08:26,032
Yeah, well, Councillor Knight's right.

818
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:28,535
I mean, that's one way out of this as one option.

819
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:32,379
And I would think we'd all be happy to vote for approving a standalone paper.

820
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:44,331
I think the other option would be to have a revised paper that reflects the request of this council so that we're not throwing out anything else that's in the appropriation that we might want to approve as well.

821
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:48,475
So it sounds to me like the answer to my question is no.

822
01:08:48,942 --> 01:08:50,804
There isn't an intent to put a standalone paper.

823
01:08:50,844 --> 01:08:52,225
We're going to use existing funds.

824
01:08:53,526 --> 01:09:00,191
Does the administration have any intent to revise supplemental appropriation before this council, before the end of the year?

825
01:09:02,994 --> 01:09:10,400
The supplemental budget has to be approved by tonight because you have your tax classification hearing next week on December 8th.

826
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,844
So for lack of time, we won't be able to put on a separate paper.

827
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:21,494
I'm hopeful that maybe tonight you will take it off the table and discuss the supplemental budget as a whole.

828
01:09:22,154 --> 01:09:24,635
I feel that those are the needs of the community right now.

829
01:09:25,055 --> 01:09:32,979
And I hear you loud and clear that there's an election supervisor position that we are currently working on reviewing.

830
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:43,685
And I have meetings set up as early as next week to continue that review in hopes to make sure we do the best we can for our elections department and city clerk.

831
01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:47,657
So if we don't approve that tonight, what's going to happen?

832
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:53,161
Is the intent just that we will no longer appropriate any of the funds that have been proposed in the supplemental budget?

833
01:09:54,682 --> 01:09:59,245
Since tonight is the last night to approve the supplemental budget, yes, the paper will die.

834
01:09:59,565 --> 01:10:07,810
And the funds will be reverted to free cash after the fiscal year 21 is over.

835
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:10,872
All right.

836
01:10:10,892 --> 01:10:11,673
Thank you, Mr. President.

837
01:10:12,183 --> 01:10:12,983
Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

838
01:10:13,163 --> 01:10:15,424
We have Vice President Caviello and then Councilor Knight.

839
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:16,565
Vice President Caviello.

840
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:17,585
Thank you, Mr. President.

841
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:21,547
And I think Councilor Marks brought up a point earlier in his discussion.

842
01:10:23,087 --> 01:10:32,191
And this is no reflection on this current merit, but why in the beginning when this department was started, why didn't the two chiefs insist on a supervisor?

843
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:36,473
I mean, how do you start a department with no supervision?

844
01:10:38,118 --> 01:10:39,539
I think that's really the biggest question.

845
01:10:39,879 --> 01:10:48,846
This should have been dealt with 15 months ago, right from day one, not at this time when the horse was out of the barn.

846
01:10:50,627 --> 01:11:00,434
As I said, in business, if you're in a business and you start a department up with nobody to run the department, how do you expect that department to ever be successful?

847
01:11:01,055 --> 01:11:03,697
These people have no manuals, no training, nothing.

848
01:11:05,698 --> 01:11:10,060
And again, this is no reflection on this mayor, because she wasn't there for that.

849
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:21,064
But as I said, the two chiefs should have got together and insisted on this way back when this first came out, and not now at this late stage in the game.

850
01:11:24,005 --> 01:11:24,625
Chief Gilberti.

851
01:11:26,246 --> 01:11:27,166
Thank you, Mr. President.

852
01:11:27,186 --> 01:11:27,526
Thank you.

853
01:11:27,546 --> 01:11:29,747
A couple of things I want to touch on.

854
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:46,336
When this whole civilian dispatch began, I was advocating for a fire supervisor.

855
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:58,604
My office training division had oversight of the 911 center for the police side when it was in our building.

856
01:11:59,665 --> 01:12:06,449
Years ago, there used to be a lieutenant who was part of the dispatching crew in the fire

857
01:12:06,841 --> 01:12:07,661
dispatch center.

858
01:12:08,202 --> 01:12:13,725
And when he retired, that position was eliminated and then they were all firefighters.

859
01:12:14,085 --> 01:12:18,147
And it was the supervision of that was taken over by the training division.

860
01:12:18,788 --> 01:12:25,291
So there was always oversight on our side through my training division.

861
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:35,297
But when I was unsuccessful in getting a fire supervisor, that's when Mayor Longo Kern,

862
01:12:36,774 --> 01:12:40,897
we began to talk about a supervisor for the entire center.

863
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:45,841
So it's a little bit more difficult now to have oversight now that they're in the new building.

864
01:12:47,422 --> 01:13:00,612
So having said that, as far as the money paper goes, I just want to, and the mayor can correct me if I'm wrong, I believe a part of that money that's on the paper before you,

865
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:04,093
has to do with repairs to fire stations.

866
01:13:05,374 --> 01:13:18,219
So I would ask that you really consider passing that paper this evening, because a large chunk of that money is going to go towards some major repairs that we have in the outlying stations.

867
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:20,700
That's correct, Chief.

868
01:13:21,253 --> 01:13:21,793
That's correct.

869
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:31,039
The stations, the schools and routine maintenance for our new police station and new library that's coming online over the summer.

870
01:13:31,059 --> 01:13:40,545
200,000 can go a long way along with the facilities director that the council me included when I was on the council advocated for year after year after year.

871
01:13:40,565 --> 01:13:46,089
And I've been asking for that for two, two administrations.

872
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:46,489
Okay.

873
01:13:49,941 --> 01:13:51,142
Thank you, Chief Gilberti.

874
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:54,885
Let's see, Vice President Caviello, did you have any further questions?

875
01:13:55,225 --> 01:13:55,966
Okay, thank you.

876
01:13:56,486 --> 01:13:57,607
Councilor Layton.

877
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:58,968
Mr. President, thank you very much.

878
01:13:59,629 --> 01:14:07,875
The mayor said something relative to the supplemental budget and how if it's not passed this evening, then it dies and the money would revert to free cash come the next fiscal year.

879
01:14:09,316 --> 01:14:17,363
Is there anybody from the administration that can speak to the impact that this will have on our levy limit, our new growth?

880
01:14:18,669 --> 01:14:20,210
for the upcoming fiscal year?

881
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:24,291
I believe we have Alicia- In terms of dollars and cents, Mr. President.

882
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:24,931
Yes.

883
01:14:26,891 --> 01:14:29,092
Alicia, would you like to take that question from Councilor Knight?

884
01:14:30,072 --> 01:14:31,533
Good evening, Honorable Councilors.

885
01:14:31,573 --> 01:14:31,793
Yes.

886
01:14:32,473 --> 01:14:34,814
Through the Chair to Councilor Knight.

887
01:14:34,894 --> 01:14:39,475
So what will happen is we want to raise as much as we can towards the tax levy limit.

888
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:46,297
If this money isn't appropriate to amend the budget, we would have to take it from reserves, which would be free cash.

889
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:52,218
part of the tax rate recap calculation.

890
01:14:52,378 --> 01:15:00,741
So because it's coming from unrestricted government aid as a program to the budget, that's why we would need it to be passed before the tax rate is set.

891
01:15:01,221 --> 01:15:05,803
If you do not pass it, it just means you'd have to appropriate it from free cash.

892
01:15:05,843 --> 01:15:08,304
You could not appropriate it after the tax rate is set.

893
01:15:09,424 --> 01:15:11,785
So it wouldn't apply to the levy limit for the next fiscal year?

894
01:15:13,366 --> 01:15:13,826
It would not.

895
01:15:14,386 --> 01:15:16,907
And is any of this money applying to new growth for the next fiscal year?

896
01:15:18,493 --> 01:15:18,693
No.

897
01:15:19,593 --> 01:15:30,637
We had new growth already certified at the 1.77, which your honorable body rescinded 703,000 back to free cash of the new growth.

898
01:15:31,097 --> 01:15:31,358
Okay.

899
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:32,338
Certified.

900
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:43,562
And this is the unrestricted government aid from local aid that we're trying to use to increase the city budget appropriation for the positions on the paper.

901
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:52,042
and the benefit of increasing the city budget is because it would allow you to have an increased levy limit next fiscal year?

902
01:15:52,062 --> 01:15:56,643
Your levy limit is based on the 2.5% of your previous fiscal year's budget, right?

903
01:15:56,883 --> 01:15:57,763
Plus your new growth.

904
01:15:58,323 --> 01:16:00,644
This paper is just amending the budget.

905
01:16:01,024 --> 01:16:06,606
Whenever you're setting the tax rate, what the tax rate's actually doing is it's raising taxes to pay for the budget that was voted.

906
01:16:07,446 --> 01:16:12,567
So if we amend right now to add more positions to last year's budget,

907
01:16:13,138 --> 01:16:14,839
It has to be raised through the tax rate.

908
01:16:15,059 --> 01:16:18,621
Otherwise, the only other funding source is free cash.

909
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:20,982
Point of information, Mr. President.

910
01:16:21,163 --> 01:16:22,283
Just one second, Michael, if I can.

911
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:29,027
But what I'm saying is if the budget is amended, the levy limit is based upon the previous year's budget, correct?

912
01:16:30,289 --> 01:16:31,229
The levy limit is the 2.5%.

913
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:33,310
How much money we were able to generate?

914
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,070
How much money we spent?

915
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:34,610
Yes, yes.

916
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:42,571
So we had estimated a 10% cut, and because the governor level funded local aid, we have additional aid that we can use towards the budget.

917
01:16:43,111 --> 01:16:44,412
Okay, and what's the total amount?

918
01:16:47,772 --> 01:16:50,933
So for Chapter 70, we had estimated $11,053,769.

919
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:51,353
We actually got $12,143,306.

920
01:16:58,232 --> 01:17:01,934
For unrestricted government aid, we had estimated $11 million.

921
01:17:02,154 --> 01:17:10,299
You can just give me the bottom line for the increase over what we- Okay, so the increase to unrestricted government aid is $963,457.

922
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:11,900
Thank you very much.

923
01:17:12,821 --> 01:17:14,442
Counselor Marks, point of information.

924
01:17:14,482 --> 01:17:16,083
Just a point of information, Mr. President.

925
01:17:16,103 --> 01:17:22,947
It was stated that this paper would die tonight because the tax rate

926
01:17:24,537 --> 01:17:26,658
You can't vote on it after the tax rate's set.

927
01:17:27,798 --> 01:17:29,619
When are we setting the tax rate, Mr. President?

928
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:36,542
We'll have a committee the whole next Tuesday night, and I believe that will be next Tuesday night's agenda, if I'm correct.

929
01:17:37,642 --> 01:17:41,984
So we have another week if the mayor wanted to submit a paper, a revised paper.

930
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:50,127
Withdraw the current $740,000 supplemental amendment amount and submit a revised paper.

931
01:17:51,148 --> 01:17:54,209
The tax rate won't be set before next Tuesday, correct?

932
01:17:55,321 --> 01:17:56,903
That sounds correct to me.

933
01:17:58,024 --> 01:17:59,125
So we do have another week.

934
01:18:00,326 --> 01:18:03,269
The tax rate is set to be set next week.

935
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:05,911
Right.

936
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:10,456
So if we vote on the paper Tuesday night, that'll be prior to us setting the tax rate.

937
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,280
correct?

938
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:16,545
Yeah, but I have to, if you're going to do that, I have to put it into the recap to DLR.

939
01:18:16,585 --> 01:18:18,866
So it's not that simple as you just pass it.

940
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:22,449
I actually have to go in and put numbers into the recap.

941
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:27,774
So I can't do it a few hours, you know, an hour before and then sit and hit submit.

942
01:18:27,914 --> 01:18:29,155
It's not, no.

943
01:18:29,815 --> 01:18:35,100
And when we give you your presentation for the committee of the whole, we have to give you the numbers.

944
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,462
The numbers will change if you voted the paper.

945
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:42,596
So the package we would give you wouldn't be the correct package for the tax rate.

946
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:55,442
Right, so if the mayor submits a new paper next week amended to approve the supervisory position in 911, you know what the dollar amount is already.

947
01:18:56,143 --> 01:19:00,765
This council, I think, has stated, and I won't speak for everyone, a commitment for that paper.

948
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:10,012
I don't see why that can't be done next week, Mr. President, and added into the paperwork that Alicia is saying, because she's right, she probably needs time to do that.

949
01:19:10,072 --> 01:19:15,296
But I think we're able to forecast now, we have a week to forecast that, Mr. President.

950
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,138
I don't see why that can't be done.

951
01:19:19,499 --> 01:19:21,220
I mean, that sounds correct to me.

952
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:24,883
It almost seems like people don't want it done, Mr. President.

953
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:39,017
And Alicia, if I may just kind of throw a wrench into it really quick, but I mean, I think there've been in years past where we've not necessarily set the tax rate on that night of the meeting.

954
01:19:39,037 --> 01:19:41,699
We've, I think, tabled it for a week before in the past.

955
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,922
I mean, so does the tax rate have to be set next Tuesday night?

956
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:47,324
What if it was tabled to the 15th, the next meeting after that?

957
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:51,486
And Alan.

958
01:19:51,506 --> 01:19:57,568
I just noticed that DOR is behind on setting a lot of things.

959
01:19:57,648 --> 01:19:58,849
I've submitted paper.

960
01:19:58,909 --> 01:20:01,429
I've already submitted to them the balance sheet for free cash certification.

961
01:20:01,449 --> 01:20:01,890
They're behind.

962
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,730
They said they're behind trying to set tax rates.

963
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:07,271
So we're a little concerned to be completely honest with you.

964
01:20:08,091 --> 01:20:12,133
I'm not sure if the inundation or why they're moving behind is because of COVID.

965
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:16,694
I can't speak to that, but I'm honestly a little concerned

966
01:20:17,387 --> 01:20:20,430
about pushing our tax rate out too far.

967
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:28,006
Let's see, Council March is all set.

968
01:20:28,487 --> 01:20:32,069
We have Councilor Scarpelli, and then Ellen's waving a hand, so we're gonna call on Ellen next.

969
01:20:32,109 --> 01:20:33,710
So, Councilor Scarpelli.

970
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:48,838
So I know that, obviously, to make it clear, this councilor didn't go put this paper on to get to an unresolved, it seems like this is, like it was being held hostage, now we're discussing the real issue, and that's not the true intent from this councilor.

971
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:52,980
We had concerns about this issue, I wanna make sure that stands alone.

972
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,321
But now that we're talking about it,

973
01:20:55,042 --> 01:20:56,409
Let's go a little bit through the timeline.

974
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,171
We all want what's on that paper.

975
01:20:59,552 --> 01:21:01,894
I think it's important that we get that facilities position in.

976
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:09,700
I think most of those things that we were given some information, the positions without any job descriptions.

977
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:10,901
We got the job descriptions.

978
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:12,663
We understand how important they are.

979
01:21:12,723 --> 01:21:13,583
Everything's in order.

980
01:21:13,924 --> 01:21:15,945
We talked to the Chief of Staff a few weeks ago.

981
01:21:16,526 --> 01:21:19,488
Chief of Staff Rodriguez mentioned that he would set aside $100,000.

982
01:21:20,569 --> 01:21:24,472
I think that one of the scenarios this council brought up is if we could

983
01:21:25,517 --> 01:21:30,703
look at a date certain saying like I believe he said 90 days and he said he would not do that.

984
01:21:31,824 --> 01:21:42,495
So now that we have the mayor on the call and I believe you said that the mayor said that she's already been in discussions moving that position that we're interested in moving it forward.

985
01:21:44,905 --> 01:22:00,724
And I would assume that our committee would support, I think that's what we're going with a few weeks ago, that if it was a date certain that we would support the paper knowing that we're coming to a resolution for the position that's needed in the elections office.

986
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:03,227
If I'm right, if I'm wrong, forgive me, but

987
01:22:04,564 --> 01:22:14,928
Could we possibly look at a date certain this evening saying that the 90 days, I believe that's what the Chief of Staff Rodriguez said, that 90 days is the process.

988
01:22:14,988 --> 01:22:25,232
It looks like, if I could remember it then, but he wouldn't commit to that because he's, I believe that he's not the mayor and he wouldn't do that to the mayor.

989
01:22:25,272 --> 01:22:27,973
So I don't know if maybe the mayor can add some light to that.

990
01:22:28,013 --> 01:22:29,113
If it's not, I understand that.

991
01:22:29,693 --> 01:22:31,635
If she doesn't feel comfortable, that's fine.

992
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:52,090
But if we can have that assurance tonight, I would move this off the table, and I would vote forward with, you know, because from what I gather from Cora Kirby's, we're hoping that three months will give us enough time for our next election, unless the special elections come up after the Georgia runoff.

993
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:55,993
So if you can, Madam Mayor, that'd be appreciative.

994
01:22:56,073 --> 01:22:56,313
Sure.

995
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:57,014
Sure.

996
01:22:57,034 --> 01:22:58,755
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

997
01:23:00,244 --> 01:23:13,352
What I can do is, within three or four months, give you a full report of my review and investigation and let you know what we find with regards to if there is a need for that position.

998
01:23:13,972 --> 01:23:19,055
And that position, three or four months would be far before the next election.

999
01:23:19,556 --> 01:23:21,317
So that's something I can commit to.

1000
01:23:21,837 --> 01:23:28,761
But I can't go and say I will institute an election coordinator when the clerk's office and the

1001
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:33,743
board of registrar voters, it is completely fully staffed.

1002
01:23:34,624 --> 01:23:38,525
And I cannot commit to that until I know that there is 100% need for it.

1003
01:23:39,345 --> 01:23:47,368
If I could use that money for a teacher, a firefighter, a police officer, there's need there.

1004
01:23:47,448 --> 01:23:48,968
There are other departments in this city.

1005
01:23:49,408 --> 01:23:54,390
We have two missing positions that need to be hired in the treasurer's office.

1006
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:57,071
In our assessing office, we have

1007
01:23:57,447 --> 01:23:59,408
the need for an additional assessor.

1008
01:23:59,948 --> 01:24:03,770
Engineering office, need for additional personnel.

1009
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:10,253
Poor Todd Blake, need for our traffic engineer for an assistant.

1010
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:12,674
Diversity, need for an assistant.

1011
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:17,356
My communications director, 18 hour days, need for an assistant.

1012
01:24:17,556 --> 01:24:27,220
There are so many needs in this community that I have to do my due diligence as your mayor to make sure that any position I implement is necessary and

1013
01:24:28,082 --> 01:24:28,982
is the right decision.

1014
01:24:29,362 --> 01:24:30,583
I hear you loud and clear.

1015
01:24:30,723 --> 01:24:31,543
I hear the clerk.

1016
01:24:31,883 --> 01:24:32,744
We had a plan.

1017
01:24:33,244 --> 01:24:37,625
Mr. Rodriguez, Mr. Osborne, Mr. Hertoghese, and myself, we sat.

1018
01:24:37,725 --> 01:24:39,346
We discussed the primary.

1019
01:24:39,426 --> 01:24:45,388
We discussed the issues, the successes, and the setbacks, and how we were going to go and address that.

1020
01:24:45,948 --> 01:24:48,729
After the election was certified, we were going to sit down again.

1021
01:24:48,749 --> 01:24:52,010
And I was going to meet with additional personnel, as well as the board,

1022
01:24:53,081 --> 01:24:54,542
that we need to figure out what the need is.

1023
01:24:54,842 --> 01:25:04,250
There's also other issues that I spoke to many about over the phone that I need to make sure if it's necessary that we have the right person in that position.

1024
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,852
And I want to do what's best for our clerk.

1025
01:25:07,272 --> 01:25:08,073
Believe me, I do.

1026
01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:09,214
I hear you loud and clear.

1027
01:25:09,454 --> 01:25:10,215
But there's a lot.

1028
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:16,540
It's very difficult to manage many, many departments with hundreds of employees and to do the right thing.

1029
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:22,465
And what is absolutely the need of this community, it's my job and I take it very seriously.

1030
01:25:23,621 --> 01:25:31,725
With that being said, I can commit to giving you a review of my investigation within 90 to 120 days, three to four months.

1031
01:25:31,945 --> 01:25:38,588
We can get that done.

1032
01:25:39,828 --> 01:25:40,749
Thank you, Mr. President.

1033
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:45,631
I would hope that it could be done faster than that.

1034
01:25:45,831 --> 01:25:49,353
But in any case, just to Director Nunley-Benjamin,

1035
01:25:51,107 --> 01:26:01,476
If we do not, and this is just going off of what Councilor Knight was saying earlier, if we do not approve the supplemental appropriation, it will not affect the revenues for next fiscal year.

1036
01:26:01,536 --> 01:26:02,157
Is that correct?

1037
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:04,819
That is correct.

1038
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:10,083
What I'm saying is if you don't pass it before the tax rate, then you have to fund it through free cash.

1039
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:10,804
Right.

1040
01:26:10,904 --> 01:26:13,987
And then the free cash would come in at the end of the fiscal year.

1041
01:26:14,407 --> 01:26:14,707
Got it.

1042
01:26:14,767 --> 01:26:17,269
I just wanted to make that clear for myself.

1043
01:26:19,558 --> 01:26:21,638
I think we're still at an impasse, to be quite frank.

1044
01:26:21,878 --> 01:26:22,799
Thank you, Mr. President.

1045
01:26:23,299 --> 01:26:24,359
Thank you, Council of Peers.

1046
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:28,600
Any other questions from the council regarding this issue?

1047
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,541
Okay.

1048
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:35,621
Any other questions out?

1049
01:26:38,041 --> 01:26:39,421
Clerk, do you see anyone with their hand up?

1050
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:41,242
I just want to make sure I don't see anyone, but.

1051
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:43,222
Move approval, place on file.

1052
01:26:45,523 --> 01:26:47,863
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scarapelli.

1053
01:26:49,394 --> 01:26:51,816
You approve the paper and place on file?

1054
01:26:52,757 --> 01:26:54,618
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1055
01:26:55,179 --> 01:27:04,326
Receive and place on file.

1056
01:27:04,346 --> 01:27:06,327
9-1-1, right, it's off of the paper.

1057
01:27:06,407 --> 01:27:08,429
Yeah, so it's 9-1-1, it has nothing to do with the paper.

1058
01:27:08,449 --> 01:27:09,750
Right, 2-0-6-4-7, nothing to do with the table of paper.

1059
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:10,390
Yes, correct.

1060
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:12,572
So on 2-0-6-4-7, on the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly,

1061
01:27:20,262 --> 01:27:20,682
Second.

1062
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:21,983
To approve and place on file.

1063
01:27:22,884 --> 01:27:24,165
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1064
01:27:24,746 --> 01:27:26,087
Clerk Kernanby, please call the roll.

1065
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:30,010
Councilor Behrs?

1066
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:30,350
Yes.

1067
01:27:31,271 --> 01:27:32,091
Vice President Caraballo?

1068
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:32,472
Yes.

1069
01:27:32,912 --> 01:27:33,392
Councilor Knight?

1070
01:27:33,432 --> 01:27:33,712
Yes.

1071
01:27:34,033 --> 01:27:34,573
Councilor Marks?

1072
01:27:34,913 --> 01:27:35,114
Yes.

1073
01:27:35,354 --> 01:27:35,954
Councilor Morrell?

1074
01:27:36,214 --> 01:27:36,475
Yes.

1075
01:27:36,795 --> 01:27:37,475
Councilor Scarpelli?

1076
01:27:37,495 --> 01:27:37,816
Yes.

1077
01:27:37,956 --> 01:27:38,676
President Falco?

1078
01:27:38,776 --> 01:27:39,017
Yes.

1079
01:27:39,177 --> 01:27:40,938
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1080
01:27:41,739 --> 01:27:42,659
The motion passes.

1081
01:27:42,679 --> 01:27:43,600
Suspend the rules, Mr. President.

1082
01:27:44,101 --> 01:27:47,463
On the motion of Councilor Knight to suspend the rules, seconded by?

1083
01:27:48,044 --> 01:27:48,324
Second.

1084
01:27:48,794 --> 01:27:50,896
Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hertoghez, please call the roll.

1085
01:27:54,899 --> 01:27:55,460
Councilor Behrs.

1086
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:55,820
Yes.

1087
01:27:56,221 --> 01:27:57,061
Vice-President Kerrio.

1088
01:27:57,222 --> 01:27:57,502
Yes.

1089
01:27:57,742 --> 01:27:58,222
Councilor Knight.

1090
01:27:58,262 --> 01:27:58,743
Yes.

1091
01:27:58,763 --> 01:27:59,303
Councilor Marks.

1092
01:27:59,564 --> 01:27:59,804
Yes.

1093
01:27:59,984 --> 01:28:00,565
Councilor Morrell.

1094
01:28:00,785 --> 01:28:01,005
Yes.

1095
01:28:01,505 --> 01:28:02,246
Councilor Scarpelli.

1096
01:28:02,306 --> 01:28:02,586
Yes.

1097
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:03,367
President Falco.

1098
01:28:03,527 --> 01:28:03,727
Yes.

1099
01:28:03,767 --> 01:28:05,429
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1100
01:28:05,829 --> 01:28:07,511
The motion passes and the rules are suspended.

1101
01:28:07,531 --> 01:28:08,031
Councilor Knight.

1102
01:28:08,452 --> 01:28:12,836
Mr. President, we have a paper on the agenda this evening, a communication from the mayor, paper 20656.

1103
01:28:12,896 --> 01:28:13,917
I don't think it's too sassy,

1104
01:28:22,513 --> 01:28:25,514
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1105
01:28:25,594 --> 01:28:36,460
Communications from the Mayor, 20656, November 25th, 2020, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

1106
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:51,227
Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council authorize me, as Mayor, on behalf of the City of Medford, to enter into a tax increment financing, TIF, TIF,

1107
01:28:51,827 --> 01:29:04,025
agreement with Monogram Gourmet Foods LLC in accordance with the Massachusetts Economic Development Incentive Program, EDIP, and Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 23A, Chapter 40, Section 59, and Chapter 59.

1108
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:25,195
I will be present at the meeting with members of the administration, Chief Assessor Ellen Bordeaux, Jeffrey Monica from Monogram Gourmet Foods, and Maria DeStefano from the Massachusetts Office of Business Development to discuss the agreement as well as Monogram Gourmet Foods plan for the proposed operation in the city of Medford.

1109
01:29:25,615 --> 01:29:27,475
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1110
01:29:27,856 --> 01:29:29,576
Sincerely, Brianna Longo Kern, Mayor.

1111
01:29:30,356 --> 01:29:31,016
Mayor Longo Kern.

1112
01:29:32,077 --> 01:29:36,738
Thank you very much, President Falco, and thank you, Councilor Knight, for moving suspension of the rules.

1113
01:29:37,855 --> 01:29:41,977
We have our assessor on to answer questions, Ellen Burdeaux.

1114
01:29:42,037 --> 01:29:45,419
We have Alicia Nunley, our finance director, on as well.

1115
01:29:45,579 --> 01:29:46,320
We have Ms.

1116
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:52,663
Hunt, Office of Community Development, is present, as well as Jeff Monica and Maria DeStefano.

1117
01:29:52,703 --> 01:29:57,845
So I want to take you through this slideshow with the help of the team.

1118
01:29:59,306 --> 01:30:06,030
Monogram Gourmet Foods LLC, this is a proposed, as I said,

1119
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:20,220
For the past several weeks, the administration has been in discussions with Monogram Gourmet Foods LLC, located, hopefully, at 300 Middlesex Ave, which is the old Whole Foods Bakery site.

1120
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:26,485
This is the site in front of BJ's Wholesale across from Dunkin' Donuts on Middlesex Ave.

1121
01:30:27,266 --> 01:30:35,212
Monogram Foods has been looking at several sites, including additional locations in Massachusetts, and we are one of those sites.

1122
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:48,155
If Monogram comes to Medford, they're going to be putting $40 million into the property as well as providing 250 new jobs to the community with Medford residents having preference.

1123
01:30:49,056 --> 01:30:55,780
We are seeking a 10-year tax increment finance agreement with Monogram if the council approves this tonight.

1124
01:30:59,505 --> 01:31:00,445
Mr. President?

1125
01:31:01,046 --> 01:31:07,529
The property right now, you'll see on the screen, this is the location, this is the condition the property is in.

1126
01:31:08,109 --> 01:31:14,212
Currently, it's generating about $118,000 in taxes each year.

1127
01:31:15,552 --> 01:31:22,896
With no improvements and without Monogram Foods, we would be estimating the taxes that we would bring in at about $150,890 by the year 2031.

1128
01:31:29,728 --> 01:31:42,639
At this point, I can turn it over to Mr. Monica, if you have any questions with regards to the improvements, the $40 million in improvements that will be brought to this property if this agreement is approved.

1129
01:31:44,321 --> 01:31:46,242
Or Jeff, if you wanna just elaborate a bit.

1130
01:31:46,262 --> 01:31:48,164
I just have one quick question before you pass it off, Mr. President.

1131
01:31:48,184 --> 01:31:50,686
We have a question, Councilor Morrell first, and then Councilor Nye.

1132
01:31:50,706 --> 01:31:51,287
Councilor Morrell?

1133
01:31:55,143 --> 01:32:03,185
I just heard if Monogram Foods comes here as opposed to is Monogram Foods coming here or is it contingent upon whether or not we give them this tax incremented financing?

1134
01:32:04,605 --> 01:32:16,488
I mean I'd hate to see us pass it and have them shopping around from city to city to city and then say wherever they get the best deal they're gonna go but we're making a commitment to them is there a commitment back you know I mean that this is where they want to be or is this a shopping spree?

1135
01:32:17,508 --> 01:32:20,929
No I believe there's there is a commitment and I can let Mr. Monica

1136
01:32:21,539 --> 01:32:22,600
explain further.

1137
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:23,140
Thank you.

1138
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:23,500
Yes.

1139
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:23,900
Thank you.

1140
01:32:24,521 --> 01:32:24,901
Thank you.

1141
01:32:24,961 --> 01:32:26,202
My name is Jeff Monica.

1142
01:32:26,282 --> 01:32:30,684
I'm the vice president of warehousing and logistics for Monogram Foods.

1143
01:32:30,704 --> 01:32:40,389
We're based in Memphis, Tennessee, where I currently reside and appreciate the opportunity to appear before the council and the mayor this evening.

1144
01:32:40,449 --> 01:32:43,071
And I'll be happy to answer any specific questions.

1145
01:32:43,231 --> 01:32:47,073
The question appears that, you know, this facility

1146
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:49,934
would meet our needs.

1147
01:32:50,095 --> 01:32:56,939
Our decision to make this our site is contingent upon the TIF award.

1148
01:32:56,999 --> 01:33:04,364
It is critical to help us with our investment of approximately $40 million in the facility.

1149
01:33:04,984 --> 01:33:09,407
It is our preferred site for a couple of reasons.

1150
01:33:09,747 --> 01:33:10,848
We want to operate

1151
01:33:11,368 --> 01:33:14,689
and open a state-of-the-art USDA bakery.

1152
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:20,131
And in combination, a USDA bakery is unique.

1153
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:32,096
There aren't many of them in the United States that allows us to do unique products with meats and proteins that aren't available in a normal FDA bakery like the Whole Foods bakery.

1154
01:33:32,176 --> 01:33:35,777
So we need this facility to support our rapid growth.

1155
01:33:35,837 --> 01:33:37,098
We have two other plants.

1156
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:40,279
in Wilmington, Massachusetts.

1157
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:44,161
So we have been a strong employer within the state of Massachusetts.

1158
01:33:44,881 --> 01:34:02,308
This is going to involve the complete renovation of the bakery, which is detailed in our application, but it's a complete renovation of the walls, the floors, the HVAC, the refrigeration system, complete floor drain systems, as well as

1159
01:34:02,928 --> 01:34:09,670
the installation of a state-of-the-art continuous bakery oven product, oven equipment, I should say.

1160
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,471
So it's all new equipment.

1161
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:16,913
It's an substantial investment for Monogram Foods in the range of $40 million.

1162
01:34:17,493 --> 01:34:25,316
We anticipate employing over 250 employees after the facility is up and running with two full shifts.

1163
01:34:25,436 --> 01:34:32,458
We have been told by the city that there is an experienced pool of bakery employees with experience

1164
01:34:32,998 --> 01:34:37,182
either with Whole Foods or other previous tenants of this facility.

1165
01:34:37,662 --> 01:34:48,092
So we are excited about that opportunity to put 250 employees to work, are back to work if they were employed previously, and particularly with experience in a bakery.

1166
01:34:48,132 --> 01:34:49,533
So that is a positive.

1167
01:34:49,954 --> 01:34:56,440
And one of the reasons why this would be a primary location, as well as we have a substantial commitment

1168
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:03,386
within Massachusetts, and this would fit well with this, with our other two plants that we currently have.

1169
01:35:03,646 --> 01:35:09,492
So I'll pause there, Mayor, and hopefully that answered Councilor's question.

1170
01:35:10,633 --> 01:35:12,234
Thank you very much, Mr. Monaco.

1171
01:35:14,196 --> 01:35:14,897
Next slide, please.

1172
01:35:17,574 --> 01:35:18,434
to be able to do that.

1173
01:35:18,454 --> 01:35:20,915
Mister Rodriguez, do you want to explain this one?

1174
01:35:20,935 --> 01:35:29,639
background for folks watching at home or on the zoom that are familiar with tax increment financing agreements and kind of mechanics of how they work.

1175
01:35:30,059 --> 01:35:34,421
So they're public-private partnerships that are used to encourage redevelopment or development in the community.

1176
01:35:34,921 --> 01:35:38,542
The tax incentives only realize that the developer makes the investment.

1177
01:35:39,003 --> 01:35:39,883
It's made in that there's

1178
01:35:42,764 --> 01:35:49,588
So as you can see on the chart here, in the blue area that's marked as number one, this is the property taxes before the investment, what we call our base value.

1179
01:35:50,168 --> 01:35:57,372
And so on the spreadsheet that you'll see in just a little bit, the base value that we see is just under $6.5 million.

1180
01:35:57,812 --> 01:35:59,133
That's a base tax level.

1181
01:35:59,173 --> 01:36:02,115
We're always derived taxes on the taxable level for that amount.

1182
01:36:03,085 --> 01:36:05,307
that's the area that the exemption would apply to.

1183
01:36:05,327 --> 01:36:06,689
So anything that's

1184
01:36:26,068 --> 01:36:27,249
That's your increment finance.

1185
01:36:27,869 --> 01:36:29,930
So that's the, that's where the exemption would apply.

1186
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:36,034
And that's, we have some, some analyses that were sent over to the council previously that kind of map out how we think that's going to go.

1187
01:36:36,454 --> 01:36:43,098
But that's the area that would, would receive the tax exemption as, as agreed to in principle with bottom line.

1188
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:45,819
it's only good for the duration of the agreement.

1189
01:36:45,839 --> 01:36:47,340
So this agreement is for 10 years.

1190
01:36:48,241 --> 01:36:54,484
After that 10 year period, the entire value of the property comes online and is taxed at the regular value with no exemption.

1191
01:36:55,045 --> 01:36:58,587
So I know Maria DeStefano from MOBD is on the call as well.

1192
01:36:58,627 --> 01:36:59,787
She's a tremendous resource.

1193
01:36:59,827 --> 01:37:07,592
I know that a couple of folks have spoken with her about the TIF process and the TIF structure and kind of the state role in the EDIP program.

1194
01:37:08,332 --> 01:37:16,394
So if she wants to add in anything that I may have missed, which I'm sure is plenty, as well as Ellen Purdell, please feel free, Ellen and Maria.

1195
01:37:22,716 --> 01:37:23,336
Thank you, David.

1196
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:25,097
Actually, you did an excellent job.

1197
01:37:26,617 --> 01:37:28,578
The blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while.

1198
01:37:29,978 --> 01:37:36,180
Now, be careful, because if we're missing a regional director, I think I know where to find one.

1199
01:37:44,795 --> 01:37:44,915
that.

1200
01:37:44,975 --> 01:37:45,516
Thank you.

1201
01:37:45,596 --> 01:37:48,902
Do you want to the next slide, Dave?

1202
01:37:48,922 --> 01:37:49,483
I think we have

1203
01:37:58,295 --> 01:38:01,657
That's an excellent overview of what a TIF does for the community.

1204
01:38:03,258 --> 01:38:05,780
And truly, we have a baseline.

1205
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:15,706
Keeping commercial properties in Medford and growing commercial properties is what we need to do to stabilize the diversity of the tax base.

1206
01:38:16,046 --> 01:38:18,307
And so this is definitely a win for the city.

1207
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:27,473
This slide shows you the proposed TIF agreement terms, and it

1208
01:38:27,952 --> 01:38:33,275
It breaks down the percentage of the exemption over the course of the 10 years.

1209
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:39,158
It also breaks down the personal property exemption schedule 10% from year 1 to 5 and 0% year 6 to 10.

1210
01:38:46,031 --> 01:38:47,012
And I just admire that.

1211
01:38:48,213 --> 01:38:57,541
So the reason that it was broken down as such is because of the breakdown of the investment that's being made by Monogram and a cross section between building improvements as well as equipment improvements.

1212
01:38:57,961 --> 01:38:59,482
So we wanted this agreement.

1213
01:38:59,562 --> 01:39:06,548
We want the city's offer to be assertive, not overly aggressive, but to be assertive and welcoming to the investor.

1214
01:39:07,549 --> 01:39:10,512
If these conditions aren't met and we have every expectation that they will be met,

1215
01:39:11,032 --> 01:39:15,996
there is the option for the state to decertify the agreement through the EIP process and through the AEACC.

1216
01:39:16,777 --> 01:39:29,728
So, you know, God forbid that, you know, when the investment doesn't hit the projected value or the jobs aren't met, we will be able to go to the state and ask them to decertify that, the agreement and bring the value of the property back online.

1217
01:39:30,362 --> 01:39:33,884
with every TIF, there's a but-for test that's applied.

1218
01:39:33,984 --> 01:39:39,666
So the but-for that goes, so monogram will come if they get the agreement, but they won't come if they don't.

1219
01:39:39,966 --> 01:39:49,811
So that's kind of how it falls down to it.

1220
01:39:49,831 --> 01:39:52,772
This slide shows you the value to the city of Medford.

1221
01:39:52,912 --> 01:39:57,374
So if you take the total real estate tax revenue to the city from 2022 to

1222
01:39:59,434 --> 01:40:01,116
$1,421,000.

1223
01:39:59,454 --> 01:40:01,116
With this TIF agreement, including the

1224
01:40:25,427 --> 01:40:27,889
total of 3 million 432,000 and then a total property tax revenue $2,040,972.

1225
01:40:27,929 --> 01:40:33,854
The exemptions would be the $668,000 and that would bring a total tax paid from 2022 to 2031 $5,473,273, which would be an increase in tax revenue

1226
01:40:51,084 --> 01:40:55,727
over that 10 year span of over $4 million to the city of Medford.

1227
01:41:00,531 --> 01:41:14,681
This just breaks it down a little bit further, and I know the council was provided this prior to this meeting, because I know it's a lot to digest, but we did want you to have all of this prior to, and we're happy to answer any other questions.

1228
01:41:15,932 --> 01:41:16,493
that you have.

1229
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:19,435
Mr. President, we have a number of council questions.

1230
01:41:19,895 --> 01:41:25,840
We have Councilor Morrell, Vice President Caviello, Councilor Marks, Councilor Night, Council Bates.

1231
01:41:27,482 --> 01:41:28,162
Councilor Morrell.

1232
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:29,343
Thank you, Mr. President.

1233
01:41:29,363 --> 01:41:31,605
Yeah, I have a number of questions.

1234
01:41:31,865 --> 01:41:40,012
First of all, we're looking, I guess, the main incentive to the community that is being touted, or really the only incentive, is the 250 permanent jobs.

1235
01:41:40,072 --> 01:41:42,134
What type of wages are we looking at for these jobs?

1236
01:41:45,356 --> 01:41:46,498
If I could address it, yeah.

1237
01:41:46,838 --> 01:41:51,565
These wages are in the approximate $20 an hour wage.

1238
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:58,215
That includes full benefits, health insurance, and participation in the retirement plan.

1239
01:41:59,132 --> 01:41:59,792
Okay, thank you.

1240
01:41:59,872 --> 01:42:08,095
And then the permanent in this terminology, obviously it's not contract work, but what does permanent mean?

1241
01:42:08,115 --> 01:42:15,458
That's the entirety of the 10-year agreement or just to your best ability to keep these jobs that are being promised?

1242
01:42:19,446 --> 01:42:22,049
Is that a question for me, Dave, or is that?

1243
01:42:22,189 --> 01:42:23,430
I'm not sure whoever can answer it.

1244
01:42:23,931 --> 01:42:26,373
Yeah, I think it's 250 jobs.

1245
01:42:26,393 --> 01:42:31,979
That's the labor force that they need to maintain throughout the life of the agreement.

1246
01:42:32,019 --> 01:42:33,300
I think Maria had her hand up as well.

1247
01:42:33,661 --> 01:42:34,181
I'm sorry, you're saying?

1248
01:42:34,201 --> 01:42:42,730
Yeah, just a quick addition to that is, so when the state talks about full-time jobs, I'm sorry, when we talk about jobs created,

1249
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:46,753
we're only talking about full-time job, not equivalents or part-time.

1250
01:42:47,353 --> 01:42:53,918
Okay, and I'm sorry, the chief of staff's point, I believe it was, so these do need to, are required to be maintained for the 10 years?

1251
01:42:55,933 --> 01:42:56,133
Okay.

1252
01:42:56,634 --> 01:42:56,914
Thank you.

1253
01:42:56,954 --> 01:42:57,114
Yes.

1254
01:42:57,735 --> 01:42:57,915
Yes.

1255
01:42:58,615 --> 01:43:01,117
Um, and then, uh, another question.

1256
01:43:01,257 --> 01:43:03,699
Just, I don't, forgive me.

1257
01:43:03,759 --> 01:43:09,804
I do not know what unique meats and proteins mean when it comes to, to bakery products.

1258
01:43:10,225 --> 01:43:13,027
And we're talking about something that runs continually.

1259
01:43:13,067 --> 01:43:14,008
So 24 hours a day.

1260
01:43:14,468 --> 01:43:21,054
Is there any impact as far as, you know, smell exhaust odors, you know, to the, to the dense neighborhoods that surround this?

1261
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,803
No, that's a great question.

1262
01:43:24,843 --> 01:43:27,207
First of all, let me, I can bring this home.

1263
01:43:27,607 --> 01:43:31,973
Two of our largest customers are large coffee companies.

1264
01:43:32,474 --> 01:43:38,122
One starts with the letter S and the other one starts with the letter D and it's Duncan.

1265
01:43:39,043 --> 01:43:46,248
So if you've ever had the pleasure of having a ham and cheese croissant at a Dunkin Donuts, that is probably our croissant.

1266
01:43:46,748 --> 01:43:52,152
So it's got ham and cheese combined as opposed to just a bakery croissant with butter.

1267
01:43:52,532 --> 01:43:55,254
So that hopefully that explains what I mean by the proteins.

1268
01:43:55,634 --> 01:44:01,177
No, there are no odorous orders that will permeate in the community.

1269
01:44:01,638 --> 01:44:04,720
There is no other than normal sanitation

1270
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:07,801
There are no hazardous chemicals involved.

1271
01:44:08,481 --> 01:44:11,162
There will be no noise, big noise issues.

1272
01:44:11,522 --> 01:44:15,783
We do plan on operating two full shifts, two full time shifts.

1273
01:44:15,823 --> 01:44:26,586
So there will be activity for approximately, I'm going to say 18 hours of a 24 hour day, primarily Monday through Friday with some Saturday work as well.

1274
01:44:27,871 --> 01:44:28,091
Okay.

1275
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:28,531
Thank you.

1276
01:44:28,611 --> 01:44:35,515
And then if I guess someone from the city or yourself as well, what is remind me that the square footage of this actual facility?

1277
01:44:39,297 --> 01:44:42,559
I believe it's approximately 65,000 square feet.

1278
01:44:43,279 --> 01:44:44,480
I don't have that in front of me.

1279
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:45,270
Okay.

1280
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:47,231
So either to yourself or representative to the city.

1281
01:44:47,291 --> 01:45:06,760
So this would qualify under the requirements of the solar ordinance that was recently passed in the city that I believe the qualifying part of this is that non-residential or residential projects which involve the substantial rehabilitation of a structure containing 10,000 square feet or more, a floor area,

1282
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:18,905
or the addition of 10,000 square feet or more of the growth floor area would be required to have the, I believe, 50% solar on the building.

1283
01:45:18,965 --> 01:45:19,485
Is that correct?

1284
01:45:19,505 --> 01:45:22,827
Can someone from the city confirm that, or have you been looped into this?

1285
01:45:26,288 --> 01:45:27,689
I know Alicia Hunt is on the call.

1286
01:45:28,209 --> 01:45:29,329
She might be able to answer the question.

1287
01:45:29,349 --> 01:45:30,590
The building commissioner isn't on the call.

1288
01:45:31,755 --> 01:45:39,202
I would definitely want Paul Moki, our building commissioner, to confirm it.

1289
01:45:39,242 --> 01:45:55,418
What is the definition of rehabilitation or renovation, major renovation of a building, which may qualify it, which would mean that they'd be required to submit to us an assessment of the ability to put solar on the roof of the building.

1290
01:45:56,658 --> 01:46:13,642
And then if the assessment shows that the building could handle solar with no additional structural other than what was already part of the rehabilitation, then we would ask them to move forward with the solar on up to 50% of the roof area.

1291
01:46:17,544 --> 01:46:19,766
which do monogram foods.

1292
01:46:19,866 --> 01:46:28,074
We've found that many large businesses have found that to be a very lucrative and profitable thing for them to be doing in our region.

1293
01:46:29,295 --> 01:46:38,865
But I would want Paul Moki to confirm whether what they are proposing qualifies under the rehabilitation portion of that ordinance.

1294
01:46:39,668 --> 01:46:40,088
Okay, thank you.

1295
01:46:40,128 --> 01:46:44,091
I mean, I would hope that $40 million counts as substantial rehabilitation.

1296
01:46:44,691 --> 01:46:53,896
So I'm just curious to Mr. Modica, is this $40 million inclusive of potentially a solar array, should it be deemed possible?

1297
01:46:53,976 --> 01:47:01,681
Or are there any other sustainability improvements that are included in this proposed $40 million rehabilitation?

1298
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,961
I'm, I'm not aware.

1299
01:47:05,221 --> 01:47:10,522
I'm not aware of any specific solar modifications planned for this.

1300
01:47:10,643 --> 01:47:14,464
We're in our final construction forecasting.

1301
01:47:14,504 --> 01:47:19,406
No work has started obviously because there's approvals not been granted at this point.

1302
01:47:19,446 --> 01:47:25,128
So I can't answer if there's been any specific, I will tell you the monogram foods is a very green conscious company.

1303
01:47:26,008 --> 01:47:29,169
In our other eight facilities across the country, we have,

1304
01:47:30,169 --> 01:47:34,291
a methane digester system in Martinsville, Virginia.

1305
01:47:34,752 --> 01:47:38,454
We have solar gardens in Minnesota with Xcel Energy.

1306
01:47:38,474 --> 01:47:40,655
I personally worked on that project.

1307
01:47:40,995 --> 01:47:43,736
So we would be supportive of that.

1308
01:47:44,016 --> 01:47:47,278
Obviously it would be contingent upon the amount of investment.

1309
01:47:47,718 --> 01:47:48,859
it would take to do that.

1310
01:47:49,039 --> 01:48:06,528
And if that has an economic return, obviously, if it's a city ordinance or state law that we would have to comply with, we would ask that we'd be given the opportunity to review the regulations and the expected costs, but we're all, we are supportive of green energy.

1311
01:48:06,789 --> 01:48:07,149
So yes.

1312
01:48:07,935 --> 01:48:08,715
we're going to look at that.

1313
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:10,456
But we have not today.

1314
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:11,356
Okay.

1315
01:48:11,576 --> 01:48:11,936
Thank you.

1316
01:48:12,436 --> 01:48:18,998
And then my final question, if the chief of staff could confirm this, and I did, I had the opportunity to speak with Maria yesterday as well.

1317
01:48:19,778 --> 01:48:30,921
When presenting the benefit of this project tax-wise to the city, it is under the assumption that this benefit of $3 million is if no other company were to come in and not ask for a TIF, correct?

1318
01:48:30,941 --> 01:48:32,021
Correct.

1319
01:48:32,741 --> 01:48:32,961
Okay.

1320
01:48:33,201 --> 01:48:33,542
Thank you.

1321
01:48:33,942 --> 01:48:34,362
That's all I have.

1322
01:48:35,525 --> 01:48:36,586
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1323
01:48:36,947 --> 01:48:38,068
Vice President Carvio.

1324
01:48:38,168 --> 01:48:38,829
Thank you, Mr. President.

1325
01:48:38,849 --> 01:48:44,236
Thank you, Mr. Monica, for coming here and considering our community with your company.

1326
01:48:44,276 --> 01:48:50,944
Now, the $40 million you're talking about, that also includes the buying of the property, correct?

1327
01:48:51,144 --> 01:48:52,606
We are leasing the property.

1328
01:48:55,826 --> 01:48:58,508
Yeah, we're just going to be a tenant of the property.

1329
01:48:58,548 --> 01:49:06,792
It is owned by Medford Bakery Realty LLC is going to be the continued owner.

1330
01:49:06,812 --> 01:49:08,553
I believe they're the owner of record today.

1331
01:49:09,274 --> 01:49:10,695
And how long will you lease me for?

1332
01:49:10,715 --> 01:49:10,835
50 years.

1333
01:49:10,855 --> 01:49:10,875
5-0?

1334
01:49:16,055 --> 01:49:21,678
Yes, it's a 20-year lease with six five-year options.

1335
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:28,042
So a 50-year commitment, which is very similar to the other commitments we have made in our other plants.

1336
01:49:28,082 --> 01:49:31,604
We're a long-term player in the food space.

1337
01:49:33,565 --> 01:49:42,590
And you did say you're only going to operate two shifts because I know Whole Foods, when they were in their bread and circus, they operated a 24-hour facility, correct?

1338
01:49:44,446 --> 01:49:47,747
And you're only going to operate two shifts, correct?

1339
01:49:49,048 --> 01:49:51,848
Our current plan is to operate two shifts.

1340
01:49:51,949 --> 01:49:57,890
As business volume needs dictated, we could go to a 24-7 operation.

1341
01:49:58,711 --> 01:50:04,113
But we would prefer to commit to what we can deliver and not over promise at this point.

1342
01:50:04,853 --> 01:50:07,414
And you mentioned about the jobs.

1343
01:50:07,694 --> 01:50:11,235
Are these union jobs or just jobs paid through your company?

1344
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:15,813
They are not currently union jobs.

1345
01:50:17,034 --> 01:50:20,318
We do have union representation in our other plants.

1346
01:50:20,878 --> 01:50:21,659
Okay.

1347
01:50:21,839 --> 01:50:26,084
And how many trucks are you going to have at this facility?

1348
01:50:27,965 --> 01:50:34,312
Well, by trucks, do you mean trucks that monogram gourmet foods would operate?

1349
01:50:34,592 --> 01:50:34,833
Yes.

1350
01:50:35,855 --> 01:50:36,855
Yeah.

1351
01:50:37,475 --> 01:50:42,997
That's to be determined, but I would estimate that we'll probably operate three transfer trucks.

1352
01:50:44,257 --> 01:50:50,239
The finished product produced there, there is a small freezer, about 1300 pallet locations.

1353
01:50:50,739 --> 01:50:55,920
Our customers normally pick up at our plant and they use common carriers in most cases.

1354
01:50:55,960 --> 01:51:03,082
So there, our own assets would probably be three to four trucks to move ingredients between our warehouses.

1355
01:51:03,642 --> 01:51:05,804
and our other plants into here and out of there.

1356
01:51:05,904 --> 01:51:13,010
We currently ship a lot of our products out of a cold storage, public cold storage located down in Taunton.

1357
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:16,213
Okay, and will those trucks be registered here in Medford?

1358
01:51:17,691 --> 01:51:22,914
Yes, they would be, and those would be part of the employment base of our employees.

1359
01:51:22,974 --> 01:51:29,838
And when I, I should clarify the $20 an hour wages, that's for the hourly production workers.

1360
01:51:29,919 --> 01:51:35,762
We would obviously have supervisors, managers, and a plant manager and a management team as well.

1361
01:51:35,862 --> 01:51:43,787
So there's a lot of, quite a few higher level paying jobs, management jobs within this plant facility.

1362
01:51:44,668 --> 01:51:46,289
And how many,

1363
01:51:47,512 --> 01:51:53,235
How many vehicles will be coming and going off the property during the working hours of the day?

1364
01:51:55,677 --> 01:52:09,985
Well, if we took the 250 employees and assumed that 80% of those were- Well, I mean, aside from the employees, I mean, commercial grade trucks coming in there.

1365
01:52:12,507 --> 01:52:13,568
How many commercial grade trucks?

1366
01:52:15,356 --> 01:52:17,158
That's a little hard to determine.

1367
01:52:17,218 --> 01:52:21,101
The facility we believe has operating flower silos.

1368
01:52:21,621 --> 01:52:24,524
So that cuts down the amount of dock unloading.

1369
01:52:24,584 --> 01:52:27,767
We'll be able to bulk fill the flower tanks and such.

1370
01:52:27,827 --> 01:52:40,858
So I'm going to guess, I'm going to estimate maybe three to four trucks a day unloading materials, finished goods, probably three to four, maybe as many as six picking up product a day, finished goods.

1371
01:52:42,091 --> 01:52:43,872
It seems to be less than we were doing there before.

1372
01:52:44,392 --> 01:52:47,914
And again, I want to thank the mayor for bringing this forward.

1373
01:52:47,954 --> 01:52:52,497
I think projects like this are always good for the community to hear about them.

1374
01:52:52,557 --> 01:52:57,499
And it's a good private-public partnership.

1375
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,982
So I look forward to possibly having you in our community.

1376
01:53:03,775 --> 01:53:06,677
If I could add one more comment, I forgot to mention.

1377
01:53:07,237 --> 01:53:15,341
One of the other things that Monogram Foods does, we believe in giving back to our communities where we have plants and employees.

1378
01:53:15,401 --> 01:53:22,465
And we have a charitable 501C3 Monogram Loves Kids Foundation, which is independent of the company.

1379
01:53:23,065 --> 01:53:31,610
And last year we gave almost $600,000 worth of grants to our six different communities, cities where we have plants.

1380
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:40,836
And those funds or grants are given to organizations to support children, whether it's the boys and girls clubs, a variety of things.

1381
01:53:41,016 --> 01:53:49,022
And the decisions of where that money is given back to the community of Medford would be made by the local management staff.

1382
01:53:49,142 --> 01:53:51,944
None of us in Memphis have any say over that.

1383
01:53:52,024 --> 01:53:54,546
So we want to be an employer of choice.

1384
01:53:55,086 --> 01:53:56,948
We want to be a good corporate citizen.

1385
01:53:57,648 --> 01:54:02,411
And we want to support the community, the children of the community, where that makes sense.

1386
01:54:02,471 --> 01:54:05,574
So that's part of the culture of Monogram Foods.

1387
01:54:05,634 --> 01:54:07,695
We are a rapidly growing company.

1388
01:54:08,195 --> 01:54:15,120
The plant in Wilmington, when we bought it five years ago, was doing $25 million in revenue.

1389
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:19,803
This year, it will do over $150 million in revenue.

1390
01:54:19,863 --> 01:54:21,665
So we have the opportunity to grow.

1391
01:54:22,425 --> 01:54:29,489
And we are thankful that Medford is considering supporting us and our growth in your fine city, so.

1392
01:54:30,149 --> 01:54:35,112
Thank you, and I appreciate the fact that you're looking to be a good neighbor and contribute to the community.

1393
01:54:36,233 --> 01:54:37,513
Thank you, Vice President Carvio.

1394
01:54:37,553 --> 01:54:38,194
Councilor Marks.

1395
01:54:40,335 --> 01:54:42,816
Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank the

1396
01:54:44,845 --> 01:54:50,267
Mr. President, I have a few questions on the same line as Councilor Caviello.

1397
01:54:51,388 --> 01:54:59,911
Can you get a little more specific on the types of trucks that will be entering and exiting your particular facility?

1398
01:55:00,472 --> 01:55:01,932
Are we looking at 18 wheelers?

1399
01:55:02,392 --> 01:55:04,093
Are we looking at refrigerated trucks?

1400
01:55:04,553 --> 01:55:05,694
What type of truck?

1401
01:55:07,469 --> 01:55:15,699
It would be a traditional Class 8 semi-tractor, most likely 53-foot refrigerated trailers.

1402
01:55:15,759 --> 01:55:21,786
The majority of the bakery products are produced and shipped frozen.

1403
01:55:22,427 --> 01:55:30,614
So reefer trailers, we anticipate live loading, which means we will load that trailer, they'll back up, we load it and they leave.

1404
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:34,657
We're not going to be leaving trailers idling on the lot.

1405
01:55:34,797 --> 01:55:39,261
As I said earlier, we're not a noisy business from that perspective.

1406
01:55:39,981 --> 01:55:48,388
We have a 1300 pallet freezer that's inside the building that if we retrofit it, should meet our needs for inside storage.

1407
01:55:49,125 --> 01:55:53,726
So class eight tractors, 53 foot trailers are the equipment.

1408
01:55:54,906 --> 01:56:02,167
Okay, and you're aware that you have residential neighbors on both sides, correct?

1409
01:56:03,527 --> 01:56:03,788
Yes.

1410
01:56:04,728 --> 01:56:18,290
Okay, and regarding your plant that after full build out, compared to what's there currently, how much more manufacturing will be done on that site?

1411
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:21,874
I don't have, yeah.

1412
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:24,541
Could you give us a rough percentage?

1413
01:56:26,304 --> 01:56:30,325
I don't have, I don't know how much business Whole Foods was doing out of there.

1414
01:56:30,345 --> 01:56:33,286
We're not privy to that confidential information.

1415
01:56:34,247 --> 01:56:38,688
I can tell you that, and our revenue is we're a privately held company.

1416
01:56:39,088 --> 01:56:46,230
So I would tell you we're going to be producing probably more poundage, more annual poundage than was produced before.

1417
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:49,532
I don't know why Whole Foods closed that bakery down.

1418
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:53,693
It was part of the Amazon acquisition is what I believe we heard.

1419
01:56:54,153 --> 01:57:03,337
through the trade industry, so I would anticipate us to be producing more annual pounds once we're up to full speed than was previously produced there.

1420
01:57:04,178 --> 01:57:08,420
Okay, and did you state that you do both retail and wholesale?

1421
01:57:10,233 --> 01:57:13,095
Yeah, well, I would say we do retail food service.

1422
01:57:14,377 --> 01:57:18,000
Some of our largest customers are large consumer.

1423
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:20,282
We produce products for ConAgra Foods.

1424
01:57:20,842 --> 01:57:26,587
We produce products in Wilmington for B&G Foods, which is the Green Giant brand.

1425
01:57:27,007 --> 01:57:34,493
If you've ever had their, or your children have had their breaded vegetables, cauliflower and broccoli, we produce that product in Wilmington.

1426
01:57:34,513 --> 01:57:39,097
So both food service and retail grocery, we are not a branded company.

1427
01:57:39,137 --> 01:57:43,180
You will not find Monogram branded foods in your local grocery store.

1428
01:57:45,097 --> 01:57:48,819
Okay, so regarding, get back to the trucks.

1429
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:57,063
Are you aware that there are many surrounding roads where you're located that do not accept heavy trucking?

1430
01:58:00,435 --> 01:58:05,459
Well, we are aware that there are streets that do have weight restrictions.

1431
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:11,704
I guess I'll have to defer to our operations team and we can look further into that.

1432
01:58:11,744 --> 01:58:18,170
Were there problems in the past with ingress and egress of trucks into the site when it was Whole Foods Bakery?

1433
01:58:18,742 --> 01:58:28,408
Well, that's a tough question to answer because as you just alluded to, you're not sure what the older capacity was at the existing site.

1434
01:58:29,209 --> 01:58:31,830
And it seems like you're going to be growing the site.

1435
01:58:32,571 --> 01:58:35,633
And I could just tell you from a first hand experience that

1436
01:58:36,353 --> 01:58:40,636
The Felsway, many of your class A trucks cannot use the Felsway.

1437
01:58:41,117 --> 01:58:43,138
They cannot use Mystic Valley Parkway.

1438
01:58:43,899 --> 01:58:52,265
And I would be very curious to see if this work has been done ahead of time to see what the potential truck routes would be.

1439
01:58:53,385 --> 01:58:56,609
Because in my opinion, they would be cutting through many neighborhoods.

1440
01:58:57,370 --> 01:59:05,738
And I think that's extremely important for us to know, as a council, the impact this may have on surrounding neighbors.

1441
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:09,462
And that leads to my other point that

1442
01:59:11,363 --> 01:59:17,685
I think, Mr. President, before we move forward with this, this would require community input.

1443
01:59:17,785 --> 01:59:21,327
And I realize this is a council meeting and it's open to the public.

1444
01:59:21,807 --> 01:59:24,548
However, it's the first time it's appeared on the agenda.

1445
01:59:25,108 --> 01:59:34,431
And I think the neighborhood where this is, I realized there was a baking facility there on a smaller scale.

1446
01:59:35,691 --> 01:59:39,893
I think this is going to have a much larger impact on the Wellington area.

1447
01:59:40,615 --> 01:59:41,664
And, you know.

1448
01:59:42,947 --> 01:59:45,028
Haines Square and so forth, Mr. President.

1449
01:59:45,468 --> 02:00:00,320
So I would ask that we have a public meeting on this where we invite the Wellington, Haines Square area, Mr. President, and notify them of what is taking place to see if residents would have any particular questions.

1450
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:09,666
There's a host of questions that I rather do in committee of the whole regarding, I could just tell you first hand, I go to that Wendy's.

1451
02:00:11,366 --> 02:00:13,608
I hate to say it, quite often.

1452
02:00:14,929 --> 02:00:20,273
And I can tell you at night, Mr. President, that the rats are rampant in that back area.

1453
02:00:20,934 --> 02:00:25,177
If you want to check out rats, go by the back of the Wendy's.

1454
02:00:25,898 --> 02:00:34,825
And so there's a lot of issues regarding, and I'm sure these are addressed by the company, but there are a lot of issues I'm sure residents are going to have.

1455
02:00:35,126 --> 02:00:38,428
I know my colleagues already asked about odor and smell and so forth.

1456
02:00:38,809 --> 02:00:40,210
We've had a number of issues.

1457
02:00:40,910 --> 02:00:44,071
Mr. President, with docking stations.

1458
02:00:44,911 --> 02:00:50,613
We've experienced them in Salt Method with the Dunkin' Donuts that has a distributor off of Mystic Ave.

1459
02:00:51,253 --> 02:01:01,997
And even though businesses say they're quiet, when you take pallets to and from the trucks, especially if they're outdoor docking stations, that noise travels.

1460
02:01:02,597 --> 02:01:09,183
And as you know, we just built 145 condos behind the Wendy's in that particular area.

1461
02:01:09,504 --> 02:01:17,951
We have residents off to the left, which is right next to BJ, which is probably 100, 200 yards away, a couple hundred yards away.

1462
02:01:18,412 --> 02:01:24,458
So there's definitely a neighborhood in that area, Mr. President, and I would ask that we set up a committee of whole.

1463
02:01:25,158 --> 02:01:38,065
or if we want to have a next council meeting, serve as a public meeting to invite the neighborhood, Mr. President, and area residents so they can have input and see this presentation and ask questions.

1464
02:01:39,128 --> 02:01:48,310
And I appreciate also the fact that the administration is looking into bringing in additional businesses in our community.

1465
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:54,552
I've always stated the Office of Community Development is supposed to be out there soliciting new businesses into the community.

1466
02:01:54,972 --> 02:01:56,792
So a TIF is another way.

1467
02:01:57,172 --> 02:02:00,633
Would I rather do it differently and not give any incentive?

1468
02:02:00,713 --> 02:02:07,975
And I probably would prefer that, Mr. President, but that remains a vote of this council and to see how this works.

1469
02:02:09,795 --> 02:02:20,199
So far, the last TIF I voted for, which was the sausage establishment on 9th Street, seems to be running very successful.

1470
02:02:20,519 --> 02:02:21,339
They're a good neighbor.

1471
02:02:21,659 --> 02:02:29,942
They're located within a residential area, but there were a lot of issues on that TIF that we had to work out, Mr. President.

1472
02:02:30,262 --> 02:02:37,585
A lot of neighborhood issues, as this gentleman mentioned, with the silos, noise, trucking, trucks that are idling.

1473
02:02:38,365 --> 02:02:39,767
It always happens, Mr. President.

1474
02:02:40,047 --> 02:02:45,572
The BJ parking lot, which is a giant parking lot right next to this building, go there at night.

1475
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:48,795
There's 18 wheelers idling there at night, Mr. President.

1476
02:02:49,056 --> 02:02:52,599
Maybe not trying to get it to BJ's, but just a place to stay.

1477
02:02:52,659 --> 02:02:57,344
Also, Mr. President, the city just approved a gas station for the BJ's parking lot.

1478
02:02:57,784 --> 02:03:07,630
So we're going to add a brand new gas station with, I believe, eight pumps located right in the frontage on Middlesex Ave of a new gas station there.

1479
02:03:08,051 --> 02:03:10,372
So there's a lot going on in this area, Mr. President.

1480
02:03:10,752 --> 02:03:14,855
And to be quite frank, Middlesex Ave is deplorable.

1481
02:03:16,296 --> 02:03:19,938
The sidewalks, the street, it looks like a third world country.

1482
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:21,219
It really does.

1483
02:03:21,579 --> 02:03:25,302
It's deplorable, it's a state owned road, it gets zero attention.

1484
02:03:26,337 --> 02:03:29,722
from the state, and Natural History City has zero responsibility.

1485
02:03:30,322 --> 02:03:41,077
So if we do move forward, Mr. President, and the TIF is with the state and so forth, I'd like to see a commitment from the state to do some work, Mr. President, on Middlesex Ave.

1486
02:03:42,118 --> 02:03:53,484
And bring it up to the 21st century regarding crossings, pedestrian safety, cars, and everything else, Mr. President, bike lanes, and everything else that needs to take place on Middlesex Ave.

1487
02:03:53,524 --> 02:03:57,085
So I would ask that, Mr. President, I am not going to vote on this tonight.

1488
02:03:57,446 --> 02:03:58,906
That doesn't mean I don't support it.

1489
02:03:59,447 --> 02:04:09,392
I want neighborhood input and I want the questions to be asked about the roadway and neighborhood concerns addressed.

1490
02:04:09,712 --> 02:04:10,012
Thank you.

1491
02:04:10,512 --> 02:04:11,573
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1492
02:04:11,973 --> 02:04:12,533
Councilor Knight.

1493
02:04:14,394 --> 02:04:15,495
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1494
02:04:16,716 --> 02:04:20,358
It appears to me that this would be what's classified as a bakery wholesaler.

1495
02:04:20,638 --> 02:04:23,320
Am I correct in making that assumption?

1496
02:04:25,141 --> 02:04:26,722
Mr. Monaco, would you be able to answer that?

1497
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:36,548
Yeah, we would be a producer of bakery products for both wholesale and food service and retail.

1498
02:04:36,748 --> 02:04:41,792
So wholesalers end up delivering it to retailers in the end.

1499
02:04:41,872 --> 02:04:44,514
So yes, sir, I can live with that definition.

1500
02:04:44,995 --> 02:04:48,358
And in this Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I do believe that.

1501
02:04:49,317 --> 02:04:58,606
Because you'd be considered a bakery wholesaler and you'd be subject to USDA approval and inspection, you wouldn't be subject to the authority of the local board of health, is that correct?

1502
02:04:59,386 --> 02:05:00,087
That is correct.

1503
02:05:00,127 --> 02:05:07,354
As I stated earlier, this would be a USDA federally inspected bakery under all regulations.

1504
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:08,940
Okay.

1505
02:05:10,241 --> 02:05:15,045
And we talked a little bit about the jobs that Monogram's going to bring.

1506
02:05:15,065 --> 02:05:20,468
And I'm relatively familiar with Monogram Foods from my day job working in the insurance industry.

1507
02:05:20,609 --> 02:05:25,452
And I understand a lot of these positions are packaging jobs and manufacturing almost type jobs?

1508
02:05:27,674 --> 02:05:27,914
Yes.

1509
02:05:28,815 --> 02:05:36,160
And then you'd have also a smaller array of positions that were mid to upper level management and then you'd have some drivers?

1510
02:05:37,928 --> 02:05:49,157
Quality assurance people, supervisors, financial accounting people, general plant management, drivers, warehouse men, yes.

1511
02:05:50,358 --> 02:05:54,061
And is there any local hiring preference that's part of the TIF?

1512
02:05:55,302 --> 02:06:02,047
I'm sorry, any local- Local hiring, if you're located in Medford and you have two applicants, and one of them's from Medford and one of them's from Everett.

1513
02:06:03,142 --> 02:06:04,983
Does the Medford person get the job?

1514
02:06:05,043 --> 02:06:06,845
Is there a local hiring preference?

1515
02:06:06,965 --> 02:06:17,672
Our plan is to give Medford, experienced Medford employees, those that particularly have bakery experience, that's of great interest to us.

1516
02:06:18,693 --> 02:06:21,115
As you covered earlier on your other topics,

1517
02:06:21,915 --> 02:06:27,180
employees in your particular area of greater Boston, proximity to work is important.

1518
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:28,582
The commutes can be terrible.

1519
02:06:28,662 --> 02:06:34,567
So we're hopeful there's a good pool of applicants within the greater Medford City area that will work for us.

1520
02:06:36,028 --> 02:06:37,149
And there is a Medford hiring.

1521
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:39,271
There is a Medford provision built within the agreement.

1522
02:06:39,532 --> 02:06:39,832
There is.

1523
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:40,252
Awesome.

1524
02:06:40,352 --> 02:06:40,553
Awesome.

1525
02:06:40,573 --> 02:06:40,733
Great.

1526
02:06:40,753 --> 02:06:41,173
Thanks, Dave.

1527
02:06:41,754 --> 02:06:42,114
It's in there.

1528
02:06:43,535 --> 02:06:43,755
OK.

1529
02:06:45,517 --> 02:06:45,737
Well.

1530
02:06:47,077 --> 02:06:49,982
I personally have supported tips in the past.

1531
02:06:50,042 --> 02:06:54,410
I think that it's a great way to jumpstart our economy and bring jobs to the community.

1532
02:06:55,612 --> 02:06:58,877
The jobs that pay $20 an hour, the jobs that pay $800 a week.

1533
02:07:00,987 --> 02:07:02,909
Those aren't necessarily the jobs I'm crazy about.

1534
02:07:03,310 --> 02:07:07,274
I'd like to see jobs that pay a living wage so the people that work here can live here.

1535
02:07:07,414 --> 02:07:11,619
And that hiring preference isn't going to go too far if the people working there are going to make 800 bucks a week.

1536
02:07:12,439 --> 02:07:17,405
With that being said, there are other positions and other jobs and other benefits that come with having an employer of this size in the community.

1537
02:07:18,045 --> 02:07:19,346
But I would agree with Councilor Mox.

1538
02:07:19,386 --> 02:07:29,069
In the past when we've done this, we've taken a slow and deliberate approach to be sure that we don't all arise cross LRTs and also listen to the concerns that the residents have.

1539
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:35,472
In looking at the location of this facility, it's, I believe, located in an industrially zoned district.

1540
02:07:36,212 --> 02:07:38,633
a wholesale bakery can be stationed there by right.

1541
02:07:39,834 --> 02:07:45,576
The option, the ability for the council to bring this entity to the table right now is purely based around this TIF.

1542
02:07:46,497 --> 02:07:55,661
So I think it would be a good exercise for us to allow the opportunity to entertain Councilor Mark's motion, and I would second it or support it if he offers it.

1543
02:07:56,281 --> 02:08:05,505
And move from there, but this is something that historically I've supported, and I certainly see no problem with it based upon the preliminary presentation that's been made, but I would like to hear from the residents as well.

1544
02:08:06,127 --> 02:08:06,928
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1545
02:08:07,008 --> 02:08:09,849
On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, Councilor Beers.

1546
02:08:12,211 --> 02:08:13,151
Thank you, Mr. President.

1547
02:08:14,212 --> 02:08:17,254
You know, I've done a dive on this, done some research around TIFs.

1548
02:08:17,474 --> 02:08:19,815
I spoke with Maria from MOBD as well.

1549
02:08:21,737 --> 02:08:31,543
You know, and from what I've understood, these have been used as an incentive to address areas of low demand, areas of blight, kind of that's the intent here.

1550
02:08:33,535 --> 02:08:37,139
I wouldn't necessarily say that Medford is an area of low demand or an area of blight.

1551
02:08:37,539 --> 02:08:43,125
I know this has, you know, bakery has not been operated in for a little while, so there might be a little wiggle room there.

1552
02:08:43,205 --> 02:08:48,190
But, you know, that's one of the concerns I have.

1553
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:55,077
And also in my research and speaking with MOBD, it does seem that tips are mostly going to large corporations versus

1554
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:57,801
looking at small businesses.

1555
02:08:57,861 --> 02:09:02,162
So that's another area of concern that I have in general around the process.

1556
02:09:03,062 --> 02:09:08,384
I do have a couple questions for Mr. Monica from Monogram Foods.

1557
02:09:09,305 --> 02:09:18,768
The first of which is, have you discussed or would you consider any curbing, driveway, or traffic improvements around the property?

1558
02:09:22,071 --> 02:09:30,555
Would you be referring to on the actual property we would be leasing, or are you talking on city-owned property?

1559
02:09:30,575 --> 02:09:32,936
It seems to me it might even be state-owned property.

1560
02:09:34,337 --> 02:09:36,358
Essentially, I drive that road a lot.

1561
02:09:36,458 --> 02:09:37,959
It's not a very safe area.

1562
02:09:38,079 --> 02:09:41,720
I would expect that trucks are going to have some issues coming out of your location.

1563
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:46,463
And during your study of this location as a potential location,

1564
02:09:47,403 --> 02:09:56,406
have you noticed or considered working with the state or the city around state-owned or city-owned property as well as your property?

1565
02:09:57,987 --> 02:09:58,747
Yes, we do.

1566
02:09:59,007 --> 02:10:14,652
Normally, as part of a plant remodel of this size, we would look at all ingresses and egresses, primarily from employee safety and where the employees would park, where trucks would come in and unload or back trailers in.

1567
02:10:14,672 --> 02:10:15,733
So, yes, we would look at that.

1568
02:10:15,793 --> 02:10:16,573
We'd be open to

1569
02:10:17,313 --> 02:10:22,696
improving curb cuts, making sure they were in the right locations and they were safe.

1570
02:10:22,816 --> 02:10:25,277
Obviously we can't have damaged equipment.

1571
02:10:25,297 --> 02:10:34,081
So if the facility's parking lot is in bad shape and has potholes, we're going to fix those things as part of our normal rehab of a facility.

1572
02:10:35,582 --> 02:10:35,822
Great.

1573
02:10:35,942 --> 02:10:36,403
Thank you.

1574
02:10:38,083 --> 02:10:45,207
Next question is, you know, are you considering any other locations for this plant other than Medford?

1575
02:10:47,472 --> 02:10:59,419
We have considered four alternative locations, two of which are in Massachusetts and two of which are not, are located in other states where we have plants.

1576
02:11:01,120 --> 02:11:03,321
So that's as much as I can say on that.

1577
02:11:04,542 --> 02:11:11,965
We have two substantial plants in Wisconsin and that was one of our other sites as well.

1578
02:11:12,045 --> 02:11:14,706
So yes, we went through a complete search.

1579
02:11:15,826 --> 02:11:18,487
I think the original list had eight potential sites.

1580
02:11:18,527 --> 02:11:19,748
We narrowed that down to four.

1581
02:11:20,868 --> 02:11:21,829
Okay, gotcha.

1582
02:11:21,909 --> 02:11:30,512
And I do have a few more questions, but I think on the note that Councilor Knight was sending and my fellow councilors as well, you know,

1583
02:11:31,182 --> 02:11:34,383
If we make a commitment to you, we'd want a shared commitment there.

1584
02:11:34,563 --> 02:11:38,365
So I do think that should be part of a deliberative process to move forward.

1585
02:11:39,786 --> 02:11:41,006
It sounded like you're privately held.

1586
02:11:41,026 --> 02:11:47,969
You might not be able or willing to answer this question, but what is Monogram's net revenue annually?

1587
02:11:51,901 --> 02:11:55,643
This year, it will approximate 750 million.

1588
02:11:56,243 --> 02:11:59,285
So I'm not sure what you consider to be a large company.

1589
02:12:00,045 --> 02:12:02,466
We are only 16 years old.

1590
02:12:03,087 --> 02:12:09,570
And so we're very proud of our growth, but we don't consider ourselves a large company at that revenue level.

1591
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:10,410
Got it.

1592
02:12:10,810 --> 02:12:13,852
And that's just kind of goes to my next question, which is

1593
02:12:16,234 --> 02:12:19,956
Is $600,000 really going to be the difference for you?

1594
02:12:19,976 --> 02:12:28,359
I would consider you, maybe we'll call you medium-sized, but $750 million sounds like a lot of money to me.

1595
02:12:28,519 --> 02:12:42,644
Is this $600,000 really the difference maker for you in making this kind of long-term decision versus all of the other factors that you've mentioned, like the location and the building and the silos and all of the other conditions?

1596
02:12:42,704 --> 02:12:43,864
Is it really the $600,000 that's the make or break?

1597
02:12:47,462 --> 02:12:54,587
All state incentives and local TIF incentives are relevant to every decision that we make.

1598
02:12:55,428 --> 02:12:59,031
It's not the only decision, but in this case, it is a relevant decision.

1599
02:12:59,451 --> 02:13:05,455
As I said, we're not a large company, and between the real estate tax incentive

1600
02:13:07,177 --> 02:13:12,040
and the personal property, it's approximately, David can answer this, I think it was 950,000.

1601
02:13:12,721 --> 02:13:17,825
So it is material to our decision, yes.

1602
02:13:18,786 --> 02:13:19,366
Okay.

1603
02:13:19,787 --> 02:13:26,552
The 950,000 number that Jeff mentioned is what we view as the upper limit of what it would be.

1604
02:13:26,672 --> 02:13:32,137
So when I was talking about a TIF, there's always some flexibility, there's always some unknown variables.

1605
02:13:32,497 --> 02:13:33,578
So in the modeling that we did

1606
02:13:33,778 --> 02:13:36,341
that showed the $4 million net value back to the city.

1607
02:13:36,981 --> 02:13:44,588
The more Monogram invests, the more market forces impact the value, the larger the exemption, but also larger the revenue back to the city.

1608
02:13:44,749 --> 02:13:55,399
So there will be some fluctuation there, but based on Ellen's best guess and Ellen's hard work, I think that that number is exactly where, it's definitely gonna be in that window.

1609
02:13:56,478 --> 02:13:56,698
Right.

1610
02:13:57,058 --> 02:13:57,759
And I understand.

1611
02:13:57,839 --> 02:14:06,385
I'm just saying, you know, regardless 600,000 at the low end, 950 at the high end, we're talking about like 0.1% of the annual revenue for a 50 year investment.

1612
02:14:06,425 --> 02:14:20,355
It just, you know, it's a small relative to this amount that you mentioned of $750 million a year and that you're a quickly growing company and that you sextupled the amount of revenue that was coming from your plant in Wilmington.

1613
02:14:20,395 --> 02:14:25,038
You know, it's, it seems like in some sense in your account book, it might be,

1614
02:14:26,095 --> 02:14:27,456
worth a little bit less to you than to us.

1615
02:14:27,756 --> 02:14:32,799
Our revenue is not $750 million a year here in Medford.

1616
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:35,720
And thank you for answering my questions.

1617
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:49,447
I think maybe more directed towards Alicia Hunt or Dave Rodriguez, I do have some concerns that this sets a bad precedent, considering that we are a pretty high demand community.

1618
02:14:49,487 --> 02:14:50,748
Our property values are growing.

1619
02:14:50,768 --> 02:14:55,270
It seems that that's going to continue for the foreseeable future in the greater Boston area.

1620
02:14:56,093 --> 02:15:03,634
Do you have any concerns that this sets a precedent for offering public subsidies and discounts in order to get new businesses in the future after this project?

1621
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:09,812
Well, I can't speak for and I think this is a good conversation for the mayor as well.

1622
02:15:09,832 --> 02:15:11,953
And I've always viewed TIFs as case by case.

1623
02:15:12,853 --> 02:15:14,894
So I don't view this as precedent setting.

1624
02:15:14,934 --> 02:15:23,237
I view this as looking at bringing this business to this location and for the city and the value that it provides to the city based on that analysis.

1625
02:15:23,677 --> 02:15:28,119
Every TIF is going to be case by case based upon some of the factors that you talked about.

1626
02:15:28,899 --> 02:15:42,025
So I'm not worried about creating a precedent because there is a strong check on this through the council process to say, you know, some cities and towns have given out TIFs pretty tightly.

1627
02:15:42,265 --> 02:15:43,886
Others have given it out pretty loosely.

1628
02:15:44,766 --> 02:15:53,290
So it's a case by, I've always viewed this as case by case, what's best for the community, for the business that they're bringing in and the site that they're being located at.

1629
02:15:53,330 --> 02:15:56,392
So I'll defer to Alicia as well as to her thoughts.

1630
02:15:56,992 --> 02:16:06,537
on that, but I'm not concerned about setting a precedent.

1631
02:16:06,597 --> 02:16:08,157
Is Alicia not my Alicia?

1632
02:16:09,838 --> 02:16:11,999
I have the wrong Alicia, sorry.

1633
02:16:12,139 --> 02:16:12,620
Alicia Hunt.

1634
02:16:14,908 --> 02:16:20,972
that we've been seeing is that Medford is a hot demand for residential.

1635
02:16:21,512 --> 02:16:29,117
And every developer that has been knocking on our door, almost every developer, has been wanting to build a large multifamily residence.

1636
02:16:29,717 --> 02:16:33,540
And that is something that has caused this council a lot of angst.

1637
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:35,221
It's caused the mayor a lot of angst.

1638
02:16:35,941 --> 02:16:42,065
And one of the things we have been looking to do is to bring in more commercial entities that bring jobs with them.

1639
02:16:42,806 --> 02:16:45,249
and this business is bringing jobs.

1640
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:49,895
I don't have another business knocking on the door saying, can we give you jobs?

1641
02:16:50,316 --> 02:16:57,746
We didn't make a big deal of it when Whole Foods closed last winter, but they did close and all of those people were laid off.

1642
02:16:58,408 --> 02:17:12,020
And this is somebody who actually wants to not just put another business there, but actually a business with the hopes of rehiring the people in this area who were recently laid off by that entity there.

1643
02:17:12,501 --> 02:17:14,763
They'll be bringing back similar jobs.

1644
02:17:14,943 --> 02:17:16,865
They'll be doing similar kinds of work.

1645
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:22,341
it'll be no more disruption to the community than we had there previously.

1646
02:17:22,721 --> 02:17:30,943
We're hoping because it's a new business and we're having conversations with them, that disruption that notice would be less than what we had there.

1647
02:17:31,763 --> 02:17:39,465
But the basis, bottom line is, those people don't have jobs right now unless they've gone off and found them in other areas.

1648
02:17:40,086 --> 02:17:42,586
This is something that we would like to see here in the city.

1649
02:17:44,307 --> 02:17:45,907
I mean, I understand the idea of jobs,

1650
02:17:46,752 --> 02:17:54,073
And no disrespect, if it's been 11 months, I would guess that they've had to get another job at this point just to pay the rent.

1651
02:17:54,913 --> 02:18:02,935
I understand bringing in jobs, but to Councilor Knight's point as well, it might cost more than $20 an hour to live in Medford.

1652
02:18:02,955 --> 02:18:04,795
At least that's my personal experience.

1653
02:18:07,816 --> 02:18:16,057
I guess- We have a large number of people that actually make and live here that make below the area median income.

1654
02:18:17,377 --> 02:18:22,820
Our area median income is lower than the regional area median income.

1655
02:18:23,401 --> 02:18:25,322
So that is something to consider.

1656
02:18:25,382 --> 02:18:28,864
It is very expensive to live in Medford because of the housing prices.

1657
02:18:29,684 --> 02:18:33,407
But we've also been going through a pandemic and we have very high unemployment rates.

1658
02:18:33,867 --> 02:18:39,430
We're seeing unprecedented usage of the food pantries here in Medford.

1659
02:18:39,910 --> 02:18:46,194
So I would not assume that the people who were working there have found jobs.

1660
02:18:46,888 --> 02:18:48,969
that there's a high unemployment rate going on.

1661
02:18:49,389 --> 02:18:50,609
No, that wasn't what I was saying.

1662
02:18:50,629 --> 02:18:54,051
I was saying I assume they've had to find some way to make money in the interim period.

1663
02:18:54,091 --> 02:18:57,852
They're not just waiting for Monogram to move in here to take an old job back.

1664
02:18:59,593 --> 02:19:02,974
So, you know, I guess it sounds like it's case by case.

1665
02:19:03,034 --> 02:19:04,574
It's not setting a precedent.

1666
02:19:06,115 --> 02:19:08,075
At least that's the position of the administration.

1667
02:19:08,816 --> 02:19:10,436
And I understand all the other factors.

1668
02:19:11,177 --> 02:19:12,137
I do think it is a

1669
02:19:13,101 --> 02:19:20,049
of concern to set a precedent to say, if we want a business here, we're going to have to give them hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks to do it.

1670
02:19:20,169 --> 02:19:25,455
So that's a concern that I have, in addition to the other concerns that have been raised by fellow councilors.

1671
02:19:25,976 --> 02:19:28,999
And I look forward to more deliberation on the matter.

1672
02:19:29,339 --> 02:19:30,340
Thank you, Mr. President.

1673
02:19:30,761 --> 02:19:31,862
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

1674
02:19:31,942 --> 02:19:32,963
Point of information, Mr. President.

1675
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:35,041
Point of information, Mr. President.

1676
02:19:35,061 --> 02:19:36,962
Point of information from the Vice President.

1677
02:19:37,683 --> 02:19:42,806
I've been on this council ten years, and this is only the second TIF that's come my way.

1678
02:19:42,906 --> 02:19:44,287
Council March has been here longer.

1679
02:19:44,747 --> 02:19:45,888
I don't know if anything has come.

1680
02:19:47,229 --> 02:19:51,532
So let's say, so TIF's not given up very generously in this community.

1681
02:19:52,292 --> 02:19:54,874
Let's say this is only the second one that I've been involved with in ten years.

1682
02:19:56,848 --> 02:20:05,710
And by the way, I think they're a useful tool to bring business to the community, especially where things are very competitive these days.

1683
02:20:05,730 --> 02:20:07,250
Thank you.

1684
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:08,370
Thank you, Vice President Carriello.

1685
02:20:08,730 --> 02:20:10,591
Councilor Villescaz, I'll start with your question.

1686
02:20:11,331 --> 02:20:22,673
I would just add, just for the notes, for the record, for the future, that we look into using some of the proceeds if the TIF is approved,

1687
02:20:23,537 --> 02:20:35,382
into tip accountability that's been one of the recommendations, policy recommendations around tips recently, making sure that they are being held up, that the agreements are being held to.

1688
02:20:35,462 --> 02:20:40,084
So I'd just like to put that for the record, maybe for a future committee of the whole meeting to discuss further.

1689
02:20:41,185 --> 02:20:43,026
And I understand it's not something we've done in the past.

1690
02:20:43,066 --> 02:20:45,567
I'm more concerned about what we're going to do in the future.

1691
02:20:46,407 --> 02:20:47,708
We do have a new administration.

1692
02:20:47,728 --> 02:20:50,409
We're hiring economic development director.

1693
02:20:51,111 --> 02:20:56,854
Is this going to be our economic development plan going forward to bring in this business because we have this high residential demand?

1694
02:20:56,874 --> 02:20:58,594
So I understand we haven't done it in the past.

1695
02:20:58,654 --> 02:21:02,556
I think that's probably a good thing, good stewardship, that we're not just giving these out willy-nilly.

1696
02:21:02,616 --> 02:21:06,758
I know there are a lot of communities that do that and have found themselves in trouble.

1697
02:21:07,318 --> 02:21:12,201
City of Chicago, 33% of their property tax revenue is wrapped up in TIFs right now.

1698
02:21:12,261 --> 02:21:12,661
I know that's

1699
02:21:13,225 --> 02:21:19,470
A little different from Medford, but I also know Malden, Salem, and other communities have used these tools pretty extensively.

1700
02:21:20,631 --> 02:21:24,453
So just saying we need to keep a close eye on the future.

1701
02:21:24,493 --> 02:21:29,557
I think the last thing we want to have is that if a business is coming here, they expect a TIF.

1702
02:21:30,058 --> 02:21:30,378
Thank you.

1703
02:21:30,755 --> 02:21:31,716
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

1704
02:21:31,756 --> 02:21:32,696
Councilor Scott Kelly.

1705
02:21:33,177 --> 02:21:34,237
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

1706
02:21:34,418 --> 02:21:44,665
Uh, again, I echo the sentiments of my colleagues and the, uh, fact of really stretching this out for the fact that we have public input as we move forward with this.

1707
02:21:45,105 --> 02:21:46,426
I think this is a great idea.

1708
02:21:46,446 --> 02:21:55,592
I think this is, uh, you know, uh, be interesting to see if there's any data that shows the amount of method residents that worked in the whole foods plant.

1709
02:21:56,513 --> 02:21:56,633
Um,

1710
02:21:57,370 --> 02:22:08,767
prior to their closure and just so they could reinforce the need and the support that we'll be giving if voted with this TIF.

1711
02:22:08,787 --> 02:22:10,990
So again, I think.

1712
02:22:12,472 --> 02:22:14,033
all of our cows will bring up some good points.

1713
02:22:14,653 --> 02:22:22,275
But, um, one thing we're seeing, especially during the COVID times, there's a lot of empty spaces and this is a big space.

1714
02:22:22,575 --> 02:22:33,199
And, uh, as long as we do it correctly and get the input from our neighbors, um, I think this is, uh, an area that, um, we'd like to see some growth and some movement.

1715
02:22:33,219 --> 02:22:33,339
So

1716
02:22:34,030 --> 02:22:57,255
It'll be interesting to see if I could it would be interesting to see if our traffic engineer Has done we could ask them if we can't to invite him to the next meeting just to get a traffic assessment moving forward with this this company this company and its growth and and and again you know with the weight restrictions for

1717
02:22:57,880 --> 02:23:00,341
You know, our major thoroughways, the Middlesex and Fellsway.

1718
02:23:00,981 --> 02:23:08,624
And the fear that some neighbors have always stressed, even with Bianchi's, is that are the trucks going to be going down the side streets?

1719
02:23:08,684 --> 02:23:17,028
And especially those side streets are full with children playing in a pretty tight-knit residential neighborhood and making sure we keep those streets safe.

1720
02:23:17,568 --> 02:23:21,149
I'm sure this company will support us in moving forward any decision.

1721
02:23:21,169 --> 02:23:26,792
But I'm excited for the process and appreciate them for coming to Medford.

1722
02:23:27,772 --> 02:23:29,133
looking to make Medford their home.

1723
02:23:29,213 --> 02:23:34,976
So, um, but again, supporting, uh, council marks is resolution, a thousand percent.

1724
02:23:35,416 --> 02:23:42,719
I think that, uh, community, uh, involvement to get the communities impact behind this decision, I think would be very important.

1725
02:23:42,859 --> 02:23:44,280
Thank you.

1726
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:51,103
One thing I'd just like to add to the records, uh, for the committee report, um, for the committee of the whole to be held.

1727
02:23:51,183 --> 02:23:55,065
If that motion passes, which I expect that it will, um, is that we amend,

1728
02:23:55,717 --> 02:24:07,581
the TIF or add language to the TIF agreement that Monogram Foods would not contest a card check or an LRB election if the workers chose to unionize at this facility.

1729
02:24:10,582 --> 02:24:12,903
Is that something you want to discuss in committee at all?

1730
02:24:13,623 --> 02:24:13,863
Yeah.

1731
02:24:14,123 --> 02:24:14,303
Okay.

1732
02:24:14,963 --> 02:24:15,143
Okay.

1733
02:24:15,624 --> 02:24:15,904
Thank you.

1734
02:24:16,844 --> 02:24:19,585
I thank all the councilors for their questions.

1735
02:24:19,605 --> 02:24:21,606
If I may, I have a couple of quick questions.

1736
02:24:23,327 --> 02:24:26,932
And Mr. Monica, thank you very much for your interest in the city of Medford.

1737
02:24:27,473 --> 02:24:31,479
With regard to the construction, when would the construction begin and how long would it last?

1738
02:24:34,215 --> 02:24:41,178
At this point, the facility is becoming available.

1739
02:24:42,299 --> 02:24:46,020
We would not start any construction until we make a decision.

1740
02:24:46,201 --> 02:24:51,943
Obviously it's contingent upon the approval of a TIF program with the city of Medford.

1741
02:24:52,023 --> 02:24:55,685
So at this point, it would be very soon after that,

1742
02:24:56,305 --> 02:25:02,908
We have a demand and a commitment to have production up and running within six months.

1743
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:10,552
And if it isn't going to be in Medford, it will be somewhere and it'll be within six, I'm going to say six to eight months.

1744
02:25:10,612 --> 02:25:14,774
So we are ready to move forward quickly if approved.

1745
02:25:15,814 --> 02:25:25,619
And if not approved with City of Medford, we'll have to move forward and go anywhere because we have a large customer who is asking for the production as soon as possible.

1746
02:25:26,927 --> 02:25:31,019
So would the construction be done by July 1st?

1747
02:25:33,781 --> 02:25:38,083
I would say right now we're estimating it's going to take six to eight months.

1748
02:25:38,123 --> 02:25:39,164
So pretty close to that.

1749
02:25:40,144 --> 02:25:45,527
Sir, again, you never know when you're doing a major remodeling, if you run into any issues, right?

1750
02:25:45,567 --> 02:25:50,709
If there's a structural issue with the roof or a wall or drainage or something.

1751
02:25:50,769 --> 02:25:52,150
So we can't commit that.

1752
02:25:52,730 --> 02:25:57,092
This is an older facility and they're all different and they're all unique.

1753
02:25:58,553 --> 02:25:58,753
Okay.

1754
02:25:58,893 --> 02:25:59,193
Thank you.

1755
02:25:59,833 --> 02:26:00,654
And I have another question.

1756
02:26:00,694 --> 02:26:01,614
This might be for Alan.

1757
02:26:04,538 --> 02:26:07,619
Seeing it's 2020, anything can happen.

1758
02:26:08,339 --> 02:26:24,206
I don't mean to sound negative, but what happens with regard to the TIF, if Monogram was to be sold or if you were to go out of business, what happens with the TIF and are there any safeguards to the city?

1759
02:26:27,107 --> 02:26:27,667
Let me unmute you.

1760
02:26:40,147 --> 02:26:40,507
I'm trying.

1761
02:26:40,587 --> 02:26:40,987
One second.

1762
02:26:48,631 --> 02:26:56,215
Can you try and mute it?

1763
02:26:57,075 --> 02:26:58,376
Why don't you let me ask my question?

1764
02:27:01,778 --> 02:27:02,458
Thank you, Counselor.

1765
02:27:12,342 --> 02:27:14,663
Yeah, Mr. President, I think Maria can answer the question.

1766
02:27:14,703 --> 02:27:15,463
I can also weigh in.

1767
02:27:15,563 --> 02:27:16,804
It's fine.

1768
02:27:16,844 --> 02:27:18,765
Maria, if you wouldn't mind weighing in, that'd be great.

1769
02:27:19,565 --> 02:27:20,065
Absolutely.

1770
02:27:20,085 --> 02:27:21,166
Thank you, Council President.

1771
02:27:22,306 --> 02:27:24,708
So actually, Ellen and I had this conversation.

1772
02:27:25,228 --> 02:27:26,688
She had asked a similar question.

1773
02:27:27,129 --> 02:27:33,391
So the TIF is for the company, so not the location.

1774
02:27:33,451 --> 02:27:36,093
So in other words, you know,

1775
02:27:38,346 --> 02:27:48,393
you know, in the event of, as you said, you know, another 2020 happens, um, and, uh, monogram foods, you know, leaves in three years.

1776
02:27:48,713 --> 02:27:48,934
Right.

1777
02:27:49,034 --> 02:27:53,237
So they, um, that tip ends on that location.

1778
02:27:54,818 --> 02:27:55,218
Okay.

1779
02:27:56,099 --> 02:27:57,860
Someone else moves in.

1780
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:04,045
And if you want, and if you were so inclined to want to give them a tip, the new company, they'd have to go through the process again.

1781
02:28:04,305 --> 02:28:04,445
Okay.

1782
02:28:05,167 --> 02:28:08,388
And are there any callbacks with regard to the TIF, if that was to happen?

1783
02:28:11,509 --> 02:28:14,630
So you could do that.

1784
02:28:14,670 --> 02:28:19,872
That would require, you know, going to an EACC meeting and, but yes, certainly.

1785
02:28:20,612 --> 02:28:20,812
Okay.

1786
02:28:20,832 --> 02:28:25,214
And with regard to, Councilor Beeson had a question about, I think it was TIF accountability.

1787
02:28:25,914 --> 02:28:28,795
And with regard to that, I believe if I'm correct that,

1788
02:28:30,250 --> 02:28:34,292
monogram would be subject to regulatory filings.

1789
02:28:34,332 --> 02:28:34,773
Am I correct?

1790
02:28:34,813 --> 02:28:35,033
Is that?

1791
02:28:36,514 --> 02:28:36,734
Yes.

1792
02:28:38,615 --> 02:28:40,336
Annual reporting to the city and to the state.

1793
02:28:40,576 --> 02:28:40,816
Okay.

1794
02:28:40,836 --> 02:28:49,040
So the annual reporting to the city with regard to, was it the amount of investment they made and to the amount of employees that reside in Medford that were hired?

1795
02:28:49,060 --> 02:28:50,021
Am I correct in that?

1796
02:28:51,902 --> 02:28:53,143
Correct, there's different things.

1797
02:28:53,163 --> 02:28:58,007
So usually with TIF accountability, it's done at the staff level.

1798
02:28:59,348 --> 02:29:06,793
We can request information from the TIF holder, but we can ask for whatever information that we'd like.

1799
02:29:07,534 --> 02:29:16,780
In terms of that, there is specific information that needs to be reported back to the state through the EACC, including a monetary amount of improvements, the number of jobs created, et cetera.

1800
02:29:18,482 --> 02:29:19,322
Okay, thank you.

1801
02:29:22,844 --> 02:29:24,165
Just one last quick question.

1802
02:29:24,386 --> 02:29:28,970
Are you currently leasing the facility right now or are you under agreement to lease the facility?

1803
02:29:31,533 --> 02:29:44,125
We have got, I'm aware of a signed letter of intent to lease subject to final financing and any incentives, either state or local.

1804
02:29:45,827 --> 02:29:46,408
Thank you very much.

1805
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:50,383
And just to clarify, the lease and the lease structure will be a triple net lease.

1806
02:29:50,903 --> 02:29:55,067
So Monogram will be accountable for all taxes, water, electricity, et cetera.

1807
02:29:55,467 --> 02:29:59,291
So the property owner, just a property owner at that point, they're not on the hook for any of this.

1808
02:30:01,132 --> 02:30:02,073
Okay, thank you.

1809
02:30:02,253 --> 02:30:03,434
Any other questions from the council?

1810
02:30:03,474 --> 02:30:04,295
We have Councilor Morrell.

1811
02:30:04,835 --> 02:30:05,536
Thank you, Mr. President.

1812
02:30:05,556 --> 02:30:07,798
I don't know if this is a question for you or the administration.

1813
02:30:07,818 --> 02:30:11,161
Does council approval of this, is it a simple majority or two thirds vote?

1814
02:30:14,113 --> 02:30:15,314
I'm not sure if you know.

1815
02:30:15,894 --> 02:30:17,335
Simple majority, I believe would.

1816
02:30:17,915 --> 02:30:18,475
Okay.

1817
02:30:18,655 --> 02:30:19,495
Okay.

1818
02:30:20,476 --> 02:30:20,776
Thank you.

1819
02:30:21,136 --> 02:30:21,436
Thank you.

1820
02:30:24,098 --> 02:30:25,298
Any other questions from the council?

1821
02:30:26,739 --> 02:30:26,959
Okay.

1822
02:30:26,999 --> 02:30:27,859
Any other questions?

1823
02:30:27,879 --> 02:30:29,040
Oh, we have a question here.

1824
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,021
Will Mavar.

1825
02:30:35,242 --> 02:30:38,424
Hey Will, name and address for the record, Will.

1826
02:30:40,078 --> 02:30:44,420
William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1827
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:47,722
Thank you for recognizing me, President Falco.

1828
02:30:48,522 --> 02:30:48,842
Thank you.

1829
02:30:49,363 --> 02:30:52,664
On the one hand, this TIF makes a lot of sense to me.

1830
02:30:53,625 --> 02:30:55,986
We want this company to invest in our community.

1831
02:30:56,306 --> 02:30:58,887
We want them to bring these jobs to Medford.

1832
02:31:00,008 --> 02:31:00,688
And it's true.

1833
02:31:01,148 --> 02:31:06,611
If we tax their improvements in the usual way, they don't want to come and make those improvements.

1834
02:31:06,991 --> 02:31:08,612
And they don't make the jobs, et cetera.

1835
02:31:10,451 --> 02:31:16,976
But I think the obvious question to me is why can't this sort of incentive be given to all taxpayers?

1836
02:31:18,558 --> 02:31:37,714
As I've often said, by switching to a system where we reduce the tax on improvements and increase the bill rate as needed to make up for it on the land, businesses and homeowners and anybody else generally would be encouraged to invest in our community, just as this step will encourage monogram.

1837
02:31:39,145 --> 02:31:52,794
As you go forward with considering this stuff, I hope you'll think about how lowering taxes on improvements generally will encourage investment without requiring that businesses strike a special deal.

1838
02:31:53,374 --> 02:32:01,059
And it's not for any corrupt reason, as Councilor Beers alluded to, that this tends to go to larger corporations.

1839
02:32:01,299 --> 02:32:05,642
Makes a lot of sense, because you're only going to bother to go through this process if you have a large project going in.

1840
02:32:06,273 --> 02:32:08,254
You're not going to be able to do it for a very small process.

1841
02:32:08,274 --> 02:32:09,334
It wouldn't be worth the time.

1842
02:32:10,795 --> 02:32:34,003
But an across-the-board swap over to land value taxation would remove the burden of taxation on every investment, no matter who's making it, rather than just those projects that are large enough to go through the process of getting a TIF, where you have a specific company going through a process and they're concerned of, you know, it's not available to everyone.

1843
02:32:35,177 --> 02:32:44,203
So I hope you'll consider that point and how this idea relates to the idea of land value taxation I brought before you so many times before.

1844
02:32:44,523 --> 02:32:44,863
Thank you.

1845
02:32:45,304 --> 02:32:45,864
Thank you, Will.

1846
02:32:48,646 --> 02:32:49,466
Any other questions?

1847
02:32:52,068 --> 02:32:52,988
Okay, hearing and seeing none.

1848
02:32:53,429 --> 02:32:54,890
On the motion of Councilor Marks.

1849
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:56,731
Mr. President, if I could just clarify.

1850
02:32:56,751 --> 02:32:57,631
Please, Councilor Marks.

1851
02:32:57,651 --> 02:33:04,556
So my motion was to, as part of the regular agenda, have a public meeting

1852
02:33:05,201 --> 02:33:17,811
in which we notify the residents of Hague Square and Wellington via the reverse 9-1-1 on the public meeting that we're going to have.

1853
02:33:17,911 --> 02:33:21,794
And to also give, Mr. President, because I don't believe we can have

1854
02:33:24,867 --> 02:33:37,170
that we provide in the reverse 911 call, a description of the project, a very brief description and the intent and how to get onto the Zoom call, Mr. President.

1855
02:33:37,310 --> 02:33:38,470
So we can do that.

1856
02:33:38,850 --> 02:33:42,211
So you want to make that as part of the regular agenda and not a separate committee?

1857
02:33:42,511 --> 02:33:45,192
That's the way I would prefer it rather than the committee of the whole.

1858
02:33:48,487 --> 02:33:50,349
Did you have that, Clerk Hernandez?

1859
02:33:50,369 --> 02:33:54,992
Okay, on that motion, offered by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1860
02:33:57,174 --> 02:33:58,255
Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

1861
02:34:01,717 --> 02:34:02,318
Councilor Behrs?

1862
02:34:02,498 --> 02:34:02,678
Yep.

1863
02:34:03,599 --> 02:34:04,459
Vice President Caravaglia?

1864
02:34:04,499 --> 02:34:04,700
Yes.

1865
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:05,680
Councilor Knight?

1866
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:05,921
Yes.

1867
02:34:06,261 --> 02:34:06,821
Councilor Marks?

1868
02:34:06,981 --> 02:34:07,302
Yes.

1869
02:34:07,542 --> 02:34:08,102
Councilor Morrell?

1870
02:34:08,382 --> 02:34:08,583
Yes.

1871
02:34:09,203 --> 02:34:09,964
Councilor Scarpelli?

1872
02:34:09,984 --> 02:34:10,264
Yes.

1873
02:34:10,364 --> 02:34:11,064
President Falco?

1874
02:34:11,285 --> 02:34:11,505
Yes.

1875
02:34:11,525 --> 02:34:15,348
7 in the affirmative, adjourned, the motion passes.

1876
02:34:19,864 --> 02:34:27,211
On the motion of Councilor, Vice President Caravaglio, to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1877
02:34:27,251 --> 02:34:27,972
Please call the roll.

1878
02:34:32,196 --> 02:34:32,696
Councilor Behrs?

1879
02:34:32,896 --> 02:34:33,177
Yes.

1880
02:34:33,637 --> 02:34:34,458
Vice President Caravaglio?

1881
02:34:34,478 --> 02:34:34,538
Yes.

1882
02:34:34,958 --> 02:34:35,419
Councilor Knight?

1883
02:34:35,439 --> 02:34:36,120
Yes.

1884
02:34:36,140 --> 02:34:36,660
Councilor Marks?

1885
02:34:36,860 --> 02:34:37,221
Yes.

1886
02:34:37,441 --> 02:34:38,001
Councilor Morrell?

1887
02:34:38,222 --> 02:34:38,462
Yes.

1888
02:34:38,742 --> 02:34:39,483
Councilor Scarpelli?

1889
02:34:39,503 --> 02:34:39,563
Yes.

1890
02:34:39,883 --> 02:34:40,444
President Falco?

1891
02:34:40,464 --> 02:34:40,564
Yes.

1892
02:34:40,845 --> 02:34:43,425
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1893
02:34:43,445 --> 02:34:48,386
20-650, this is on the motions, orders and resolutions offered by Councilor Knight.

1894
02:34:49,007 --> 02:34:54,608
Be it resolved that the City of Medford implement a no trucking ban, I'm sorry.

1895
02:34:55,148 --> 02:35:05,990
Be it resolved that the City of Medford implement no trucking along Boston Ave between Route 16 and Route 60 until such time as the gas leaks are repaired and the roadway resurfaced.

1896
02:35:06,410 --> 02:35:06,910
Councilor Knight.

1897
02:35:07,955 --> 02:35:09,136
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1898
02:35:09,756 --> 02:35:18,319
Over the course of what's been about two summers now, two and a half years now, I've been working with National Grid to get the level two gas leaks repaired.

1899
02:35:19,239 --> 02:35:25,502
They would be right on Boston Ave, right around the corner of Harvard Canal, right in that stretch.

1900
02:35:26,062 --> 02:35:36,126
And I've been getting a lot of complaints, Mr. President, from residents in the neighborhood when I'm out down the park walking and the like, that the condition of the roadway is so poor,

1901
02:35:37,852 --> 02:35:39,994
Coupled with the gas leaks, the people are very concerned.

1902
02:35:40,134 --> 02:35:46,679
Their houses are shaking when trucks are coming down off Route 16, down Boston Ave to Route 60.

1903
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:57,088
And I'm hoping that we can provide these residents with some relief from the heavy trucking and the noise and impact that it's having on their quality of life and the foundations of their homes.

1904
02:35:57,649 --> 02:36:02,533
Through no fault of their own, but for the fault of the fact that our public utilities repair our roadways terrible.

1905
02:36:03,033 --> 02:36:05,535
and that street maintenance is not the greatest, Mr. President.

1906
02:36:06,096 --> 02:36:17,366
So with that being said, I'm asking that my council colleagues support this resolution to request that no trucking be posted or implemented along that stretch of the roadway until such times as these infrastructure and public utility problems can be addressed.

1907
02:36:19,668 --> 02:36:20,469
Thank you, Councilor.

1908
02:36:22,270 --> 02:36:23,331
Any questions for the Council?

1909
02:36:23,371 --> 02:36:23,752
Any comments?

1910
02:36:24,212 --> 02:36:24,572
Second.

1911
02:36:25,013 --> 02:36:25,233
Okay.

1912
02:36:25,723 --> 02:36:27,025
Get a second from Councilor Behrs.

1913
02:36:27,105 --> 02:36:28,507
Anyone online here?

1914
02:36:28,607 --> 02:36:28,787
No.

1915
02:36:28,807 --> 02:36:31,791
Okay, the motion for Councilor Wright, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

1916
02:36:31,871 --> 02:36:33,393
Clerk Urnavies, please call the roll.

1917
02:36:34,595 --> 02:36:35,316
Councilor Behrs?

1918
02:36:35,356 --> 02:36:35,676
Yes.

1919
02:36:35,916 --> 02:36:36,798
Vice President Caravaglia?

1920
02:36:36,818 --> 02:36:36,878
Yes.

1921
02:36:37,619 --> 02:36:38,119
Councilor Knight?

1922
02:36:38,159 --> 02:36:38,440
Yes.

1923
02:36:38,820 --> 02:36:39,381
Councilor Marks?

1924
02:36:39,521 --> 02:36:39,922
Yes.

1925
02:36:40,102 --> 02:36:40,703
Councilor Morrell?

1926
02:36:40,923 --> 02:36:41,123
Yes.

1927
02:36:41,825 --> 02:36:45,047
Councilor Scarpelli, looks like he's briefly absent from the chamber.

1928
02:36:45,307 --> 02:36:45,967
President Fevella.

1929
02:36:46,247 --> 02:36:48,789
Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

1930
02:36:48,829 --> 02:36:49,709
The motion passes.

1931
02:36:49,729 --> 02:37:04,356
2-0-651 offered by Council and I. Be it resolved that the City of Medford apply to participate in the Google Tree Canopy Lab, a mapping tool designed to identify where trees are needed most in urban communities.

1932
02:37:04,977 --> 02:37:05,397
Council and I.

1933
02:37:05,988 --> 02:37:23,173
Yes, Mr. President, this was brought to my attention through a very famous resident on Mystic Street, one of Councilor Caviello's neighbors, a gentleman who's very involved in a number of issues in the community, whether it be the Chevalier Organ Society, or Trees for Medford, or the Shepard Brooks Estates, and the like, Mr. President.

1934
02:37:23,193 --> 02:37:33,436
But Mr. Krause sent an email out identifying this tool that Google's put out, allowing communities to use Google's mapping technology

1935
02:37:33,876 --> 02:37:45,159
to determine what areas in their community could benefit from more tree cover and tree canopy to address the issues of urban heat and the like.

1936
02:37:45,239 --> 02:37:57,122
So with that being said, Mr. President, I thought it was a very good idea and a very good opportunity for the city of Medford to implement some technology that we haven't had in the past and for us to move forward in addressing some of these concerns that we have over the degradation of our tree canopy.

1937
02:37:57,422 --> 02:38:00,423
So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the paper and move approved.

1938
02:38:01,587 --> 02:38:02,427
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1939
02:38:02,808 --> 02:38:05,428
On the motion of council, actually, any questions from the councilors?

1940
02:38:06,209 --> 02:38:07,629
Oh, yes, Councilor Morrell.

1941
02:38:07,969 --> 02:38:08,569
Thank you, Mr. President.

1942
02:38:08,589 --> 02:38:10,870
I just want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

1943
02:38:11,310 --> 02:38:15,011
Tree canopies are a moving target with development, disease, and age.

1944
02:38:15,572 --> 02:38:22,794
And as we look at the number of high heat days only increasing due to climate change, our tree canopy is more important than ever.

1945
02:38:22,874 --> 02:38:27,415
So hopefully this can aid our very small, but very in demand forestry division.

1946
02:38:27,475 --> 02:38:29,536
So I thank the council for bringing this forward.

1947
02:38:32,353 --> 02:38:33,194
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1948
02:38:33,854 --> 02:38:35,415
Any other questions from the council?

1949
02:38:35,735 --> 02:38:36,636
Anyone online?

1950
02:38:37,136 --> 02:38:38,117
Okay, seeing and hearing none.

1951
02:38:38,598 --> 02:38:41,420
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Carviello.

1952
02:38:41,440 --> 02:38:44,162
Clerk, please call the roll.

1953
02:38:44,182 --> 02:38:44,762
Councilor Behrs?

1954
02:38:44,942 --> 02:38:45,222
Yes.

1955
02:38:45,563 --> 02:38:46,483
Vice President Carviello?

1956
02:38:46,503 --> 02:38:46,643
Yes.

1957
02:38:46,984 --> 02:38:47,504
Councilor Knight?

1958
02:38:47,544 --> 02:38:47,804
Yes.

1959
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:48,645
Councilor Marks?

1960
02:38:48,685 --> 02:38:49,005
Yes.

1961
02:38:49,285 --> 02:38:49,866
Councilor Morrell?

1962
02:38:50,106 --> 02:38:50,326
Yes.

1963
02:38:50,686 --> 02:38:51,467
Councilor Scarpelli?

1964
02:38:51,527 --> 02:38:51,707
Yes.

1965
02:38:51,887 --> 02:38:52,608
President Franco?

1966
02:38:52,728 --> 02:38:52,948
Yes.

1967
02:38:53,188 --> 02:38:55,390
Senate affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1968
02:38:57,042 --> 02:39:02,563
Mr. President, I will withdraw paper 20652 as the matter is scheduled for a committee of the whole tomorrow evening.

1969
02:39:03,824 --> 02:39:11,185
Mr. President, I will withdraw paper 20653 as the paper is scheduled for a committee of the whole tomorrow evening.

1970
02:39:11,605 --> 02:39:13,906
There will be a committee of the whole regarding these papers tomorrow night.

1971
02:39:21,601 --> 02:39:23,662
Okay, 20-654 offered by Councilor Morrell.

1972
02:39:23,682 --> 02:39:32,190
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the city administration work to establish and promote an internet exchange safe zone in Medford.

1973
02:39:32,250 --> 02:39:32,811
Councilor Morrell.

1974
02:39:33,441 --> 02:39:34,282
Thank you, Mr President.

1975
02:39:34,502 --> 02:39:35,984
Yeah, this is just a simple request.

1976
02:39:36,004 --> 02:39:37,647
I had a resident reach out about this.

1977
02:39:37,667 --> 02:39:50,864
A number of cities have established these safe exchange zones for people purchasing exchanging items through Craigslist, Facebook and having an area that whether I know a lot of communities do it in the parking lot of police station or somewhere that

1978
02:39:51,685 --> 02:40:02,795
They know there is our cameras to add a level of safety so that people can support the circular economy, keep things out of the landfill and get them to new owners, but do so in a safe way.

1979
02:40:02,935 --> 02:40:08,160
And noting that there actually has been some incidents in the past in Medford where people were going.

1980
02:40:09,882 --> 02:40:17,109
They were lured by online sales that were not to be, I believe, over in Duggar Park a little, a year or two ago.

1981
02:40:17,570 --> 02:40:26,779
So I think just seeing if the administration can see working with the police are the best way they see fit to establish this safe zone, promote it, and

1982
02:40:27,580 --> 02:40:30,725
I think cities, you know, just go as far as putting a sign up and letting people know where it is.

1983
02:40:30,885 --> 02:40:37,814
I believe I've heard about this incidentally in the past, but if it's something that is still being offered, it's very hard to find.

1984
02:40:37,894 --> 02:40:43,282
So it would be great if we could offer this for the safety of our residents and people looking to buy and sell online.

1985
02:40:45,652 --> 02:40:46,652
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1986
02:40:47,093 --> 02:40:48,073
Vice President Carriello.

1987
02:40:48,213 --> 02:40:48,913
Thank you, Mr. President.

1988
02:40:48,933 --> 02:40:50,714
I thank my colleague for bringing this forward.

1989
02:40:51,394 --> 02:41:02,578
I think we've all heard many horror stories, both in the news and other things, about people buying stuff online and getting robbed and beaten up and our homes getting robbed.

1990
02:41:02,598 --> 02:41:06,500
So again, I think this is a good motion.

1991
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:08,041
I will second the motion.

1992
02:41:08,501 --> 02:41:12,722
Okay, thank you, Vice President Carriello.

1993
02:41:13,343 --> 02:41:14,363
Any questions from the council?

1994
02:41:15,288 --> 02:41:16,349
Anyone online?

1995
02:41:16,489 --> 02:41:18,071
Okay, seeing and hearing none.

1996
02:41:18,511 --> 02:41:22,976
On the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Vice President Carabiello, Clerk Bernabeu, please call the roll.

1997
02:41:23,797 --> 02:41:24,437
Councilor Behrs?

1998
02:41:24,477 --> 02:41:24,778
Yes.

1999
02:41:25,058 --> 02:41:25,919
Vice President Carabiello?

2000
02:41:25,959 --> 02:41:26,159
Yes.

2001
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:26,640
Great.

2002
02:41:27,280 --> 02:41:27,681
Councilor Knight?

2003
02:41:29,285 --> 02:41:29,505
Yes.

2004
02:41:29,785 --> 02:41:30,086
Thank you.

2005
02:41:30,126 --> 02:41:30,666
Council Marks.

2006
02:41:30,846 --> 02:41:31,207
Yes.

2007
02:41:31,387 --> 02:41:31,987
Councilor Morrell.

2008
02:41:32,167 --> 02:41:32,508
Yes.

2009
02:41:32,568 --> 02:41:33,348
Councilor Scarpelli.

2010
02:41:33,428 --> 02:41:33,689
Yes.

2011
02:41:33,729 --> 02:41:34,429
President Falco.

2012
02:41:34,509 --> 02:41:34,750
Yes.

2013
02:41:35,070 --> 02:41:36,671
Seven affirmative, zero negative.

2014
02:41:36,711 --> 02:41:37,612
The motion passes.

2015
02:41:37,632 --> 02:41:42,016
20-655 offered by Councilor Marks.

2016
02:41:42,356 --> 02:41:51,444
Whereas the Massport Community Advisory Committee, MCAC requested the FAA conduct an early feasibility assessment on runway 33L

2017
02:41:53,045 --> 02:42:12,523
departure solutions, and whereas due to the August 14th, 2020 letter sent by the Northeast Regional Administrator for the FAA, indicating the FAA had rejected all eight dispersion proposals for further study, then be it resolved that our state federal delegation continue

2018
02:42:13,344 --> 02:42:39,161
to communicate a message to the FAA that due to continued noise concentration, which has created a permanent problem in Bedford that will not go away until the FAA commits to address the problem and develop a procedure for runway 33L at Logan International Airport that geographically disperses jet departures more equitably than the current plan.

2019
02:42:39,661 --> 02:42:40,322
Councilor Marks.

2020
02:42:41,356 --> 02:42:50,080
Thank you, Mr. President, and I know myself and other members of this council, I believe Councilor Morrell put this on within the last couple of months.

2021
02:42:50,621 --> 02:43:05,227
Asking for an update of our Massport Community Advisory Committee, who have been doing yeoman's work, representing this community for issues that are confronting the noise pollution that we experience on a daily basis.

2022
02:43:07,388 --> 02:43:14,346
Recently we received a response from a representative to the MCAC who is.

2023
02:43:18,707 --> 02:43:22,430
Peter Hauk is our representative, he's been doing a great job.

2024
02:43:22,470 --> 02:43:32,158
But Mr. President, the reason why I bring this up is he made a recommendation of this council and also for our state and federal delegation.

2025
02:43:32,759 --> 02:43:38,003
And I want to make sure, because this council has been on top of this issue for many years now,

2026
02:43:40,085 --> 02:43:50,874
back in 2010, and then back in 2016 when the MIT study was initiated to look at departure and arrival procedures at Logan Airport.

2027
02:43:51,475 --> 02:43:57,760
And how to more equitably find solutions to dispersing flight traffic over the city of Medford.

2028
02:43:58,801 --> 02:44:06,867
As was stated in my resolution on August 14th, 2020, the North Regional Administrator for the FAA,

2029
02:44:07,788 --> 02:44:18,195
sent a letter to Massport Community Advisory Committee stating that they were no longer going to look at the dispersion proposals that came out of the MIT study.

2030
02:44:19,155 --> 02:44:34,005
So that was a big hit to us as a community, because we were really counting on having at least someone from the FAA consider how to ease up and disperse some of the flights that are impacting our community so daily.

2031
02:44:34,605 --> 02:45:00,365
On October 15th, the leaderships in Method, Cambridge, Arlington, and Malden responded to the FAA, their feasibility assessment with a request back to the FAA to earnestly and promptly apply the considerable resources at its disposal to propose an alternative departure procedure for runway 33L that would disperse jet noise more equitably.

2032
02:45:01,265 --> 02:45:05,888
So that was sent out on behalf of the four communities, Mr. President.

2033
02:45:06,308 --> 02:45:27,880
Then on October 21st, six members of the federal delegation sent a letter to the FAA regional administrator reinforcing the October 15th letter sent by the municipalities and their proposed ideas to reduce overflight noise over the city of Method and the surrounding communities.

2034
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:47,885
So I just ask, Mr. President, in follow up to the response that we received from Peter Hulk, dated November 16th, 2020, that we request that our state and federal delegation commit to reinforce the message.

2035
02:45:48,925 --> 02:45:56,629
That noise concentration has created permanent problem that will not go away until the FAA addresses the problem with a procedure change.

2036
02:45:57,169 --> 02:46:13,436
So I would ask that we send that to our local delegation as well as our federal delegation, Mr. President, asking that they keep up the request to make sure that the FAA and Massport realize

2037
02:46:14,016 --> 02:46:25,482
that this is considerable noise, pollution, and destruction to the quality of life for area residents, and that we stay on top of the issue, Mr. President.

2038
02:46:25,922 --> 02:46:37,427
And I appreciate, once again, our representatives on the MCAC for their due diligence, Mr. President, and their foresight on this issue.

2039
02:46:38,107 --> 02:46:38,468
Thank you.

2040
02:46:39,048 --> 02:46:40,088
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2041
02:46:41,799 --> 02:46:43,021
Clerk, do you have these?

2042
02:46:43,082 --> 02:46:43,903
Okay, you do, okay.

2043
02:46:44,204 --> 02:46:44,945
Thank you, council.

2044
02:46:44,965 --> 02:46:48,231
We have a councilor Murrell, councilor Behrs, councilor Murrell.

2045
02:46:48,863 --> 02:46:49,564
Thank you, Mr. President.

2046
02:46:49,624 --> 02:46:52,286
I do want to thank Councilor Marks for raising this.

2047
02:46:52,366 --> 02:46:59,071
And yeah, I did have the resolution a few weeks back, really piggybacking on one of his previous to get an update on this.

2048
02:46:59,151 --> 02:47:01,573
And this is the recommendation that came out.

2049
02:47:01,833 --> 02:47:16,926
And I think it's worth noting that with our federal delegation, with Representative Clark, now Assistant Speaker, and her being a member of the Quiet Skies Caucus, hopefully she can hear what we're saying above the airplane noise and really be able to make some moves on this.

2050
02:47:17,046 --> 02:47:18,047
And I also want to credit

2051
02:47:19,007 --> 02:47:35,178
Our representatives, the administration, the previous administration for taking the approach of working with our neighboring cities on this, because in the Globe today, there was a story about Milton and Quincy kind of going at each other as far as plans to mitigate their airplane traffic and noise.

2052
02:47:35,398 --> 02:47:40,121
And I think moving forward together, hopefully, hopefully we'll get some movement on this.

2053
02:47:40,461 --> 02:47:42,323
But again, I thank Councilor Marks for raising this.

2054
02:47:43,884 --> 02:47:44,984
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

2055
02:47:45,044 --> 02:47:45,745
Councilor Peers.

2056
02:47:46,123 --> 02:47:46,904
Thank you, Mr. President.

2057
02:47:46,924 --> 02:47:51,428
Thank you to Councilor Morrell, Councilor Marks for your work on this issue.

2058
02:47:51,448 --> 02:47:54,452
It was particularly bad this weekend.

2059
02:47:54,772 --> 02:48:01,359
I live in North Medford, but it wasn't the departures, it was the arrivals.

2060
02:48:02,079 --> 02:48:07,505
So I would just propose an amendment that, I don't know about the

2061
02:48:07,905 --> 02:48:17,412
I guess the FAA, but especially Massport, explore alternatives to using runway 15R for arrivals.

2062
02:48:19,874 --> 02:48:26,540
It's a little bit different than the issue with departures, which as we know is complicated by these waypoints and all the other things that have been discussed for years.

2063
02:48:27,622 --> 02:48:32,585
But there's been a huge spike in the number of arrivals coming in on runway 15R in 2020.

2064
02:48:32,745 --> 02:48:37,528
It's the highest, I think, since 2014 or 2015, literally in the thousands.

2065
02:48:38,768 --> 02:48:40,349
So permanent alternatives would be great.

2066
02:48:40,409 --> 02:48:53,376
I also think alternatives during the pandemic, if maybe for the language for the amendment, if Massport can't find alternatives, permanent alternatives, consider alternatives for the duration of the pandemic.

2067
02:48:53,897 --> 02:48:55,998
As we know, people are still spending a lot of time at home.

2068
02:48:56,758 --> 02:48:57,658
I'm trying to work.

2069
02:48:57,698 --> 02:48:58,799
It's a huge disruption.

2070
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:04,721
The noise to people trying to work, people trying to go to school online, et cetera.

2071
02:49:05,621 --> 02:49:18,085
So if the amendment would be that Massport review alternatives for arrivals on runway 15R and also review pandemic related options for those arrivals.

2072
02:49:22,327 --> 02:49:23,447
Councilor Beers, thank you.

2073
02:49:27,308 --> 02:49:28,509
Any other questions from the council?

2074
02:49:29,369 --> 02:49:32,130
Anyone has a hand up?

2075
02:49:32,751 --> 02:49:43,176
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, as amended by Councilor Beers.

2076
02:49:44,136 --> 02:49:45,237
Clerk Urnaby, please call the roll.

2077
02:49:49,395 --> 02:49:49,956
Councilor Bears.

2078
02:49:50,096 --> 02:49:50,376
Yes.

2079
02:49:50,836 --> 02:49:51,737
Vice-President Caravaglia.

2080
02:49:51,957 --> 02:49:52,197
Yes.

2081
02:49:52,478 --> 02:49:52,998
Councilor Knight.

2082
02:49:53,078 --> 02:49:53,318
Yes.

2083
02:49:53,599 --> 02:49:54,179
Councilor Marks.

2084
02:49:54,379 --> 02:49:54,740
Yes.

2085
02:49:54,960 --> 02:49:55,580
Councilor Morrell.

2086
02:49:55,841 --> 02:49:56,061
Yes.

2087
02:49:56,341 --> 02:49:57,122
Councilor Scarpelli.

2088
02:49:57,222 --> 02:49:57,382
Yes.

2089
02:49:57,602 --> 02:49:58,303
President Falcone.

2090
02:49:59,324 --> 02:50:01,766
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

2091
02:50:04,428 --> 02:50:08,431
Reports to committees.

2092
02:50:11,454 --> 02:50:12,295
Reports to committees.

2093
02:50:14,526 --> 02:50:19,408
20-625, November 21st, 2020, Community of the Whole report.

2094
02:50:19,788 --> 02:50:24,411
We had a Community of the Whole on Saturday, November 21st, 2020 at 11 a.m.

2095
02:50:25,031 --> 02:50:27,993
It was a site visit that was well attended.

2096
02:50:28,433 --> 02:50:36,137
And there was a really good discussion regarding, it was actually at the intersection of Fulton Spring Road and Fern Road.

2097
02:50:36,797 --> 02:50:41,540
And the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the safety concerns related to the traffic in the North Bedford neighborhood

2098
02:50:42,393 --> 02:50:44,555
Councilor Marks, you brought forward that resolution.

2099
02:50:44,575 --> 02:50:56,466
And it was a really good discussion and conversation about the issues that are going on, the traffic issues specifically with regards to everything that from, and that whole North Bedford neighborhood there.

2100
02:50:57,046 --> 02:51:03,332
Just to let everyone know, the crosswalks have been installed and the stop lines have been installed as well.

2101
02:51:03,832 --> 02:51:07,315
So some work has begun on that initiative.

2102
02:51:07,876 --> 02:51:07,996
So,

2103
02:51:10,790 --> 02:51:12,491
So we will have a follow up meeting.

2104
02:51:12,551 --> 02:51:14,552
I think we're going to, I'm sorry.

2105
02:51:15,313 --> 02:51:16,193
They're all working.

2106
02:51:16,254 --> 02:51:17,754
Well, that's a good question.

2107
02:51:18,035 --> 02:51:18,335
Actually.

2108
02:51:18,475 --> 02:51:20,576
And they actually had enforcement there the other day as well.

2109
02:51:21,077 --> 02:51:22,518
So the police were there enforcing them.

2110
02:51:22,618 --> 02:51:25,159
So, uh, there's a number of people get pulled over.

2111
02:51:25,179 --> 02:51:28,321
Uh, it actually got someone, someone get pulled over tonight too.

2112
02:51:28,421 --> 02:51:33,625
So, um, with that being said, it looks like they're working on some of these, uh, things.

2113
02:51:33,845 --> 02:51:37,207
And, uh, I believe we're going to have a follow up meeting on this as well.

2114
02:51:37,767 --> 02:51:38,588
Uh, just to, uh,

2115
02:51:40,126 --> 02:51:43,288
kind of see how we'll move forward in the future with some of the other suggestions that were made.

2116
02:51:43,868 --> 02:51:45,309
Councilor Marks.

2117
02:51:45,409 --> 02:51:46,390
Thank you, Mr. President.

2118
02:51:47,090 --> 02:51:54,215
And I want to thank you for setting up that meeting and inviting all the city players to the table.

2119
02:51:54,955 --> 02:52:02,700
It was a great meeting and my council colleagues couldn't ask better questions to get results on behalf of the neighborhood.

2120
02:52:03,340 --> 02:52:07,263
I would just ask that we do set up the follow-up meeting because that was our commitment.

2121
02:52:07,903 --> 02:52:22,273
to the neighborhood and also I know we met at the corner of Fulton Spring and Fern, but there were a number of other hotspot areas going up Fulton Spring Road that also need to be addressed.

2122
02:52:22,313 --> 02:52:31,039
And I'm hoping that on this next meeting, we can start picking away little by little on some of the other areas and staying on top of them.

2123
02:52:31,579 --> 02:52:36,803
And I just want to thank my colleagues for taking a Saturday out and going down there and thank the residents for coming out.

2124
02:52:38,524 --> 02:52:45,968
I firmly believe we have to do more of that because I think it's a good way.

2125
02:52:46,308 --> 02:52:47,669
We can talk and talk and talk.

2126
02:52:48,029 --> 02:52:50,230
It's a good way of getting issues addressed.

2127
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:54,833
We bring the department heads and actually witness firsthand what's going on.

2128
02:52:55,073 --> 02:52:58,195
How many cars do we see roll through that four way stop?

2129
02:52:58,335 --> 02:52:59,356
You are correct, many.

2130
02:53:00,056 --> 02:53:02,457
Many, we could have given out 100 tickets.

2131
02:53:03,598 --> 02:53:07,840
Mr. President, it was really, it was a dangerous area, but we slowed them down.

2132
02:53:07,880 --> 02:53:15,764
There were so many of us, we actually slowed them down, but I think it shows you what's happening in our community, in every neighborhood of this community.

2133
02:53:15,824 --> 02:53:20,767
So I thank you for your leadership, Mr. President, and look forward to the upcoming meeting.

2134
02:53:20,967 --> 02:53:22,048
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2135
02:53:24,869 --> 02:53:30,112
I was just, you know, there were 50 of us out there and they were still blowing through the intersection.

2136
02:53:30,452 --> 02:53:32,613
So it was just amazing.

2137
02:53:34,343 --> 02:53:35,344
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

2138
02:53:35,965 --> 02:53:36,926
Thank you, Councilor Moxley.

2139
02:53:36,946 --> 02:53:38,047
Thank you to all the councilors.

2140
02:53:38,087 --> 02:53:39,108
Councilor Moxley hit it on the head.

2141
02:53:39,128 --> 02:53:40,289
There were a lot of great questions.

2142
02:53:40,730 --> 02:53:47,616
And thank you to the residents who came and asked those questions and pointed out the many issues that need to be addressed in that area.

2143
02:53:48,037 --> 02:53:53,762
So on the motion of Councilor Night to approve the report.

2144
02:53:53,802 --> 02:53:57,526
Seconded by Vice President Caviello, Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

2145
02:54:00,664 --> 02:54:01,204
Councilor Behrs.

2146
02:54:01,424 --> 02:54:01,725

Yes.

Councilor Morrell.

2154
02:54:06,347 --> 02:54:06,587
Yes.

2155
02:54:06,947 --> 02:54:07,688
Councilor Scarpelli.

2161
02:54:11,650 --> 02:54:16,852
20-641, November 24th, 2020 committee, the whole report.

2162
02:54:18,633 --> 02:54:27,118
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the small cell telecommunications equipment siting in the city of Medford and the potential litigation stemming from the same

2163
02:54:28,043 --> 02:54:37,727
I believe the outcome of that was that we were going to, I believe that the... Yes, that is correct.

2164
02:54:38,007 --> 02:54:38,568
That is correct.

2165
02:54:38,608 --> 02:54:43,870
On the motion of call tonight to approve, seconded by... Vice President Cabral, please call the roll.

2166
02:54:50,192 --> 02:54:50,832
Councilor Behrs?

Yes.

2168
02:54:51,373 --> 02:54:52,253
Vice President Caravaglio?

2169
02:54:52,273 --> 02:54:52,494
Yes.

2170
02:54:52,654 --> 02:54:53,194
Councilor Night?

2171
02:54:53,234 --> 02:54:53,594
Yes.

2172
02:54:53,634 --> 02:54:54,195
Councilor Marks?

2173
02:54:54,555 --> 02:54:54,915
Yes.

2174
02:54:55,015 --> 02:54:55,676
Councilor Morrell?

2175
02:54:55,876 --> 02:54:56,136
Yes.

2176
02:54:56,256 --> 02:54:57,057
Councilor Scarpelli?

2177
02:54:57,557 --> 02:54:57,817
Yes.

2178
02:54:57,977 --> 02:54:58,678
President Fevella?

2179
02:54:59,098 --> 02:54:59,358
Yes.

02:54:59,438 --> 02:55:00,899

Councilor Behrs.

Yes.

2187
02:55:22,338 --> 02:55:23,199
Vice-president Caraviello.

2188
02:55:23,339 --> 02:55:23,539
Yes.

2189
02:55:23,859 --> 02:55:24,379
Councilor Night.

2190
02:55:24,439 --> 02:55:24,639
Yes.

2191
02:55:24,879 --> 02:55:25,419
Councilor Marks.

2192
02:55:25,559 --> 02:55:25,860
Yes.

2193
02:55:26,020 --> 02:55:26,620
Councilor Morrell.

2194
02:55:26,820 --> 02:55:27,080
Yes.

2195
02:55:27,280 --> 02:55:28,040
Councilor Scarpelli.

2196
02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:28,460
Yes.

2197
02:55:28,580 --> 02:55:29,320
President Fevella, go.

2198
02:55:29,381 --> 02:55:32,601
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2199
02:55:32,781 --> 02:55:35,982
Okay, we have two papers in the hands of the clerk.

2200
02:55:36,563 --> 02:55:37,163
Mr. President.

2201
02:55:37,383 --> 02:55:38,523
Yes, Councilor Marks.

2202
02:55:38,583 --> 02:55:44,345
I would just ask that the entire council be named on both those papers.

2203
02:55:44,785 --> 02:55:45,085
Okay.

2204
02:55:45,225 --> 02:55:45,525
Thank you.

2205
02:55:46,826 --> 02:55:47,786
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2206
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:51,241
It's offered by the Memphis City Council 20-657.

2207
02:55:51,501 --> 02:55:59,383
Be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for a long time Memphis resident and educator Sandra Sacco on a recent passing.

2208
02:55:59,864 --> 02:56:02,765
Be it further resolved that this meeting be dedicated in her memory.

2209
02:56:03,465 --> 02:56:04,045
Councilor Marks.

2210
02:56:05,265 --> 02:56:06,286
Thank you, Mr. President.

2211
02:56:06,326 --> 02:56:09,987
This truly is a big loss for the community.

2212
02:56:10,007 --> 02:56:18,130
You know, Sandy was one of the first people I met in public office back some 26 years ago.

2213
02:56:20,572 --> 02:56:35,702
And you couldn't meet a kinder, gentler person that just, for many years she served as the Program Administrator for the Early Child Care Program within the Meffitt Public Schools.

2214
02:56:36,342 --> 02:56:38,284
She was just a sweetheart of a person.

2215
02:56:39,064 --> 02:56:44,850
She was devoted to her family and friends, a truly loving mother, wife, sister.

2216
02:56:45,650 --> 02:56:54,738
And what I didn't know about Sandy, and she was a woman of many talents, she was an accomplished and published poet, which I never knew.

2217
02:56:55,479 --> 02:56:57,521
And she was an accomplished world traveler.

2218
02:56:59,222 --> 02:57:01,444
And, you know, she really is,

2219
02:57:03,290 --> 02:57:06,912
There's going to be a hole in this community that's missing, Mr. President.

2220
02:57:06,932 --> 02:57:17,398
Because when you lose someone of that character, someone of that stature, someone that put kids first, I don't know if you can recover from that.

2221
02:57:18,319 --> 02:57:26,724
And I just want to, on behalf of the city council, wish her family well and her husband Rick, who we all know.

2222
02:57:28,765 --> 02:57:32,107
I wish him well, Mr. President, in this very difficult time.

2223
02:57:33,252 --> 02:57:34,192
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2224
02:57:35,212 --> 02:57:36,293
Councilor Scarpell.

2225
02:57:36,373 --> 02:57:37,453
Thank you, Mr. President.

2226
02:57:37,533 --> 02:57:42,054
Again, I think Councilor Marks really hit it right on the head.

2227
02:57:43,074 --> 02:57:43,314
Ms.

2228
02:57:43,334 --> 02:57:44,994
Sacco was a great person.

2229
02:57:46,375 --> 02:57:48,055
Two great sons, Eric and Brian.

2230
02:57:49,575 --> 02:57:55,916
Brian's actually a teacher in the system now, and she handed those traits off to her children.

2231
02:57:56,777 --> 02:57:58,457
And again, a great family.

2232
02:58:00,318 --> 02:58:22,606
You know that if you drive down Ridgeway Road, you know that they were they were very very committed to that neighborhood and the safety of that neighborhood and just just great people and like we said we'll lose you too many of the patriarchs of this community and It's it's sad to see so our heartfelt sympathy to the family.

2233
02:58:22,966 --> 02:58:28,368
Thank you Our thoughts and prayers going to the

2234
02:58:29,526 --> 02:58:39,473
Sacco family on the motion of on behalf of the city council clerk her to be as could you please call the roll.

2235
02:58:42,495 --> 02:58:43,075
Council bears.

2236
02:58:43,275 --> 02:58:43,515
Yes.

2237
02:58:44,016 --> 02:58:45,817
Vice President Kirby on council night.

2238
02:58:46,457 --> 02:58:47,058
Council marks.

2239
02:58:47,298 --> 02:58:47,598
Yes.

2240
02:58:48,158 --> 02:58:48,739
Council Morrell.

2241
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:49,179
Yes.

2242
02:58:49,799 --> 02:58:50,540
Councilor Scarpelli.

2243
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:50,760
Yes.

2244
02:58:51,160 --> 02:58:51,841
President Falco.

2245
02:58:51,941 --> 02:58:52,461
Yes.

2246
02:58:52,541 --> 02:58:55,123
70 affirmative zero in the negative motion passes.

2247
02:58:56,667 --> 02:59:04,168
20-658 offered by the Memphis City Council, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for a long time after resident Ralph Surrett on his recent passing.

2248
02:59:04,687 --> 02:59:05,587
Councilor Locks.

2249
02:59:05,707 --> 02:59:06,808
Thank you, Mr. President.

2250
02:59:07,268 --> 02:59:16,151
For those that have been around this city for a number of years, Ralph Surrett was our faithful cameraman for a lot of years in this corner room.

2251
02:59:16,871 --> 02:59:29,655
You probably never saw him because he was very behind the scenes, never wanted any public light, was truly a kind, gentle man when you talk to him.

2252
02:59:30,155 --> 02:59:45,784
He'd always tell you about what's going on in local news and he was a real animal lover and someone that was an advocate for animals within this community and a graduate of the Meffitt Vocational School and someone that

2253
02:59:47,305 --> 02:59:50,768
was a true Methodite for a lot of years, Mr. President.

2254
02:59:51,388 --> 03:00:09,882
And on behalf of his family, I want to dedicate this meeting and dedication to Ralph Surrett for his many years of service to this community and to the Method City Council, Mr. President.

2255
03:00:10,302 --> 03:00:11,083
Thank you, Councilman Marks.

2256
03:00:11,103 --> 03:00:11,963
Thank you.

2257
03:00:13,204 --> 03:00:15,105
On that motion, seconded by?

2258
03:00:16,197 --> 03:00:18,619
It's got the motion of the city council, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2259
03:00:19,480 --> 03:00:20,721
Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

2260
03:00:22,122 --> 03:00:22,662
Councilor Behrs?

2261
03:00:23,003 --> 03:00:23,263
Yes.

2262
03:00:23,503 --> 03:00:24,384
Vice President Carabiello?

2263
03:00:24,404 --> 03:00:24,464
Yes.

2264
03:00:24,804 --> 03:00:25,305
Councilor Knight?

2265
03:00:25,445 --> 03:00:25,685
Yes.

2266
03:00:25,885 --> 03:00:26,426
Councilor Marks?

2267
03:00:26,686 --> 03:00:27,026
Yes.

2268
03:00:27,186 --> 03:00:27,767
Councilor Morrell?

2269
03:00:27,967 --> 03:00:28,187
Yes.

2270
03:00:28,407 --> 03:00:29,188
Councilor Scarpelli?

2271
03:00:29,308 --> 03:00:29,508
Yes.

2272
03:00:29,628 --> 03:00:30,329
President Feldkamp?

2273
03:00:30,429 --> 03:00:30,649
Yes.

2274
03:00:30,829 --> 03:00:32,271
And the affirmative is zero and the negative.

2275
03:00:32,291 --> 03:00:33,031
The motion passes.

2276
03:00:33,071 --> 03:00:37,395
At this point in time, I would ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

2277
03:00:58,283 --> 03:00:59,584
Thank you.

2278
03:00:59,604 --> 03:01:00,365
Vice President Caviello.

2279
03:01:03,107 --> 03:01:04,208
Thank you, Mr. President.

2280
03:01:04,228 --> 03:01:07,891
Before we adjourn this evening, I'd like to reach out to the community.

2281
03:01:08,611 --> 03:01:11,053
Christmas is three weeks away.

2282
03:01:11,073 --> 03:01:14,696
A lot of need in the community this year.

2283
03:01:14,716 --> 03:01:15,957
A lot of families are going to need some help.

2284
03:01:18,052 --> 03:01:24,117
There's a lot of good organizations that are out there doing some work, the Rotary, the Kiwanis, the Memphis Family Network.

2285
03:01:25,137 --> 03:01:29,280
Reach out to them, help them out with the donation for this year's holidays.

2286
03:01:31,432 --> 03:01:38,354
Again, and if you don't want to reach out to them, ask around your neighborhood, ask for a family that could use some help, some food, some things.

2287
03:01:38,955 --> 03:01:46,117
I've already sent out five families for adoption, and you'd be surprised what the kids ask for.

2288
03:01:46,157 --> 03:01:50,439
They're not asking for toys, they're asking for clothes, things for their mother, so again.

2289
03:01:51,379 --> 03:01:55,960
I would hope people in the community step up and help all these families.

2290
03:01:56,020 --> 03:01:57,781
If you need a family, call me, I'll help you out.

2291
03:01:58,481 --> 03:02:04,623
But let's say a lot of organizations in the city that are all stepping up and businesses stepping up to help out these families.

2292
03:02:04,663 --> 03:02:11,105
Indeed, especially during, let's say, this year more than other years, people need more help than ever.

2293
03:02:11,145 --> 03:02:13,546
So reach out and help them out.

2294
03:02:14,246 --> 03:02:15,646
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

2295
03:02:15,666 --> 03:02:15,966
Thank you.

2296
03:02:16,387 --> 03:02:17,427
Can we have a hand up here?

2297
03:02:26,765 --> 03:02:27,925
There you go, Harold.

2298
03:02:28,286 --> 03:02:28,966
Harold McGill.

2299
03:02:30,727 --> 03:02:32,647
Thank you, President Falco.

2300
03:02:32,667 --> 03:02:37,489
Harry McGill, 100 Main Street, president of the Metropolitan Police Patrolmen's Association.

2301
03:02:39,290 --> 03:02:53,375
I brought up the new building earlier during the meeting, and it's been brought to my attention that as of right now, we do not have a contractor or a maintenance company working in this building to keep the building clean.

2302
03:02:56,985 --> 03:03:00,706
I don't want to use the word emergency because I think it's been thrown around too much tonight.

2303
03:03:00,746 --> 03:03:04,127
But that needs to be addressed, and it needs to be addressed quickly.

2304
03:03:04,507 --> 03:03:05,947
The building's been open for a week now.

2305
03:03:05,967 --> 03:03:07,428
It's a 24-7 building.

2306
03:03:08,348 --> 03:03:09,968
The city seemed to get this right.

2307
03:03:10,729 --> 03:03:15,590
Let's not get something right and then turn it into a wrong by not maintaining this building.

2308
03:03:16,910 --> 03:03:22,352
The council needs, the council, the mayor, however it has to happen, that needs to happen as quickly as possible.

2309
03:03:22,772 --> 03:03:26,573
We need some people in here to get the building clean and to maintain the building.

2310
03:03:28,969 --> 03:03:40,034
I remember specifically asking that question during the budget because building maintenance has always been a big concern, not only to me, but I think the entire city council.

2311
03:03:40,714 --> 03:03:46,637
And here we are, we're building new facilities and we need to make sure that they're maintained.

2312
03:03:47,137 --> 03:03:52,301
and we need to make sure that the preventive maintenance gets done, because if it doesn't get done, you know what happens.

2313
03:03:52,961 --> 03:03:56,584
So it's a huge, to me, it needs to be a huge focus.

2314
03:03:57,124 --> 03:03:57,945
It wasn't in the budget.

2315
03:03:57,985 --> 03:04:06,591
I'm not sure if Dave wants to take that question or answer on behalf of the administration, but to me, and I think to many of the councils, it's a major concern.

2316
03:04:06,731 --> 03:04:07,351
Mr. President.

2317
03:04:07,371 --> 03:04:09,753
Can I just, can I add something?

2318
03:04:09,913 --> 03:04:10,514
Yes, please.

2319
03:04:10,714 --> 03:04:14,837
The first weekend we were in the building, we had barrels all flowing.

2320
03:04:16,132 --> 03:04:17,793
We have nowhere to put this trash on.

2321
03:04:19,214 --> 03:04:27,620
So I know there's something about a facilities manager that's supposed to take care of the police department, the library, and other cities' buildings.

2322
03:04:29,302 --> 03:04:30,322
That should be looked at.

2323
03:04:31,463 --> 03:04:34,185
We actually were in the old building today.

2324
03:04:34,205 --> 03:04:35,846
We did some training in the old building.

2325
03:04:36,687 --> 03:04:38,888
And that building's not being maintained either.

2326
03:04:38,908 --> 03:04:40,650
The contract over there is expired.

2327
03:04:44,712 --> 03:04:49,215
If the city doesn't address these issues, that building is going to deteriorate rapidly.

2328
03:04:49,916 --> 03:04:52,958
So I urge the council.

2329
03:04:53,038 --> 03:04:58,202
I urge the mayor to, to, to get that done as quickly as possible.

2330
03:04:58,422 --> 03:04:58,842
Thank you.

2331
03:04:59,803 --> 03:05:00,103
Thank you.

2332
03:05:00,123 --> 03:05:00,584
Okay.

2333
03:05:04,408 --> 03:05:05,769
Carol, thank you very much, appreciate it.

2334
03:05:06,469 --> 03:05:20,379
Mr. President, just very briefly in response to Mr. McElroy, there's two separate issues, the preventative maintenance facilities management aspect of it, which we've kind of talked a great deal about the last couple of weeks.

2335
03:05:20,699 --> 03:05:23,841
The other issue is the cleaning contracts that have since expired.

2336
03:05:24,282 --> 03:05:26,603
There were several contracts that were expired.

2337
03:05:26,623 --> 03:05:32,948
We're looking to, procurement is working on consolidating those and getting a better value and a better service based upon those.

2338
03:05:33,448 --> 03:05:37,469
working closely with Chief Buckley in order to make sure that that building does get clean.

2339
03:05:38,089 --> 03:05:41,150
We'll take all the steps we need to in order to make sure that that building is taken care of.

2340
03:05:41,210 --> 03:05:42,830
It's a priority of the mayor that that's done.

2341
03:05:43,291 --> 03:05:49,772
We don't want it to go down the tubes at all, especially not in the first week that we've got the building open.

2342
03:05:49,812 --> 03:05:51,473
So we are working on it as quickly as possible.

2343
03:05:51,633 --> 03:05:52,333
Thank you very much.

2344
03:05:52,373 --> 03:05:56,654
Mr. President, just if Dave could, how long is as quickly as possible?

2345
03:05:58,013 --> 03:06:00,754
we're going to be able to do that within the next couple of weeks.

2346
03:06:00,774 --> 03:06:02,975
As long as it's he has to be procured under 30 day.

2347
03:06:02,995 --> 03:06:04,756
So procurement office is working on that very.

2348
03:06:05,016 --> 03:06:08,797
We had people walk through all the buildings recently to give us an adequate price.

2349
03:06:08,817 --> 03:06:14,840
There is going to be a price differential between this is a big new that has to be that has to be clean.

2350
03:06:14,860 --> 03:06:18,821
So there is a price differential, but they're working as quickly as they can within the confines of

2351
03:06:29,833 --> 03:06:32,178
is there a cleaner working in the police station now?

2352
03:06:32,198 --> 03:06:33,520
I'll have to check with the chief.

2353
03:06:33,921 --> 03:06:39,372
It was my impression that the contract has since expired for that particular service and we're in the process of looking into it.

2354
03:06:40,243 --> 03:06:42,925
It sounds like that trash is just piling up.

2355
03:06:42,965 --> 03:06:47,548
We have a point of information offered by Councilor Scott Peli.

2356
03:06:47,588 --> 03:06:48,469
Councilor Scott Peli.

2357
03:06:49,509 --> 03:06:55,673
To the chief of staff, we don't have an active member of DPW that can at least empty the barrels.

2358
03:06:56,574 --> 03:06:58,815
That's one of the options that we're looking into.

2359
03:06:58,835 --> 03:07:01,397
We're not going to let it go to waste.

2360
03:07:01,717 --> 03:07:02,778
We're working on it now.

2361
03:07:03,098 --> 03:07:03,439
Thank you.

2362
03:07:06,821 --> 03:07:07,041
Okay.

2363
03:07:09,101 --> 03:07:09,501
Thank you.

2364
03:07:10,282 --> 03:07:12,383
Oh, I'm sorry.

2365
03:07:12,763 --> 03:07:14,464
Harold McGillivray.

2366
03:07:15,505 --> 03:07:15,765
Yeah.

2367
03:07:17,346 --> 03:07:21,468
I did say the barrels are overflowing, but they are getting empty by administrative personnel over here.

2368
03:07:21,988 --> 03:07:22,548
Oh, okay.

2369
03:07:23,189 --> 03:07:30,573
They are getting empty, but I'm not quite sure that lieutenants, captains, and chiefs of police should be emptying barrels.

2370
03:07:32,954 --> 03:07:34,255
So I think we need a cleaning company.

2371
03:07:36,422 --> 03:07:38,064
Very good point.

2372
03:07:41,206 --> 03:07:43,569
Harold, thank you very much.

2373
03:07:44,389 --> 03:07:48,213
Okay, so we are on to the records.

2374
03:07:52,152 --> 03:07:57,814
Records, the records of the meeting of November 24th, 2012 were passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

2375
03:07:58,274 --> 03:08:00,054
Councilor Scarpelli, how did you find those records?

2376
03:08:00,174 --> 03:08:02,155
I found them in order, Mr. President, move approval.

2377
03:08:02,315 --> 03:08:05,796

2388
03:08:15,619 --> 03:08:16,179
Yes, what?

2389
03:08:16,619 --> 03:08:17,399
Councilor Morrell?

2390
03:08:17,619 --> 03:08:17,800

The motion passes.

2398
03:08:27,814 --> 03:08:29,374
Is there anyone on that?

2399
03:08:29,994 --> 03:08:31,695
There's public participation.

2400
03:08:31,735 --> 03:08:33,955
Is anybody on for public participation?

2401
03:08:34,635 --> 03:08:37,716
I don't see anybody's hands up, so I'm thinking no.

2402
03:08:39,456 --> 03:08:40,837
Any further motions from the council?

2403
03:08:41,257 --> 03:08:41,617
