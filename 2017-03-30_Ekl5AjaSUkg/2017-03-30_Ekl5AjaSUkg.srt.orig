Aye.

00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:46,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed?

14
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:47,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

15
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:48,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:01:03,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I ask to suspend the rules to allow one of our prestigious Medford public school teachers to come up and address the council relative to a fundraising drive that he is participating in in the memory of one of our deceased Medford public school students.

17
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:07,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to call Anthony Petrellis to the podium, Mr. President.

18
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:10,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

19
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:13,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

20
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:14,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Anthony Petralas.

21
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:17,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a fifth grade teacher at the McGlynn Elementary School.

22
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:21,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't live in Mefford, but I'm a teacher here, so.

23
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:29,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am here for the One Mission Buzz Off, which is taking place June 4th at Gillette Stadium.

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Council and Knight for putting us on the agenda tonight.

25
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:39,245
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to come here last year, and after being here, we had a lot of community

26
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:44,392
[SPEAKER_03]: reach out to us about being involved and getting involved in donations and everything else.

27
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:47,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you guys are a pretty popular show, I guess.

28
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:49,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's a great thing.

29
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,598
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, thank you guys for taking the time to have us.

30
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:55,101
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, this takes place June 4th at Gillette Stadium.

31
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:56,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the One Mission Buzz-Off.

32
00:01:56,362 --> 00:02:04,168
[SPEAKER_03]: And we buzz in honor of Hemal Duferrage, who was a student who passed away in third grade at the McGlynn Elementary School of Spinal Cancer.

33
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:09,092
[SPEAKER_03]: A few years after that, we hosted a basketball game in our school in his honor.

34
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:10,853
[SPEAKER_03]: fifth grade versus teacher's game.

35
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:17,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And since then, we have now kind of moved and shifted to participating in the One Mission Buzz Off.

36
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, we were able to raise over $15,000.

37
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:24,985
[SPEAKER_03]: The year before, it was over $10,000.

38
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:29,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So the past few years, we've raised over $25,000 in his honor.

39
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:37,436
[SPEAKER_03]: So what One Mission does, which is so great, is it's one of those charities that gives to the families in need

40
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,749
[SPEAKER_03]: as the children and the family are going through the cancer.

41
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:51,839
[SPEAKER_03]: So they donate a lot to the hospitals, they bring Christmas to the hospitals, they bring birthdays to the hospitals, they help parents with costs, parking garage if you're, you know, with the Mass General or the Children's Hospital, and it can get very pricey.

42
00:02:52,259 --> 00:03:03,129
[SPEAKER_03]: So the money is given to the families who are directly affected, which is kind of, you know, very rare of a lot of charities and something that just really stood out to us as a great mission statement for them.

43
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:05,692
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past we've had teachers buzz.

44
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:08,713
[SPEAKER_03]: This year we are fortunate enough to have the word spread.

45
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:10,574
[SPEAKER_03]: We have currently five teachers.

46
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:17,735
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a police officer, the athletic director, the hockey coach, the baseball coach, several baseball players, and this year even some students.

47
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:20,856
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our team members has been doing it since he's been in kindergarten.

48
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:23,717
[SPEAKER_03]: He's now in second grade and he looks forward to it.

49
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:28,858
[SPEAKER_03]: He starts growing his hair in October and his mom takes pictures every month to see how much his hair has grown.

50
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,089
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing to get the kids really involved in the city.

51
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal next year is to actually host our own Buzz Off here in Medford.

52
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:43,633
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this year the word has gotten out a lot and we've gotten contacted by so many different people to see how they could be a part of it.

53
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:48,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't have to shave your head to be a part of the team and be a part of the cause and help out.

54
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:57,838
[SPEAKER_03]: This year we're having our first annual fundraiser for the One Mission Buzz Off and we are having a John Brewers April 13th on a Thursday.

55
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:01,633
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Holy Thursday, I believe, is the day.

56
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:05,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to have over 25 different raffles there.

57
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:06,615
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a DJ there.

58
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:10,757
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, price of the door, we ask is $15 for donation at the door.

59
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:12,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're really excited about this.

60
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:23,222
[SPEAKER_03]: We have over about 125 people that have already committed to coming and a lot of people from the community just reaching out on Facebook and email, asking to donate raffles and baskets and so on.

61
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:26,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we couldn't be happier that the community is so behind us.

62
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:30,380
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, too, we also try to get the schools really involved in it.

63
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,024
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the Method Votek actually create our t-shirt design.

64
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:41,269
[SPEAKER_03]: So we put it out to them a couple weeks ago, and over 15 students submitted t-shirt designs to us.

65
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,791
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, you know, picked through the team.

66
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:44,772
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Jackson.

67
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,014
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our second grade I was just talking about here.

68
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:48,956
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite a nice set of hair he's got there.

69
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:55,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had over 15 different t-shirt designs.

70
00:04:56,312 --> 00:05:01,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And we ended up picking a senior at the Meffitt Vogue, Liam Spellman, who came up with our t-shirt design.

71
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:03,034
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our t-shirt from last year.

72
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:06,135
[SPEAKER_03]: This year we're doing more of the Meffitt blue and white colors.

73
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:10,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're very thankful that, you know, Ms.

74
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Riccio at the Vogue was able to help us out.

75
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:19,959
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have the video production students creating a big video that's going to be put on the city Facebook page very soon.

76
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:25,113
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have a meeting with the mayor tomorrow to kind of get a couple words from her to be putting on the video.

77
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:35,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're hoping to have it wrapped up in the next couple of weeks that it will be put on every social media page, I'm sure, out there so people can, you know, really see and learn about the cause and what we're doing.

78
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,884
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, the baseball team is participating this year.

79
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:41,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I reached out to Coach Nestor very early in January.

80
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,149
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very receptive towards it and is very excited.

81
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:55,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also going to be hanging a banner in front of City Hall fairly soon once it comes in for people to drive by and see what this event is and what we're doing.

82
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of all I have here.

83
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,801
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to spread the awareness.

84
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:01,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank everybody.

85
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:08,402
[SPEAKER_03]: There's several council people here that have donated to us already and really helped us spread the word.

86
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:09,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were very thankful last year.

87
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:12,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thought it'd be great to come back and A, say thank you, and B,

88
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,994
[SPEAKER_03]: spread the word even more of how much we've grown over the course of the year.

89
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:19,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

90
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:23,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's April 13th.

91
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:26,075
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts at 7 o'clock.

92
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:27,796
[SPEAKER_02]: John Brewers?

93
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:28,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

94
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:35,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I hear you correctly when you said the athletic director was going to be participating in this event?

95
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:37,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, off-site.

96
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:40,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and the hockey coach are going to be buzzing off-site.

97
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can't wait to see that.

98
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:54,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony, thank you very much for what you do in the community.

99
00:06:55,626 --> 00:07:05,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Also you have here with you is Chris Murphy, one of the members of the park commission here in the city of Medford, who's been a long time activist in the community and someone that's given so much back to the city of Medford.

100
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to thank you guys for coming down here this evening and thank you for the work that you do.

101
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:15,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I am interested to hear from a friend here about what he thinks about the Buzz Off and how much fun he's had in participating.

102
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackson, that's your buddy.

103
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

104
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:21,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So how much money have you got?

105
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:23,042
[SPEAKER_10]: What is your name, young man?

106
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:24,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Jackson.

107
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:27,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming down tonight, Jackson.

108
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,083
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got a pretty good head of hair.

109
00:07:28,403 --> 00:07:28,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

110
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:29,703
[SPEAKER_09]: My mom did it.

111
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:35,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackson, can I come down so you can shave my head?

112
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:36,005
Sure.

113
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:40,929
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you start growing your hair?

114
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:41,929
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

115
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,370
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you start growing your hair?

116
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a couple months ago.

117
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:47,993
Wow.

118
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:49,273
[SPEAKER_03]: October.

119
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:50,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, October.

120
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:53,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that when you started?

121
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:57,718
[SPEAKER_07]: October of 69.

122
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:02,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much for indulging me and allowing me the opportunity to suspend the rules.

123
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, Anthony, Chris, and Jackson, thank you very much for coming down here tonight.

124
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:16,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And to all the rest of the members of Team HEMO, thank you very much for what you do to keep the memory and spirit of a good boy who was taken from us too soon, Mr. President.

125
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:18,257
[SPEAKER_07]: So I motion to receive and place no file.

126
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:23,978
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Layton, Councilor Falcons, Councilor Scarpelli, get the rest of the hair cut off.

127
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:30,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris, thank you very much for coming down.

128
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

129
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,201
[SPEAKER_07]: See you guys in two weeks.

130
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:33,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

131
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:55,257
[SPEAKER_10]: No, George and I were going to just say a few words, but I just want to thank everything that the fifth grade teacher Anthony does for the students and this great fundraiser.

132
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris Murphy and Jackson as well.

133
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So good luck.

134
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:13,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully, I was going to ask them how we could let the public know where to donate.

135
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:17,809
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure there'll be Facebook links and a number of different ways you can reach out.

136
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:21,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he sent a mass email around.

137
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully, you can get out and donate to a great cause.

138
00:09:25,294 --> 00:09:25,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Counsel.

139
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Counsel Scott Pelley.

140
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:28,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Mox.

141
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:32,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate an opportunity for Mr. just, I know Mr. Petrell has left.

142
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:42,335
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's amazing to me when you have Milk and Teacher of the Year award recipients like Mr. Petrelis, who were named a few years ago, named the Teacher of the Year.

143
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:47,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's done so many great, great, put so many great initiatives in place.

144
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:54,739
[SPEAKER_05]: What's amazing is when we lost Hemo at the McGlynn, that class still today celebrates his birthday.

145
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:57,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year they have a birthday cake.

146
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that's so special that they took something as horrible as death

147
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:04,434
[SPEAKER_05]: and they learned how to celebrate it.

148
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:10,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And Anthony carries that, his memory, HEMO's memory, alive with the buzz off.

149
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:15,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is the only time, this is what I really want here, so I can be involved.

150
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:20,919
[SPEAKER_05]: But I appreciate everything he's done, and I think the city should rally around it, it's a great cause.

151
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:21,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

152
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council.

153
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:25,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Council President.

154
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:26,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

155
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I want to echo my other councilors.

156
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations for Chris.

157
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:34,348
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been a good kid.

158
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:38,570
[SPEAKER_10]: And last year we all helped raise a lot of money for him in his endeavor.

159
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,370
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope he does equally as well this year.

160
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:42,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

161
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:45,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to receive and place on file.

162
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Second by Council Member Kern.

163
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:48,813
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor?

164
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

165
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:51,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Ayes have it.

166
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:54,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to revert back to regular audit business by Council Member Knight.

167
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:55,375
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor?

168
00:10:56,095 --> 00:10:56,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

169
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:57,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Ayes have it.

170
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:00,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Motions, audits, and resolutions.

171
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:05,695
[SPEAKER_02]: 17, I'm sorry, 17-317, offered by President Caviello.

172
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:18,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Be resolved that the rules of the Meffitt City Council be amended to allow video recording of the Meffitt City Council meetings in accordance with Massachusetts general law and that it be sent to the Rules Committee for adoption.

173
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:20,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Council President Caviello.

174
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:21,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

175
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:29,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Last week we had some people filming here and walking around that I got some calls from people that they weren't comfortable with.

176
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:37,282
[SPEAKER_10]: In accordance with the Mass General Laws, open meeting laws, which actually we don't even need to put them in our rules.

177
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:41,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to make sure that they will be enforced in the future.

178
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:45,510
[SPEAKER_10]: We've designated some areas where people can stand now and film.

179
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,854
[SPEAKER_10]: And like I said, all I'm saying is

180
00:11:49,443 --> 00:12:03,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Going forward, we're going to ask everyone to comply with the open meeting law when they want to film here, and we will announce that the meeting is being filmed other than by our TV cameras.

181
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:09,226
[SPEAKER_10]: And anyone who wants to buy a copy can buy a copy of the tape for $5.

182
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:18,988
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, like I said, some people here that weren't comfortable with where the filming was happening, and I wanted to just make sure that we adhere to the open meeting laws.

183
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:20,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

184
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:21,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Counselor Knight.

185
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:25,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Counselor Caviello, for bringing this issue forward.

186
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:35,511
[SPEAKER_07]: If we take a look at the Attorney General's Guide to the Open Meeting Law, published in March of 2017, there's a section entitled Public Participation.

187
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:42,432
[SPEAKER_07]: And in this section, it reads, any member of the public has the right to make an audio or video recording of an open session of a public meeting.

188
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:46,013
[SPEAKER_07]: A member of the public who wishes to record a meeting must first notify the chair,

189
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:52,799
[SPEAKER_07]: and comply with reasonable requirements regarding audio or video equipment established by the chair as not to interfere with the meeting.

190
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I commend Councilor Caviello for bringing this resolution forward.

191
00:12:55,501 --> 00:13:04,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I too got a number of calls relative to the recording of the meeting last week and some people feeling uncomfortable that certain individuals putting a camera in their face and following them around.

192
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:12,694
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that this is a good proactive measure to ensure that we have full participation and that individuals that want to come down to the Memphis City Council meetings are not

193
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,140
[SPEAKER_07]: feeling intimidated or frightened to do so.

194
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,421
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, Councilor Caviello.

195
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:22,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate your leadership on this issue and I look forward to the final product that the chair puts out as the presiding officer underneath the open meeting law.

196
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:24,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor.

197
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:25,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Del Rosso.

198
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:27,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

199
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:31,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I too want to congratulate the president on this measure.

200
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:41,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that in our meetings and committee that we can also address the issue of taping in committee meetings.

201
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:59,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it is in the context of those meetings that I've received a comment from people who have, uh, uh, felt as they've told me, creeped out by the manner, uh, in which some people have exercised, uh, uh, their rights in that forum, uh, with regards to taping.

202
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:07,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, uh, so I think that that needs to be a matter for discussion and policy.

203
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:08,168
[SPEAKER_08]: as well.

204
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:10,730
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we'll talk that out in committee.

205
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

206
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

207
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:14,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Counsel.

208
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:15,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Counsel Wongo Kern.

209
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:18,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Marks.

210
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:23,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had a question about exactly what the Mass General Law stated, but I think Counsel Knight answered that.

211
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:33,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So, going forward, until this rule committee gets set up, as long as they ask you, President Carviello, and then where would the designated areas be that they can videotape?

212
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:36,262
[SPEAKER_10]: The designated areas that we've selected

213
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:43,027
[SPEAKER_10]: will be where the chair is, which is going to be in the middle of both windows and around the outside corridor.

214
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:43,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the corridor.

215
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:44,768
[SPEAKER_10]: The outside of the wall there.

216
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:48,951
[SPEAKER_10]: And not in the middle where people will be waiting to stand and speak.

217
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:58,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And we prefer that it would be a fixed camera, not someone just walking around with a phone, just taking pictures of people's faces.

218
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:01,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, we will look and get it done in a professional manner.

219
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And the same thing when we go into the committee of the halls and subcommittee meetings,

220
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, those are open meetings and same rules will apply in there as they do in this room.

221
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:10,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

222
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:11,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

223
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:16,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree that it should go to, to committee just for vetting purposes.

224
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:20,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure we let the public know the rules that we're going to implement or that we are implementing.

225
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,302
[SPEAKER_10]: The rules are already in place by the mass general law on the open meeting law.

226
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:30,545
[SPEAKER_10]: So all we're doing is just sort of bringing them into our rules just to have them in place, but their rules supersede our rules anyway.

227
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:30,665
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

228
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, report of information.

229
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:38,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Based on the reading of it, the Memphis City Council is already governed and subject to the open meeting laws.

230
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:44,351
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that this is something that can be done absent a change to our rules or even meeting in subcommittee.

231
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:52,514
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the sole discretion of the chair to establish the criteria for which the reasonable use of recording equipment can be done.

232
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:59,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that this could certainly be taken care of sooner rather than later, just by way of a policy that's been implemented and submitted to this council for review.

233
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:05,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I think that we should have maybe four designated areas that individuals can record from.

234
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:08,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's also important that the cameras be stationary.

235
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,604
[SPEAKER_07]: There are certain aspects of this, if we're going to implement the policy, that I think are important.

236
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:17,628
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that they can be done absent the adoption of the Memphis City Council rules, number one.

237
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:25,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And number two, based upon my reading of the language in the Open Meeting Law Guide, I feel as though it's at the sole discretion of the presiding officer, not that of the body.

238
00:16:27,313 --> 00:16:27,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

239
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:35,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, Vice President Marks, I think it's important with regards to the subcommittee meetings that they do get recorded.

240
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's something this council has asked for.

241
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Councilor Falco brought it up.

242
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:47,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe we're hopefully in the works of getting a meeting together to figure out how much cameras will cost in room 207.

243
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:55,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think any subcommittee meeting that takes place or committee, the whole meeting that takes place in the chambers here should be recorded and should be

244
00:16:55,828 --> 00:17:05,071
[SPEAKER_04]: put on display, because I did get a couple responses from last week, subcommittee meeting being, Committee of the Whole meeting being taped, and people were happy they were able to view it online.

245
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:22,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand where it can be intrusive, but at the same time, people should be able to view every public meeting that goes on in City Hall, and I think getting cameras in some of the essential rooms, especially room 207, and where the Zoning Board of Appeals meets, we need to be able to do,

246
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:24,703
[SPEAKER_04]: look into doing that further.

247
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's very important for transparency and open government.

248
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:48,338
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would hope that we can implement some sort of resolution for Room 207 and create guidelines that are going to kind of be best for everybody in Room 207 if somebody does want to come in and film and post it on, whether that be Facebook or YouTube, because people are interested in

249
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:51,928
[SPEAKER_04]: a number of meetings in this community and they're important to, to go public.

250
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important for them to go public.

251
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:54,790
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand both sides.

252
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure we vet it well and do the right thing.

253
00:17:58,772 --> 00:17:59,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

254
00:17:59,093 --> 00:17:59,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Counselor.

255
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Counselor Falco.

256
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:01,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

257
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:04,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I also want to thank, uh, councilor Carviello for bringing this forward.

258
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:11,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, with regard to, uh, um, the meetings that are held in room two Oh seven, I'm in a full agreement that those meetings should be on tape.

259
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:14,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or actually they should be filmed in some capacity.

260
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:15,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh,

261
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:24,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Those meetings are open to the public, but there are many meetings that happen in that conference room that the public doesn't necessarily know about.

262
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:27,721
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we should be doing is we should be making sure that we're transparent.

263
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:31,663
[SPEAKER_01]: We're making sure that government is easily accessible to everyone in this community.

264
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:41,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important that we do have a camera in that room, and that it's easy to operate, and that all the meetings can be filmed and people can participate.

265
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:43,804
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been in contact with the vendor.

266
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:47,125
[SPEAKER_01]: The vendor was supposed to come in in February, but they had to cancel.

267
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:54,268
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working on getting them to hopefully come in soon to give us a price on that and to just let us know how it would work.

268
00:18:55,228 --> 00:19:00,270
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm in full agreement that rooms in room 207 should be filmed.

269
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Meetings should be filmed in there.

270
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:07,253
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many boards and commissions that meet on a monthly basis, and those

271
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:10,269
[SPEAKER_01]: those meetings should be filmed, that people should be able to see those.

272
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:15,590
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thank Councilor Caviello for bringing this forward, and in full support.

273
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

274
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:17,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Council.

275
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:21,972
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Council President Caviello, amended by Councilor Lungo and Councilor Falco.

276
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:23,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

277
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:31,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So the motion would be to send the paper to the Rules Committee, as opposed to the president exercising his discretion under the law and putting something together for us to review?

278
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:35,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Be up to the committee.

279
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,257
[SPEAKER_07]: In my opinion, I think it should.

280
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:45,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think the act would indicate.

281
00:19:47,432 --> 00:19:47,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

282
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:53,135
[SPEAKER_07]: But the open meeting law would say that it's the sole discretion of the chair to establish the acceptable areas.

283
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:53,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

284
00:19:53,695 --> 00:20:01,858
[SPEAKER_07]: So the committee creating the acceptable areas is really in contradiction to what the access, um, in my opinion, um, however, I'll proceed.

285
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:02,938
[SPEAKER_07]: However, the body feels fit.

286
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:05,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that this is something that the president could propose.

287
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:09,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we could either adopt it as something we want to encompass into our rules right away or make amendments to it.

288
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:16,659
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to, if you want to propose it tonight and then go into subcommittee process, I think you could probably adopt an interim policy or something like that.

289
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:20,140
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, to govern the meetings, cause it's going to have to go through the legislative process.

290
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:29,943
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want, I'm proposing that, uh, as, as the room is marked now with where the middle of the second window on both sides and around the outer perimeter of the back of the back wall.

291
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:36,377
[SPEAKER_10]: and no filming be allowed in the middle corridor where people stand to come up to speak at the podium.

292
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:44,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And we prefer if it would be a fixed location versus standing around, walking around and filming people.

293
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:48,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, as long as we have an understanding going forward that there are some restrictions in place right now.

294
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:58,492
[SPEAKER_10]: And before the meeting, as long as I'm notified, I can let the people in the room know that someone other than TV3 will be filming the meeting.

295
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:01,864
[SPEAKER_10]: which is what the law says.

296
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:14,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, Mr. President, my concern would be that, number one, we have an obligation to comply with the open meeting law, and the open meeting law requires the chairman to notify other members in the facility, or in the locale, that they are being recorded.

297
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:19,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's very important that, as we move forward and have our meetings, that we are in compliance with the open meeting law.

298
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And by designating certain areas, it'll make us a little bit easier for the president to identify, number one, and number two,

299
00:21:25,846 --> 00:21:29,130
[SPEAKER_07]: The City Messenger at the meeting has already started to identify individuals.

300
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you stated at the beginning, that's up to the discretion of the chair.

301
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:32,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

302
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:35,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an unwritten rule by the discretion of the chair.

303
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:35,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

304
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:40,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it would be important that we do add it to our rules to further clarify.

305
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:40,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

306
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:42,723
[SPEAKER_07]: My concern was just between then and now, what's going to happen.

307
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:43,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

308
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:44,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Wango-Kern.

309
00:21:44,985 --> 00:21:46,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Marks.

310
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:47,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine with all that.

311
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:48,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think

312
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:54,510
[SPEAKER_04]: having something stationary is something that a lot of people can't afford, having a tripod.

313
00:21:54,530 --> 00:22:00,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of people want to film with their phones or a camera or a video recorder.

314
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,374
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have a tripod, something stationary.

315
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:07,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So I disagree with that portion of how we're going to move forward.

316
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:09,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it's unrealistic.

317
00:22:09,398 --> 00:22:13,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that the one person that's tried to film is doing it from a cell phone.

318
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand maybe designating areas, but to not allow somebody to

319
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:19,389
[SPEAKER_04]: film us with a cell phone.

320
00:22:19,449 --> 00:22:26,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're elected to do the people's business, and if somebody wants to live stream it on Facebook, I don't see a problem with allowing them to do so.

321
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:39,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have no cameras in room 207, so if they want to do it with a cell phone, as long as they're stationary, not in the way, they're not impeding somebody's safety with regards to moving around, I don't see the problem.

322
00:22:39,924 --> 00:22:44,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to voice my concern there, because I know people are happy with

323
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:48,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Having the meetings live streamed and I agree with council Falco.

324
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:58,438
[SPEAKER_04]: We need video cameras in room 207, which That's the only way we got something videoed in the last couple weeks Even people aren't happy with who who videoed it.

325
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it is what it is Thank You console console

326
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:16,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me clarify when I said the word stationary, I don't mean that someone needs to buy a tripod or someone needs to, you know what I mean, buy this elaborate TV3 or, you know, channel 56 WLVI, Saturday Night Live, David Letterman, it's on the shoulder, it's on a tripod.

327
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:26,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I just mean that the individual that's recording shouldn't be walking around putting the camera, recording here, recording here, recording here, over here, over there, over there, over here, over here, walking all around the place because the intent is that the meeting does not get disrupted.

328
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,142
[SPEAKER_07]: We allow audio and video recording.

329
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:30,238
[SPEAKER_07]: But the meeting is not interfered with or disrupted.

330
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:33,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And that can be a disruption when someone's walking around with a camera and pointing at people's faces.

331
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:41,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we should add to this, like when one of us is talking, maybe the other councillors can't be like hysterically laughing.

332
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because that's disruptive.

333
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:44,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a councillor or two.

334
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:45,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Mr. President.

335
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Knight, point of information.

336
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:51,742
[SPEAKER_07]: The open meeting law in this section of the open meeting law speaks to public participation.

337
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:53,182
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't speak to the conduct of councillors.

338
00:23:53,202 --> 00:23:55,623
[SPEAKER_07]: The conduct of councillors is governed under a different chapter of the general law.

339
00:23:55,663 --> 00:23:56,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's chapter 43.

340
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:03,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ask, and I think that's why I think we do need to have a committee on the rules so we can get together.

341
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:13,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also a sign at the entrance to the Alderman Chambers that says no cell phone usage or electronic devices, I believe it mentions.

342
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:17,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is also something that I think we need to look in as a council.

343
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:26,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion by Council President Caviello that this be sent to committee on rules and further amended by Councilor Felco and Councilor Lungo-Kern.

344
00:24:27,294 --> 00:24:28,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

345
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:29,435
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor?

346
00:24:29,775 --> 00:24:29,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

347
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:30,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

348
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:31,795
[SPEAKER_02]: The ayes have it.

349
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:32,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion is adopted.

350
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:38,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

351
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:44,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

352
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,822
[SPEAKER_10]: 17318, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the Meffitt Housing Authority be discussed.

353
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:52,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Mox.

354
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:54,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

355
00:24:56,343 --> 00:25:04,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a few days ago, I received a call from a resident that resides in one of our housing developments.

356
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:15,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And the resident brought up a very valid concern, stating that during the snowstorm we had two weeks back, a little over two weeks back,

357
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: that she is a handicapped resident of this particular development.

358
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:25,134
[SPEAKER_02]: She resides on, I believe, the fourth floor.

359
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:33,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And during this latest snowstorm, the power went out at the building for several hours.

360
00:25:34,502 --> 00:25:39,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And she happens to have a lifeline that she uses, a medical alert.

361
00:25:40,135 --> 00:25:43,876
[SPEAKER_02]: When the power went out, her lifeline no longer worked.

362
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:49,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And the elevators in the building don't have a backup generator.

363
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:57,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And her phone, based on the type of phone you have, her particular phone wasn't working either.

364
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:06,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was confined to her floor of the building for a three or four hour span with no communication.

365
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was very concerned that

366
00:26:08,963 --> 00:26:13,366
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, her building did not have a backup generator for the elevator.

367
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:23,574
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a small generator that has the capacity to handle small lights at the entrance to each doorway inside the building.

368
00:26:23,994 --> 00:26:29,338
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, there is no backup generator to handle the elevator capacity.

369
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:33,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made a call to Meffitt Housing yesterday.

370
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:38,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to Joseph McRitchie,

371
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:41,069
[SPEAKER_02]: who is the interim director, executive director.

372
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:57,380
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who are not aware, Mr. John Coddington, the executive director, decided not to seek reappointment to the position, and right now the housing board is currently looking at three different candidates for the executive director position.

373
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:05,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. McRitchie is here in the interim for about a month from what he told me.

374
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:16,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him, Mr. President, what is the, first of all, which of our eight developments in the city have backup generators for the elevators?

375
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:21,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And he mentioned that the only building is the main high rise in the square.

376
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:24,888
[SPEAKER_02]: The Salt and Stall does have a backup generator.

377
00:27:24,928 --> 00:27:30,469
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an 11 story elevator with 200 units in that particular building.

378
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:39,132
[SPEAKER_02]: So if power does go out, residents from any of the floors can get down to the main floor if need be in a time of concern.

379
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:43,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went through the list of buildings, Mr. President, and

380
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:56,059
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this may be helpful to some of the new colleagues, because when people hear about method housing right away, they think, Oh, that's under the guise and control of the city of method.

381
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And it absolutely has.

382
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:00,485
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing to do with the city of Method.

383
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:09,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are astonished when I say that, but the Housing Authority is a quasi-agency that's run by the state and federal government.

384
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:19,510
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, out of the eight developments we have, we only have one state unit that's funded by the state, and that's Walkland Court.

385
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,371
[SPEAKER_02]: The other seven are federal-funded buildings.

386
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:28,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you would just indulge me, Mr. President, I think it's important

387
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:40,445
[SPEAKER_02]: to go through the list of housing that we have in this community, and then in order to move forward on a resolution that needs to take place, I think it's helpful.

388
00:28:41,106 --> 00:28:43,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the Salt and Stall building.

389
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an 11-story development here on Riverside Ave.

390
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:46,772
[SPEAKER_02]: It has 200 units.

391
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:52,604
[SPEAKER_02]: of elderly and disabled units, and it's federally funded.

392
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:55,408
[SPEAKER_02]: LaPreece Village is on Riverside Ave.

393
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:58,012
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a family development.

394
00:28:58,332 --> 00:28:59,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It has 142 units, and it's federally funded.

395
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:05,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Fells Way West, there's the Doherty Apartments.

396
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:14,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a three-story elevated building, which is elderly and disabled, and it has 17 units and it's funded by the federal government.

397
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:21,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Weldon Gardens, which is on Bradley Road, five-story elevated building for elderly and disabled.

398
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:24,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It has 75 units, funded by the federal government.

399
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:29,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Tamponi Manor, Alston Street, it's a three-story elevated building,

400
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:36,512
[SPEAKER_02]: with elderly and disabled residents, and it has 100 units, and it's funded by the federal government.

401
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Canal Street, Phillips Apartments, it's a two-story building.

402
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:45,236
[SPEAKER_02]: It's elderly and disabled, and has 15 units, and funded by the federal government.

403
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:51,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have Willis Ave Development, which is a family development that's on Barnard and Willis.

404
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,182
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 150 units, and it's funded by the federal government.

405
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I stated, Walkland Court,

406
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:04,707
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a two-story building, elderly and disabled, 144 units, and it's funded by the state.

407
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:17,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Combined total, we have 843 of housing units in our community, of which a lion's share are dedicated to the elderly and disabled.

408
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:20,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I brought up this resolution is

409
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:44,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Upon inquiry to the Meffitt Housing, I asked what is their emergency plan in times of power outages with people that are on these elevated floors that are disabled and don't have a means to gain access to the first floor, and secondly, may have a medical condition that requires them to have electricity.

410
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was told that they were going to look into it.

411
00:30:48,128 --> 00:31:15,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And to date, I still haven't received a response, but I'm hoping tonight through this resolution that my first motion, Mr. President, is that this council receive a response from Medford Housing Authority on the emergency plan, evacuation plan in times of power outages or other catastrophes in this community to deal with the disabled.

412
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:22,102
[SPEAKER_02]: that are living within the buildings in particular, and an emergency plan in general for everyone living in the building.

413
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:41,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondly, Mr. President, the fact that only one building out of one, two, three, four, five, six buildings that have, I'm sorry, one, two, three, four, five buildings, only one has an emergency backup generated for the elevator.

414
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:53,297
[SPEAKER_02]: So my second motion is, out of the five buildings that have elevators currently, why are only one building equipped with an emergency backup generator?

415
00:31:53,697 --> 00:32:07,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the plans to address needs of residents that are in the building that may or may not be disabled, Mr. President, in time of power outages or other safety needs?

416
00:32:07,902 --> 00:32:09,683
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are my two questions, Mr. President.

417
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:17,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the interim director, MacRitchie, has only been around for a short period of time, and he was very prompt in getting back to me.

418
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:18,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to thank him.

419
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:32,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told him I was gonna be offering this resolution to address the needs of the 843 different units we have throughout this community, and the safety concern that potentially could exist, Mr. President.

420
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:33,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

421
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor De La Russo.

422
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:37,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

423
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:56,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Just by way of information, I was under the impression that after our last major power outage, the city suffered some years back, that there was indeed a emergency plan that was under the supervision of the director.

424
00:32:56,436 --> 00:33:03,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we called them emergency management or civil defense had contingencies for these matters.

425
00:33:04,078 --> 00:33:29,173
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is alarming to note that in housing that caters to largely elderly and disabled and people with critical medical conditions, especially people that need in their domicile machines that generate oxygen for their breathing, to be without the aid of those machines for even a brief period of time

426
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:33,220
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, might be life threatening and certainly injurious to their health.

427
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:39,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I, uh, uh, second approval on this, uh, motion, Mr. President.

428
00:33:39,606 --> 00:33:40,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

429
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:42,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco.

430
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

431
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'd like to thank, uh, Councilor Mox for bringing this forward.

432
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:50,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, uh, resident, um, uh, actually gave me a call as well.

433
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:54,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there's some, uh, really legitimate concerns here that need to be addressed.

434
00:33:56,023 --> 00:34:04,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Councilor Mark said, there are hundreds of units here with elderly people and disabled people, and we need to make sure there's a plan in place.

435
00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:14,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to see if we could amend the resolution to actually see if actually the fire department is aware of a plan, if they have a copy of the plan, if they could send it to us.

436
00:34:15,093 --> 00:34:23,257
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't, if we could have the housing authority send that emergency plan to the fire department, I would think that as first responders,

437
00:34:23,902 --> 00:34:28,386
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the fire department and the police department should have a copy of the emergency plan.

438
00:34:28,586 --> 00:34:31,608
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I thank the council for bringing this forward and I support it.

439
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:32,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

440
00:34:32,229 --> 00:34:32,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

441
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:33,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

442
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Nice.

443
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Mr. President, thank you very much.

444
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:38,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to commend Councilor Marks for putting this resolution forward.

445
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:39,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a great idea.

446
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:41,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, certainly questions that need to be answered.

447
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:49,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, whereas we have an interim director right now, I think it would also be important that, um, we send copies of the resolution to each member of the Medford housing authority board.

448
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:54,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also think it would be important that we send a copy to the Director of Civil Defense, which is coming out of the Board of Health right now.

449
00:34:54,567 --> 00:35:01,212
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just ask that the paper be amended to include those individuals to receive copies of the resolution.

450
00:35:01,592 --> 00:35:03,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully we can get an answer within 10 days or so, Mr. President.

451
00:35:04,614 --> 00:35:05,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Move for approval.

452
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:05,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

453
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:10,138
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended.

454
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:11,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

455
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:12,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, Vice President Marks.

456
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:19,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Just if we could, if we can also get the name of the person, if anyone behind the railing knows of the Civil Defense person.

457
00:35:20,942 --> 00:35:25,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the position has been vacant for several years now.

458
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:28,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'd be curious if... Point of information, Mr. President.

459
00:35:28,348 --> 00:35:31,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Counselor DelaRusso.

460
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:38,956
[SPEAKER_08]: The qualifications and duties of that person have been assumed into the role of the Director of Health.

461
00:35:39,397 --> 00:35:40,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Counselor DelaRusso.

462
00:35:41,578 --> 00:35:42,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor Knight.

463
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Well said, Counselor DelaRusso.

464
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:50,492
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Mox, as seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended.

465
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:54,095
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

466
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:54,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

467
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:59,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

468
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:01,200
[SPEAKER_10]: 17.319 offered by Vice President Mox.

469
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:05,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the issue of natural gas leaks

470
00:36:05,822 --> 00:36:08,144
[SPEAKER_10]: in the city of Medford be discussed?

471
00:36:08,564 --> 00:36:09,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Mox.

472
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:11,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

473
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:13,749
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very important subject.

474
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:29,542
[SPEAKER_02]: On March 20th of this year, National Grid came out to the McGlynn Middle School to talk to residents about their natural gas bills and concerns and any questions they may have.

475
00:36:30,143 --> 00:36:32,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that particular meeting, Mr. President,

476
00:36:33,662 --> 00:36:43,824
[SPEAKER_02]: residents raised a number of very valid questions, but one that kept on coming up over and over again was natural gas leaks within the community.

477
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:54,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the meeting, it was explained that natural gas leaks contain CO2 and methane, and a result of corroded pipes

478
00:36:55,283 --> 00:37:02,045
[SPEAKER_02]: which we know many of the pipes that are under our roads and streets are many, many years old.

479
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:09,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while, the joints become faulty and they end up fractioning.

480
00:37:10,107 --> 00:37:16,009
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's typically caused by heavy trucking that may go up and down streets.

481
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:18,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It's caused by digging in particular areas.

482
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:24,498
[SPEAKER_02]: But National Grid has a report, and that's why I offer this resolution tonight.

483
00:37:24,998 --> 00:37:43,942
[SPEAKER_02]: They categorize the type of leaks that are in every community, and they categorize them as grade one, which is eminent threat of explosion, grade two, threatens the health of property, and grade three, no threat to health or property.

484
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And according to National Grid,

485
00:37:47,503 --> 00:38:01,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Meffitt currently has zero grade 1 and 2 leaks, which I guess is great news, but has over 260 plus grade 3 leaks that, according to them, are decades old.

486
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:05,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I offer this tonight, Mr. President, is that

487
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:18,691
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing how the infrastructure works in the community, knowing how water and sewer and the pipes that are underground as they age don't get less leaky, they become more leaky.

488
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:32,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And knowing that we have over 260 leaks currently in the city, many of which may be decades old, I would venture to say that these leaks are no longer grade three leaks,

489
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:34,716
[SPEAKER_02]: but could be grade one or two leaks.

490
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:36,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And how often are we looking at these leaks?

491
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:38,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they re-inspected every year?

492
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:39,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

493
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my question tonight, Mr. President.

494
00:38:42,938 --> 00:38:59,562
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could get a report back from National Grid on how often grade three leaks in the city of Meffitt are being monitored, if we can get that particular reporting on how frequent they are monitored, and also, Mr. President,

495
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:19,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have to talk to our state delegation because as part of the meeting that was held, they said currently grade three leaks are not prioritized by National Grid because they don't receive any type of reimbursement on grade three leaks.

496
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:24,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Grade one and two leaks, they receive reimbursement either from the state or federal government.

497
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:26,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not quite sure on that.

498
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:28,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So grade three leaks are not a priority.

499
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:32,228
[SPEAKER_02]: We happen to be inundated with grade three leaks.

500
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:51,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And knowing they're not a priority, knowing that many of these leaks have been out there for decades, I'm very concerned, Mr. President, that if National Grid is not on their game, these leaks could be turning into grade one and grade two leaks, which pose an imminent threat to health and safety and property of this community.

501
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:55,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that would be my motion tonight, Mr. President.

502
00:39:56,098 --> 00:40:08,903
[SPEAKER_02]: reporting and potentially also if a representative from National Grid can come before this council to give us an explanation on the current condition of leaks within our community.

503
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:10,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vice President Mox.

504
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:15,885
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

505
00:40:15,925 --> 00:40:16,626
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor.

506
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:20,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like to speak on this matter?

507
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:22,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

508
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:43,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

509
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:46,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street Method.

510
00:40:46,617 --> 00:40:47,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Council President.

511
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:48,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate your attention.

512
00:40:49,937 --> 00:40:54,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought I'd share some information about this gas leak situation.

513
00:40:54,598 --> 00:41:02,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 15 years ago, my wife said there was a gas leak in front of the house, but I couldn't tell.

514
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:05,580
[SPEAKER_00]: She can smell a cigarette from a mile away, but I really can't.

515
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:12,361
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sure enough, a gas employee, National Grid,

516
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:23,791
[SPEAKER_00]: came in front of the house and I didn't notice my new tree on Cushion Street was dwarfed and it looked like it was dying compared to the others that were newly planted.

517
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:33,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, across the street, they had gone through multiple trees about number 26 Cushion.

518
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:39,054
[SPEAKER_00]: So the guest gentleman said to me, listen,

519
00:41:39,815 --> 00:41:49,040
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I thought he said stage one, stage two, stage three, or I said grade, you said stage, whatever it is, there's one, two, and three.

520
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,721
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which was the worst.

521
00:41:51,181 --> 00:41:52,982
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you counsel much, you know better.

522
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:55,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And your mind is refreshed.

523
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:58,786
[SPEAKER_00]: However, he said it was not so bad.

524
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:07,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so he also says to me, don't say I said it, so I'm not quoting his name, I probably have it in my notes.

525
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:13,830
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Medford is known as the gassy city, kind of like Shark Bay.

526
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,071
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I presume it has nothing to do with Boston baked beans, mind you.

527
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:27,235
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I've been seeing them walking around and driving around with their scanners and snifters, whatever they hang from their bumpers.

528
00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:33,336
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, they did come and replace the whole main for the entire street.

529
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:36,637
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been fortunate.

530
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:38,778
[SPEAKER_00]: We have new infrastructure on that street.

531
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:46,111
[SPEAKER_00]: And they replanted new trees, because they also did the sidewalks.

532
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:56,719
[SPEAKER_00]: And our tree in the front seems a little bit more dwarfed than the other one we have on the front, which is more on the Abbott's corner.

533
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:06,547
[SPEAKER_00]: And across the street, where they already went through three trees prior to the replacement of the new line, their tree looks more dwarfed than mine.

534
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:09,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's ready to go to De La Ruza's pretty soon.

535
00:43:11,618 --> 00:43:19,004
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I covered the information I'd like to share.

536
00:43:20,545 --> 00:43:27,370
[SPEAKER_00]: And just think, these pipes are probably 100 years old or more, give or take 20 years.

537
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:40,480
[SPEAKER_00]: God forbid, if we ever had to do entire re-digging the infrastructure, I don't think this country could afford such a thing and the inconvenience.

538
00:43:41,062 --> 00:43:46,906
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we're gonna have to do a piecemeal when it becomes a stage one, as you say, Councilor Marks.

539
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:55,913
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanna re-quote this gentleman, just don't quote me, but Medford is known as the gassy city.

540
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:57,754
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to offer.

541
00:43:58,234 --> 00:43:59,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Castanetti.

542
00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:01,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, Vice President Marks.

543
00:44:02,377 --> 00:44:03,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

544
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:08,902
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, another point that I didn't bring up is the fact that, you know,

545
00:44:10,185 --> 00:44:15,871
[SPEAKER_02]: The gas that's coming into the community is meted in outer parts of the city.

546
00:44:16,672 --> 00:44:18,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have giant gas lines.

547
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:20,315
[SPEAKER_02]: They know exactly how much gas is coming into the community.

548
00:44:20,636 --> 00:44:24,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's broken up by the individual businesses, homes, and so forth.

549
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:30,785
[SPEAKER_02]: What is not going into your home or your business is unaccounted for gas that's leaking, these 260 plus

550
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:35,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be 300, 400, who knows?

551
00:44:35,863 --> 00:44:39,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But that cost is not picked up by National Grid.

552
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,105
[SPEAKER_02]: That's picked up by the consumer.

553
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:45,928
[SPEAKER_02]: That's picked up by URI, all these different leaks, similar to the water in sewer.

554
00:44:46,328 --> 00:44:49,170
[SPEAKER_02]: We have unaccounted for water in this community.

555
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not water I'm using or any other rate payer.

556
00:44:53,772 --> 00:44:57,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It's water that's leaking directly into the ground that we're paying for.

557
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:01,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not a win-win for our community, the fact that

558
00:45:01,772 --> 00:45:02,973
[SPEAKER_02]: These are low-grade leaks.

559
00:45:03,393 --> 00:45:19,025
[SPEAKER_02]: It's costing us, Mr. President, to pay for the leaks, and it's also costing us, Mr. President, as we heard, within our environment, and also the potential threat from these decade-old leaks that we have in the community.

560
00:45:19,446 --> 00:45:20,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to bring up that point.

561
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:22,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

562
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:26,311
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

563
00:45:26,331 --> 00:45:27,091
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

564
00:45:27,112 --> 00:45:27,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

565
00:45:27,912 --> 00:45:28,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes. 17.

566
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:33,785
[SPEAKER_10]: 20, offered by Councilor Knight.

567
00:45:34,726 --> 00:45:47,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council adopt the following... I'm just gonna read the beginning of it.

568
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:55,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council adopt the following ordinance regulating the use of security bars and grates in the city of Memphis.

569
00:45:56,993 --> 00:46:02,580
[SPEAKER_10]: In order as we get regulated the greats on commercial properties and industrial properties in the city of Medford.

570
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion by Councillor Scarpelli to waive the reading.

571
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:08,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Knight.

572
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:15,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much and Councillor Caviello, thank you for making that motion so we didn't have to read this long and

573
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:18,739
[SPEAKER_07]: voluminous piece of language here.

574
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:28,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, ultimately, this is a draft proposal that I would expect to go through the legislative process, through the subcommittee process, the committee of the whole process, and make it back here to the council floor after deliberation.

575
00:46:29,082 --> 00:46:37,425
[SPEAKER_07]: But what it is, is it is an attempt to regulate security bars and grates on commercial and industrial properties that abide in a public way.

576
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:39,925
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a beautification initiative, Mr. President.

577
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:44,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel as though right now, in the day and age that we're in, with the technological advances that we have,

578
00:46:45,558 --> 00:46:50,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that a number of these security grates aren't being utilized in a fashion that would be neighborly.

579
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:54,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they don't go up at all during working hours when they're graffitied.

580
00:46:54,383 --> 00:46:58,184
[SPEAKER_07]: The graffiti doesn't come off, and at the end of the day, the grate comes down and the graffiti remains on.

581
00:46:58,685 --> 00:47:02,487
[SPEAKER_07]: The security grate, I think that there are certain issues that we need to look at in this regard, Mr. President.

582
00:47:03,027 --> 00:47:06,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I drafted a proposal, and it's a phase-in proposal.

583
00:47:07,129 --> 00:47:12,872
[SPEAKER_07]: It calls for any existing commercial or industrially zoned property that has a security bars, grills, or grates.

584
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:17,010
[SPEAKER_07]: that were properly permitted to have a 10-year window to remove those from the community.

585
00:47:17,591 --> 00:47:25,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And any location that has security grates that were not installed in compliance with the building code has five years to remove those.

586
00:47:25,196 --> 00:47:35,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So existing structures that have these security bars, grills, or grates that are up would have 10 years if they were put in there in a conforming basis and five years in a non-conforming basis to take it off.

587
00:47:35,242 --> 00:47:41,026
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also some restrictions in there relative to whether or not a permit's pulled and a requirement to take the security grates down.

588
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:54,922
[SPEAKER_07]: But ultimately, this is, Mr. President, an attempt to start a discussion on the issue of security grates, grills, and the like that cover windows of commercial and industrial properties that abut public ways, that provide an unsightly appearance to individuals driving into the community.

589
00:47:55,262 --> 00:48:02,884
[SPEAKER_07]: If we take a look at our zoning map, we'll see that there are many commercial and industrially zoned areas that lie on the fringes and the periphery of our community, the gateways to our community.

590
00:48:03,264 --> 00:48:05,725
[SPEAKER_07]: And the impression that we want to give people coming to MedFit isn't that.

591
00:48:06,107 --> 00:48:10,130
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an unsafe community that requires security, greats, bars, and grills on your windows, Mr. President.

592
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,251
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the intent of this proposal.

593
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:16,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I would move that the matter be sent to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances of further improper vetting.

594
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:17,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

595
00:48:18,415 --> 00:48:20,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

596
00:48:20,116 --> 00:48:20,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

597
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:22,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this up.

598
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:28,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what's great with resolutions like this and the next resolution is that you get the dialogue started.

599
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:35,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I'd second the subcommittee motion to move to subcommittee because these are the discussions that

600
00:48:35,514 --> 00:48:40,557
[SPEAKER_05]: that when they go into that other room, that hopefully it televised soon, that people can see the real work getting done.

601
00:48:41,157 --> 00:48:48,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And understanding that, um, I got a few phone calls and some phone calls will jeopardize the security.

602
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:54,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have other, I had a few phone calls saying, that's great because a lot of people that do have the greats are keeping the greats down.

603
00:48:54,745 --> 00:49:00,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where the graffiti artists are really tagging those areas and which that brings up another point.

604
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:06,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think is probably the greatest points is our ordinances focusing on, on graffiti throughout the community.

605
00:49:07,053 --> 00:49:13,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, um, I think this is a great start for many different issues that we can, it could morph into.

606
00:49:13,955 --> 00:49:17,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I second that motion to, uh, move to subcommittee.

607
00:49:18,077 --> 00:49:18,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

608
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Kelly, councilor Falco.

609
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:21,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

610
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:23,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank a console night for bringing this forward.

611
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a good resolution that will, uh, help beautify the city.

612
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:33,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm in full agreement that this is something that would benefit the whole community.

613
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:40,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to this moving to the zoning and ordinance subcommittee, where we can get to work on it hopefully right away.

614
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:47,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot going on in that subcommittee, but I may get to work on this, and I think it will benefit everyone.

615
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:47,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

616
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

617
00:49:50,692 --> 00:49:51,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Castaneda, would you like to speak?

618
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:51,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

619
00:49:53,354 --> 00:49:54,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

620
00:49:54,895 --> 00:49:56,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew, Cushing Street, Method Mass.

621
00:49:58,573 --> 00:50:07,056
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate Councilor Knight's concern about keeping a more of a Winchester-type atmosphere versus a Chelsea-type atmosphere.

622
00:50:07,536 --> 00:50:09,117
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great thought.

623
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:11,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad you respect the city.

624
00:50:12,238 --> 00:50:17,420
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me most people in the world, including in our community, are good people.

625
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:25,063
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some that have issues, and maybe they do bad things, and I'm not sure if we can,

626
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:37,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone can dictate, even through an ordinance, and you probably can, but to whether they should have grates or not, especially if they're carrying 24-karat gold bullion or jewelry.

627
00:50:37,912 --> 00:50:39,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about ice cream parlors.

628
00:50:40,473 --> 00:50:52,818
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think in order to avoid possibly more of the secondhand shops and

629
00:50:53,892 --> 00:50:59,814
[SPEAKER_00]: massage parlors, which kept Medford hopping until after eight o'clock at night, but they had to go, I guess.

630
00:51:00,714 --> 00:51:02,935
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had to roll up the sidewalks at 4 p.m.

631
00:51:02,995 --> 00:51:03,375
[SPEAKER_00]: at least.

632
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:20,280
[SPEAKER_00]: However, all kidding aside, I believe it's more important for the leadership in this city to make better amends to beautify our city.

633
00:51:21,486 --> 00:51:23,147
[SPEAKER_00]: and at least clean up the trash.

634
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:31,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not Winchester, but I fear it might become like the communities on the East Coast as night is implying it.

635
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:48,594
[SPEAKER_00]: So behind Mystic River Bend Park, for example, that parking lot, and I've said it to many people, leaders in this community, it's insane.

636
00:51:48,654 --> 00:51:51,215
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a war zone.

637
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:55,184
[SPEAKER_00]: You have these cement things that's supposed to stop the cars from hitting the curb.

638
00:51:55,644 --> 00:51:59,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've been plowed over and broken in half, and you have rebar sticking up.

639
00:52:00,225 --> 00:52:02,486
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid someone's gonna end up in a wheelchair.

640
00:52:05,606 --> 00:52:10,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of debris back there, and it's just, that's only one location.

641
00:52:12,168 --> 00:52:13,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, what's the name?

642
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Aretha Franklin, R-E-S.

643
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:17,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect the city.

644
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Do something.

645
00:52:22,688 --> 00:52:28,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides the great work you're doing, we gotta have respect.

646
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:37,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind picking up papers in the street, pieces of plywood in Memphis Square, on Salem Street, Riverside Ave, but what am I gonna put in my pocket?

647
00:52:39,082 --> 00:52:49,872
[SPEAKER_00]: The city could do a better job, although DPW employees have a shortage of manpower, in my estimation, and

648
00:52:51,008 --> 00:53:00,430
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tired after a snowstorm, and instead of spending money for the high execs, maybe we should hire a few Indians, so to speak.

649
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:11,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Use some of that free cash to clean up the neighborhood, and maybe people will stop throwing their chewing gum wrappers on the street.

650
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thinking out loud, sir.

651
00:53:13,853 --> 00:53:14,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

652
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:17,814
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Layton, seconded by?

653
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:17,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

654
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:20,735
[SPEAKER_10]: By Councilor Falco.

655
00:53:21,383 --> 00:53:22,204
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

656
00:53:22,224 --> 00:53:22,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

657
00:53:23,424 --> 00:53:26,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

658
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:38,493
[SPEAKER_10]: 17-321, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the City of Medford adopt the following ordinances, re-regulating donation boxes in the City of Medford.

659
00:53:42,115 --> 00:53:42,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitions.

660
00:53:42,775 --> 00:53:46,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I'd like to ask that we waive the reading.

661
00:53:47,038 --> 00:53:49,479
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Falco that we waive the reading

662
00:53:54,758 --> 00:53:58,481
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councillor Falco, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

663
00:53:59,162 --> 00:53:59,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Knight.

664
00:54:00,263 --> 00:54:03,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much and Councillor Falco, thank you as well.

665
00:54:03,726 --> 00:54:15,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Similar to the preceding matter that was on the agenda and that was just discussed, this is nothing more than an opportunity for us to start a discussion and it's a proposal to regulate donation drop boxes across the community.

666
00:54:17,331 --> 00:54:28,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all of us behind this rail have been contacted by a number of individuals that are concerned about this proposal and the effect that it will have on our public schools and the fundraising drive that they have going on with Bay State Textiles.

667
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:35,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And this proposal in no way was designed to hurt that effort in any way.

668
00:54:37,406 --> 00:54:43,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Since the filing of the proposal, Mr. President, I've had discussions with several of my colleagues as well as members of the general public

669
00:54:43,777 --> 00:54:45,118
[SPEAKER_07]: It was my intention and my intent.

670
00:54:45,178 --> 00:54:47,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this is a beautification initiative.

671
00:54:47,159 --> 00:55:00,245
[SPEAKER_07]: The intent of the ordinance is to put some restrictions around donation drop boxes to ensure that we have opportunities and abilities to keep areas clean and to keep neighborhood quality of life and beautification at the forefront, Mr. President.

672
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:02,786
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, this is also a paper that

673
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:14,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd request to get sent to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances, but ultimately what it does is it requires a permitting process for those entities that wish to utilize a donation drop box.

674
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:28,605
[SPEAKER_07]: It requires a sketch of the spot, the dimensions of the box, where it's going to be placed, and approval by the building department so that we're sure that this donation drop box, number one, is authorized by the property owner, and number two, doesn't provide a risk to public safety.

675
00:55:29,499 --> 00:55:33,122
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, it's an opportunity for us to start a discussion, Mr. President.

676
00:55:33,422 --> 00:55:36,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd ask that the matter be sent to the Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinances.

677
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:48,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in no way an effort or an attempt to restrict the great work that the Medford Public Schools and Baystate Textile have done in cooperation as fundraising drives for our PTOs.

678
00:55:48,534 --> 00:55:55,619
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more or less an initiative to address a matter that's been before this council at least three times this term and at least four times last term, Mr. President.

679
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Counselor.

680
00:55:58,799 --> 00:55:59,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Falco.

681
00:55:59,919 --> 00:56:00,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

682
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I second the motion that this move to the zoning and ordinance subcommittee.

683
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:06,441
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a process.

684
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:08,102
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a proposed resolution.

685
00:56:08,182 --> 00:56:15,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there are many changes and adjustments that can be made to make this an effective resolution.

686
00:56:15,284 --> 00:56:23,867
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big concerns from many of the parents in the community and from the PTOs is that it will have an impact on the base day textiles.

687
00:56:23,907 --> 00:56:27,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do not want that to have a negative impact

688
00:56:28,945 --> 00:56:29,705
[SPEAKER_01]: on that program.

689
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:34,967
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a program that raises money for the various PTOs throughout the city.

690
00:56:35,787 --> 00:56:41,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself and I know Councilor Scott Pelley, when we were on this school committee, this is a program that we supported 100%.

691
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:49,471
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a program that gives back $7,000 over the past 30 months.

692
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:50,571
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty significant.

693
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:52,711
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a significant income for the PTOs.

694
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:58,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to make sure that if we draft an ordinance, or we're going to draft an ordinance, that we make sure we do it right.

695
00:56:59,128 --> 00:57:02,049
[SPEAKER_01]: and we make sure that it doesn't impact this program that's already in place.

696
00:57:02,509 --> 00:57:08,412
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely second that this move to the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee and move for approval.

697
00:57:08,652 --> 00:57:09,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

698
00:57:09,652 --> 00:57:10,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lococo-Kurin.

699
00:57:10,913 --> 00:57:12,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Carviello.

700
00:57:12,814 --> 00:57:28,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I did receive a number of, I think, three phone calls on this and a number of emails, the same as my colleagues from Concerned Parents, members of the PTO, I believe the two creators of the Bay State textiles Dropboxes,

701
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,619
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are a number of things that do concern me, especially a fee.

702
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:38,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe the fee of $100 that might be required if we do create an ordinance with this language.

703
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:46,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's important that we vet this out completely, whether that be in subcommittee or in committee of the whole, because of the grave controversy.

704
00:57:47,043 --> 00:57:55,545
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that one thing that should be done before we have a committee meeting is that we research what boxes are out there, who owns them.

705
00:57:57,147 --> 00:58:04,732
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure we understand the legalities and the agreements they have with whether it be the school or the city or commercial property.

706
00:58:04,832 --> 00:58:19,021
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand what it is these contracts state and how we can regulate them and whether or not we should regulate them in different ways depending on where they're located because we definitely don't want the PTOs to lose money, fundraising money.

707
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:20,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was over $7,000 that the PTOs have

708
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:45,215
[SPEAKER_04]: been able to obtain from Bay State Textiles, so creating this fee per box may hinder that money that goes to the PTOs, and you've got a good 10 people that are really concerned about it, so I hope that we can potentially do this together, whether that be in the Committee of the Whole or in a subcommittee, and really vet this process out.

709
00:58:46,076 --> 00:58:47,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilwoman O'Brien.

710
00:58:47,196 --> 00:58:48,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

711
00:58:48,657 --> 00:58:49,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

712
00:58:50,803 --> 00:59:04,253
[SPEAKER_05]: At the spirit of this resolution, I believe, that I too got the phone calls and emails and being on the school committee and understanding at the time how important this initiative was for our PTOs.

713
00:59:04,473 --> 00:59:15,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the focus that I was really looking at with this resolution is really getting a database in place where, as you see in different neighborhoods, I know in the Heights we have one,

714
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,261
[SPEAKER_05]: next to a convenience store that's overflowing onto the sidewalk.

715
00:59:19,621 --> 00:59:21,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really poses a real eyesore.

716
00:59:21,742 --> 00:59:25,564
[SPEAKER_05]: And neighbors there had concerns where it butts their driveways.

717
00:59:25,644 --> 00:59:35,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that's where really having understanding who the contact person is, how we can remedy some of these solutions.

718
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:42,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's probably the biggest and most aggressive campaign with this resolution.

719
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:45,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So I too support this to go to subcommittee.

720
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:50,153
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be vetted like President, excuse me, Councilor Longo-Kern has mentioned.

721
00:59:50,393 --> 01:00:06,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I think that to all the phone calls and emails that rest assured this committee is all in favor of making sure that it doesn't affect with partners like we have with the Bay State Textiles.

722
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So we appreciate their effort.

723
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:08,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

724
01:00:09,432 --> 01:00:10,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

725
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

726
01:00:12,758 --> 01:00:13,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

727
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:19,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the textile recycling is something that's certainly on the forefront right now of everybody's mind.

728
01:00:19,341 --> 01:00:24,302
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that the Mass DEP has been very focused on promoting throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

729
01:00:24,322 --> 01:00:28,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Here this evening, we have Catherine Larson as well from Baystate Textiles.

730
01:00:28,204 --> 01:00:41,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, she dropped off a nice packet of information for me, and she's agreed to become a resource of technical assistance moving forward to ensure that we craft language in an ordinance for the city that does not impact the work of

731
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:45,327
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very simple fix, Mr. President.

732
01:00:45,347 --> 01:00:52,850
[SPEAKER_07]: We just put language in there that says nothing in this article shall apply to the Medford Public Schools or the property that's under their control and direction, and then it's over.

733
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:55,291
[SPEAKER_07]: So I certainly think it's something that we can address in subcommittee.

734
01:00:55,331 --> 01:00:58,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly think that it's something that's an easy fix, not a hard one, Mr. President.

735
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:10,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the intention legislatively was not to restrict or impede upon the fundraising abilities of our public schools, and it's certainly not to have a negative impact on Bay State Textiles and the

736
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,276
[SPEAKER_07]: relationship and partnership that they've been able to forge with our public schools.

737
01:01:14,816 --> 01:01:15,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

738
01:01:16,336 --> 01:01:17,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Mox.

739
01:01:18,397 --> 01:01:19,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

740
01:01:19,737 --> 01:01:24,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting both these resolutions on.

741
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:37,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just, you know, I need to state that I think what's being offered now on our council agendas are no longer resolutions.

742
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:39,043
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular,

743
01:01:39,507 --> 01:01:45,169
[SPEAKER_02]: when we receive a two-page ordinance, that's really not a resolution.

744
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:58,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can get the same outcome by putting on a resolution that we need to explore drop-off boxes in the community, and then discuss it in the council, and decide if we want to send it to subcommittee.

745
01:01:59,034 --> 01:02:09,117
[SPEAKER_02]: But to get a two-page ordinance, I think, honestly, it does an injustice to, first of all, our process here as a council, because this is not the process

746
01:02:09,978 --> 01:02:11,119
[SPEAKER_02]: in the way things should work.

747
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:17,185
[SPEAKER_02]: An ordinance doesn't appear the first time on the council as a motion or a resolution.

748
01:02:18,086 --> 01:02:19,488
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens down the line.

749
01:02:19,928 --> 01:02:29,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what we saw just with this, and I'm not saying anything about the council or in particular, because I've probably been at fault doing this myself, but people read our

750
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:33,830
[SPEAKER_02]: agendas and look at it and say, Oh my goodness.

751
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:39,413
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the council, uh, be resolved that the city council adopt the following ordinance.

752
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:41,194
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about this tonight.

753
01:02:41,234 --> 01:02:42,414
[SPEAKER_02]: They may adopt this tonight.

754
01:02:42,774 --> 01:02:44,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even been able to read it.

755
01:02:44,175 --> 01:02:45,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been able to discuss it.

756
01:02:45,476 --> 01:02:54,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's alarming people to see this type of, uh, in depth, um, ordinance creation on the council agenda.

757
01:02:55,911 --> 01:03:11,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And my just humble approach would be, I would respectfully ask my colleagues that in the future we can discuss issues of ordinance change or anything we want without presenting, you know, a two or three page ordinance on the council agenda.

758
01:03:12,562 --> 01:03:18,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would just state that I think these are worthy things that we should be looking at and discussing.

759
01:03:18,665 --> 01:03:32,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to alarm people in the community that something, because potentially, this is on the agenda tonight, potentially if you had four members of this council tonight, that's all we require, can move this to a first reading tonight.

760
01:03:33,914 --> 01:03:36,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second reading is a newspaper and the third reading is down the line.

761
01:03:37,696 --> 01:03:40,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's where some of the concern comes in.

762
01:03:40,738 --> 01:03:58,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to say that's gonna happen because this council's been very thoughtful about sending things to subcommittee and vetting them all properly, but I would just caution my council colleagues that really the agenda is not the first place a two or three page ordinance should appear, Mr. President.

763
01:03:58,364 --> 01:04:03,306
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be released from subcommittee or committee of the whole and not on the council agenda.

764
01:04:04,146 --> 01:04:05,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Mox.

765
01:04:06,127 --> 01:04:06,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

766
01:04:07,808 --> 01:04:08,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President,

767
01:04:09,085 --> 01:04:18,588
[SPEAKER_07]: As the legislative body in the community, we need to start somewhere, and that's what this attempt at this proposal was to do, to start somewhere, to have this discussion start.

768
01:04:19,348 --> 01:04:28,990
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's certain aspects of the proposal that people don't like or that are possibly ineffective or not suitable for MEDFED at this point in time, that's great.

769
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:32,151
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we have the discussion and we go through the vetting process, Mr. President.

770
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:34,632
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it's all too often that we

771
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:39,311
[SPEAKER_07]: put items on the agenda and we say, do this, do that, do this, do that, and then nothing ever happens with them.

772
01:04:40,031 --> 01:04:47,713
[SPEAKER_07]: And I figured that it might be more conducive to time and to getting things done to actually put some language on a piece of paper as a launching pad, as a starting point.

773
01:04:48,053 --> 01:04:49,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can go from there, Mr. President.

774
01:04:49,834 --> 01:04:50,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, it's a proposal.

775
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:52,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Proposals pass, proposals fail.

776
01:04:53,435 --> 01:05:05,298
[SPEAKER_07]: It's certainly something that I'm comfortable supporting with the fact that we can take it through the subcommittee process, that it's going to have to go to a committee of the whole after it goes through the subcommittee process, that it's going to have to come to this council.

777
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:10,390
[SPEAKER_07]: for a vote for a first reading, be advertised for a second reading, and then come back to the council for a third reading, Mr. President.

778
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:17,993
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can certainly understand Councilor Mox's concern, because it did prompt some, I don't want to say fear, but certainly interest in the community.

779
01:05:18,993 --> 01:05:25,495
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you know, I felt as though it would be in the best interest of this body moving forward to put something with some language on a piece of paper.

780
01:05:25,535 --> 01:05:29,077
[SPEAKER_07]: We've voted three or four times now to regulate donation drop boxes.

781
01:05:31,077 --> 01:05:32,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing's ever come of it, Mr. President.

782
01:05:33,212 --> 01:05:38,055
[SPEAKER_07]: took some of the concerns that I heard over the last couple of years and I put them together and put pen to paper and made a proposal.

783
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:39,796
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where I was coming from with this.

784
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:45,499
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can certainly understand what the councilor is referring to in terms of, um, you know, shouting fire in a crowded movie theater.

785
01:05:45,879 --> 01:05:47,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, this isn't going to pass this evening.

786
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,361
[SPEAKER_07]: It was never an intention to have this matter pass this evening.

787
01:05:49,681 --> 01:05:52,162
[SPEAKER_07]: My intention was to have the matter go through the legislative process.

788
01:05:52,563 --> 01:05:54,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, just like we do with most matters that come before this council.

789
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:55,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

790
01:05:55,504 --> 01:05:56,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor.

791
01:05:56,084 --> 01:05:57,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Russo.

792
01:05:57,685 --> 01:06:00,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I don't want to seem argumentative in any way,

793
01:06:01,353 --> 01:06:05,935
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think this is a demonstration of a way that the legislative process works well.

794
01:06:06,816 --> 01:06:14,500
[SPEAKER_08]: It works in other bodies this way, both on the local, state, and federal level, Mr. President.

795
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:23,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think in recent years, we've seen a great use and work in subcommittee.

796
01:06:23,885 --> 01:06:30,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly, Mr. President, in your chairmanship of several subcommittees and also under the chairmanship of Counselor Knight,

797
01:06:31,512 --> 01:06:41,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and, uh, Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Kern and Councilor Marks and the various roles and chairmanship of subcommittees.

798
01:06:41,419 --> 01:06:45,502
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen, uh, great work in the subcommittees in recent years.

799
01:06:46,222 --> 01:06:51,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, they've not worked this hard in my estimation, uh, in, uh, decades.

800
01:06:53,307 --> 01:06:59,872
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, uh, I, uh, never thought that, uh, Councilor Knight would, uh, um,

801
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:08,329
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, expect any type of, uh, decision making tonight other than to send these matters to subcommittee.

802
01:07:09,049 --> 01:07:29,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh, and we've, uh, certainly received, uh, proposals of ordinance, uh, whether it be, uh, through a change in pay grades, uh, loan orders and, uh, any number of proposed ordinances come from the administrative side, uh, to us in the form of an ordinance proposed ordinance that we've, uh,

803
01:07:30,395 --> 01:07:55,687
[SPEAKER_08]: discussed, delayed action on, and then it was actually the good measure of Councillor Marks who called to all of our attention, and we've held to this over the past two years, that we not pass matters of ordinance in a first reading in wave three.

804
01:07:56,187 --> 01:07:58,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And this body has stuck to that for two years.

805
01:07:58,893 --> 01:08:06,536
[SPEAKER_08]: which I think is a very good measure and is a sound principle in legislation, Mr. President.

806
01:08:07,457 --> 01:08:17,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So my remarks aren't to be disagreeable, but only to point out my opinion on the way this process is working.

807
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:19,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's working well.

808
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,183
[SPEAKER_10]: The President Thank you, Counselor de la Rousseau.

809
01:08:22,823 --> 01:08:24,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

810
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Dave McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

811
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:35,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I was reading this ordinance and I think it is definitely well written and the points are very well taken.

812
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:42,124
[SPEAKER_06]: There is one thing that I would like to suggest to add to this is simply the drop boxes.

813
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:47,405
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest problem with the drop boxes is the amount of product that actually goes to those boxes and the overflow.

814
01:08:47,886 --> 01:08:53,387
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe there's some way we can ask for some sort of a calendar or something of pickup

815
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:57,590
[SPEAKER_06]: when the pickups occur, how many pickups are for each individual box.

816
01:08:57,911 --> 01:09:01,332
[SPEAKER_06]: That way there you have a monitoring system and you can hold people accountable for that.

817
01:09:01,752 --> 01:09:03,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's really the biggest issue of those boxes.

818
01:09:04,013 --> 01:09:05,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of those boxes are pretty well kept.

819
01:09:06,034 --> 01:09:10,375
[SPEAKER_06]: They're clean, they're neat, they're well painted, they're not really too disastrous.

820
01:09:10,755 --> 01:09:14,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the amount of product that goes around those boxes.

821
01:09:14,137 --> 01:09:20,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe there's that one window that you have an opportunity to kind of monitor that and maybe have better control over that.

822
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:21,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

823
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. McKillop.

824
01:09:23,953 --> 01:09:31,138
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, that this be sent to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.

825
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:32,619
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

826
01:09:32,639 --> 01:09:32,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

827
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,260
[SPEAKER_10]: No opposed?

828
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:36,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

829
01:09:37,742 --> 01:09:51,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Scott Pelli, be it resolved that the city administration reach out to National Grid with issues dealing with power outages around the city and report back to the city council.

830
01:09:54,044 --> 01:09:54,444
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, yeah.

831
01:09:54,805 --> 01:09:56,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Spend the rules to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

832
01:09:57,846 --> 01:09:58,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councillor Neill.

833
01:09:59,507 --> 01:10:00,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Scarpelli.

834
01:10:00,468 --> 01:10:00,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

835
01:10:00,808 --> 01:10:18,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that I apologize for not putting this on the agenda, but with the recent storm and the outages, mostly in North Medford and the Wellington area, I've received a few phone calls from people that live in the Felsway and the Salem Street area that they've been

836
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:27,445
[SPEAKER_05]: They've come across a few loud noise booms and then brief power outages.

837
01:10:28,546 --> 01:10:42,657
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can have the city administration discuss this with the national grid and see what might be causing this so we can let our constituents know what are these issues.

838
01:10:42,737 --> 01:10:49,402
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's starting to alarm a few of our senior residents that have contacted me in the last couple of weeks.

839
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And this isn't something that's been happening, I take it, just for the winter season.

840
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:57,103
[SPEAKER_05]: But this has been happening for a while now.

841
01:10:57,203 --> 01:11:02,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's alarming that it's a long period of outages.

842
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:10,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're hearing booms, and then you would have a brief outage for a minute or so.

843
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:12,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it would kick back on.

844
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:19,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's something going on here, we need to know what National Grid is doing in that area.

845
01:11:20,148 --> 01:11:28,212
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we can have the city administration reach out to National Grid and give us a report on those outages, it would be greatly appreciated.

846
01:11:28,433 --> 01:11:28,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

847
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:30,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

848
01:11:30,574 --> 01:11:31,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor DelaRusso.

849
01:11:32,034 --> 01:11:33,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

850
01:11:33,395 --> 01:11:40,099
[SPEAKER_08]: And perhaps if we could amend that, that the city develop a way of communicating with the public on this.

851
01:11:40,639 --> 01:11:43,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And the difficulty is your power's out and

852
01:11:45,373 --> 01:11:51,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Those of us who still have flip phones don't have the opportunity to check the internet.

853
01:11:53,155 --> 01:12:06,718
[SPEAKER_08]: However, in so many people's phones are now battery, if they have phones in their homes still, and not a old-fashioned landline, it's hard to communicate out of that.

854
01:12:07,318 --> 01:12:13,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say this, in this last storm, as I put myself to sleep, I was listening to WBZ.

855
01:12:14,019 --> 01:12:15,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Radio 1030, Dan Ray.

856
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,782
[SPEAKER_08]: And he had a representative from National Grid on.

857
01:12:20,442 --> 01:12:30,847
[SPEAKER_08]: And in live time, they kept giving updates through the whole show on what was going on throughout Massachusetts.

858
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:34,928
[SPEAKER_08]: And as Towns Power was coming on, they were announcing it.

859
01:12:35,709 --> 01:12:42,912
[SPEAKER_08]: So they, National Grid, to their credit, had a representative on the most listened to radio station

860
01:12:43,498 --> 01:12:58,026
[SPEAKER_08]: in the region and was updating people in real time as to, I heard it, the woman was there, she said at nine o'clock, I think it was a section of Saugus was supposed to come back on.

861
01:12:58,446 --> 01:13:00,607
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a woman who called who hadn't been listening.

862
01:13:01,307 --> 01:13:04,749
[SPEAKER_08]: She caught it, she says, I live in Saugus, I got no power, when's it coming on?

863
01:13:05,129 --> 01:13:08,931
[SPEAKER_08]: And she said, three, two, one, and boom, the lady's lights came back on.

864
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,273
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty remarkable.

865
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:16,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for this measure, because we do need clearer communication.

866
01:13:16,198 --> 01:13:17,359
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a major power outage.

867
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,883
[SPEAKER_08]: It was still warm out, so I think it was at the end of the fall, and South Medford was down.

868
01:13:21,923 --> 01:13:26,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Half the city was out, really, and it was a complete mess for people.

869
01:13:26,206 --> 01:13:27,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor.

870
01:13:27,448 --> 01:13:28,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

871
01:13:28,568 --> 01:13:36,235
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley, as amended by Councilor DelaRusso, all those in favor?

872
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:36,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

873
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:39,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor DelaRusso, I don't know if they make FM radio now.

874
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:47,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so they may want to get a better phone.

875
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:52,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's 2017.

876
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:56,356
[SPEAKER_10]: 17-323, offered by Vice President Marks and Councilor Knight.

877
01:13:57,036 --> 01:14:06,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Thomas Howell on his recent passing.

878
01:14:06,781 --> 01:14:10,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence

879
01:14:10,957 --> 01:14:11,677
[SPEAKER_10]: in his memory.

880
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:20,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I defer to the senior member, Mr. President.

881
01:14:22,264 --> 01:14:28,147
[SPEAKER_02]: It's senior member in length of service, not age.

882
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:34,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, Thomas Howell was a longtime Meffitt resident.

883
01:14:35,552 --> 01:14:37,833
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a staple in this community in the West Meffitt area.

884
01:14:38,372 --> 01:15:01,499
[SPEAKER_02]: He worked for the Department of Revenue, don't hold that against him, for a number of years in this community, and he was married for 50 years with his lovely wife, Mary Ann, and recently passed away, and we really lost a good gentleman in this community, and he will be sorely missed as a great guy, Mr. President.

885
01:15:02,139 --> 01:15:02,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Counselor Marks.

886
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:03,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor Knight.

887
01:15:04,179 --> 01:15:06,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and Counselor Marks,

888
01:15:06,914 --> 01:15:09,496
[SPEAKER_07]: certainly did a great job remembering Tom.

889
01:15:10,277 --> 01:15:12,238
[SPEAKER_07]: My relationship with Mr. Howell was a little different.

890
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:20,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember Mr. Howell when he was the manager at Chisholm's Motel, and his nephew Jason and I were very close friends.

891
01:15:20,345 --> 01:15:30,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of our first summer jobs, when we were old enough to work, was going over to Chisholm's Motel on Route 1 and flipping mattresses, which that in itself was an experience, let me tell you, Mr. President.

892
01:15:31,008 --> 01:15:38,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when Mr. Howell moved from Chisholm's Motel when he retired to 27 Playstead Road, and we helped him move.

893
01:15:39,431 --> 01:15:45,612
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 27 Playstead Road, Mr. President, and the House of the Karate's and the Howell's was one of those homes when we were kids.

894
01:15:45,632 --> 01:15:46,673
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't have to ring the doorbell.

895
01:15:47,013 --> 01:15:48,853
[SPEAKER_07]: We were walking by the house, and we needed to use the bathroom.

896
01:15:48,873 --> 01:15:49,794
[SPEAKER_07]: We needed a drink of water.

897
01:15:50,394 --> 01:15:51,034
[SPEAKER_07]: We banged twice.

898
01:15:51,054 --> 01:15:51,634
[SPEAKER_07]: We opened the door.

899
01:15:51,654 --> 01:15:52,134
[SPEAKER_07]: We walked in.

900
01:15:52,174 --> 01:15:53,695
[SPEAKER_07]: We said our name, and she said, help yourself.

901
01:15:53,755 --> 01:15:54,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be right down, honey.

902
01:15:55,752 --> 01:15:58,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary Ann, Joanne, Ron, and Tom were the greatest.

903
01:15:58,774 --> 01:15:59,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Great neighbors, great people.

904
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:02,356
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tom's going to be sadly missed.

905
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:07,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish the Karate family and the Howell family all the strength that they need to get through this.

906
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:13,581
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really want to thank them for allowing me to have the opportunity to become a friend of Tom's.

907
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:15,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And he will be sadly missed, Mr. President.

908
01:16:15,923 --> 01:16:16,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

909
01:16:16,223 --> 01:16:17,023
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could all stand, please.

910
01:16:29,783 --> 01:16:38,790
[SPEAKER_10]: 17-324 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Firefighter Anthony Meyer on his recent promotion to Lieutenant.

911
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:39,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

912
01:16:40,671 --> 01:16:42,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

913
01:16:42,393 --> 01:16:47,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Firefighter Meyer has been a longtime firefighter in our community and recently he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.

914
01:16:48,117 --> 01:16:50,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to thank him for his service and congratulate him on his appointment.

915
01:16:51,059 --> 01:16:55,202
[SPEAKER_07]: It's obviously a testament to the hard work and dedication that he's put forward in his professional career.

916
01:16:55,677 --> 01:17:00,541
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to say thank you very much and congratulations to Anthony Meyer, and I'd ask that my colleagues join me in doing the same.

917
01:17:02,722 --> 01:17:03,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

918
01:17:04,944 --> 01:17:06,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Long-Wilkerin.

919
01:17:06,485 --> 01:17:09,607
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

920
01:17:09,628 --> 01:17:20,155
[SPEAKER_10]: 17-325, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Firefighter Stephen Bluth on his recent promotion to the position of captain.

921
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:20,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

922
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:24,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. President, similar to Firefighter Meyer, now Lieutenant Meyer.

923
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Firefighter Blute was named a captain very recently.

924
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:32,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, it is also a testament to his dedication and hard work and his commitment to the community of Medford.

925
01:17:33,122 --> 01:17:35,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Great gentleman, long family relationship.

926
01:17:35,043 --> 01:17:38,124
[SPEAKER_07]: His mother and my grandmother go back very, very long time.

927
01:17:39,124 --> 01:17:46,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very encouraging and pleasing to see somebody with such a relationship to the family be so successful in their professional career.

928
01:17:46,626 --> 01:17:52,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to congratulate Stephen on his promotion and thank him for his hard work, service and dedication to the community of Medford.

929
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,589
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

930
01:17:55,669 --> 01:17:56,309
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

931
01:17:56,329 --> 01:17:56,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

932
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:00,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to revert back to regular business.

933
01:18:01,651 --> 01:18:05,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

934
01:18:05,033 --> 01:18:16,217
[SPEAKER_10]: 17-322, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Method City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Johnny Marr on his recent passing.

935
01:18:16,277 --> 01:18:16,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

936
01:18:17,758 --> 01:18:19,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, again, thank you very much.

937
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:27,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of us in this community, especially the South Medford area, we all know John Maher, Maher Service Station, right there across from Dunkin' Donuts.

938
01:18:28,085 --> 01:18:31,285
[SPEAKER_07]: And for a number of years, this was a family-owned and operated business.

939
01:18:31,425 --> 01:18:34,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And John Maher was a fixture in the community.

940
01:18:34,486 --> 01:18:38,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I met him a number of years ago, Mr. President, when I was involved with Pawpawanna football.

941
01:18:38,887 --> 01:18:47,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. Maher was the best cheerleader that the city of Medford ever had when it came to Pawpawanna football and cheering on his kids and the members of the team.

942
01:18:48,782 --> 01:18:50,464
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to be sadly missed, Mr. President.

943
01:18:50,504 --> 01:18:53,186
[SPEAKER_07]: His impact on the community is certainly going to be noticed.

944
01:18:53,466 --> 01:18:59,071
[SPEAKER_07]: For the last — the better part of the last four years, he struggled significantly with cancer.

945
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:05,276
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, the disease got the better of his mind and body, but it did not get the best of his soul.

946
01:19:05,316 --> 01:19:10,080
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to be greatly remembered, Mr. President, as an individual who gave of himself.

947
01:19:10,561 --> 01:19:15,565
[SPEAKER_07]: For a number of years, he was involved with the Medford Elks and the Elks organization and all the charitable work that they've done there.

948
01:19:16,012 --> 01:19:18,574
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's touched countless lives, Mr. President.

949
01:19:18,594 --> 01:19:19,635
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to be sadly missed.

950
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:25,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to extend the deepest condolences to his family in this time of loss and time of need, Mr. President.

951
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:26,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd ask that my colleagues join me in doing the same.

952
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

953
01:19:29,302 --> 01:19:30,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Castaneda.

954
01:19:31,424 --> 01:19:31,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

955
01:19:32,004 --> 01:19:34,186
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Counselor Knight.

956
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:35,247
[SPEAKER_00]: That's news to me.

957
01:19:35,287 --> 01:19:37,148
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very sorry to hear that John's gone.

958
01:19:37,836 --> 01:19:41,278
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I was a teenager, we used to get our cars fixed.

959
01:19:42,059 --> 01:19:48,884
[SPEAKER_00]: And if some of us didn't have enough funds, he was very nice about extending time.

960
01:19:49,804 --> 01:19:55,508
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually didn't really get to know him until I was a member of the Elks.

961
01:19:55,648 --> 01:19:59,431
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a stature of that organization.

962
01:19:59,491 --> 01:20:02,033
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a very, very good man.

963
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,660
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very sorry to hear it.

964
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

965
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:04,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Counselor knife for bringing this forward.

01:20:07,421 --> 01:20:08,261
[SPEAKER_10]: We all rise please.

969
01:20:22,744 --> 01:20:28,865
[SPEAKER_10]: The records of the meeting of March 21st, 2017 have been passed to vice president mocks.

970
01:20:29,378 --> 01:20:32,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Under your investigation, Mr. Counselor Marks, do you find the records in order?

971
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,582

974
01:20:38,724 --> 01:20:45,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I have brought it to the clerk's attention, so I ask that they be laid on the table for one week.
