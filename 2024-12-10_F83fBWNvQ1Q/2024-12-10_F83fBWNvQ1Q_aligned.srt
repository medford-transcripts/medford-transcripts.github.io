1
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,801
Test 1-2, test 1-2.

2
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:15,903
Number 10, 2024 Governance Committee.

3
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:22,726
I'm calling this committee meeting to order.

4
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:48,209
We're meeting on paper 24468, resolution to discuss updates to the city charter, be it resolved by the Metro City Council that the Governance Committee discuss updates to the city charter, including creating a timeline for action and reviewing proposals of the Charter Study Committee once finalized.

5
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:59,936
Representatives of the Edward J Collins jr center for public management at Boston are invited to provide an overview of the charter review process and the next steps for the city council.

6
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:02,578
Mr. Clerk may call the role.

7
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:03,839
President bears.

8
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:05,961
President.

9
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,623
Vice President Collins counselor Lazaro.

10
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:22,419
present, seven present or five present, two joining us, or one joining us, and the meeting is called to order.

11
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,220
Great.

12
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:32,843
Before we start, do any councillors have comments or questions about this paper, about Charter Review?

13
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:39,026
I see President Behrs on Zoom, and I recognize President Behrs.

14
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:42,189
Thank you, Chair Seng.

15
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,171
Just wanted to thank the Collins Center representatives for being there in person.

16
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:48,413
Apologies that I can't join you there tonight.

17
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:59,159
I'm really excited to hear from the Collins Center what the next steps are for the council to take action on the proposals and the framework of the Charter Study Committee.

18
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:09,465
I know that we haven't received that yet, so we won't be discussing their proposals and specifics, but more of what the timeline will look like in the new year for us to consider that.

19
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:24,955
And, you know, I have a few questions after we hear from them, but in general, I'm excited to work with my colleagues on this committee to consider, you know, any amendments to the proposals from the study committee.

20
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:34,459
And then my personal preference, I think, would be to hopefully report something out by the end of the spring to put on the ballot in November that would go.

21
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,860
And then if the voters were to approve it, it would go into effect

22
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:42,474
after the 2027 or for the 2027 election.

23
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:58,343
So still a ways away from this going into effect, but really excited and hopeful and looking forward to working with my colleagues over the next few months on finalizing a proposal and getting that before the voters.

24
00:17:58,603 --> 00:17:58,924
Thank you.

25
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:01,585
Thank you, President Bares.

26
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:09,053
Fellow Councillors, have any preliminary questions, comments, remarks?

27
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:11,857
Councillor Zara.

28
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:42,362
I just want to echo what President Behrs was saying, and I'm really excited about getting started and looking forward to taking what the committee discussed and what the Collins Center has to report and moving forward and getting going.

29
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:43,462
This is really exciting work.

30
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:49,024
This is something that we've been talking about for a long time and what many of us talked about during our campaigns as well.

31
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,505
So this is very exciting.

32
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:52,806
So I'm excited to get going.

33
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:57,654
Thank you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Zahra.

34
00:18:58,034 --> 00:19:03,718
The mic system is new, so we're all still learning the ins and outs of turning stuff on and off.

35
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,564
Do any other Councilors have any comments before we invite the Collins Center up?

36
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:13,626
Doesn't seem like it.

37
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:27,895
I just wanted to thank you all for being here at this meeting, for being willing to have this conversation with us and giving us a better idea of where the city council fits in into the charter review process.

38
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:33,597
I'd like to invite our representatives from the Collins Center up to make any remarks.

39
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:34,377
Yes.

40
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:45,383
Yes, yeah, that'd be perfect.

41
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:51,867
There's a small button I believe you have to press on the right with the multiple people.

42
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:53,428
There we go.

43
00:19:53,448 --> 00:20:00,273
And I'll ask your name and address for the record, please.

44
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:06,938
Marilyn Contreras, the Collins Center at UMass Boston.

45
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:08,659
Thank you.

46
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:12,101
Frank Wright, Collins Center at UMass Boston.

47
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:13,122
Thank you so much.

48
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:14,596
Or is yours?

49
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:16,097
Okay.

50
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:19,599
In terms of the, I don't need this.

51
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:34,527
In terms of the council's role, you will receive a proposal from the mayor and you will review it and then there'll be perhaps some negotiation.

52
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:43,091
There has to be agreement of the council to accept this charter by a majority vote and for the mayor to approve it.

53
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:46,026
And then it goes to the state legislature.

54
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,791
And that's the process that you really have to watch quite carefully.

55
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:58,019
It will be filed by your legislative delegation on the city's behalf.

56
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,545
And it will be the bill we assigned to the municipal and regional government committee.

57
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:07,048
And they will hold a hearing.

58
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:18,378
And they will also reach out to other committees that might have something to contribute to the analysis of the charter.

59
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:25,163
For example, the section dealing with elections might go to the elections committee, that kind of thing.

60
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:28,365
And the committee reports the bill out.

61
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:36,090
And after that, it continues its journey through the statehouse.

62
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:46,492
The committee on third reading reviews the bill to determine its consistency with the legislative drafting manual and the requirements of the manual.

63
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:52,934
The House and Senate council will look at it in terms of internal consistency and consistency with state law.

64
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:58,175
And then it will be put on the House and Senate calendars for vote.

65
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:04,396
If they accepted, if it's voted yes in both houses, it goes to the governor's office.

66
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:07,235
They conduct a final review and they sign it.

67
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:29,106
Now, if you want this on ballot in November of 2025, you really need to work with your delegation to make sure that you get it back by September 1st, so that the summary can be prepared, the ballot can be prepared, and you're not, you know, in fingernail-biting time.

68
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:35,368
I have a question about that.

69
00:22:36,828 --> 00:22:48,010
The state house process, is there a general length as to how long that review process might look to help us inform us about our timeline?

70
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:51,551
It depends.

71
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:53,011
It's a good year.

72
00:22:53,491 --> 00:22:54,272
It's an odd year.

73
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:55,792
So they're in session the whole time.

74
00:22:56,052 --> 00:23:00,293
They'll be holding their, they'll be meeting regularly.

75
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,953
There won't be long recesses.

76
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:06,322
But the state budget process comes along in May.

77
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:10,505
And that takes up basically May, June, and sometimes July.

78
00:23:11,746 --> 00:23:22,835
So it's best if you can get as much as you can on the front end before they start the budget deliberations, and maybe get it out at the end of the summer.

79
00:23:22,855 --> 00:23:24,937
Great.

80
00:23:25,257 --> 00:23:25,697
Thank you.

81
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:28,099
And one more question.

82
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:40,153
The plebiscite process, could you elaborate a little bit what that looks like if we wanted to put it on the ballot for November, or just the ballot in general?

83
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,676
And is it common to go that route?

84
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,638
Yes, yes.

85
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,043
The legislature has an expectation if you make major changes that it will go to the voters.

86
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:49,904
Great.

87
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:57,950
I had two questions that related to what you had just said, but if you have more comments, I'm happy to.

88
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,831
No, no.

89
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:02,353
I want you to know what you want to know.

90
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:05,616
So we're prepared for the questions.

91
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:06,376
Thank you.

92
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:13,381
Let me turn the floor over to my fellow counselors and see if they have any questions for now.

93
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:16,584
And if there are any struggling questions, I'll ask.

94
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,887
Please raise your hand if you're on Zoom so I can see.

95
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:25,919
President Behrs.

96
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,580
Thank you.

97
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,840
Yeah, you answered one of my questions around the referendum.

98
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,861
My second question is, what is the mechanism that we use for the referendum?

99
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:48,344
Is it technically that the council is placing a non-binding ballot question on the ballot, or is there another mechanism of mass general law that we're using in this case to place a referendum on the ballot?

100
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:54,325
Usually the act itself contains the provisions that you're going to use.

101
00:24:55,066 --> 00:25:05,617
to put a question on the, the question that goes on the ballot will be inside the charter document itself, will be inside your special act, the directions on how.

102
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,921
And is that a bind?

103
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:12,344
And so then essentially the language of that bind.

104
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:13,605
Yes.

105
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:15,127
Thank you.

106
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:25,364
So do any of other counselors have questions?

107
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:29,707
I think see Vice President Collins, give me one sec.

108
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,110
Great.

109
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,551
Thank you, Chair Seng.

110
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:36,811
Thank you so much for being here today.

111
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:41,334
And I know you've been very involved in guiding the committee's work over the past year or so.

112
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:44,016
So thank you so much for being a resource to our community.

113
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:49,419
So just to rephrase, I haven't been on the committee, so I'm, you know, just want to make sure I'm learning

114
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:50,954
learning this process.

115
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:56,217
So there's the draft that's been crafted.

116
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:57,978
We're going to get a proposal from the mayor.

117
00:25:58,378 --> 00:25:59,518
The city council will review that.

118
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:04,661
We may negotiate and make certain changes that the mayor can also sign off on.

119
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:13,925
Once we have that joint agreement between the city council and the mayor on a proposal that both parties agree to, then it is sent to the state legislation.

120
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:16,366
sorry to our state delegation.

121
00:26:16,386 --> 00:26:27,872
And at that point, this document that then has kind of the buy in of the City Council, the mayor sign off and review by the legislature, then that would go to the voters for the final vote before.

122
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:28,632
Yes.

123
00:26:28,872 --> 00:26:29,673
Okay, great.

124
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,174
Just wanted to make sure I had all those parts of the process in the right order.

125
00:26:32,214 --> 00:26:32,594
Thank you.

126
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:32,774
Yeah.

127
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:37,097
Thank you, Collins.

128
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:40,658
Um, do any other counselors have questions?

129
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,560
I see Councilor Scarpelli's hand raised on zoom.

130
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:48,623
Uh, thank you, uh, uh, gentlemen chair.

131
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:52,765
I appreciate first your assistance and these endeavors.

132
00:26:52,825 --> 00:27:03,689
I think that, uh, to be clear, I think that not to confuse everybody, but this is, this is what the conjunction with the, um, the charter committee that's been working so hard throughout the community.

133
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:09,651
I don't, I know that I had a question with, uh, just a text that the message text message saying, is this different?

134
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:10,652
And I said, no, it's, uh,

135
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:19,736
This is all conjunction, so this is a big team effort and making sure that we're putting the best product out and making sure that we have the best information moving forward.

136
00:27:20,276 --> 00:27:24,118
So we send this off to the state house that we're all in 1 breath.

137
00:27:24,218 --> 00:27:26,699
So, um, I just wanted to clarify that.

138
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,162
Um, and then, uh, if I can having the gentleman at the podium this evening.

139
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:38,505
Frank Wright, one of the most well-respected city auditors that I've ever worked with.

140
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:40,085
I really appreciate his presence.

141
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:45,968
And then Frank, if you need a job, Method's looking for a city solicitor and we could do anything you want.

142
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:48,229
Thank you.

143
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:50,850
Thank you.

144
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:56,352
Thank you, Councillor Scarbelli.

145
00:27:57,713 --> 00:28:00,334
Do we have any other Councillors with questions, remarks?

146
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,914
I think none for now.

147
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,257
Oh, Vice President Collins.

148
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:10,463
Thank you.

149
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:17,047
So I know that this probably looks different, like the timelines probably look a little bit different in every community.

150
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:26,151
I know you've spoken a little bit to timelines already, like what's the latest that we would want to get the charter back from the legislature?

151
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:29,933
What are those like hard stops that we need to get it on the ballot if we're going that route?

152
00:28:31,754 --> 00:28:36,757
When you've seen this process get done in other communities, are there any sort of like,

153
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:51,091
very obvious common trends that you see like usually once it gets back to the city council it's a three month process it's easy to get it in before budget time or it's not unusual for it to be a bit of a scramble is there anything that you tend to notice from when this done other cities.

154
00:28:52,550 --> 00:29:08,194
Yes, I've worked in several communities and it can be, it really depends on where the council is and where the mayor is and what you, you know, maybe three, three and a half months.

155
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:17,937
But I think one of the drivers is this, to get it into the legislature so you can get it out.

156
00:29:20,365 --> 00:29:26,427
And so if they're going to get it in June, you're calling it too close.

157
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:30,089
I think that's to Marilyn's point earlier.

158
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:34,371
That's why you want to make sure you're working closely with your state delegation.

159
00:29:34,711 --> 00:29:36,972
So you don't want to just bring it on them when you don't.

160
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,414
You want to make sure they're in the loop and they know this is coming.

161
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:45,056
Maybe they can give you some heads up on what your timetable should be.

162
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:46,361
Gotcha.

163
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:47,022
Thank you.

164
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:47,782
That makes a lot of sense.

165
00:29:47,802 --> 00:29:55,886
I want to make sure that it gets to them and have it be kind of frictionless by the time it gets to the state house so that they'll be able to act on it expeditiously.

166
00:29:55,906 --> 00:29:56,766
Thank you.

167
00:29:57,107 --> 00:30:01,509
The municipal and regional government committee will expect local officials to testify.

168
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:04,630
Good to know.

169
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:06,791
Thank you.

170
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:07,572
Thank you.

171
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:11,014
I see President Behrs' hand raised on Zoom.

172
00:30:12,674 --> 00:30:15,576
Yeah, I just want to take advantage of your experience.

173
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:18,819
on any tips and tricks around the legislative process.

174
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,362
I know sometimes things can get hung up.

175
00:30:21,462 --> 00:30:25,185
Are there any other strategies and approaches that you can suggest?

176
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:35,074
I was thinking, would it be helpful to invite our delegation to a council meeting where they can see us report it out or come to a committee meeting and ask questions in advance?

177
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:41,700
Just any tips and tricks to move this through the legislature would be much appreciated.

178
00:30:45,744 --> 00:31:01,892
Basically, it's different now because the committee assignments, sometimes you're looking for advocates who've maybe done charter work before on the municipal and regional government committee.

179
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:06,154
That's one outreach that I've seen.

180
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:07,675
Do you have any?

181
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:21,740
No, I mean, it can't hurt to include your state delegation, although I don't know what type of role that you will find that they'll take prior to actually getting the document.

182
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:50,986
The other thing is, the more you may stray from what the legislature is used to seeing, the more likely it is it's going to get hung up in the legislature, because people are going to want to examine what you're proposing, which they perhaps have not seen or have not regularly seen across the Commonwealth, and that can result in delay.

183
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,837
and we wanna make sure the process keeps going.

184
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:03,063
If I could follow up, Chair Singh.

185
00:32:03,944 --> 00:32:05,205
Yeah, yeah, I was just gonna ask.

186
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:06,386
Thank you.

187
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:18,776
Along those lines, would it be possible for us as a committee, as we move through different pieces of the proposed charter and different portions of that,

188
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:29,438
to consult with you on how far those proposals may be straying from a standard or something the legislature is more familiar with?

189
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:31,320
Yes.

190
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:35,663
We will be available to the council for any questions that they have.

191
00:32:37,225 --> 00:32:37,445
Great.

192
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:38,246
Thank you so much.

193
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:40,608
Thank you.

194
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:51,182
On that question, I've talked to a few members of our state delegation with regards to what the cooperation might look like.

195
00:32:51,983 --> 00:33:02,089
Something they mentioned is once they receive it, they might be able to talk with us about what they think might pass the state house, what they think might not pass the state house and make edits.

196
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,012
Would those edits have to come back to the city council and mayor's office for approval?

197
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:09,894
Probably not.

198
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:19,329
There is, the legislative drafting manual requires that you give direction to the legislature.

199
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:29,357
And the usual direction to the legislature is that you can, that any changes that you make should have to be approved by the mayor.

200
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:32,399
Great, thank you.

201
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:36,523
Are there any other questions from councilors?

202
00:33:39,691 --> 00:33:43,453
I had one more written down.

203
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:56,638
With regards to the enactment process, could you give us a little bit, a look into what that process looks like once, let's say the voters do vote yes on the new city charter?

204
00:33:56,718 --> 00:34:04,321
There'll be a set of directions in the charter in terms of what happens when, in terms of

205
00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:18,493
As one of the councilors has already noted, if it's on the ballot in 2025, then the terms and the composition of the council, if that changes, the first election would be November of 2027.

206
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:25,878
The budget process will start in fiscal year 20, it will start July 1st, 2028.

207
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:34,046
so that everybody has the script.

208
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:35,046
Got it.

209
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:51,576
And with regards to the vote itself, let's say by some reason the State House doesn't get it passed by September 1st, would the vote be pushed to the next ballot it's available for?

210
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:54,038
Is that something that we'd have to work to schedule with

211
00:34:54,486 --> 00:35:01,331
You would need another special act if you wanted to put it on a state election ballot, just like you did with the two and a half questions.

212
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:02,552
Okay, great.

213
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:09,217
And so I assume the dates for the elections are just written into the special act itself?

214
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:11,018
Yes.

215
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,661
Is that correct?

216
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:16,302
Great.

217
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:18,043
Those are the questions I have written down for now.

218
00:35:18,423 --> 00:35:20,485
Do other counselors have questions?

219
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:27,634
Don't see any hands on Zoom.

220
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:28,736
Great.

221
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:32,605
Oh, Vice President Collins.

222
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:34,326
I saw you thinking.

223
00:35:36,486 --> 00:35:36,886
Thank you.

224
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:48,109
Yeah, it does seem to me that the, as with most things having to do with our partners in the State House, it seems like the steps there are pretty clear, pretty organized.

225
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:54,250
They're just, you know, that's where the bureaucracy lives, so we have to make sure that we're- You're competing with their entire agenda.

226
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,490
Yeah, we just have, yeah, exactly.

227
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,951
So that's why your delegation has to,

228
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:03,594
be on top of where things are and where things appear to be going awry.

229
00:36:03,974 --> 00:36:04,514
Exactly.

230
00:36:04,554 --> 00:36:06,215
Yeah, it seems like that's that's pretty clear.

231
00:36:06,235 --> 00:36:08,337
We just have to be as soon as we can.

232
00:36:08,677 --> 00:36:08,877
Right.

233
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:14,541
We just have to be really clear about working with their timetables, getting on top of it and giving them as much time and notice as we possibly can.

234
00:36:15,261 --> 00:36:22,708
And I think for our process, that means trying to expedite the process of coming to consensus about what we are sending to them.

235
00:36:22,728 --> 00:36:33,958
And I appreciate also the clarity around which of those processes to click into if we're shooting for a November 2025 ballot, or if we're going to, again, try to put it on a state election ballot.

236
00:36:33,998 --> 00:36:38,822
So I think that these are all really good benchmarks to have as we head into 2025.

237
00:36:38,902 --> 00:36:40,724
And I think my takeaway is making sure that we're

238
00:36:42,024 --> 00:37:07,897
being diligent and efficient with our piece of the process, putting together the proposal that we'll actually be sending to the state house so that we can make sure that all the hard work that community members, mayor's team, city council, community members have put into this process reaches the state house in time for them to review it and do what we want on the timeline that works for Medford.

239
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:12,092
Thank you.

240
00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:15,295
I see Councilor Lazara's hand up.

241
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:20,200
Let me get that mic up here.

242
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:33,754
For the sake of clarity, also, it seems to me that the more we can be, the more our body and our state delegation can be on the same page and in agreement with each other, the better

243
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:41,059
The better position we would be probably to move it along quicker at the state level as well.

244
00:37:42,522 --> 00:37:43,104
Okay, great.

245
00:37:43,164 --> 00:37:44,427
I just wanted to be super clear.

246
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:45,248
Thank you.

247
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:55,881
Well, and piggybacking on that question, I was curious, you had mentioned that usually local officials are expected to testify.

248
00:37:55,901 --> 00:38:01,502
Is there anything else that we should know about as city councillors with regards to letters we may send?

249
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:04,103
Oh yes, they also accept written testimony.

250
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:11,905
Is there anything else that we should be aware of schedule or make sure that we do before

251
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:17,748
outside of the actual process of voting out of the city council.

252
00:38:18,748 --> 00:38:20,128
That's the most important thing really.

253
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:21,449
Okay, great.

254
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:29,012
Um, I tend to ask this question in almost every meeting I've been to make sure I'm not missing anything.

255
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:37,335
I'm curious what other frequently asked questions you might receive from city councilors from legislate

256
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:46,164
from people in local government about the charter review process, things that we haven't asked that we should ask or that we should know.

257
00:38:46,184 --> 00:38:52,550
You've been very diligent and thorough.

258
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:58,275
I really think that

259
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:08,414
What you need to know is that the charter is the legal foundation for the community.

260
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:17,360
And it's also describing your structure in basic ways.

261
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:28,628
You're trying to create a document so that when a resident picks it up, they can get a pretty good sense of how the city of Medford works.

262
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:37,559
And it's a document for the future.

263
00:39:38,939 --> 00:39:55,525
So my pet peeve is when a charter commission wants to solve the problem that happened in 1957 and bring that forward now, even though it could never happen again.

264
00:39:58,218 --> 00:40:04,220
So I just urge you to keep, is this serving Medford in 10 years?

265
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,901
Is this serving Medford in 12 years?

266
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:11,183
That's the focus as opposed to what happened in 1968.

267
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:15,745
Great, thank you.

268
00:40:17,026 --> 00:40:19,587
Before I turn it over to public part, oh.

269
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:24,509
I recognize President Beres.

270
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:27,357
Thank you.

271
00:40:27,397 --> 00:40:35,242
I just wanted to say that's the second compliment this council has received from the Collins Center in as many years on our diligence.

272
00:40:35,322 --> 00:40:36,423
So we appreciate that.

273
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:45,749
But I just wanted to also ask, is there any

274
00:40:50,154 --> 00:41:06,998
know, maybe I'll leave this for a more specific session, but I just wanted to thank you guys again for being here, for answering our questions, moving through the process, and I really look forward to working with you as we review the proposal of the Charter Study Committee and get to an agreement with the mayor.

275
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:08,098
Thanks.

276
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,299
Thank you, President Bares.

277
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:18,120
Are there any other comments before I turn it over to public participation?

278
00:41:20,774 --> 00:41:24,577
Seeing none, I'll call for public participation now.

279
00:41:24,657 --> 00:41:25,337
Thank you so much.

280
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:31,061
If you're on Zoom, please raise your hand.

281
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:33,743
If you're in person, please come up to the podium.

282
00:41:37,386 --> 00:41:38,847
Seeing none.

283
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:39,967
Great.

284
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:54,194
Well, I just wanted to thank you all again for coming to our meeting for giving us such a thorough, thorough explanation of the process of where we fit into it of the steps that we should, we should take and we should expect to take in the next few months as well.

285
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:59,257
I'm sure we'll be relying on you all for feedback and for advice as well.

286
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:07,220
But thank you for coming here, introducing yourselves to the new counselors who haven't seen you around before.

287
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:09,301
I'm very grateful.

288
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:16,224
I'm very excited to get this off the ground from our end, to get this to the State House and to the voters as well.

289
00:42:16,444 --> 00:42:19,546
I think Medford's been itching for this change.

290
00:42:23,137 --> 00:42:32,866
the hard work that everyone, the Charter Study Committee, the call-in center, counselors have and will put in to this process in the coming future.

291
00:42:33,366 --> 00:42:34,047
Thank you so much.

292
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:36,008
Do we have any motions?

293
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:38,210
Oh, I see President Behrs.

294
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:41,793
Just wanted to move to keep the paper in committee and adjourn.

295
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:43,295
Great.

296
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:50,081
On motion, I'll give the clerk a second to type.

297
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:07,551
On the motion to keep the paper and committee and adjourn by President there's seconded by Councilor Zaro.

298
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:11,031
Mr. Clerk, can you please hold the roll?

299
00:43:12,892 --> 00:43:13,512
President bears?

300
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:14,292
Yes.

301
00:43:15,172 --> 00:43:19,473
Mr. President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Scarpelli.

302
00:43:19,853 --> 00:43:20,153
Yes.

303
00:43:21,154 --> 00:43:21,594
I'm just saying.

304
00:43:22,114 --> 00:43:22,334
Yes.

305
00:43:23,374 --> 00:43:25,935
Five and affirmative, none against.

306
00:43:26,735 --> 00:43:27,435
Motion passes.
