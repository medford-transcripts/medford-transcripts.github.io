    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=967.067s">Vice</a>  President Collins counselor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=973.68s">present,</a>  seven present or five present, two joining us, or one joining us, and the meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=983.802s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=985.543s">Before</a>  we start, do any councillors have comments or questions about this paper, about Charter Review? <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=994.565s">I</a>  see President Bears on Zoom, and I recognize President Bears.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1000.694s">Thank</a>  you, Chair Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1003.015s">Just</a>  wanted to thank the Collins Center representatives for being there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1006.157s">Apologies</a>  that I can't join you there tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1008.999s">I'm</a>  really excited to hear from the Collins Center what the next steps are for the council to take action on the proposals and the framework of the Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1019.685s">I</a>  know that we haven't received that yet, so we won't be discussing their proposals and specifics, but more of what the timeline will look like in the new year for us to consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1030.376s">And,</a>  you know, I have a few questions after we hear from them, but in general, I'm excited to work with my colleagues on this committee to consider, you know, any amendments to the proposals from the study committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1044.941s">And</a>  then my personal preference, I think, would be to hopefully report something out by the end of the spring to put on the ballot in November that would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1054.645s">And</a>  then if the voters were to approve it, it would go into effect <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1058.701s">after</a>  the 2027 or for the 2027 election. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1063.302s">So</a>  still a ways away from this going into effect, but really excited and hopeful and looking forward to working with my colleagues over the next few months on finalizing a proposal and getting that before the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1078.567s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
