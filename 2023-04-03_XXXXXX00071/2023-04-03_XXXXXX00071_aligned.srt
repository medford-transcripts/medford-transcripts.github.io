1
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:10,564
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:11,444
And Shelly.

3
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:14,825
Shelly is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,866
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and change maker.

5
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:20,207
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:28,450
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:32,272
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,773
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:45,843
Alright, I'm here with Shelly.

10
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:46,704
Hi, guys.

11
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:47,404
Thank you all.

12
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:48,384
We've got a big group today.

13
00:00:48,444 --> 00:00:50,385
So, um we'll start with some introductions.

14
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:54,086
If you don't mind saying your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

15
00:00:54,106 --> 00:00:56,987
So, I'll go first.

16
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:58,988
My name is Alex Lesson Hop.

17
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,369
Uh you see him pronouns.

18
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,049
I live in South Medford.

19
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:08,371
Um and I am the chair of Housing Medford which we're going to be talking about today.

20
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:09,532
I'm originally from

21
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:23,019
five or six years ago, and I've lived in the Boston area since 2011, and I work at the Museum of Science in my day-to-day job.

22
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:25,844
Great, thank you.

23
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:29,787
Hi, everyone.

24
00:01:30,187 --> 00:01:31,788
My name is Cassian Fonte.

25
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:40,733
I use she, her pronouns, and I live in Haverhill, Massachusetts, and I'm from Lawrence, so longtime Merrimack Valley native.

26
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:47,237
My background is actually in education policy and organizing for education justice.

27
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:49,598
I was an elected school board member in Lawrence.

28
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:51,558
still near and dear to my heart.

29
00:01:52,659 --> 00:02:00,361
But now I have transitioned to housing advocacy and I'm the associate director of operations at Abundant Housing Massachusetts.

30
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:09,724
So I basically oversee our statewide organizing work as well as the internal operations of a growing nonprofit and I'm excited to chat more about that.

31
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:18,924
All right, and I am third and last on your list today, Roberta Cameron.

32
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:23,547
I've lived in Medford for about 27 years.

33
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,050
I serve on the Community Preservation Committee.

34
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,853
Since 2017, 2015, I helped to run the campaign that adopted the Community Preservation Act.

35
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:50,120
And I've been a planning consultant for about 25 years, mostly working in Massachusetts, doing a lot in housing policy, as well as other areas.

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,781
And for the last couple of years, I've been working for the city of Somerville as their Community Preservation Act manager.

37
00:02:55,801 --> 00:03:03,262
So, experience both in Medford and beyond, and excited about this conversation.

38
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:07,767
We're thrilled that you're here, all of you.

39
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:08,367
Thank you.

40
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:09,508
Thanks for being here.

41
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:17,875
And so every episode we ask our guests the same question to sort of ease into the topic and break the ice a little bit.

42
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:25,782
But if you all could share, perhaps we can go in the same order, just what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there.

43
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:32,250
I think I have to say Chili Garden in Medford Square.

44
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:39,617
And as far as things to eat, so I usually like to get, we usually order off their Sichuan menu.

45
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:44,582
Although if you have a craving for like the classic American Chinese, you know, it's all there.

46
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,931
I like the like dry diced chicken.

47
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,651
It's really good.

48
00:03:48,771 --> 00:04:00,796
And we used to joke that we ordered from them so much when my wife was pregnant with my oldest child, my daughter, that she was probably like 25% Mapo tofu by the time she was born.

49
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:05,738
So we ordered a lot of Chili Garden when she was pregnant.

50
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:08,939
That was her like main pregnancy craving was Mapo tofu from Chili Garden.

51
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,320
That's gotta be my answer.

52
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:12,729
Shelly is a chili garden fan.

53
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:18,011
I'm also a chili garden fanatic and had a 6 year pregnant relationship with the menu.

54
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,433
So that resonates.

55
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:24,615
Thanks Alex.

56
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:27,617
Okay, I really love that.

57
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:39,741
I'm definitely going to check it out because I don't have a lot of dining experience in Medford since I up in the Merrimack Valley, but I do just want to plug my favorite restaurant.

58
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:47,463
It's also a really great just community space and bookstore, independent bookstore in the city of Lawrence.

59
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:49,224
It's called El Taller.

60
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:53,367
It's spelled, it looks like Taller, T-A-L-L-E-R in English.

61
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:58,711
And it's just incredible Mexican, sort of Dominican fusion food.

62
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:05,936
They have the best crispy double fried tostones, like smashed plantains in the world.

63
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:07,757
I keep telling them they need to trademark it.

64
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:09,799
But yes, I need to make a plug for them.

65
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:10,539
Thank you.

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,100
I love it.

67
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:18,544
And I'm going to call out Kushari Grill on Boston Avenue.

68
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:24,506
I really love a one-dish meal, and so their hawashi hits the spot for me.

69
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:26,286
Okay, great.

70
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:27,167
Cool.

71
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:28,287
Thank you all.

72
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:37,269
So we were just kind of hoping you could, it sounds like we have some perspective from the state level when we talk about housing, and then also from the more local Medford level.

73
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:43,251
So we're wondering if you could teach us a little bit about the genesis of housing Medford and abundant housing.

74
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:46,483
Absolutely.

75
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,565
I'm happy to start with that.

76
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:55,452
And so Abundant Housing is an organization that was founded only three years ago now.

77
00:05:55,472 --> 00:06:00,397
I had to count because like with COVID, the years kind of run together.

78
00:06:00,457 --> 00:06:03,320
But we were founded three years ago.

79
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,643
And our motto is

80
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:09,104
building, you know, making Massachusetts for everyone.

81
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:25,228
We know that that is not the case because the housing crisis is so palpable across all groups and income levels but really affecting most poignantly, you know, our BIPOC and lower income communities.

82
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:37,960
And we saw a specific need in the advocacy space for a statewide coalition that would bring housing advocates from across the state together on specific issues.

83
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:46,108
Because the reality is that housing development, land use decisions, zoning, those

84
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:57,760
Um, by and large happen at the local level, of course, with the help of state regulations that that really sort of dictate what happens to some degree.

85
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,904
But Massachusetts is a very parochial state.

86
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:05,108
We really believe in local control and local government for better or worse.

87
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:05,448
And

88
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:18,098
You know, abundant housing saw this need in the advocacy space to have a statewide network that would particularly focus on what we talk about as the housing shortage.

89
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:32,328
We know that one of the systemic issues that contributes to the lack of affordability for everyone is the fact that there just aren't enough housing options.

90
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,710
There isn't enough housing for the amount of

91
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,752
for the population change, and so the amount of people that are here and want to move, or the amount of people that want to move here.

92
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:46,193
And the housing production has just not kept up with the pace of demand.

93
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:55,956
And so what that does is it creates a strain, and it puts people in situations where they are bidding each other out for housing.

94
00:07:56,456 --> 00:08:00,058
And in that circumstance, lower income people will always lose.

95
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:04,239
And we're seeing that, I think, exacerbated even this year

96
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:11,684
the increased interest rates, and we're even seeing that in rental units in the last couple of years.

97
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:26,254
And so we felt like there was an opportunity to really focus on the housing shortage, because we didn't necessarily see that being talked about in sort of the dominant conversations and narratives.

98
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:30,577
And we, you know, we do understand that when we talk about the housing crisis,

99
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:47,833
I like to talk about it from the perspective of the Othering and Belonging Institute out of Berkeley has this really great report that deconstructs the housing crisis as actually 12 different crises, many of which intercede, but some of which don't.

100
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:53,959
And the parts that we're really focused on are not just the housing shortage, but also zoning reform.

101
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:01,445
I will say personally, I barely knew what zoning was before I started this job, you know, a year and a half ago.

102
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:05,948
And now I'm a, you know, board of appeals member in Haverhill.

103
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:09,630
Zoning is basically how we decide we use our land.

104
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:22,840
And zoning historically has been used as a tool of exclusion, has been used as a tool to create, you know, really wealthy suburbs with high opportunities, schools that, you know,

105
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,681
property taxes that go into our schools and create all these opportunities for kids.

106
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:34,623
But then in places like Lawrence, we don't have that because it's concentrated in economic poverty.

107
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:43,745
And so we are all about changing zoning laws so that it's easier to build multifamily, what we call missing middle housing.

108
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:46,726
And all that's meant by that is, you know,

109
00:09:47,386 --> 00:10:13,343
housing that is more naturally occurring affordable in the marketplace, so we're talking about duplexes, triplexes, things that are not large single-family homes, because the reality is that another thing we talk about is there's not enough suitable options for different life stages, you know, for elders, downgrading, well, not downgrading, I'm sorry, but, you know, what's the term I'm looking for?

110
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:13,783
Downsizing.

111
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:16,825
Thank you, downsizing, not downgrading.

112
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:20,407
Very different.

113
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:35,398
And there's not enough sort of starter homes, right, for folks that are just getting into home ownership, which, for better or worse, is one of the primary ways that historically people in our country have built wealth.

114
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:37,500
And so, so many are left out of that.

115
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:53,160
The last thing I'll say, because I know I'm going on and on, is we do also support and understand the importance of tenant protections and development without displacement, and so we don't feel that development is something that has to happen.

116
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,122
We don't feel that those are, you know, those are two topics that are at odds with each other.

117
00:10:57,182 --> 00:11:07,548
And so we support legislation that would, for example, allow tenants the first right of refusal in purchasing a property if their landlord is selling.

118
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:12,471
We support eviction ceilings so that no one's housing record

119
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:17,734
you know, negatively impacts them when they're looking for a job, for example.

120
00:11:17,854 --> 00:11:20,476
And so, we really try to take an umbrella approach.

121
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:27,200
And one of the ways we do that is by bringing in local pro-housing groups, like Housing Medford.

122
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:36,045
We support them in really building their capacity as advocates to engage at the local level and bringing them together with other groups across the state.

123
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:42,888
So, I do at this point want to make space for Alex and Roberta, as I like to say her name.

124
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:45,709
To talk about housing Medford.

125
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:50,170
Thanks, Cassie, the housing Medford actually.

126
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:57,032
Redates the creation of of and housing Medford was established around.

127
00:11:57,312 --> 00:12:01,513
I want to say 2018 with the assistance of a different organization called.

128
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:06,134
Which stands for the citizens, housing and planning association.

129
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:09,031
And Chapa is an awesome organization.

130
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:17,246
They're also statewide advocacy and they really focus on advocating for affordable housing in particular.

131
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,010
So that term can get.

132
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,289
pretty fraught, I think.

133
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:36,660
Like the way that we use the term affordable housing, really we mean housing that is, or generally what we mean, we can mean a lot of different things, but one thing that is often meant is housing that is like restricted to people of

134
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,005
below the median income or at a particular income, income-restricted housing.

135
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:49,551
There's also housing that just happens to be affordable to you, whatever your income is, and those can be different.

136
00:12:50,212 --> 00:13:03,104
But CHAPA really seeks to encourage the production of that income-restricted housing so that there's something in place there for people who don't make the median income in our community, which is pretty high.

137
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:18,160
So CHAPA had an initiative that was to go to different communities like Medford, and Arlington was another one that they worked in, and helped to just establish Housing Medford as a little citizens group, you know, residence group here in Medford.

138
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,281
And we worked with one of their staff members for about a year.

139
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,981
Her name is Dana LeWinter.

140
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:25,301
She was awesome.

141
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:32,703
She helped us kind of write a policy agenda for the first year, helped us try to figure out what we wanted to focus on, and we actually had some

142
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,143
I don't know, I would say some pretty big wins early on in our sort of existence as a group.

143
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:43,705
We've always been a pretty small group, but we've had a strong voice with the city.

144
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:53,289
And so one of the things we did early on, I think it was in 2019, we helped advocate for the passage of something called inclusionary zoning here in Medford.

145
00:13:53,689 --> 00:14:00,252
So Medford didn't have an inclusionary zoning ordinance on the books, but we helped advocate for the creation of one.

146
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:14,198
Basically, what that does is that for any multifamily development over a particular number of units, the developer has to designate a certain percentage of those to be income restricted at certain levels.

147
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,522
It's different depending on how many there are.

148
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:18,523
It's a different percentage.

149
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:28,569
But that just basically ensures that there's some level of, you know, below market rate units that are available in any of these larger developments that get built.

150
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:45,600
And so if you look around at any of the, you know, newer, bigger multifamily buildings in Medford, like the Lumiere or the Madeira or something, you probably have some, you know, 10, 15% of those are income restricted and available to people who make less than the median income here in Medford.

151
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,720
Roberta, what am I missing about housing Medford?

152
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,600
We've existed since about 2018.

153
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,540
Here we are now.

154
00:14:54,621 --> 00:15:01,182
So, I mean, I'll pick up in the first year we talked about the inclusionary zoning.

155
00:15:01,302 --> 00:15:13,565
And then in this past year, one of the things so we there were some things that we were advocating for in this past year that were really we felt important to advancing affordable housing in Medford.

156
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:17,946
Those were for the city to adopt a housing plan.

157
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:35,082
They had prepared a housing production plan in the last couple of years which needed to be adopted by City Council in order for us to be able to make that housing plan public and show the development community, show our community at large what

158
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:44,947
kind of affordable housing we want in the community and to begin to implement the the strategies that are identified in the plan.

159
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,609
So we needed City Council to adopt that housing production plan.

160
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:55,773
We were asking for City Council to establish an affordable housing trust which is

161
00:15:57,036 --> 00:16:00,098
Like a commission, it's similar to the community preservation committee.

162
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:05,682
It's a commission who has control over a pool of money.

163
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:12,126
That's to be used specifically for affordable housing and that money can be raised in a number of different ways.

164
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,987
It can use community preservation act money.

165
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:16,208
It can use.

166
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:18,889
pilot money.

167
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:29,072
It can receive tax title property that that the city has that can be repurposed for affordable housing.

168
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:38,155
There are a number of different ways that that money can be collected but money is collected by the affordable housing trust and then used for affordable housing.

169
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:42,917
So we were advocating for the creation of an affordable housing trust in the community.

170
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:46,598
Many other communities around us have affordable housing trusts.

171
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:46,798
We're

172
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,382
Somewhat late to the game and establishing this tool.

173
00:16:50,983 --> 00:17:04,720
And then finally, the 3rd thing that we wanted to see the city do in the last few years was to hire a full time housing planner so that we could have capacity in city hall to support and.

174
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:08,163
move forward affordable housing initiatives.

175
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:17,189
So, all three of those objectives, I would say, have been accomplished in the last year, just in this year.

176
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:27,116
So, last year, the city council approved the housing production plan and just in the past month, they have

177
00:17:28,517 --> 00:17:36,119
Um or they're currently in the process of moving forward the establishment of an affordable housing trust.

178
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:49,724
So, let's look in the near future for the affordable housing trust to begin getting off the ground and finally, we have right now currently posted a position for a full-time housing planner in City Hall.

179
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:55,165
So, if you know anyone who has the qualifications, we're

180
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,910
Um, but we have looking forward, um, in in the current time, what do we need to do?

181
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,874
What is housing Medford trying working on doing now?

182
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:10,398
Um, I'd say that there are 4 areas of.

183
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:18,027
of our agenda that we need to work on for the city of Medford.

184
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:32,581
One is leadership, filling that staff position, making sure that when boards and commission positions open up that we fill those board and commission positions with people who are friendly to affordable housing and to housing development.

185
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:42,561
they can play a critical role in blocking or opening the door for affordable housing development.

186
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:45,063
And finally, community organizing.

187
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:59,112
What we need to do most of all is to get people talking positively across the community about affordable housing and participating in planning initiatives, coming out and speaking up for affordable housing.

188
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:00,933
So we need help reaching people.

189
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:10,584
And so we're brainstorming and trying to find ways that Housing Medford can better reach the public.

190
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:14,169
So thank you very much for having us on Medford Bites today.

191
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,373
One more way that we can reach out to people.

192
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:20,335
Secondly, we need to participate in planning.

193
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:33,325
The city right now has a lot of zoning initiatives that they're looking at, implementing the city's master plan, that housing production plan that I mentioned, to create affordable housing opportunities.

194
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:37,948
And we also have neighborhood or site planning going on.

195
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:43,973
Just today, I saw an announcement that the city is inviting people to participate

196
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:52,381
in planning for the reuse of the parking lots behind City Hall.

197
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:59,368
So, re-envisioning Medford Square with those being the prime opportunity places.

198
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:04,494
So, let's talk about building more affordable housing in Medford Square.

199
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:11,497
by participating in these planning activities that the city is doing.

200
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:27,382
So advocating for development projects, as I mentioned, coming out and speaking up for we have 40B projects that are in the pipeline and other housing projects that are in the pipeline that we want to speak up for.

201
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,583
And as Cassie mentioned earlier,

202
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:49,878
There may be housing stability ordinances that the city is considering that we want to support as well to help people to be able to afford their housing and stay at their housing and finally advocating for state initiatives that promote affordable housing.

203
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,899
So, that's a lot already and I'm only through two out of four.

204
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:04,482
The next area that Housing Medford is working on is building resources, raising money for the Affordable Housing Trust.

205
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:14,344
So, looking for ways that we can increase the funding that the Affordable Housing Trust has to use in committing public land to affordable housing.

206
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:17,685
Like I mentioned, the parking lots behind City Hall,

207
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:32,987
And potentially parcels that could be used for affordable housing through the land trust advocating again to the state legislature to increase the money that's available to us to spend on affordable housing.

208
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:49,019
And then finally, the 4th area is that housing Medford is looking to support partnerships, recruiting nonprofit developers to build in Medford and recruiting.

209
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:59,984
non-profit organizations to come and provide services to Medford residents where Medford is currently a social service desert and we're a child care desert.

210
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:09,809
We're missing a lot of services that residents need and it's all related to our living cost and the cost of housing.

211
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:16,052
So we need to work on bringing organizations into Medford to provide services.

212
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:17,533
So that's

213
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:24,137
Incredible working on today, you 3 are very prepared for just that 1st question.

214
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:25,197
I think you covered a lot.

215
00:22:25,437 --> 00:22:27,619
So, you took us 80% of the way through the podcast, but incredible.

216
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:39,267
you know, you've experienced multiple wins, you know, in a variety of spaces.

217
00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:54,342
And I think while you're all speaking, my mind goes to process and wondering sort of, you know, where their spaces in cultivating a relationship with the city that felt like areas of strength where their positives what felt more difficult.

218
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:56,224
And I think that.

219
00:22:56,925 --> 00:23:01,829
You know, folks want to participate, or they would like to think that they could participate, but then what does that mean?

220
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:03,751
And what kind of time is involved?

221
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:10,516
And will I be politically chastised or, you know, just do folks who look like me speak like me read like me also participate.

222
00:23:11,377 --> 00:23:17,742
So, maybe if you might speak to what it's felt like in the moment, and maybe what you've taken are their takeaways.

223
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:27,616
I've personally felt like everyone at the City has been incredibly receptive to our group.

224
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:32,037
And I don't know all the things that have contributed to that.

225
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:39,259
I feel like having people like Roberta involved who are really active with the City and people already know them, there's kind of an element of trust.

226
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:44,821
And so when I sort of jump in and say, yeah, I'm here from Housing Medford, they know already who we are.

227
00:23:45,061 --> 00:23:48,282
And it's been a very positive relationship with

228
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:55,476
know, the mayor, the mayor's staff, the city council, like everybody has been just very, I don't know, open.

229
00:23:55,557 --> 00:24:05,405
And not to say that there haven't been disagreements or we haven't, you know, not wanted things to go a certain way that they've gone, but in general, I felt like things have been very positive.

230
00:24:06,526 --> 00:24:11,510
What has been a little bit harder and can be really scary, but is also one of the kind of

231
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:23,871
easiest, easiest, no, I'm not going to say it's easy, but least time-consuming things to do is speaking up at public meetings in support of affordable housing or even just housing in general.

232
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:35,980
I don't know how many folks listening or how many of you, I know people, my fellow housing organizers have been up there at a public meeting, but they're very negative, especially when housing gets talked about.

233
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,902
And I think I thought this stuff about housing

234
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,234
10, 15 years ago.

235
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:53,118
I'm not sure if it's just knee-jerk or whatever, but you get up there and people are yelling, it's too big, there's not enough parking, too much traffic, it's going to overcrowd the schools.

236
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,019
It's a very negative environment to be in, and if you're up there and you just want to say,

237
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:07,436
I would love to have new neighbors in my community or like, this corner has been like a dead zone for 25 years.

238
00:25:07,796 --> 00:25:15,643
Do you really think that like, having a small apartment building with, you know, even a bank on the bottom wouldn't be a little bit better, like make it a little livelier?

239
00:25:15,663 --> 00:25:16,944
It's very scary.

240
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:24,250
And so I, you know, that's been something that's been a little bit scarier for me, but working with the city has not been something that's been

241
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:28,706
Negative, it's been very receptive to us and to our entire group.

242
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:31,929
I mean, did you have something?

243
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:55,152
Yeah, can I just say some, I want to just like reaffirm what Alex is saying with like a quick sort of historical anecdote because before I started working in housing, I didn't quite realize how resistant communities were to new housing or development in general.

244
00:25:55,912 --> 00:25:57,113
even affordable housing.

245
00:25:57,133 --> 00:26:06,417
And I think, you know, there's some great research out of Boston University from Maxwell Palmer and Katie Einstein on what they call neighborhood defenders.

246
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:17,243
And they really do a good job of contextualizing the fact that we have a system, we have a local political system that prioritizes and privileges

247
00:26:17,963 --> 00:26:32,799
majority homeowners, majority white males, older, and I think that I would like to think that tide is changing and a lot of the pro-housing work we're doing

248
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,481
But it is scary.

249
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:53,806
And I think that what we emphasize, and I say scary because I've been in a space where I'm the only woman of color in the entire room and it's deeply uncomfortable to hear people who don't look like me saying things that are very exclusive and frankly racist and classist.

250
00:26:54,626 --> 00:27:00,168
And then I'm one of the two or three people that I brought with me getting up standing in support of an

251
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:03,915
Accessory dwelling unit ordinance, for example.

252
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:12,424
But I think to Alex's point, the city is really receptive to that because they're used to like all the negative neighborhood defenders.

253
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:19,650
And it's really refreshing when they see people supporting something, supporting positive smart growth changes in their neighborhood.

254
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:24,915
And in Haverhill, we ended up passing that ADU ordinance.

255
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:32,561
And partly not because of everyone that showed up to speak in support, but I got some of my friends and family who probably

256
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:34,602
you know, they didn't feel safe, frankly.

257
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:36,244
They didn't feel safe testifying.

258
00:27:36,264 --> 00:27:37,605
They didn't feel comfortable.

259
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:42,048
They just wrote an email or they, you know, texted their city counselor.

260
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:46,712
Even those small points of contact really matter, even one email.

261
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:53,737
And so at AMA, and I think in the work we do, we really try to emphasize everyone can be an activist.

262
00:27:53,957 --> 00:27:56,199
There's activism opportunities for everyone.

263
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,081
It's a tool for social change.

264
00:27:58,221 --> 00:27:59,302
Your voice matters.

265
00:27:59,902 --> 00:28:02,328
and you can find that medium that works for you.

266
00:28:02,428 --> 00:28:04,713
You don't have to always be the person testifying.

267
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:28,921
Yeah, so, well, we have a long list of things that I've just rattled off that we're watching and working on the most of the people who participate in housing Medford are simply on our email list and they hear an action item come up and they can contact the city counselor or contact the mayor.

268
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:34,365
So, they may, or they can write a letter to the board or commission.

269
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:40,768
They don't necessarily have to stand up and be that lone person at the Mike in a big public meeting.

270
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:42,690
There are other ways to advocate.

271
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:49,233
And so we hope to, as a group, be able to tell people where their voices can.

272
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:51,755
It can chime in.

273
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:59,295
Thank you, and you mentioned sort of how folks can get involved being on your email list.

274
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:01,757
What's the best way to find you or to like get in touch?

275
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:05,599
I would say there's a few different ways.

276
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:13,925
If they want to get on an email list, they can go to housingmedford.org and there's a contact page that has just a little sign up form for the mailing list.

277
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:19,228
Pretty low volume because it's mostly me sending emails a few times a month, if that.

278
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:20,969
So don't worry, I won't spam you.

279
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:37,065
We also have a Google discussion group that you can access and probably the best way is just to email housingmedford at gmail.com, which is like a little bit more if you want a little bit more email kind of back and forth talking about stuff that's there, as well as our social media.

280
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:37,705
We're on Facebook.

281
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:38,585
We have a page group.

282
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:44,946
We have a very inactive Twitter because also I'm a little bit nervous about tweeting just stuff into the ether, but I'm trying to get better.

283
00:29:46,006 --> 00:29:47,786
So those are some easy ways.

284
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:51,607
And I'm always happy to just have conversations with folks who are like,

285
00:29:52,152 --> 00:29:58,518
I think I might be interested in Housing Medford, but I don't really know what I want to do or what you do or what I can do.

286
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:06,026
So housingmedford at gmail.com is a great way to just kind of make a touch point with me and then go from there.

287
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:07,668
Awesome.

288
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:08,048
Thank you.

289
00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:09,590
I love it.

290
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,634
Well, we want to be mindful of your time and we're thankful that you were able to meet with us on a late night.

291
00:30:16,674 --> 00:30:22,458
But before we kind of wrap up, I'm wondering if you have anybody has anything else that they were hoping we would ask about or wanted to share.

292
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:39,852
I don't know, like, this is something that you can use or not use in in your podcast, but I thought that I could maybe say a few points about, like, defining the housing crisis in Medford and, like, why are we talking about affordable housing?

293
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:44,174
So a couple years ago, I started to put together some data.

294
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:47,335
I just actually updated what I could and reported on it last year.

295
00:30:47,935 --> 00:30:50,116
But the data that I have is primarily from 2021.

296
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:55,217
The average condo price in Medford then was $575,000.

297
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,039
So that's the average condo.

298
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:01,119
We're not even talking about single family home.

299
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,661
That would require an income of close to $140,000 to be able to afford to buy a condo in Medford.

300
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:05,821
And

301
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:20,104
By comparison, about one third of the jobs in the Boston metro region put people into this income bracket.

302
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:29,986
So no matter where you work in the Boston metro region, only a third of people can afford to buy a condo in Medford.

303
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:32,047
And these aren't Medford jobs.

304
00:31:32,147 --> 00:31:36,588
Medford jobs pay on the lower end of the Boston metro region scale.

305
00:31:37,568 --> 00:31:51,773
So then also 2021 data, the average rent for a one bedroom in Medford was $2,500 a month, which requires an income of $100,000 for that to be affordable.

306
00:31:52,353 --> 00:32:00,416
That means that excludes about 37% of the Boston Metro workforce from being able to rent an apartment in Medford.

307
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:16,304
And so then looking like where do people live then if they can't rent an apartment, they can't buy a condo, the income needed to be able to rent a room at market rate, which is about $1,000 a month, is $40,000.

308
00:32:18,065 --> 00:32:28,391
So there are a lot of service workers, especially in food service and hotel industry in the Boston area, who don't make enough money to be able to rent a room.

309
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:41,123
So that just puts in context the housing crisis that we have in this area that we're responding to in trying to advocate for affordable housing development.

310
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:45,567
And we really need every kind of housing of every description.

311
00:32:46,168 --> 00:32:53,514
You know, everything from rooms to houses, home ownership opportunities, senior

312
00:32:55,355 --> 00:33:03,859
Senior housing that will enable people to downsize and be able to stay in the community housing for people with disabilities.

313
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,161
Housing for families, we just need every kind of housing.

314
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:08,841
So.

315
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:11,442
That's what that's what we're working for.

316
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:12,543
Right?

317
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:20,246
Yeah, I remember when we were buying a home in Medford that we were benefited from the first time home buyers program.

318
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:29,488
And I remember learning about, depending on what city, City of Boston had their own program, Cambridge had a program, Medford didn't have a program.

319
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:31,068
So it was like a statewide thing.

320
00:33:31,088 --> 00:33:37,110
So I wonder, is that any part of the agenda or is that something that has come up?

321
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:42,868
We would definitely like to see more resources for home ownership.

322
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:48,931
I should add that Medford has been able to establish resources to help renters.

323
00:33:50,612 --> 00:34:07,001
We had rental assistance during the pandemic, that program has completed, but we have a move-in assistance program where people who are moving into Medford who are income qualified can have the first and last month's rent.

324
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:11,387
Paid through a grant that's administered by ABCD.

325
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:15,293
This is funded by Medford's Community Preservation Act program.

326
00:34:15,914 --> 00:34:22,785
And when we say that we're trying to recruit organizations to provide more services in Medford, we're reaching out to more.

327
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:36,370
organizations like ABCD to ask that they also use Medford's Community Preservation Act money or CDBG money to extend services to Medford residents.

328
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,931
So, you know, a Medford resident might not think to call ABCD.

329
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:44,032
They might reach out to Somerville to say, can you help me?

330
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:48,993
And Somerville will say no, because they're only supporting Somerville residents.

331
00:34:49,573 --> 00:34:59,380
But if some if the organizations locate based in Somerville Accessed our funding then they could say yes to Medford residents.

332
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,642
There's no reason why they have to be limited by the city boundaries.

333
00:35:03,322 --> 00:35:16,411
So That's one of the ways that we can expand but yeah, we it would we would like to be able to see more homeownership opportunities in Medford

334
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:26,064
Yeah, we talked to Kit Collins a while ago, one of our city councilors, who is, I think, a big advocate of, like, supporting renters as a renter herself.

335
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:35,128
And she brought up some really interesting points about how maybe those folks are, like, don't rank as high in priority because they may not be here, you know, they may not be here forever.

336
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:37,889
They may be sort of a transient kind of population to the city.

337
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:40,270
So, it's really, I think it's really interesting.

338
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:43,211
It sounds like really important work that you all are doing, and thank you for doing it.

339
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:47,333
I wonder if there's any other comments before we wrap up for today.

340
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:58,914
Yeah, no, I did want to kind of piggyback on what Roberta said a little bit, just kind of hearing you describe the scale of the problem, like how bad the price problem has gotten.

341
00:35:58,975 --> 00:36:04,896
It's not just in Medford, you know, anybody who's lived anywhere in Massachusetts can tell you it's really bad.

342
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:12,278
And I guess it's really easy to get discouraged because of that, because of just the scale of the housing problem.

343
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:22,141
But something that I've learned and that I've tried to remember is that we didn't get into this mess overnight We're not gonna get out of it, you know tomorrow.

344
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:33,524
There's there's also there's no magic policy There's no like I can't snap my fingers and tomorrow one bedrooms are gonna be $500 a month and single-family homes are gonna be $200,000 like that's not gonna happen.

345
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:38,926
There's nothing we can do quickly overnight to do that so once you let go of like a

346
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:46,827
the idea of some sort of perfect policy or some sort of quick fix, you really realize that, like, there's no such thing as perfect in housing advocacy.

347
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:48,027
There's no perfect policy.

348
00:36:48,347 --> 00:36:57,552
There's just a lot of little things that we can do, a lot of things that we can change bit by bit, one by one, community by community, state by state, that make it a little bit better.

349
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:03,175
And every little thing we do, you know, I sometimes think about that adage about planting trees.

350
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:07,777
Like, the best time to have planted a tree was 20 years ago, and the second best time is now.

351
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:11,578
So the best time for us to have fixed our housing problem was decades ago.

352
00:37:12,238 --> 00:37:13,818
Failing that, we can start doing it now.

353
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:18,340
And every little thing we do, every affordable housing unit we get is a win.

354
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:26,622
Every family that doesn't have to move out because of a rent increase or whatever, every family that can access their tenant rights is a win.

355
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:33,945
That's one thing I would say that really keeps me going in an advocacy area that is really hard.

356
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:35,746
It's really complicated.

357
00:37:36,186 --> 00:37:36,866
It's really technical.

358
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:44,169
There probably were words that we said in this podcast that listeners have no idea what they mean, or acronyms that are like, wait, what's that?

359
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,311
And frankly, if you jump into one of

360
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:52,316
housing Medford's meetings and it's just some of our regulars there, you might be like, what are they talking about?

361
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,419
And I have to own that.

362
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:55,079
Absolutely.

363
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:56,140
It's really confusing.

364
00:37:57,782 --> 00:37:59,744
But there is a place for everyone.

365
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:04,990
Housing is on the policy level really complicated, but it's also extremely simple and extremely personal.

366
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,472
Everybody has an experience with housing.

367
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:08,134
And so there's a place for

368
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,215
Anybody to get involved.

369
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,937
Maybe you want to learn some terms.

370
00:38:13,277 --> 00:38:18,720
Maybe you don't, but there's something you can do to advocate for making housing more affordable here in Medford or wherever you live.

371
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,822
But, you know, we're here in your tree.

372
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:23,603
That's right.

373
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:24,744
Thank you so much.

374
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:25,805
This has been amazing.

375
00:38:25,865 --> 00:38:26,465
This is awesome.

376
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:27,406
Thank you very much.

377
00:38:28,927 --> 00:38:30,728
And hopefully we'll hear more from you in the future.

378
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:33,169
Yeah, absolutely.

379
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,650
Thank you so much.

380
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:35,471
