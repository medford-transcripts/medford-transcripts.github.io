1
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:31,849
City Council fourth regular meeting February 25 2025 is called order Mr. please call the roll.

2
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,810
Vice President Collins.

3
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,371
That's a little sorrow.

4
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:39,111
That's a lemming browser.

5
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:44,393
That's a scrupley counter saying, President, President, please rise to the flag.

6
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:09,317
Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports and records 25033 offered by President Behrs, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we send our deepest condolences to the family, friends and loved ones of Ruth Youngblood.

7
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:16,581
She was a fixture in the West Medford neighborhood and West Medford Community Center, and her vibrant presence will be missed by so many people in our Medford community.

8
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:21,243
I put this resolution forward, I first met Ruth

9
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:29,008
early on in my first campaign for running for city council.

10
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,371
And we had a lot of great conversations.

11
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:40,218
And I also was able to buy a lot of wonderful cards from her over the years and I still have a few left that are going to

12
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:49,518
have a little bit of extra memory as I send them out that I'm going to probably hold them a little closer and think of a special occasion to send them out before I do.

13
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:55,663
So, with that I will go to Councilor Sang, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Collins, Councilor Sang.

14
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:56,504
Thank you.

15
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:00,247
The cards are something that I will cherish a lot.

16
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:10,655
Especially now going forward, there was a good few years where the only cards I really bought were Roots cards.

17
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:16,214
because they meant something more than a store-bought card.

18
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:38,609
I would see Ruth at West Bedford Community Center events, at artist fairs, and she was such a reliable, dependable presence at those places, and a really reliable, smiley face who I could talk to about issues that maybe I didn't understand because

19
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:40,613
of my life experience.

20
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:45,737
We grew up in very different places.

21
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:58,225
We talk about how West Medford has changed, how the community has changed, what makes the West Medford Community Center community stick together so close, what's ticking there.

22
00:11:58,246 --> 00:12:00,887
And I've just learned so much from Ruth.

23
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:07,812
And every time I would look at the cards as they sent them out,

24
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:17,371
And, you know, I would get reminded, you know, of the fact that I'm supporting a friend and supporting a local business, a local artist here in Medford too.

25
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:23,958
And that's why for me, over those years, those were the cards I bought and those were the cards I really cherish.

26
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:31,145
is such a core presence in the West Medford community.

27
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:44,252
And when she passed, so many people talked to me about the experiences, the really happy experiences that they had with her.

28
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:54,757
And I'm very grateful for you, President Behrs, for putting this on the agenda and for giving us a chance to talk about our happy memories of her.

29
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,507
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

30
00:12:58,847 --> 00:12:59,768
Thank you Councilor Baez.

31
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,290
Again, great words from Councilor Sang.

32
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:10,673
I think that Ruthie was what Medford was all about.

33
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:13,554
Her heart is open to everybody.

34
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:15,343
She was so sweet.

35
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:21,808
And when it came to election time, if you ever drove by Ruthie's home, she had everyone sign.

36
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:23,629
I don't think she could ever say no to anyone.

37
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:30,494
And her allegiance was to anybody that ran for office here in Medford.

38
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:31,415
So I think that

39
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:38,860
You know, she told you like it was, there were times that she's pulled me aside and then brought me over to her Cod table at some fairs.

40
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,883
And we negotiated some issues in the community, but she's definitely someone this community will miss.

41
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:54,165
Her family is a very strong family in Medford that have faith and love of the city.

42
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,646
So we send out our deepest condolences.

43
00:13:58,086 --> 00:13:59,187
She will definitely be missed.

44
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,407
Thank you, Mr. President.

45
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:02,125
Thank you.

46
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:02,845
Councilor Collins.

47
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:06,127
Thank you for putting this forward.

48
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:10,028
I want to send deepest sympathies to Ruth's family.

49
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:14,630
I feel very lucky to have gotten to meet her several times over the years.

50
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:15,850
Absolutely.

51
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:21,092
Always a constant fixture at West Bedford Open Studios and other art events around the city.

52
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:34,240
always nice as you know, somebody who always goes to that events always able to count on seeing Ruth and saying hello and checking with her and seeing a smile and saying what she had made recently.

53
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,023
I know she meant a lot to the artist community in Medford.

54
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:39,844
I know she just meant a lot to everybody who knew her.

55
00:14:39,924 --> 00:14:40,965
She was a really sweet person.

56
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:42,546
I feel very lucky to have gotten to meet her.

57
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:46,049
And again, you know, our deepest consolances to the family.

58
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,191

81
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:03,252
I'll read them both and then I will go to Councilor Scarpelli.

82
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:12,335
25034 offered by President Behrs, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we send our deepest condolences to the family, friends, and loved ones of Robert Emmett Skerry Jr.

83
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:18,878
He'll be remembered for his long service as a member of the Medford School Committee and his dedication to the students of the Medford Public Schools.

84
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:36,012
And we have 25035, whereas the Medford City Council mourns the passing of Robert Emmett Bob Skerry Jr., a lifelong resident of Medford, Massachusetts, who passed away peacefully on February 13th, 2025, at the age of 74, following a courageous two-year battle with cancer.

85
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:46,862
And whereas Bob Skerry was a proud graduate of Medford High School, class of 1968, and furthered his education at UMass Boston, formerly Boston State College, earning a degree in political science and English,

86
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:56,989
He continued his academic pursuits at Harvard University Graduate School of Education, obtaining a certificate in School and Community Relationships, reflecting his lifelong commitment to learning and public service.

87
00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:05,915
And whereas Bob served honorably as a member of the 101st Engineers Battalion and the Massachusetts National Guard, demonstrating his dedication to both the Commonwealth and the nation.

88
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:16,403
And whereas Bob dedicated his career to education and public service, working as a teacher in Everett and Medford public school systems, where he taught civics, social studies, and English, and coached varsity soccer.

89
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:38,628
He furthered his impact on the community through over four decades of service in the city government, particularly as a dedicated member of the Medford School Committee and an active participant in the Medford Chamber of Commerce, and whereas in his professional career Bob served as a senior investigator with the Bureau of Special Investigations for the Office of the State Auditor for over 35 years, upholding the values of accountability and integrity in public service.

90
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:58,022
And whereas Bob was a devoted friend, neighbor, and mentor who touched the lives of many through his generosity, wisdom, and kindness, he was deeply committed to his beloved friend and partner, Maria C. DeMarco, and shared a special bond with her daughter, Margaret Meg DeMarco, her wife Claire, and their children Avery, Emerson, and Sloan, whom he cared for as if they were his own grandchildren.

91
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:17,237
He's also beloved brother, uncle and cousin cherishing his relationships with his family, and whereas Bob scary was a passionate supporter of his community, often lending a helping hand to neighbors advocating for local causes and celebrating Menford spirit he was an ardent fan of the Boston Red Sox BC Eagles and Notre Dame fighting Irish

92
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:43,732
His love for Medford, his faith, and his country remain steadfast throughout his life, and whereas Bob's legacy of service and kindness and unwavering dedication to the City of Medford will be felt for generations to come, and he'll be deeply missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford City Council hereby honors the life and legacy of Robert Emmett Bob Skerry Jr., and expresses its deepest condolences to his family and loved ones, and recognizes his extraordinary contributions to the City of Medford,

93
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:49,689
And be it for the resolve of the Medford City Council dedicates this meeting in his honor, Councilor Scarpelli.

94
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:59,136
I'm sorry for the long solution but I think that that's minimal what Bob scary deserves.

95
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:02,528
Bob was very special.

96
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:12,692
I think that he was a true passionate lover of the city of Medford and its people.

97
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:17,594
Whenever anybody needed anything, Bob Skerry was there.

98
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:30,638
Whether it was his time on the school committee or if somebody was having an issue as a senior citizen and they were having an issue at the state house, Bob would find a way to make it his mission to support

99
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:33,972
uh, anyone that crosses path.

100
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:38,473
Um, I was very fortunate that I served in the school committee with Bob scary.

101
00:19:38,513 --> 00:19:51,476
And I still remember my first day and, um, being elected and Bob came to the house and, um, with the cigar in his hand and pulled me aside and said, all right, son, this is how it goes.

102
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:58,377
And this is what you'll do and make sure that you have respect for this position because it deserves that respect.

103
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:07,118
everything from the clothes that I was supposed to wear to the way I address constituents and the way that we respected our office.

104
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:14,303
Bob was truly a man that always gave back to Medford.

105
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:20,808
And when we heard, when Bob came up and whispered in my ear and said, it's got me, buddy.

106
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:25,552
And he talked about the cancer and

107
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:37,345
He fought and I know that he had a tough last couple of weeks, but he's in a better place today and Bob's family will miss him.

108
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:39,026
The city of Method will miss him and I'll miss him.

109
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:42,867
So may he rest in peace and condolences to his family.

110
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:44,508
Thank you, Mr. President.

111
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:45,929
Thank you.

112
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:47,629
Go to Councilor Sang.

113
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,391
I really can't speak to Bob even, you know,

114
00:20:53,704 --> 00:21:03,141
Yeah, I can't, I really can't speak to Bob in such a, you know, great way that Councilor Scarpelli did in his resolution because I think

115
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:12,491
There's such a life that was lived and such a dedication to his community that we really ought to respect.

116
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:22,995
I can, however, speak to my short experience with Bob on the school committee, and I think that's a testament to how long he served our city.

117
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,783
I never intersected with Georgia on the school committee, but I did intersect with Bob.

118
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:33,366
And as a student rep for the school committee, he was always really

119
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:47,236
a great guide in showing me the ropes, showing me the ropes of how things worked on the school committee and what questions we should be asking of our leaders in the city.

120
00:21:48,396 --> 00:21:53,400
And through that work, I really got to see how dedicated he was to our city as well.

121
00:21:53,901 --> 00:22:01,807
So I wanted to send my condolences to his family as well, and to remember Bob for the great work that he did in Medford.

122
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:04,876
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

123
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:08,577
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, I'll go to Vice President Collins.

124
00:22:09,638 --> 00:22:13,779
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Sang, we'll go to public participation.

125
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,260
Name and address for the record, please.

126
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,940
You have three minutes.

127
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:19,381
Good evening.

128
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:24,122
Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, East Method Mass.

129
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:33,425
I first met Bob Scarri at the brand spanking new

130
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:39,577
grand opening at the Medford Public Library in 1960.

131
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:44,619
He's a man of great character.

132
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:52,182
We love the United States of America, and we love our city, Medford, Massachusetts.

133
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:59,704
And I want to say God bless all, including the other 1968 graduates of Medford High School.

134
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:04,046
Please hear my prayer.

135
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:22,846
Almighty God, creator of heaven, earth, all sentient beings, and more, please get me and all of us to be and do the best that we can, now, always, forever, and ever, in our quest for eternal, blissful peace.

136
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:23,526
Thank you.

137
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:25,554
Thank you.

138
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:32,619
Before we take the vote, if we could, well, let's take the vote and then we'll take a moment of silence for everybody.

139
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,362
So if we could call the roll on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Sang.

140
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:44,407
Councilor Kellyanne, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lozaro, Councilor Lemming.

141
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:45,468
Yes.

00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,210
Yes.

00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:49,971
President Behrs.

147
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:50,451
Yes.

148
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,753
Seventy affirmative, negative, the motion passes.

149
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:54,474
If everyone could please rise for a moment of silence.

150

Records the records of the meeting of February 11, 2025 or past Council is our Council is our Oh, how did you find those records.

151
00:24:25,126 --> 00:24:31,511
I found them in order and emotion to approve the motion of counselors are to approve the record seconded by Councilor Callahan was called the role.

152
00:24:37,095 --> 00:24:37,696
Councilor Callahan.

153
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:42,519
Vice President Collins Council is our Council let me.

154
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,100
Yes.

155
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:46,980
Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

156
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,364
Yes, I have an affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

157
00:24:49,385 --> 00:24:55,155
Reports of committees 24033, Vice President Collins, Planning and Permitting Committee, February 12, 2025.

158
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:55,716
Vice President Collins.

159
00:24:57,812 --> 00:24:58,592
Thank you, President Behrs.

160
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:06,797
This was our third meeting with the zoning consultant on the topic of the neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal specifically.

161
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:09,719
The fourth one is tomorrow at 6pm.

162
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,221
We hope that residents will continue to join in this process.

163
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:14,021
Motion for approval.

164
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:20,385
On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

165
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:21,466
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

166
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:23,667
Councilor Callahan.

167
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:27,817
Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Lemming.

168
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:28,477
Yes.

169
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:32,481
Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

170
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,103
Yes, I have an affirmative and a negative.

171
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:39,488
The motion passes 24468 offered by Councilor Sang, Governance Committee, February 19th, 2025.

172
00:25:39,548 --> 00:25:40,870
Report to follow, Councilor Sang.

173
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:41,881
Thank you.

174
00:25:42,341 --> 00:26:02,469
In this governance committee meeting, we met to discuss in detail the rest of the Charter Study Committee's recommendations as sent to us by the mayor's office that mostly included school committee stuff and some elections, citizen participation mechanisms as well.

175
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:10,312
We voted out amended draft of the Charter Study Committee's recommendations to the committee the whole meeting.

176
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:14,444
and that committee of the whole is next Tuesday at 6pm.

177
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:22,068
On the motion of Councilor Seng to approve seconded by seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

178
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:23,089
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

179
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:32,175
Councilor Kellyanne, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Lemming.

180
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:32,695
Yes.

181
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:37,978
Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Seng, President Behrs.

182
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:38,879
Yes, I have the affirmative.

183
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:40,220
None of the negative motion passes.

184
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:46,202
This should be in petitions presentations similar papers, my apologies I didn't catch that.

185
00:26:46,663 --> 00:26:54,611
But this is 25032 proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance 10 and 20 Revere Beach Parkway for referral to the Community Development Board.

186
00:26:55,151 --> 00:27:03,560
This is from the petitioner at 10 and 20 Revere Beach Parkway, we have Valerie Moore.

187
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:06,347
from Dr. MacLennan and Fish on behalf of the petitioner.

188
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:20,103
I'm just going to summarize it and say that they are representing Transom Real Estate, the applicant looking to have an amendment to the text of the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District, WSMOD.

189
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,971
and they have proposed a redline amendment.

190
00:27:23,932 --> 00:27:32,758
This is the property consists of two parcels which are currently owned by Houlihan Properties and 10 Revere Beach Parkway LLC petitioners, both of which consent to the petition.

191
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,521
Essentially the three clarifications that are being requested

192
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:42,123
First, the table of dimensional standards establishes a maximum front yard setback of 15 feet.

193
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:53,927
The petitioners property as well as others on the fells winter rear beach parkway is subject to a perpetual deed restriction held by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation that requires a minimum setback of 20 feet.

194
00:27:54,848 --> 00:28:00,570
So they're requesting that that be clarified a footnote that if there's a property subject to a public agency.

195
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:04,757
restriction that the maximum setbacks would coincide with that restriction.

196
00:28:05,657 --> 00:28:07,978
Second, there's a development incentive bonuses.

197
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:14,320
It currently reads a certified LEED Gold or LEED Platinum.

198
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:22,323
The petitioners are proposing a modification from certified to certifiable because the LEED certification can't happen until the building is constructed.

199
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:31,852
And the third is definitions section clarifying the definition of building coverage to make clear it does not include building overhangs.

200
00:28:31,932 --> 00:28:35,254
They're arguing that the current definition is ambiguous on this point.

201
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:40,956
Right now, the only thing before us is to refer this to community development board as it's a zoning amendment.

202
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:52,102
I will say I've spoken to the planning department staff on the first two of these items and those are changes that we were planning to make as part of the zoning updates project anyway.

203
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:58,688
So I can't speak to the third change, although it seems to me on its face reasonable.

204
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:09,358
So tonight we would refer this to Community Development Board, and then they would refer it back to us with any recommendations and conditions.

205
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:11,940
And with that, I'll recognize Vice President Collins.

206
00:29:13,702 --> 00:29:15,264
Thank you, President Behrs, for the overview.

207
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:17,786
I would motion to refer to the Community Development Board.

208
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:27,154
Great, and I do wanna offer, we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli, and then I do wanna offer the petitioner a chance to take a look before we move forward.

209
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:27,894
Councilor Scarpelli.

210
00:29:27,914 --> 00:29:28,375
Okay, thank you.

211
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:33,098
I know that this is something that first I've seen of it, so 10 to 20 Red Beach Parkway.

212
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:35,939
What are the abutters?

213
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:37,300
Have the abutters been notified?

214
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,882
Are there abutters next, residents next to this?

215
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:49,488
Because I think that before we move this forward, were the neighbors informed and how do they feel about the situation?

216
00:29:50,005 --> 00:30:01,069
Yeah, so procedurally, what would happen is we receive it, we refer it to Community Development Board, which we're obligated to do, and then they'll schedule the public hearings of the CD board and work with the clerk to schedule a public hearing for us.

217
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,851
Butters will be notified of the public hearings, and then the public hearings will go forward.

218
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,432
Thank you for the clarification, Mr. President.

219
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:09,293
You got it.

220
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:12,754
Do we have a representative of the petitioner?

221
00:30:12,774 --> 00:30:13,534
Great.

222
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:17,736
Just want to give you guys a chance to speak to the petition.

223
00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:23,214
Hi, my name is Brian Lee with Transom Real Estate.

224
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:23,974
I'm a partner there.

225
00:30:24,714 --> 00:30:25,715
Thank you for the time tonight.

226
00:30:25,735 --> 00:30:26,975
I won't take up too much of your time.

227
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:27,576
I know it's late.

228
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:30,157
I just wanted to take a moment to introduce ourselves.

229
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:33,399
We're a local developer, a very small firm.

230
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:36,120
We are six people located in the south end of Boston.

231
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:42,263
We focus on really important sites in what we consider to be really great cities.

232
00:30:42,903 --> 00:30:43,764
And this is one of those.

233
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:52,990
As you mentioned, we're focusing on 10 and 20 Revere Beach Parkway, which, as you all know, is really the Cappies and Monroe Auto site.

234
00:30:53,690 --> 00:31:02,075
There will certainly be a lot of discussions around our plans, but we're really here tonight in a very preliminary fashion to just discuss the zoning.

235
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:10,721
One thing about Transom, despite being very local, we care a lot about design and we care a lot about the neighborhoods in which we build.

236
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:20,790
And so I think if you look at some of the history of our buildings in the past, we're really proud of how we contribute to the neighborhood and how we really involve the neighborhoods feedback into the design process.

237
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:23,612
As I said, I won't take up too much of your time.

238
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:24,993
I just wanted to introduce transom.

239
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:30,737
Our permitting attorney, Valerie Moore is here and she's much more capable to discuss the zoning issues than I am.

240
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:31,678
Thank you very much.

241
00:31:31,698 --> 00:31:33,019
And thank you.

242
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:38,083
If you'd like to counselor, if you'd like to share anything you're on.

243
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:41,213
Yes, you are.

244
00:31:41,473 --> 00:31:42,834
The red is good in this case.

245
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,296
Thank you, President Behrs.

246
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:55,283
You summarized the three specific changes that we're looking for better than I could, so I'll speak to process and then answer any questions that you might have.

247
00:31:55,863 --> 00:32:03,068
So these are just minor changes proposed to the Wellington Station Multi-Family Overlay District.

248
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,369
You're not approving a project as part of this.

249
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:13,152
Once those changes are approved, then we would be able to actually submit for our site plan review.

250
00:32:13,212 --> 00:32:18,314
That's when the public hearings on the project itself would be before the Community Development Board.

251
00:32:18,734 --> 00:32:26,938
So this is really a very preliminary step that would enable really full public review of the actual project that we intend to propose.

252
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:27,678
Great.

253
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,264
That was going to be my question or clarification, just to elucidate the process.

254
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:44,660
Even if this zoning amendment moves through all the phases and is adopted, then you would have your project proposal, which would go through site plan review for the specific project with all the studies and the comment and the process at that point.

255
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:45,922
That's great.

256
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:51,681
Can you tell that we've been doing a zoning update for the past 18 months?

257
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,722
And honestly, it feels like for me for the past like five years.

258
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:57,044
You're pretty savvy on it, I'm impressed.

259
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,945
I was like, oh, this again.

260
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:04,087
But no, thank you for bringing this to us.

261
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:09,289
I know we'll have another chance to talk to you during the public hearing if the Community Development Board sends this back to us.

262
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:10,250
So thanks for being here.

263
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,110
Thank you so much.

264
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:17,362
On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Council Lazzaro to refer this to the Community Development Board.

265
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:18,982
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

266
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:24,164
Councilor Callahan.

267
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:27,445
Vice President Collins.

268
00:33:28,185 --> 00:33:29,066
Councilor Lazzaro.

269
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:30,606
Councilor Lemming.

270
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:31,286
Yes.

271
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:32,727
Councilor Scarpelli.

272
00:33:34,383 --> 00:33:36,284
Councilor Singh, President Behrs.

273
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:38,745
Yes, I have the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion passes.

274
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:39,165
Thank you.

275
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:44,567
All right, our next petition, petition for a CV license, common victims license, Kelly's roast beef.

276
00:33:45,668 --> 00:33:46,568
They were here last time.

277
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:48,429
Do we have a representative this time?

278
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:49,089
Yes, we do.

279
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:49,550
All right.

280
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,592
So I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli to talk about this petition.

281
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,712
Thank you, Mr. President.

282
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:01,254
I do see everything is in order.

283
00:34:01,435 --> 00:34:03,637
I think that there was one clarification.

284
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:10,865
I think the clerk, just publicly, I know that the hours of operations, is that something we're changing now, Mr. Clerk?

285
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:14,956
Or does the petition have to come back for those extended hours?

286
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,077
To amend the hours of operation, they would have to come back.

287
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,198
But it's not going to be through the special permit process.

288
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:20,579
OK, so they do have to come back.

289
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,420
So your hours are till 11 o'clock right now.

290
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:34,844
OK, and then I know usually Kelly's was a great location for a little time after for people that work late, or Justin, who is at Harvard until 2 in the morning.

291
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:41,006
Or when that Councilor Scarpella has a few items on the agenda.

292
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:44,287
My wife won't allow me to go there anymore.

293
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:44,747
We can go.

294
00:34:44,787 --> 00:34:49,388
I was one of the last people with the punch card, the three-way punch card.

295
00:34:49,428 --> 00:34:51,368
You guys don't know that.

296
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:51,828
I know.

297
00:34:51,948 --> 00:34:53,729
I see everything is in order, Mr. President.

298
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:58,810
I know that already the feedback I've heard from people that super professional and

299
00:35:00,655 --> 00:35:04,536
that they're excited about this new venture with our new organization.

300
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:09,638
And after my fellow colleagues have any comments, I would move approval.

301
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:16,099
Any other comments for anyone else?

302
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:19,920
I guess, are you guys representing the new venture that has purchased Kelly's?

303
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,360
Yes.

304
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,941
Okay, great.

305
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:26,462
Could you just go into like, are you guys still pretty local or?

306
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:27,247
Yes.

307
00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:34,231
So David Massey, the owner, um, of AM 15 management, he lives in Ipswich, Massachusetts recently, most, or most recently of Georgetown.

308
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:35,572
So he has a local guy.

309
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,853
Um, we're a real estate investment company.

310
00:35:37,893 --> 00:35:43,397
We have 11 hotels on the North shore or the Northeast, um, Turner Hill golf club up in Ipswich.

311
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:46,238
And now we've gotten into the Kelly's segment.

312
00:35:46,298 --> 00:35:47,739
We have the four light.

313
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:52,042
We call them the four legacy, the Medford Danvers, August and Revere.

314
00:35:52,482 --> 00:36:04,371
as well as we built Salem, New Hampshire, Detta, Massachusetts, and Worcester, Massachusetts, with the plans to continue to build, I think, what, five or 10 in the next five years down in Florida we're looking to go.

315
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:12,096
So we are a local company and looking to add a little bit more dimension to the Kellys that everybody knows and loves.

316
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:16,179
And so you guys have already built and operated some, and now you've purchased the originals.

317
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:16,799
Correct.

318
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:17,120
Great.

319
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,323
And do you think there might be a potential for an extended hours at some point?

320
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:22,685
I'm not sure.

321
00:36:22,705 --> 00:36:23,406
I don't think so.

322
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:24,106
I don't believe so.

323
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:25,687
I think it's a late-day thing.

324
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:26,647
It's a thing of the past.

325
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,688
That might have been a mistake on my part when putting the application together.

326
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:32,569
You can feel free to send back that some of us would like that.

327
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:33,510
OK.

328
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,552
If there's a request for it, we'll definitely do it.

329
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:40,993
It didn't come from George.

330
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:42,974
Oh, yeah.

331
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:44,394
Can we have your names just for the record?

332
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:44,674
Sure.

333
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:45,775
My name is Lisa Whiteman.

334
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:48,356
I'm from Peabody, Massachusetts, and I'm Magnolia Way.

335
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:49,696
Great.

336
00:36:49,716 --> 00:36:51,157
And you can use the business address if you want.

337
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:59,790
It's out of Burlington, Massachusetts.

338
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:00,751
Great.

339
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:02,292
All right.

340
00:37:02,492 --> 00:37:03,072
Well, thank you.

341
00:37:03,493 --> 00:37:07,856
We see everything in order and the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Sang.

342
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:08,856
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

343
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:12,899
Councilor Callahan.

344
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,340
Vice President Collins.

345
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:15,922
Councilor Lozaro.

346
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:17,042
Councilor Lemming.

347
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:17,643
Yes.

348
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:22,029
Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

349
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:22,649
Yes.

350
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,211
So the affirmative, the negative, the motion passes.

351
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:25,591
Thank you.

352
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:26,552
Thank you very much, everybody.

353
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:29,633
Did we have King Boba last time?

354
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:31,555
Okay.

355
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:33,476
I, again, I apologize for that.

356
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,859
So we'll just move beyond that.

357
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:41,000
They've already been approved.

358
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:44,222
For some reason, I got it in my head that we didn't have anyone here.

359
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,198
All right, communications from the mayor.

360
00:37:47,218 --> 00:37:50,498
25028, loan order, MWRA water bonds.

361
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:56,920
Dear President Behrs and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following loan order.

362
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:10,844
City of Medford, loan order, MWRA water bonds, that $8 million is appropriated for the purpose of replacing lead service lines and galvanized requiring replacement and addressing service lines of unknown materials in various locations throughout the city.

363
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:33,582
Eligible for financial assistance to the MWRA's lead replacement program including payment of any and all costs incidental and related thereto that to meet this appropriation, the treasurer with the approval of the mayor is authorized to borrow the set amount under and pursuant to chapter 44 section 7 and 8 of the general laws or pursuant to any other enabling authority and to issue bonds or notes of the city therefore that the treasurer with the approval of the mayor

364
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:54,648
is authorized to borrow a portion, all or a portion of such amount from the MWRA pursuant to the MWRA's local water system assistance program and in connection therewith enter into a loan agreement and or financial assistance agreement with the MWRA and otherwise to contract with the MWRA with respect to such loan and for any grants or aid available for the project or the financing thereof.

365
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:06,117
and that the mayor is authorized to accept and expend any grants or aid available for the project or for the financing thereof and provided that the amount of the authorized borrowing for the project shall be reduced by the amount of any such grants or aid received.

366
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,399
I was really seeking a period there and it never came.

367
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:13,142
So I'll just read the rest and further ordered that the treasurer

368
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:30,864
is authorized to file an application with the appropriate officials under the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to qualify under Chapter 44A of the General Law as any and all bonds of the city authorized to be borrowed pursuant to this loan order and provide such information and execute such documents as such officials of the Commonwealth may require in connection therewith.

369
00:39:31,284 --> 00:39:32,925
Respectfully submitted, Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

370
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:37,546
And we have here as well the loan order opinion, KP Law.

371
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:40,327
In our opinion, the loan order

372
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,148
It is in proper legal form.

373
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:45,548
And I'm not going to read that whole letter.

374
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:48,830
I'll go to you guys, Commissioner McGibbon, Engineer Wartoff.

375
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,170
Thank you very much.

376
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:52,211
Thank you for hearing us tonight.

377
00:39:53,332 --> 00:39:57,213
The information that you just provided does it, right?

378
00:39:57,874 --> 00:39:59,494
Yeah, I totally understood.

379
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:00,215
I read.

380
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:01,816
I understood what I was reading.

381
00:40:03,573 --> 00:40:09,954
All right, so as we've talked about before, we have a lot of work to do on our water system.

382
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:14,435
A significant portion of that work is the lead service line removal.

383
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:23,997
So what we're going to do here is I'm going to give a sort of a broad overview of the program and what we're going to do with this loan.

384
00:40:24,657 --> 00:40:32,879
And then Owen can dive into some nitty gritty information that we've been working with directly to try to get this program up and running.

385
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:40,510
So this program is from the MWRA, it's a loan program that provides a 25% relief.

386
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:52,934
So, like a grant so 25% of that would be a grant, if we use the money in a certain way that certain way is removing both sides of a lead line and not just the public side.

387
00:40:54,795 --> 00:40:59,737
We're basically going to be funding the full removal from the house all the way to the street.

388
00:41:00,898 --> 00:41:11,722
That's important because one of the things that the, the folks in the DEP and the EPA have discovered is that when you do half of a line, like has been pretty typical for many years now.

389
00:41:12,182 --> 00:41:16,043
It actually increases the risk of lead poisoning in the house.

390
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:18,604
So it's frowned upon now.

391
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:19,844
So we're trying not to do that anymore.

392
00:41:19,884 --> 00:41:22,825
We're transitioning to the recommended best practice.

393
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:27,427
This is also what the EPA wants to happen within a certain amount of time.

394
00:41:27,627 --> 00:41:28,367
I'll get to that in a second.

395
00:41:29,147 --> 00:41:34,249
So with this loan, we would basically be providing a significant upgrade to our entire water system.

396
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:38,890
The lead service lines or the service lines in general are a huge component of our system.

397
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:42,836
You can just think every single building has a service line.

398
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:44,944
So we have about 19,000 of them or so.

399
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:48,766
The program would be a three-year program.

400
00:41:49,147 --> 00:41:51,227
It would include soft costs and hard costs.

401
00:41:51,507 --> 00:42:10,391
What I mean by that, it includes hiring an engineer to put together a bid package for a testing and a removal and replacement program, as well as a statistical analysis to get rid or shed our numbers down with what we have.

402
00:42:10,432 --> 00:42:11,672
Right now, we have a lot of unknowns.

403
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:16,673
So if we do a statistical analysis, we should be able to reduce that number of unknowns.

404
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,454
That's important.

405
00:42:18,855 --> 00:42:24,058
How many unknowns we have and how many lead lines we have dictates how fast we need to remove them.

406
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:28,602
And also, that's the biggest thing, how fast we need to remove them.

407
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:34,887
But it also dictates how many folks we need to notice every single year.

408
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:38,790
If you're lucky enough to get a notice this year, you'll know what I'm talking about.

409
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:39,510
A lot of people did.

410
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:41,472
All right.

411
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:51,388
So just to take one big step back, this all is a result of the lead and copper rule that the EPA has been instituting over a number of years.

412
00:42:51,888 --> 00:42:54,509
This is a revision to the lead and copper rule.

413
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:08,457
And that revision includes the mandate to remove the lead lines fully, as well as to send a notice to everybody that may have one, either unknown or definitely lead.

414
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:11,834
So that's something that we have to do now.

415
00:43:12,334 --> 00:43:15,176
The deadlines for this are pretty rigorous.

416
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:23,160
We have a deadline that is 2032 to see if we can get everything, all the lead out of our system.

417
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:29,003
So that's our target is 2032 to have a lead-free service line city.

418
00:43:31,104 --> 00:43:33,885
Now, the $8 million is probably not enough to get us there.

419
00:43:34,105 --> 00:43:37,167
So during year three of this three-year push,

420
00:43:38,812 --> 00:43:44,082
evaluating what we have left, and then figuring out how to fund what we have left.

421
00:43:45,305 --> 00:43:47,887
We have tried different ways to fund this.

422
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:58,695
And this was kind of option C. Option A was a EPA grant for somewhere around $20 million that we did not get.

423
00:44:00,156 --> 00:44:04,319
And we'll see how federal grant opportunities come about in the future.

424
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,702
But we do have state revolving fund and we have MWRA.

425
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:09,303
So we're in good shape for the moment.

426
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:11,445
So with that,

427
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:17,731
I'll let Owen talk and go over a few things, and then we'll be available for questions.

428
00:44:20,714 --> 00:44:28,100
Just high level here is that we have about 14,500 service lines.

429
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:38,110
About a third of them are classified as lead, about another third is classified as copper, and the other third is unknown.

430
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:48,605
We have been working diligently over the winter to get this kind of working up and doing some investigative in the heights.

431
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:51,991
And what we've found is that of the

432
00:44:53,663 --> 00:44:57,167
Non-lead, 100% of those are non-lead.

433
00:44:57,787 --> 00:45:03,513
Of the unknowns, about 90% are non-lead, 10% are lead.

434
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:10,420
And of the lead, or that we have records of that are shade or lead, about 30% to 40% are lead, and the rest are copper.

435
00:45:14,163 --> 00:45:16,704
So we think these numbers will come down drastically.

436
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:27,729
We don't anticipate having 5,000 plus lead lines to come out, but there is a lot of investigative that we need to do and it's going to take time to do it.

437
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,450
But I'm here to answer any questions if you have it.

438
00:45:32,811 --> 00:45:33,191
Happy to.

439
00:45:34,572 --> 00:45:34,932
Thank you.

440
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:36,933
Just a quick question clarification.

441
00:45:38,553 --> 00:45:40,274
So we have what's on record and you're saying

442
00:45:40,942 --> 00:45:47,487
based on some early estimates, it feels like that, or some stuff that you've already looked at, the records are just not accurate.

443
00:45:47,707 --> 00:45:53,272
So there was a fire in the early 2000s in the water department, and we lost a lot of the records.

444
00:45:53,532 --> 00:45:56,594
So anything that is unknown, we have to classify as lead.

445
00:45:57,495 --> 00:46:00,357
We've been working over the winter to bring that number down.

446
00:46:00,397 --> 00:46:01,118
We've gone through about

447
00:46:02,407 --> 00:46:12,095
500 of new records visualizations going to looking at meters and going through our records and being able to eliminate a lot of those just with that.

448
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:14,838
But we have a meter program happening right now.

449
00:46:14,878 --> 00:46:17,380
So if you swap so that gives us information on the inside.

450
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,561
So that's new information.

451
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:22,805
Also new information is a test pit contract that we have out in the streets happening.

452
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:23,606
So about 620

453
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:28,230
test bits, and that is data that Owen is referring to.

454
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:36,837
So we're seeing these percentages come up, which is why we're going to try to remove many unknowns using statistical analysis.

455
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:42,823
Because what this data is showing us is that our numbers, say 5,000 leds and 4,000 and change unknowns,

456
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,606
okay, well, what is it really?

457
00:46:47,106 --> 00:46:55,692
So if we take a sampling of data throughout the whole city, we can use that sampling data to then do a statistical analysis to see what we really have.

458
00:46:56,072 --> 00:47:03,718
And DEP, it will, you can use those numbers to make our requirements less burdensome.

459
00:47:04,258 --> 00:47:08,581
And the NWRA really, really wants us to tackle this.

460
00:47:09,462 --> 00:47:13,205
They're really on board with us, you know, taking loans and

461
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:14,585
and making this happen.

462
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:22,888
And it's mostly because of all the communities put together, all the MWA communities put together, there are only 14,000 known lead lines.

463
00:47:23,368 --> 00:47:27,249
We have 5,000 of those just in this community.

464
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:31,990
So they are really, really eager to help us in any way they can.

465
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,751
So we're their top priority.

466
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:34,651
It's Boston and us.

467
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:35,712
It's Boston and us.

468
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:40,613
But Boston started a little couple years ago, so they've got a little bit of a head start, but we intend to catch up.

469
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:45,709
Just two more quick clarifications about one of my fellow colleagues.

470
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:47,970
Some of the slow money would pay for the analysis?

471
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:48,950
Yes.

472
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:49,490
OK.

473
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:52,871
And then the rest of it would go towards the removal and replacement.

474
00:47:53,251 --> 00:47:58,633
The bulk of it would go towards a contract for testing and removals.

475
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:03,794
And soft costs, maybe 10% of it is going to go towards engineering and the like.

476
00:48:04,254 --> 00:48:05,674
And the statistical analysis is in that 10%?

477
00:48:05,734 --> 00:48:06,294
Correct.

478
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:06,835
Great.

479
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:13,180
These loans will be repaid by the rate payers or the taxpayers?

480
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:13,860
Correct.

481
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:19,882
So about $6 million of this, if we use it the way that we just described, $6 million of it will have to be paid back over 10 years.

482
00:48:20,122 --> 00:48:21,903
It will be on the rate payers and 0%.

483
00:48:22,003 --> 00:48:23,404
Through the Enterprise Fund only?

484
00:48:23,704 --> 00:48:24,044
Correct.

485
00:48:24,144 --> 00:48:24,484
OK.

486
00:48:24,504 --> 00:48:26,165
So this is a bond for the Enterprise Fund.

487
00:48:26,505 --> 00:48:26,885
You got it.

488
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:27,165
Great.

489
00:48:27,185 --> 00:48:28,846
It will be paid debt service to the Enterprise Fund.

490
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:29,426
Awesome.

491
00:48:29,626 --> 00:48:31,047
I will go to yes.

492
00:48:33,207 --> 00:48:34,648
Is this about what I just said?

493
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:43,789
Okay, I'm gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli and then you, and then Councilor Callahan.

494
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:45,130
Councilor Scarpelli.

495
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,071
Thank you, Mr. President.

496
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:48,512
Thank you to the both of you.

497
00:48:48,532 --> 00:48:50,153
I know that this is a daunting task.

498
00:48:50,213 --> 00:48:55,457
That's one thing we talked about earlier, how we have so many department heads doing so much with so little.

499
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:57,158
So we really appreciate it.

500
00:48:57,218 --> 00:49:03,923
I know that, is this the same, Mr. Hotel, we talked about the federal program and we talked about the lead.

501
00:49:04,003 --> 00:49:07,826
Is this in the same vein with that funding or is it separate?

502
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:11,203
That was the funding that we were going for that we did not receive.

503
00:49:11,703 --> 00:49:13,304
Oh, we didn't get it, okay.

504
00:49:13,604 --> 00:49:25,229
So we didn't receive funding that, technically it's still under review, but of all the communities that went for that grant, zero got it.

505
00:49:25,689 --> 00:49:29,650
So the MWRA is still like, they're looking for other ways as well.

506
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,511
We appreciate that.

507
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:33,072
Fred Lasky's, I'm sure his line is,

508
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:54,792
hope that's that's copper so I know that again I think that the biggest thing again is when you talk about this I know we'll get phone calls from neighbors if they come and start doing this in the on the streets when it's time we'll have a plan in place with I know you've been super aggressive with the curb to curb or making sure that whatever we cut

509
00:49:55,423 --> 00:50:07,665
that the road is replaced at a reasonable, uh, you know, so with this, with this loan, we're going to focus on EJ communities first and try to target those areas.

510
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:08,145
Okay, good.

511
00:50:08,385 --> 00:50:09,585
And that's where we're going to start.

512
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:11,146
And then we're going to move out.

513
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:11,306
Okay.

514
00:50:11,326 --> 00:50:12,066
So there'll be a plan.

515
00:50:12,106 --> 00:50:14,466
So people understand when it comes out to their end.

516
00:50:14,546 --> 00:50:14,786
Okay.

517
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:17,247
So again, I thank you for all your hard work.

518
00:50:17,287 --> 00:50:23,288
This is something that we need and it's something, especially as you're hearing throughout the, you know, throughout the country, when you hear about lead, uh,

519
00:50:24,594 --> 00:50:26,675
you know, let in the water and people getting nervous.

520
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:28,656
I think that it's a step in the right direction.

521
00:50:28,676 --> 00:50:30,716
So we appreciate that and how it works.

522
00:50:30,796 --> 00:50:31,116
Thank you.

523
00:50:32,277 --> 00:50:32,577
Thank you.

524
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:33,597
Just quick clarification.

525
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,078
Did the denial start coming out?

526
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:36,198
Not yet.

527
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:36,919
Okay.

528
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:48,123
But for, there was an October we got in, we revamped again, resubmitted, and we have not yet heard back because there was an influx of applications

529
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:56,226
that were received in the last month until they reviewed all of them.

530
00:50:56,246 --> 00:50:57,046
Okay, got it.

531
00:50:57,667 --> 00:51:02,551
I'll go to Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Callahan, Councilor Collins, Councilor Lazaro.

532
00:51:03,252 --> 00:51:03,592
Thank you.

533
00:51:04,172 --> 00:51:06,514
Thank you for this information.

534
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:11,379
I got one of the letters, but mine was unsure.

535
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:17,984
We're unsure if you have led or not, but I want to clarify some stuff about this because

536
00:51:20,605 --> 00:51:23,407
It was a little, the letter is a little bit confusing.

537
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:30,993
It's so, it's not paying to replace the lines.

538
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:35,116
The homeowner replaces the service lines, right?

539
00:51:35,216 --> 00:51:41,861
And it's a loan to help pay for, isn't it a loan that has to be paid back or the city pays to replace the lines?

540
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:50,848
So this loan, one of the requirements of the program is the city would have to remove both the private and public side if they're both led.

541
00:51:51,658 --> 00:51:53,858
And if only one is led, we replace the one that is led.

542
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,219
So it's the cost burden is no longer on the homeowner.

543
00:51:57,459 --> 00:51:58,359
So it's a different thing.

544
00:51:58,559 --> 00:51:58,839
Correct.

545
00:51:58,879 --> 00:52:02,380
Our current program provides a $1,000 rebate to the homeowner.

546
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:02,700
Yes.

547
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:07,801
So we don't know exactly what we're going to do with that program at the moment.

548
00:52:07,901 --> 00:52:11,562
It will remain funded for the time being.

549
00:52:11,782 --> 00:52:17,023
But it will most likely be phased out once we reach a point where it's no longer useful.

550
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:17,643
OK.

551
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:23,133
I didn't understand this is a whole new program where you're paying for it.

552
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:23,794
Oh, OK.

553
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:24,795
And that's why it's expensive.

554
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:25,315
Yes.

555
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:25,455
Yeah.

556
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:25,855
Great.

557
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:28,938
The intent was always for us to do both sides.

558
00:52:29,038 --> 00:52:32,121
We never had the means or the avenue to do that.

559
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:34,683
And this is the avenue to do that.

560
00:52:35,784 --> 00:52:36,264
Amazing.

561
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:36,825
Great.

562
00:52:37,228 --> 00:52:37,848
That's wonderful.

563
00:52:38,209 --> 00:52:48,095
And I understand why then it makes so much sense to get all of the information about what is actually, what the service lines are made of.

564
00:52:51,397 --> 00:53:03,526
My son had elevated lead levels in his blood when he was a baby because of paint in our house when we had work done on our house that basically flaked into his crib when he was like an infant.

565
00:53:03,566 --> 00:53:05,687
It was ridiculous.

566
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:06,367
There's lead everywhere.

567
00:53:07,582 --> 00:53:12,025
And it's all very dangerous, but it was just one incident and it never happened again.

568
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:25,333
So I think that we probably, our water is probably okay, but all of these things are kind of so hard to figure out how to, you know, take care of your family to the best of your ability.

569
00:53:26,134 --> 00:53:34,599
But I'm really glad that we have an opportunity here to try to mitigate some of these things in Medford.

570
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:50,659
I have a second question, which is, do you know if there, after the fire that destroyed all the records, if there's fireproof record-keeping, any changes made?

571
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,340
Great, excellent.

572
00:53:53,301 --> 00:53:53,681
Love to hear it.

573
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:55,161
Thank you very much for bringing this forward.

574
00:53:58,856 --> 00:54:01,518
Yes, I was wondering if I could just take the opportunity to say something.

575
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:02,719
Sure.

576
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:07,723
I just want to make it really clear that there's nothing wrong with people's water.

577
00:54:08,304 --> 00:54:12,387
Yeah, I think the conversation could turn alarming and it shouldn't be.

578
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:15,170
The MWR does a great job treating the water.

579
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:20,194
And even if you have a lead line, the risk is still low, you should run your water.

580
00:54:20,734 --> 00:54:25,438
in the morning if you know you have a lead line and do best practices like that.

581
00:54:25,478 --> 00:54:27,139
And the city does provide information on that.

582
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:28,360
We have the information online.

583
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,884
But this is in no way should spur any sort of alarming issues with folks.

584
00:54:35,585 --> 00:54:39,127
The lead line has been in the ground, servicing your house for quite a long time.

585
00:54:39,588 --> 00:54:40,408
We want to get it out.

586
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:41,049
Yes.

587
00:54:41,269 --> 00:54:44,011
And I'm guessing you would agree with the statement that

588
00:54:45,612 --> 00:54:52,618
The point of this is to avoid any potential future issue, not address a current issue of health or safety.

589
00:54:52,918 --> 00:54:53,198
Correct.

590
00:54:53,278 --> 00:54:56,841
It's basically we're increasing the water quality for the city of Medford.

591
00:54:56,921 --> 00:54:57,942
That's really what this does.

592
00:54:58,222 --> 00:54:58,902
All right.

593
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:00,604
I did have one clarifying question.

594
00:55:01,684 --> 00:55:07,089
If records were lost, I'm sure a lot of residents have had work done on their homes at some point.

595
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:09,951
Is there a mechanism for them to communicate to you?

596
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:13,754
Like if they got a letter to say, oh, we had a plumber in,

597
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:16,558
we have a, you know, the plumber looked at the line.

598
00:55:16,698 --> 00:55:17,659
Is that useful information?

599
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:21,082
Is that information you can even use or is it just kind of hearsay?

600
00:55:21,322 --> 00:55:36,215
We've, we've received those calls and that's what we've received since October, since we put the letters out and yeah, just call either a water quality hotline or, you know, and we'll take a look.

601
00:55:36,696 --> 00:55:36,916
Great.

602
00:55:37,176 --> 00:55:37,436
All right.

603
00:55:37,636 --> 00:55:38,177
Councilor Callahan.

604
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,160
Thank you.

605
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,941
Thanks for all this work that you're doing.

606
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:45,942
And I'm hoping, can you give us a little bit more of the big picture?

607
00:55:45,962 --> 00:55:53,945
Because I know that we have like 125 year old water lines throughout the city and it's hundreds of millions of dollars for us to replace them all.

608
00:55:54,365 --> 00:55:56,025
Can you fit this into the context of that?

609
00:55:56,045 --> 00:56:07,429
I know that this is a specific APA project that has a deadline, but give us a little bit of context in terms of how does it fit into our sort of longer term plans to replace these aging pipes?

610
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:12,854
Yeah, I'd say it's a piece.

611
00:56:13,114 --> 00:56:15,854
I'd say it's a piece, but it's a very section of the piece.

612
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:19,035
It's something that needs to be done.

613
00:56:19,215 --> 00:56:23,176
It's very quantifiable, much more than the rest of the water system.

614
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:26,197
A lot of the water system, we find out when it's in bad shape, when it breaks.

615
00:56:26,837 --> 00:56:28,957
This one, we can kind of quantify it.

616
00:56:29,017 --> 00:56:29,898
We know what to expect.

617
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:30,778
We know what, how to do it.

618
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:39,880
So, you know, we've come up with estimates anywhere between 40 and $60 million worth of lead surface line removals in this city.

619
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:44,086
Um, you know, that's what the numbers as they stand now.

620
00:56:44,266 --> 00:56:47,412
But, you know, as we've been saying, we believe those numbers in reality be lower.

621
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:49,836
So it could be closer to 30 million.

622
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:52,240
But it's definitely in the 10s of millions.

623
00:56:53,223 --> 00:57:08,936
And then as far as our entire water system and the needs of our water system, it's a separate need than, say, replacing old water mains that are breaking and leaking.

624
00:57:10,578 --> 00:57:14,321
It's very regulatory driven.

625
00:57:15,241 --> 00:57:17,984
If the EPA wasn't making us do this, I'm not sure how fast we would move.

626
00:57:19,506 --> 00:57:24,030
But for the water breaks, we're moving, you know, we need to move faster.

627
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:30,695
So I wish that the EPA funded us to replace all the water pipes and we'd move pretty quickly.

628
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,938
So anyway, so that answers the question.

629
00:57:34,158 --> 00:57:39,042
Is it safe to say that like, this is just the very end of like the sort of

630
00:57:39,822 --> 00:57:42,864
roots or tree branches or whatever you want to call it, of the water system.

631
00:57:42,924 --> 00:57:49,428
So at this point, because of the deadline and the funding, we're going to be working at the ends of the system.

632
00:57:50,368 --> 00:57:58,393
And that after that, when that deadline is no longer pressing, that we will move on to working to the rest of the aging water system.

633
00:57:59,317 --> 00:57:59,617
both.

634
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:00,857
We're doing both at the same time.

635
00:58:00,998 --> 00:58:09,640
Now this loan is for the end, the service is only, but we are still moving forward with our water main replacement.

636
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,440
We're trying to ramp that up as well.

637
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:18,502
And whenever we do a water main project, we always replace the lead lines on these lines

638
00:58:20,175 --> 00:58:32,960
The targeting for water main replacement is more on a fire safety, pressure, head loss type of basis versus where the lead lines.

639
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:39,923
We want to make sure that people have water when it's needed.

640
00:58:41,283 --> 00:58:42,183
The pressure is there.

641
00:58:42,223 --> 00:58:42,984
The volume is there.

642
00:58:43,004 --> 00:58:44,124
Those are the two big ones.

643
00:58:44,864 --> 00:58:45,985
Water quality is important too.

644
00:58:46,747 --> 00:58:55,771
When we replace an unlined cast iron pipe from 1905 to a ductile iron pipe that's lined, that's an increase in water quality as well.

645
00:58:56,852 --> 00:59:01,114
So I probably thought of a better answer to your question, though.

646
00:59:02,294 --> 00:59:03,835
We have to ramp up all of these things.

647
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:13,916
One of the things we're trying to do to get a handle on it is we have one of our consultants working on, I've talked about this, a long-term rate plan with the CIP.

648
00:59:13,936 --> 00:59:15,457
They're wrapping that work up now.

649
00:59:15,477 --> 00:59:26,327
So basically it means taking our capital improvement program and then saying, okay, we think the rates for water need to grow at this rate in order to accommodate

650
00:59:26,807 --> 00:59:28,128
that capital program.

651
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:39,052
And then we're also saying, well, what are we missing consultant, and they're telling us, well, you also have to do this, this, that, and that should be in your capital program, and this and should be doing this many miles, this many, you know, so

652
00:59:39,613 --> 00:59:47,797
That's coming, and actually I owe the Water Commission a meeting on this to see if we can make sure we have something lined up for this budget season.

653
00:59:48,357 --> 00:59:51,239
So that might provide a little bit more context to your question.

654
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:57,262
It's a huge task to wrap our heads around, but

655
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,869
That's what we're trying to do right now.

656
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:05,995
It's something similar that we did with pavement a few years back, is to understand the problem first.

657
01:00:06,495 --> 01:00:08,737
So that's really where we're still at with water.

658
01:00:09,618 --> 01:00:13,702
But we know we have to do this, and it's very defined.

659
01:00:15,604 --> 01:00:16,145
Thank you so much.

660
01:00:17,746 --> 01:00:18,046
Thanks.

661
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:21,049
And just to, again, just for my brain to understand,

662
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:32,757
The MWRA is giving out essentially a 25% discounted loan for this purpose because the regulations are so stringent around this specific issue.

663
01:00:33,778 --> 01:00:42,201
And that's what, like, if you could get this for mains, you would, but it's not offered because the regulations aren't requiring replacement of old mains in the same way.

664
01:00:43,422 --> 01:00:44,882
That's a good way to put it.

665
01:00:45,182 --> 01:00:47,623
I wouldn't say it's all the way correct.

666
01:00:47,904 --> 01:00:48,184
OK, great.

667
01:00:48,224 --> 01:00:49,284
But it's a good way to think about it.

668
01:00:49,484 --> 01:00:49,984
OK.

669
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,185
What would make it more correct?

670
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:57,637
There is funding available for water mains.

671
01:00:58,557 --> 01:01:00,398
It's just not forgiven.

672
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:01,819
So there's no 25% grant.

673
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:07,803
So we've come before, let's see, I forget exactly when it was, but a year and a half plus.

674
01:01:07,843 --> 01:01:08,223
Last January.

675
01:01:08,523 --> 01:01:09,064
Last January.

676
01:01:09,084 --> 01:01:09,424
Here we go.

677
01:01:10,064 --> 01:01:12,786
We came before you guys for approval for a $3.5 million bond.

678
01:01:14,518 --> 01:01:24,843
that was going to be used to replace the Willis Ave water main, which is taking an old water main installed in 19-whatever to a new water main.

679
01:01:25,763 --> 01:01:27,904
So that was funded through MWA program.

680
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:32,726
And then the State Revolving Fund also provides funding for that as well.

681
01:01:33,427 --> 01:01:34,407
The difference is that

682
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:41,875
the regulatory pressure from the DEP and the EPA is what kind of sets us apart.

683
01:01:42,595 --> 01:01:52,099
Also, the other thing that sets us apart is that if we continue to do it the way we have been doing it, which is we do ours, you guys do yours, and

684
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:54,740
we all walk away and it's done.

685
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,922
That they're finding out that that makes it worse for the homeowner.

686
01:01:58,322 --> 01:02:07,127
So that's the other sort of circumstance here, which is why they're saying, okay, listen, we'll give you, if you take $8 million out, we'll give you $2 million of that.

687
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:07,647
Right.

688
01:02:08,328 --> 01:02:13,431
And, and the, and the bonds, the previous bond, it was zero interest, but there wasn't like 25% rebate or.

689
01:02:13,451 --> 01:02:14,171
Correct.

690
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,312
Okay.

691
01:02:15,972 --> 01:02:16,833
Councilor Collins and Councilor

692
01:02:20,766 --> 01:02:21,126
Thank you.

693
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:26,852
Really appreciate the big picture, the granular information.

694
01:02:26,892 --> 01:02:27,633
Thank you for all this.

695
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:32,077
Just want to go back to one clarifying question that I had from your presentation.

696
01:02:32,437 --> 01:02:35,200
And sorry, I'm sure that you made this very clear.

697
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,302
I'm just trying to keep track of the numbers you mentioned.

698
01:02:39,304 --> 01:02:41,066
For example, there's a certain thousand number of

699
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:54,812
lines that are classified as copper, for example, and you said of that number of lines, there's a percentage that we know to be, that gave me the impression that even the lines that already have a classification, we're going back and double checking.

700
01:02:54,912 --> 01:02:55,693
Is that the case?

701
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:58,455
Where we're digging, yes.

702
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:02,639
So when we dig down ones that are copper, are copper.

703
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,402
We've never found one that is not copper.

704
01:03:05,693 --> 01:03:11,359
OK, so it sounds like the trends are things that we think to be copper, broadly are copper.

705
01:03:11,459 --> 01:03:13,421
Things we think to be lead, broadly are lead.

706
01:03:13,481 --> 01:03:17,985
And then it sounded like, and correct me if I misheard you, that most of the unknowns are turning out not to be lead.

707
01:03:18,686 --> 01:03:19,446
OK, thank you.

708
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:20,227
I just wanted to make sure.

709
01:03:20,287 --> 01:03:24,451
And it also sounded like most of the lead, only 30% to 40% of the lead are actually lead.

710
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:26,133
So most of the leads aren't lead.

711
01:03:26,537 --> 01:03:30,738
Right, you have to remember that our records date back to like, some of them date back to 1896.

712
01:03:31,819 --> 01:03:40,541
Like they were initially done and then anything that was redone and we didn't have, we lost those records.

713
01:03:40,761 --> 01:03:41,881
So we have the originals.

714
01:03:42,382 --> 01:03:46,763
So you might have a record that says it was lead and then it was replaced, but that second record got burned in a fire.

715
01:03:46,863 --> 01:03:48,923
So you're calling it lead, but it actually got replaced.

716
01:03:49,163 --> 01:03:49,444
Correct.

717
01:03:49,684 --> 01:03:49,924
All right.

718
01:03:50,404 --> 01:03:50,944
Councilor Callahan.

719
01:03:53,241 --> 01:04:00,366
Thanks, just one super quick question, and I think you already said it, but if you can repeat, when would this work be completed?

720
01:04:01,326 --> 01:04:02,727
Approximately, do we have any ideas?

721
01:04:02,867 --> 01:04:05,069
Yes, we do.

722
01:04:05,289 --> 01:04:10,012
So the program that we're introducing today is three years, so it'll last three years, approximately.

723
01:04:10,592 --> 01:04:15,095
But we have a deadline of 2032 to get our lead service lines out of the ground.

724
01:04:15,455 --> 01:04:22,660
That's a really aggressive deadline for this, which is why we're really hoping that those numbers that we just talked about, those two categories, lead and unknown,

725
01:04:23,322 --> 01:04:29,826
really hoping the trend continues that 30% of the lead are actually not lead.

726
01:04:30,106 --> 01:04:30,787
Can I ask a question?

727
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:43,355
So I'm specifically thinking of some constituents who have reached out to me and like begged me for any sort of resources that they can do that they can possibly get for replacing their lines because they know they have lead in their water.

728
01:04:46,265 --> 01:04:51,128
Do you have any thoughts on should they just pay to do it themselves?

729
01:04:51,228 --> 01:04:57,152
If they replace their part, but then the other part isn't replaced, is that then possibly going to be worse?

730
01:04:57,692 --> 01:05:00,394
What should they do, given that they're concerned right now?

731
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:13,902
Well, speaking as a resident and speaking as someone who also tested my children when they were very young, and they did have

732
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:16,254
but in their system.

733
01:05:17,277 --> 01:05:19,001
And, you know,

734
01:05:20,098 --> 01:05:23,961
I have a water system at my house that filters it, everything.

735
01:05:24,141 --> 01:05:25,543
It's a reverse osmosis system.

736
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:29,486
So that's probably the most cost effective way to do something on your own.

737
01:05:30,507 --> 01:05:48,522
But I would recommend that you, if you own a house and your house is worth six figures plus, you know, obviously most of them are around here, it's well worth your investment to spend the three or $4,000 it's going to be to replace, fully replace your lead service line with copper.

738
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:52,053
well worth it, the incredible investment that you can make.

739
01:05:52,373 --> 01:05:58,358
Now, if you want to wait for the city to come to you and do your whole line, you certainly can do that, and many people will do that.

740
01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:07,106
But if you are a family with young children and our inventory says that you have a lead line in your house and you own your house, there are options available to you.

741
01:06:08,567 --> 01:06:13,372
The cheapest one, like I said, is some sort of reverse osmosis system for your house.

742
01:06:14,518 --> 01:06:18,601
Then there's, well, actually there's one thing cheaper than that, that's just best practices.

743
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:28,730
When you wake up in the morning, run your faucet for a little while, go through your fixtures, make sure your fixtures don't have lead or old brass in them, things like that.

744
01:06:30,471 --> 01:06:34,214
So there are lots of very cheap things that you can do that are more best practices.

745
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:36,456
Then there's filtering systems that you can get.

746
01:06:37,217 --> 01:06:41,881
And then obviously the standard, the gold standard is just replace the lime with copper.

747
01:06:42,861 --> 01:06:43,761
It's so incredibly helpful.

748
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:44,882
Thank you.

749
01:06:44,902 --> 01:06:45,182
Yeah.

750
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:47,123
And we offer $1,000 right now, and that program is active.

751
01:06:47,543 --> 01:06:47,723
Great.

752
01:06:48,623 --> 01:06:53,425
And I think also just should be noted, just to reiterate your point, it's not always the line.

753
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:56,246
It could be fixtures or something else in the house.

754
01:06:57,127 --> 01:06:58,067
Be systemic about it.

755
01:06:59,168 --> 01:07:00,848
We just saw at the middle schools, right?

756
01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:03,970
The lines are probably fine, but you had some fixtures with issues.

757
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:04,290
Yeah.

758
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:05,990
Usually is.

759
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:07,131
OK.

760
01:07:07,871 --> 01:07:08,051
Great.

761
01:07:08,831 --> 01:07:09,832
Any further questions on this?

762
01:07:15,234 --> 01:07:19,776
We can motion to approve for first reading or we can motion to approve for third reading with if there's no objection.

763
01:07:21,157 --> 01:07:23,379
We can't do it with a loan or needs three.

764
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:23,839
Okay.

765
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:25,540
All right.

766
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:33,185
So the motion would be to approve the first reading if there is one on the motion of councilor Callahan, seconded by councils are to approve for first reading.

767
01:07:33,205 --> 01:07:35,206
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

768
01:07:43,953 --> 01:07:44,554
That's a call him.

769
01:07:45,815 --> 01:07:46,595
Vice President Collins.

770
01:07:46,615 --> 01:07:49,658
That's a little Zorro Council lemon.

771
01:07:49,938 --> 01:07:50,219
Yes.

772
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,361
Councilor Scarpelli.

773
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,963
Councilor saying, President bears.

774
01:07:55,023 --> 01:07:57,105
Yes, I think I'm going to have a motion passes.

775
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:57,405
Thank you.

776
01:07:59,077 --> 01:08:12,744
25.029 wage adjustment for the traffic supervisors union respectfully request and recommend approve the following amendments traffic supervisors effective July 1 2024.5% note that this union received 2% on 630 2024 July 1 2025 2% July 1 2026 2% July 1 2027 2% so is there a motion to or do we have any further discussion on yep

777
01:08:29,724 --> 01:08:32,825
Yes, this is the union contract agreed with the traffic supervisors.

778
01:08:36,006 --> 01:08:45,370
Possibly waive the three readings with this, because I think that the units that have been waiting a while, if we could move forward and waive the readings, I'd appreciate that.

779
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:51,152
A motion of Councilor Scarpelli to waive the three readings and approve for third reading, seconded by Councilor Collins.

780
01:08:51,813 --> 01:08:52,893
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

781
01:09:10,285 --> 01:09:10,945
Councilor Callahan.

782
01:09:12,446 --> 01:09:13,307
Vice-President Collins.

783
01:09:14,087 --> 01:09:14,907
Councilor Lazaro.

784
01:09:16,088 --> 01:09:16,608
Councilor Lemming.

785
01:09:16,968 --> 01:09:17,269
Yes.

786
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:19,230
Councilor Scarpelli.

787
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:19,590
Yes.

788
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:21,111
Councilor Singh.

789
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:21,391
Yes.

790
01:09:21,851 --> 01:09:22,371
President Harris.

791
01:09:22,411 --> 01:09:22,631
Yes.

792
01:09:22,651 --> 01:09:23,892
I have the affirmative, none of the negative.

793
01:09:23,912 --> 01:09:25,973
The motion passes.

794
01:09:25,993 --> 01:09:29,235
25.03.0, Community Preservation Committee Appropriation Request.

795
01:09:29,775 --> 01:09:32,957
Cross-Street Cemetery Monument Restoration Phase One.

796
01:09:34,017 --> 01:09:39,460
On behalf of the CPC, I respectfully request and recommend your honorable body approve the following recommendation.

797
01:09:40,153 --> 01:09:51,296
requesting 5,000 from the CPA historic reserve to the cemetery trustees of the historical commission for phase one of the cross streets emissary monument restoration project respectively submitted Brianna Lugo-Kern.

798
01:09:51,336 --> 01:09:54,657
We do have manager Dupont, vice chair Hayward.

799
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:58,859
And I did just want to also note that there were some other funds going towards this project.

800
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:02,760
We have a motion to approve by councilor Scarpelli, seconded by councilor Sang.

801
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:06,009
It sounds like it's going through.

802
01:10:06,029 --> 01:10:09,090
Do you wanna raise your hands to say anything or are y'all good with that?

803
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:12,411
I'm seeing shaking heads on the motion.

804
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:13,912
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

805
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:16,873
Councilor Callahan.

806
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:19,975
Vice President Collins.

807
01:10:21,075 --> 01:10:21,896
Councilor Lozaro.

808
01:10:22,716 --> 01:10:23,256
Councilor Lemming.

809
01:10:23,536 --> 01:10:23,857
Yes.

810
01:10:24,877 --> 01:10:25,617
Councilor Scarpelli.

811
01:10:25,657 --> 01:10:25,898
Yes.

812
01:10:26,298 --> 01:10:26,918
Councilor Sang.

813
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:27,098
Yes.

814
01:10:27,578 --> 01:10:28,199
President Pierce.

815
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:28,499
Yes.

816
01:10:28,519 --> 01:10:30,580
I have affirmative and negative motion passes.

817
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:31,120
Thanks you guys.

818
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:46,036
25 or three one submitted my brain occurred if we do this in one minute I would have bet with the clerk home real petition institutional master plans I respect the request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following home real petition and transmit the general court for their consideration.

819
01:10:46,636 --> 01:10:53,082
This is an act granting the city of Medford the authority to require the adoption of institutional master plan subject to the review and approval of the municipality.

820
01:10:53,622 --> 01:11:19,948
This is, I think, the fourth refiling of this Home Rule petition, and essentially would allow the city to require that large-scale institutional facilities, for example, a Tufts University, that they have to provide a master plan to the city, and that the city can impose institutional master plan review to regulate the use of land or structures for land owned, leased, or otherwise occupied by hospitals, healthcare institutions, colleges, universities, and nonprofit educational corporations.

821
01:11:21,805 --> 01:11:25,127
I will go to what looks to be Councilor Collins.

822
01:11:27,749 --> 01:11:28,610
Thank you, President Behrs.

823
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:36,255
This is something that has come up in a lot of recent discussions in the community lately, including but not limited to city council meetings.

824
01:11:38,777 --> 01:11:46,162
Such a measure if communities like Medford were allowed to institute mandatory institutional master plans would give us

825
01:11:48,224 --> 01:12:01,733
the greater latitude and authority that I think we all know that we need and deserve over the very large institutions that take up a lot of real estate and take a lot of land and footprint within our communities.

826
01:12:02,314 --> 01:12:14,543
I think a lot of people can recognize by gut instinct that a community should be able to have some level of mandatory at least conversation and co-planning with institutions that have such a large footprint in their communities.

827
01:12:15,924 --> 01:12:18,966
Currently we are very disenfranchised and being able to enforce that.

828
01:12:20,547 --> 01:12:27,493
This legislation around institutional master plans which is something we're not currently enabled to do this home repetition would be asking for the permission to set up that.

829
01:12:29,088 --> 01:12:46,917
mandate that regulation would allow us to equalize the playing field with community partners such as Tufts University, other very large institutions, so that we can do a better job of collaborating or do the collaboration that we've been wanting to do all along on these issues that affect both the institutions and the communities like ours that host them.

830
01:12:47,337 --> 01:12:48,118
So I motion to approve.

831
01:12:51,219 --> 01:12:56,162
On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins and submit this to the legislature, seconded by Councilor Sang.

832
01:12:56,202 --> 01:12:58,263
I saw your request, Councilor Callahan.

833
01:12:59,263 --> 01:13:00,785
Thank you.

834
01:13:01,506 --> 01:13:04,991
Yes, I wish there were much more that we could do.

835
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:12,621
It is really, I believe, quite ridiculous that we cannot actually get this without a home rule petition, which is almost certainly going to be denied.

836
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,164
We should be getting

837
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,383
real estate taxes from these large institutions.

838
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:32,654
A master plan is really small potatoes, and it is quite frustrating that we have to do a homeown petition, and it is unlikely to be approved, but I am certainly in favor of this homeown petition.

839
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:33,855
I hope that it passes.

840
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:34,116
Thank you.

841
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:37,813
Thank you, Councilor Callahan, and I also am in favor.

842
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:54,927
I'm, you know, continually frustrated by the exemptions that especially large institutions get from the basic processes and procedures that this community asks of every other member of the community, down to the 3,000 square foot lot owner.

843
01:13:56,168 --> 01:13:58,530
Nevermind that Tufts has a budget

844
01:13:59,563 --> 01:14:15,913
of you know, many attend or more times the size of the city of Medford and endowment certainly bigger than any sort of reserve fund that the city of Medford has and the ability to leverage all of that to their advantage in addition to their legal protections.

845
01:14:16,133 --> 01:14:17,814
So very supportive of this.

846
01:14:18,134 --> 01:14:21,897
I will go to Councilor Zaro and then we do a public participation on this.

847
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:36,232
And just one thing I would like to add is that many of us in this community have strong opinions about a lot of things but but something it seems like we can almost all of us can agree on is that we think that.

848
01:14:36,711 --> 01:14:44,898
it would be nice if Tufts University could come to the table and meet us as an equal partner.

849
01:14:46,459 --> 01:14:49,662
It really brings our community together when we talk about stuff like this.

850
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:55,327
So it would be nice if the state house would also meet us there.

851
01:14:56,267 --> 01:14:57,208
We would really appreciate that.

852
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:58,369
So thank you.

853
01:15:00,131 --> 01:15:00,851
Thank you.

854
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,273
I will go now to public participation.

855
01:15:03,814 --> 01:15:04,895
We have a hand on Zoom.

856
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:07,775
name and address for the record, please.

857
01:15:07,855 --> 01:15:09,635
And once I'm here, you'll have three minutes.

858
01:15:10,976 --> 01:15:11,676
One second.

859
01:15:12,956 --> 01:15:13,337
Here you go.

860
01:15:14,017 --> 01:15:14,717
Matthew Page.

861
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:18,738
Yes, Matthew Page, Lieberman and 15 Canal Street.

862
01:15:18,778 --> 01:15:20,939
I was watching this bill in the last session.

863
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:26,021
And you know, it was mothballed to go off to a study committee.

864
01:15:26,461 --> 01:15:28,802
I reached out to Representative Barber last month

865
01:15:29,505 --> 01:15:36,068
about because she was the lead sponsor, and I reached out to the planning department about this.

866
01:15:36,848 --> 01:15:40,670
I watched the hearing, which was two years ago for this bill.

867
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:51,155
Representative Barber spoke, Representative Mayor Longo Kern spoke for our bill, and there was also Mayor Ballentine, because there's an analog bill that Somerville has.

868
01:15:52,555 --> 01:15:55,877
Mayor Ballentine really gave some compelling arguments

869
01:15:57,422 --> 01:16:05,168
Our mayor said that the bill had previously been introduced twice, and our mayor was hoping that the third time would be a charm.

870
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:21,243
I think that when bills come from the administration or requests come to the administration or to the city council, I would hope that the administration would explain how they're going to try to do something differently elsewhere, you know, just

871
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:26,348
re-asking for something, going through the motions and expecting for it to die.

872
01:16:26,368 --> 01:16:37,541
Else, you know, our mayor may be saying, you know, this time, perhaps the fourth time will be a charm and not expecting anything differently.

873
01:16:38,121 --> 01:16:41,045
We can assume that Tufts has lawyers, you know, that are lobbying

874
01:16:42,445 --> 01:16:44,246
you know, legislators not to do anything.

875
01:16:44,846 --> 01:16:50,569
And it would be nice if perhaps the planning department would appear in the hearing and explain this.

876
01:16:50,689 --> 01:17:00,993
It would be nice if the administration were to be able to communicate to residents why this is important and also get residents involved to give testimony.

877
01:17:01,133 --> 01:17:01,573
Thank you.

878
01:17:04,255 --> 01:17:04,735
Thank you.

879
01:17:04,755 --> 01:17:07,316
Any further discussion?

880
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:13,912
No, I owe the clerk one piece of candy.

881
01:17:16,554 --> 01:17:18,676
That man always has them and he's not here to defend it.

882
01:17:18,756 --> 01:17:20,937
So, all right.

883
01:17:20,997 --> 01:17:25,180
On the motion of vice-president Collins, seconded by councilor Sang.

884
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,343
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

885
01:17:30,945 --> 01:17:31,625
Councilor Callahan.

886
01:17:32,926 --> 01:17:33,787
Vice-president Collins.

887
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:35,548
Councilor Lozaro.

888
01:17:36,409 --> 01:17:36,969
Councilor Lemming.

889
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:37,730
Yes.

890
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:39,551
Councilor Scarpelli.

891
01:17:41,618 --> 01:17:43,579
Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

892
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:46,020
Yes, I have the affirmative, none the negative, motion passes.

893
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:48,662
That brings us to public participation.

894
01:17:48,842 --> 01:17:55,826
Is there anyone in the chambers or on Zoom who would like to speak on any matter to their heart's content for three minutes?

895
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:06,452
Seeing none, is there any further motion by members of the council?

896
01:18:07,564 --> 01:18:11,751
On the motion to adjourn by Councilor saying seconded by Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

897
01:18:13,514 --> 01:18:18,122
Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Lemming.

898
01:18:18,422 --> 01:18:18,683
Yes.

899
01:18:19,664 --> 01:18:20,385
Councilor Scarpelli.

900
01:18:22,869 --> 01:18:23,370
Councilor Sang.
