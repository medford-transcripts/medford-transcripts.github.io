    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1598.018s">Yes,</a>  I have the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1598.899s">None</a>  of the negative motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1602.299s">This</a>  should be in petitions presentations similar papers, my apologies I didn't catch that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1606.663s">But</a>  this is 25032 proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance 10 and 20 Revere Beach Parkway for referral to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1615.151s">This</a>  is from the petitioner at 10 and 20 Revere Beach Parkway, we have Valerie Moore. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1624.104s">from</a>  Dr. MacLennan and Fish on behalf of the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1626.367s">I'm</a>  just going to summarize it and say that they are representing Transom Real Estate, the applicant looking to have an amendment to the text of the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District, WSMOD. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1641.31s">and</a>  they have proposed a redline amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1643.932s">This</a>  is the property consists of two parcels which are currently owned by Houlihan Properties and 10 Revere Beach Parkway LLC petitioners, both of which consent to the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1653.839s">Essentially</a>  the three clarifications that are being requested <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1657.221s">First,</a>  the table of dimensional standards establishes a maximum front yard setback of 15 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1662.643s">The</a>  petitioners property as well as others on the fells winter rear beach parkway is subject to a perpetual deed restriction held by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation that requires a minimum setback of 20 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1674.848s">So</a>  they're requesting that that be clarified a footnote that if there's a property subject to a public agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1681.556s">restriction</a>  that the maximum setbacks would coincide with that restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1685.657s">Second,</a>  there's a development incentive bonuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1688.218s">It</a>  currently reads a certified LEED Gold or LEED Platinum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1694.68s">The</a>  petitioners are proposing a modification from certified to certifiable because the LEED certification can't happen until the building is constructed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1703.368s">And</a>  the third is definitions section clarifying the definition of building coverage to make clear it does not include building overhangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1711.932s">They're</a>  arguing that the current definition is ambiguous on this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1716.734s">Right</a>  now, the only thing before us is to refer this to community development board as it's a zoning amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1721.417s">I</a>  will say I've spoken to the planning department staff on the first two of these items and those are changes that we were planning to make as part of the zoning updates project anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1732.962s">So</a>  I can't speak to the third change, although it seems to me on its face reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1740.209s">So</a>  tonight we would refer this to Community Development Board, and then they would refer it back to us with any recommendations and conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1749.798s">And</a>  with that, I'll recognize Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1753.702s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears, for the overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1755.284s">I</a>  would motion to refer to the Community Development Board.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1761.21s">Great,</a>  and I do wanna offer, we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli, and then I do wanna offer the petitioner a chance to take a look before we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1767.174s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1767.914s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1768.395s">I</a>  know that this is something that first I've seen of it, so 10 to 20 Red Beach Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1775.159s">What</a>  are the abutters? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1776.019s">Have</a>  the abutters been notified? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1777.36s">Are</a>  there abutters next, residents next to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1782.744s">Because</a>  I think that before we move this forward, were the neighbors informed and how do they feel about the situation?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1790.005s">Yeah,</a>  so procedurally, what would happen is we receive it, we refer it to Community Development Board, which we're obligated to do, and then they'll schedule the public hearings of the CD board and work with the clerk to schedule a public hearing for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1801.73s">Butters</a>  will be notified of the public hearings, and then the public hearings will go forward.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1806.371s">Thank</a>  you for the clarification, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1808.792s">You</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1809.313s">Do</a>  we have a representative of the petitioner? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1812.774s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1815.075s">Just</a>  want to give you guys a chance to speak to the petition.</p>

    <p>[Brian Lee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1820.212s">Hi,</a>  my name is Brian Lee with Transom Real Estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1823.234s">I'm</a>  a partner there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1824.714s">Thank</a>  you for the time tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1825.735s">I</a>  won't take up too much of your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1827.015s">I</a>  know it's late. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1828.056s">I</a>  just wanted to take a moment to introduce ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1830.697s">We're</a>  a local developer, a very small firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1833.439s">We</a>  are six people located in the south end of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1837.701s">We</a>  focus on really important sites in what we consider to be really great cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1842.903s">And</a>  this is one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1845.124s">As</a>  you mentioned, we're focusing on 10 and 20 Revere Beach Parkway, which, as you all know, is really the Cappies and Monroe Auto site. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1853.69s">There</a>  will certainly be a lot of discussions around our plans, but we're really here tonight in a very preliminary fashion to just discuss the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1863.256s">One</a>  thing about Transom, despite being very local, we care a lot about design and we care a lot about the neighborhoods in which we build. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1871.463s">And</a>  so I think if you look at some of the history of our buildings in the past, we're really proud of how we contribute to the neighborhood and how we really involve the neighborhoods feedback into the design process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1881.851s">As</a>  I said, I won't take up too much of your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1883.652s">I</a>  just wanted to introduce transom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1885.974s">Our</a>  permitting attorney, Valerie Moore is here and she's much more capable to discuss the zoning issues than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1891.138s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1891.698s">And</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1893.499s">If</a>  you'd like to Councilor, if you'd like to share anything you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1900.313s">Yes,</a>  you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1901.473s">The</a>  red is good in this case.</p>

    <p>[Valerie Moore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1904.535s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1905.316s">You</a>  summarized the three specific changes that we're looking for better than I could, so I'll speak to process and then answer any questions that you might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1915.863s">So</a>  these are just minor changes proposed to the Wellington Station Multi-Family Overlay District. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1923.688s">You're</a>  not approving a project as part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1926.749s">Once</a>  those changes are approved, then we would be able to actually submit for our site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1933.212s">That's</a>  when the public hearings on the project itself would be before the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1938.734s">So</a>  this is really a very preliminary step that would enable really full public review of the actual project that we intend to propose.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1947.438s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1948.58s">That</a>  was going to be my question or clarification, just to elucidate the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1952.925s">Even</a>  if this zoning amendment moves through all the phases and is adopted, then you would have your project proposal, which would go through site plan review for the specific project with all the studies and the comment and the process at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1965.001s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1967.399s">Can</a>  you tell that we've been doing a zoning update for the past 18 months? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1971.721s">And</a>  honestly, it feels like for me for the past like five years.</p>

    <p>[Valerie Moore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1974.883s">You're</a>  pretty savvy on it, I'm impressed.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1977.144s">I</a>  was like, oh, this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1980.825s">But</a>  no, thank you for bringing this to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1984.147s">I</a>  know we'll have another chance to talk to you during the public hearing if the Community Development Board sends this back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1989.349s">So</a>  thanks for being here.</p>

    <p>[Valerie Moore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1990.63s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1992.22s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Council Lazzaro to refer this to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1998.002s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2016.584s">Yes,</a>  I have the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2018.845s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2020.126s">All</a>  right, our next petition, petition for a CV license, common victims license, Kelly's roast beef. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2025.668s">They</a>  were here last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2026.588s">Do</a>  we have a representative this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2028.509s">Yes,</a>  we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2029.21s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2030.93s">So</a>  I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli to talk about this petition.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2037.15s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2039.513s">I</a>  do see everything is in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2041.435s">I</a>  think that there was one clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2043.737s">I</a>  think the clerk, just publicly, I know that the hours of operations, is that something we're changing now, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2051.715s">Or</a>  does the petition have to come back for those extended hours?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2055.136s">To</a>  amend the hours of operation, they would have to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2057.097s">But</a>  it's not going to be through the special permit process.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2059.298s">OK,</a>  so they do have to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2061.159s">So</a>  your hours are till 11 o'clock right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2063.9s">OK,</a>  and then I know usually Kelly's was a great location for a little time after for people that work late, or Justin, who is at Harvard until 2 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2076.565s">Or</a>  when that Councilor Scarpella has a few items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2081.126s">My</a>  wife won't allow me to go there anymore.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2084.347s">We</a>  can go.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2084.787s">I</a>  was one of the last people with the punch card, the three-way punch card. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2089.428s">You</a>  guys don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2091.468s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2091.948s">I</a>  see everything is in order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2093.789s">I</a>  know that already the feedback I've heard from people that super professional and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2100.655s">that</a>  they're excited about this new venture with our new organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2104.596s">And</a>  after my fellow colleagues have any comments, I would move approval.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2113.399s">Any</a>  other comments for anyone else? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2116.579s">I</a>  guess, are you guys representing the new venture that has purchased Kelly's?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2120.08s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2120.56s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2121.961s">Could</a>  you just go into like, are you guys still pretty local or?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Whiteman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2127.047s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2127.307s">So</a>  David Massey, the owner, um, of AM 15 management, he lives in Ipswich, Massachusetts recently, most, or most recently of Georgetown. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2134.531s">So</a>  he has a local guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2136.052s">Um,</a>  we're a real estate investment company. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2137.893s">We</a>  have 11 hotels on the North shore or the Northeast, um, Turner Hill golf club up in Ipswich. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2143.477s">And</a>  now we've gotten into the Kelly's segment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2146.298s">We</a>  have the four light. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2147.759s">We</a>  call them the four legacy, the Medford Danvers, August and Revere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2152.482s">as</a>  well as we built Salem, New Hampshire, Detta, Massachusetts, and Worcester, Massachusetts, with the plans to continue to build, I think, what, five or 10 in the next five years down in Florida we're looking to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2165.231s">So</a>  we are a local company and looking to add a little bit more dimension to the Kellys that everybody knows and loves.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2172.256s">And</a>  so you guys have already built and operated some, and now you've purchased the originals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2176.479s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2176.839s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2178.0s">And</a>  do you think there might be a potential for an extended hours at some point?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2189.708s">You</a>  can feel free to send back that some of us would like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2192.909s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2389.37s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2390.731s">Thank</a>  you for hearing us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2393.332s">The</a>  information that you just provided does it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2397.874s">Yeah,</a>  I totally understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2399.775s">I</a>  read. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2400.275s">I</a>  understood what I was reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2403.573s">All</a>  right, so as we've talked about before, we have a lot of work to do on our water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2409.974s">A</a>  significant portion of that work is the lead service line removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2415.175s">So</a>  what we're going to do here is I'm going to give a sort of a broad overview of the program and what we're going to do with this loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2424.657s">And</a>  then Owen can dive into some nitty gritty information that we've been working with directly to try to get this program up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2433.868s">So</a>  this program is from the MWRA, it's a loan program that provides a 25% relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2441.691s">So,</a>  like a grant so 25% of that would be a grant, if we use the money in a certain way that certain way is removing both sides of a lead line and not just the public side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2454.795s">We're</a>  basically going to be funding the full removal from the house all the way to the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2460.898s">That's</a>  important because one of the things that the, the folks in the DEP and the EPA have discovered is that when you do half of a line, like has been pretty typical for many years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2472.182s">It</a>  actually increases the risk of lead poisoning in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2476.343s">So</a>  it's frowned upon now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2478.624s">So</a>  we're trying not to do that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2479.884s">We're</a>  transitioning to the recommended best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2483.685s">This</a>  is also what the EPA wants to happen within a certain amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2487.627s">I'll</a>  get to that in a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2489.147s">So</a>  with this loan, we would basically be providing a significant upgrade to our entire water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2494.589s">The</a>  lead service lines or the service lines in general are a huge component of our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2499.585s">You</a>  can just think every single building has a service line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2503.439s">So</a>  we have about 19,000 of them or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2507.026s">The</a>  program would be a three-year program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2509.147s">It</a>  would include soft costs and hard costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2511.507s">What</a>  I mean by that, it includes hiring an engineer to put together a bid package for a testing and a removal and replacement program, as well as a statistical analysis to get rid or shed our numbers down with what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2530.432s">Right</a>  now, we have a lot of unknowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2532.112s">So</a>  if we do a statistical analysis, we should be able to reduce that number of unknowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2537.333s">That's</a>  important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2538.855s">How</a>  many unknowns we have and how many lead lines we have dictates how fast we need to remove them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2545.079s">And</a>  also, that's the biggest thing, how fast we need to remove them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2549.362s">But</a>  it also dictates how many folks we need to notice every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2556.108s">If</a>  you're lucky enough to get a notice this year, you'll know what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2558.81s">A</a>  lot of people did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2561.211s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2562.863s">So</a>  just to take one big step back, this all is a result of the lead and copper rule that the EPA has been instituting over a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2571.888s">This</a>  is a revision to the lead and copper rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2575.55s">And</a>  that revision includes the mandate to remove the lead lines fully, as well as to send a notice to everybody that may have one, either unknown or definitely lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2589.593s">So</a>  that's something that we have to do now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2592.334s">The</a>  deadlines for this are pretty rigorous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2595.916s">We</a>  have a deadline that is 2032 to see if we can get everything, all the lead out of our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2603.3s">So</a>  that's our target is 2032 to have a lead-free service line city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2611.104s">Now,</a>  the $8 million is probably not enough to get us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2614.105s">So</a>  during year three of this three-year push, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2618.812s">evaluating</a>  what we have left, and then figuring out how to fund what we have left. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2625.305s">We</a>  have tried different ways to fund this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2627.907s">And</a>  this was kind of option C. Option A was a EPA grant for somewhere around $20 million that we did not get. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2640.156s">And</a>  we'll see how federal grant opportunities come about in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2644.86s">But</a>  we do have state revolving fund and we have MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2647.742s">So</a>  we're in good shape for the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2650.924s">So</a>  with that, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2653.367s">I'll</a>  let Owen talk and go over a few things, and then we'll be available for questions.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2660.714s">Just</a>  high level here is that we have about 14,500 service lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2669.402s">About</a>  a third of them are classified as lead, about another third is classified as copper, and the other third is unknown. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2679.331s">We</a>  have been working diligently over the winter to get this kind of working up and doing some investigative in the heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2689.467s">And</a>  what we've found is that of the <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2693.663s">Non-lead,</a>  100% of those are non-lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2697.787s">Of</a>  the unknowns, about 90% are non-lead, 10% are lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2703.993s">And</a>  of the lead, or that we have records of that are shade or lead, about 30% to 40% are lead, and the rest are copper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2714.163s">So</a>  we think these numbers will come down drastically. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2717.905s">We</a>  don't anticipate having 5,000 plus lead lines to come out, but there is a lot of investigative that we need to do and it's going to take time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2729.269s">But</a>  I'm here to answer any questions if you have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2732.811s">Happy</a>  to.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2734.572s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2735.012s">Just</a>  a quick question clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2738.553s">So</a>  we have what's on record and you're saying <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2740.942s">based</a>  on some early estimates, it feels like that, or some stuff that you've already looked at, the records are just not accurate.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2747.707s">So</a>  there was a fire in the early 2000s in the water department, and we lost a lot of the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2753.532s">So</a>  anything that is unknown, we have to classify as lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2757.495s">We've</a>  been working over the winter to bring that number down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2760.397s">We've</a>  gone through about <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2762.407s">500</a>  of new records visualizations going to looking at meters and going through our records and being able to eliminate a lot of those just with that.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2772.856s">But</a>  we have a meter program happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2774.878s">So</a>  if you swap so that gives us information on the inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2777.6s">So</a>  that's new information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2778.881s">Also</a>  new information is a test pit contract that we have out in the streets happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2783.305s">So</a>  about 620 <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2785.407s">test</a>  bits, and that is data that Owen is referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2788.51s">So</a>  we're seeing these percentages come up, which is why we're going to try to remove many unknowns using statistical analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2797.077s">Because</a>  what this data is showing us is that our numbers, say 5,000 leds and 4,000 and change unknowns, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2804.844s">okay,</a>  well, what is it really? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2807.106s">So</a>  if we take a sampling of data throughout the whole city, we can use that sampling data to then do a statistical analysis to see what we really have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2816.072s">And</a>  DEP, it will, you can use those numbers to make our requirements less burdensome.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2824.258s">And</a>  the NWRA really, really wants us to tackle this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2829.462s">They're</a>  really on board with us, you know, taking loans and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2833.605s">and</a>  making this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2834.865s">And</a>  it's mostly because of all the communities put together, all the MWA communities put together, there are only 14,000 known lead lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2843.368s">We</a>  have 5,000 of those just in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2847.289s">So</a>  they are really, really eager to help us in any way they can.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2852.09s">So</a>  we're their top priority.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2853.791s">It's</a>  Boston and us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2854.811s">It's</a>  Boston and us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2855.732s">But</a>  Boston started a little couple years ago, so they've got a little bit of a head start, but we intend to catch up.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2861.028s">Just</a>  two more quick clarifications about one of my fellow colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2866.169s">Some</a>  of the slow money would pay for the analysis? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2868.75s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2869.23s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2869.65s">And</a>  then the rest of it would go towards the removal and replacement.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2873.251s">The</a>  bulk of it would go towards a contract for testing and removals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2879.333s">And</a>  soft costs, maybe 10% of it is going to go towards engineering and the like.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2884.254s">And</a>  the statistical analysis is in that 10%? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2885.734s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2886.655s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2888.678s">These</a>  loans will be repaid by the rate payers or the taxpayers?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2893.64s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2893.88s">So</a>  about $6 million of this, if we use it the way that we just described, $6 million of it will have to be paid back over 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2900.122s">It</a>  will be on the rate payers and 0%.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2902.003s">Through</a>  the Enterprise Fund only?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2903.704s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2904.144s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2904.504s">So</a>  this is a bond for the Enterprise Fund.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2906.505s">You</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2906.905s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2907.185s">It</a>  will be paid debt service to the Enterprise Fund.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2909.106s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2909.626s">I</a>  will go to yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2913.207s">Is</a>  this about what I just said? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2918.285s">Okay,</a>  I'm gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli and then you, and then Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2924.009s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2925.17s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2927.411s">Thank</a>  you to the both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2928.532s">I</a>  know that this is a daunting task. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2930.213s">That's</a>  one thing we talked about earlier, how we have so many department heads doing so much with so little. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2935.517s">So</a>  we really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2937.218s">I</a>  know that, is this the same, Mr. Hotel, we talked about the federal program and we talked about the lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2944.003s">Is</a>  this in the same vein with that funding or is it separate?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2948.522s">That</a>  was the funding that we were going for that we did not receive.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2951.703s">Oh,</a>  we didn't get it, okay.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2953.604s">So</a>  we didn't receive funding that, technically it's still under review, but of all the communities that went for that grant, zero got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2965.689s">So</a>  the MWRA is still like, they're looking for other ways as well.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2969.67s">We</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2970.711s">Fred</a>  Lasky's, I'm sure his line is, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2974.722s">hope</a>  that's that's copper so I know that again I think that the biggest thing again is when you talk about this I know we'll get phone calls from neighbors if they come and start doing this in the on the streets when it's time we'll have a plan in place with I know you've been super aggressive with the curb to curb or making sure that whatever we cut</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=2995.423s">that</a>  the road is replaced at a reasonable, uh, you know, so with this, with this loan, we're going to focus on EJ communities first and try to target those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3007.785s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3008.385s">And</a>  that's where we're going to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3009.625s">And</a>  then we're going to move out.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3011.186s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3011.326s">So</a>  there'll be a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3012.106s">So</a>  people understand when it comes out to their end. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3014.546s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3015.326s">So</a>  again, I thank you for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3017.287s">This</a>  is something that we need and it's something, especially as you're hearing throughout the, you know, throughout the country, when you hear about lead, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3024.594s">you</a>  know, let in the water and people getting nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3026.755s">I</a>  think that it's a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3028.676s">So</a>  we appreciate that and how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3030.796s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3032.277s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3032.597s">Just</a>  quick clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3033.697s">Did</a>  the denial start coming out?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3035.798s">Not</a>  yet.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3036.739s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3036.959s">But</a>  for, there was an October we got in, we revamped again, resubmitted, and we have not yet heard back because there was an influx of applications <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3051.982s">that</a>  were received in the last month until they reviewed all of them.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3056.246s">Okay,</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3057.667s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Callahan, Councilor Collins, Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3063.252s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3064.172s">Thank</a>  you for this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3066.935s">I</a>  got one of the letters, but mine was unsure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3071.459s">We're</a>  unsure if you have led or not, but I want to clarify some stuff about this because <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3080.605s">It</a>  was a little, the letter is a little bit confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3084.768s">It's</a>  so, it's not paying to replace the lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3091.633s">The</a>  homeowner replaces the service lines, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3095.216s">And</a>  it's a loan to help pay for, isn't it a loan that has to be paid back or the city pays to replace the lines?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3103.911s">So</a>  this loan, one of the requirements of the program is the city would have to remove both the private and public side if they're both led. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3111.658s">And</a>  if only one is led, we replace the one that is led. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3114.318s">So</a>  it's the cost burden is no longer on the homeowner.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3117.459s">So</a>  it's a different thing.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3118.559s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3118.879s">Our</a>  current program provides a $1,000 rebate to the homeowner.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3122.44s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3123.34s">So</a>  we don't know exactly what we're going to do with that program at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3127.901s">It</a>  will remain funded for the time being. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3131.782s">But</a>  it will most likely be phased out once we reach a point where it's no longer useful.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3137.583s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3139.57s">I</a>  didn't understand this is a whole new program where you're paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3143.393s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3143.834s">And</a>  that's why it's expensive.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3144.875s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3145.355s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3145.495s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3145.936s">The</a>  intent was always for us to do both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3149.038s">We</a>  never had the means or the avenue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3152.761s">And</a>  this is the avenue to do that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3155.784s">Amazing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3156.645s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3157.228s">That's</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3158.209s">And</a>  I understand why then it makes so much sense to get all of the information about what is actually, what the service lines are made of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3171.397s">My</a>  son had elevated lead levels in his blood when he was a baby because of paint in our house when we had work done on our house that basically flaked into his crib when he was like an infant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3183.566s">It</a>  was ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3185.727s">There's</a>  lead everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3187.582s">And</a>  it's all very dangerous, but it was just one incident and it never happened again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3192.065s">So</a>  I think that we probably, our water is probably okay, but all of these things are kind of so hard to figure out how to, you know, take care of your family to the best of your ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3206.134s">But</a>  I'm really glad that we have an opportunity here to try to mitigate some of these things in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3216.792s">I</a>  have a second question, which is, do you know if there, after the fire that destroyed all the records, if there's fireproof record-keeping, any changes made? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3231.66s">Great,</a>  excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3233.301s">Love</a>  to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3234.061s">Thank</a>  you very much for bringing this forward.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3238.856s">Yes,</a>  I was wondering if I could just take the opportunity to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3242.319s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3242.739s">I</a>  just want to make it really clear that there's nothing wrong with people's water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3248.304s">Yeah,</a>  I think the conversation could turn alarming and it shouldn't be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3252.407s">The</a>  MWR does a great job treating the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3255.19s">And</a>  even if you have a lead line, the risk is still low, you should run your water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3260.734s">in</a>  the morning if you know you have a lead line and do best practices like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3265.478s">And</a>  the city does provide information on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3267.179s">We</a>  have the information online. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3268.92s">But</a>  this is in no way should spur any sort of alarming issues with folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3275.585s">The</a>  lead line has been in the ground, servicing your house for quite a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3279.588s">We</a>  want to get it out.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3280.849s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3281.269s">And</a>  I'm guessing you would agree with the statement that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3285.612s">The</a>  point of this is to avoid any potential future issue, not address a current issue of health or safety.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3292.918s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3293.278s">It's</a>  basically we're increasing the water quality for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3296.921s">That's</a>  really what this does.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3298.222s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3299.022s">I</a>  did have one clarifying question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3301.684s">If</a>  records were lost, I'm sure a lot of residents have had work done on their homes at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3307.469s">Is</a>  there a mechanism for them to communicate to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3310.471s">Like</a>  if they got a letter to say, oh, we had a plumber in, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3314.476s">we</a>  have a, you know, the plumber looked at the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3316.698s">Is</a>  that useful information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3317.679s">Is</a>  that information you can even use or is it just kind of hearsay?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3321.322s">We've,</a>  we've received those calls and that's what we've received since October, since we put the letters out and yeah, just call either a water quality hotline or, you know, and we'll take a look.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3336.696s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3337.176s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3337.636s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3339.9s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3340.92s">Thanks</a>  for all this work that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3342.961s">And</a>  I'm hoping, can you give us a little bit more of the big picture? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3345.962s">Because</a>  I know that we have like 125 year old water lines throughout the city and it's hundreds of millions of dollars for us to replace them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3354.365s">Can</a>  you fit this into the context of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3356.045s">I</a>  know that this is a specific APA project that has a deadline, but give us a little bit of context in terms of how does it fit into our sort of longer term plans to replace these aging pipes?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3371.233s">Yeah,</a>  I'd say it's a piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3373.114s">I'd</a>  say it's a piece, but it's a very section of the piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3377.035s">It's</a>  something that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3379.215s">It's</a>  very quantifiable, much more than the rest of the water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3383.596s">A</a>  lot of the water system, we find out when it's in bad shape, when it breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3386.837s">This</a>  one, we can kind of quantify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3389.017s">We</a>  know what to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3389.958s">We</a>  know what, how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3391.858s">So,</a>  you know, we've come up with estimates anywhere between 40 and $60 million worth of lead surface line removals in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3400.721s">Um,</a>  you know, that's what the numbers as they stand now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3404.266s">But,</a>  you know, as we've been saying, we believe those numbers in reality be lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3408.133s">So</a>  it could be closer to 30 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3410.617s">But</a>  it's definitely in the 10s of millions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3413.223s">And</a>  then as far as our entire water system and the needs of our water system, it's a separate need than, say, replacing old water mains that are breaking and leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3430.578s">It's</a>  very regulatory driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3435.241s">If</a>  the EPA wasn't making us do this, I'm not sure how fast we would move. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3439.506s">But</a>  for the water breaks, we're moving, you know, we need to move faster. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3444.39s">So</a>  I wish that the EPA funded us to replace all the water pipes and we'd move pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3451.656s">So</a>  anyway, so that answers the question.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3454.158s">Is</a>  it safe to say that like, this is just the very end of like the sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3459.822s">roots</a>  or tree branches or whatever you want to call it, of the water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3462.924s">So</a>  at this point, because of the deadline and the funding, we're going to be working at the ends of the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3470.368s">And</a>  that after that, when that deadline is no longer pressing, that we will move on to working to the rest of the aging water system.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3479.317s">both.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3479.737s">We're</a>  doing both at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3480.998s">Now</a>  this loan is for the end, the service is only, but we are still moving forward with our water main replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3489.82s">We're</a>  trying to ramp that up as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3493.761s">And</a>  whenever we do a water main project, we always replace the lead lines on these lines <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3500.175s">The</a>  targeting for water main replacement is more on a fire safety, pressure, head loss type of basis versus where the lead lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3513.72s">We</a>  want to make sure that people have water when it's needed.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3521.283s">The</a>  pressure is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3522.223s">The</a>  volume is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3523.004s">Those</a>  are the two big ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3524.864s">Water</a>  quality is important too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3526.747s">When</a>  we replace an unlined cast iron pipe from 1905 to a ductile iron pipe that's lined, that's an increase in water quality as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3536.852s">So</a>  I probably thought of a better answer to your question, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3542.294s">We</a>  have to ramp up all of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3545.949s">One</a>  of the things we're trying to do to get a handle on it is we have one of our consultants working on, I've talked about this, a long-term rate plan with the CIP. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3553.936s">They're</a>  wrapping that work up now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3555.477s">So</a>  basically it means taking our capital improvement program and then saying, okay, we think the rates for water need to grow at this rate in order to accommodate <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3566.807s">that</a>  capital program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3568.568s">And</a>  then we're also saying, well, what are we missing consultant, and they're telling us, well, you also have to do this, this, that, and that should be in your capital program, and this and should be doing this many miles, this many, you know, so <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3579.613s">That's</a>  coming, and actually I owe the Water Commission a meeting on this to see if we can make sure we have something lined up for this budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3588.357s">So</a>  that might provide a little bit more context to your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3591.859s">It's</a>  a huge task to wrap our heads around, but <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3598.027s">That's</a>  what we're trying to do right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3600.309s">It's</a>  something similar that we did with pavement a few years back, is to understand the problem first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3606.495s">So</a>  that's really where we're still at with water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3609.618s">But</a>  we know we have to do this, and it's very defined. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3615.604s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3617.746s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3618.167s">And</a>  just to, again, just for my brain to understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3623.253s">The</a>  MWRA is giving out essentially a 25% discounted loan for this purpose because the regulations are so stringent around this specific issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3633.778s">And</a>  that's what, like, if you could get this for mains, you would, but it's not offered because the regulations aren't requiring replacement of old mains in the same way.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3643.422s">That's</a>  a good way to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3645.182s">I</a>  wouldn't say it's all the way correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3647.904s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3648.224s">But</a>  it's a good way to think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3649.484s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3650.064s">What</a>  would make it more correct?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3655.055s">There</a>  is funding available for water mains. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3658.557s">It's</a>  just not forgiven. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3660.458s">So</a>  there's no 25% grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3662.24s">So</a>  we've come before, let's see, I forget exactly when it was, but a year and a half plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3667.843s">Last</a>  January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3668.523s">Last</a>  January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3669.084s">Here</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3670.064s">We</a>  came before you guys for approval for a $3.5 million bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3674.518s">that</a>  was going to be used to replace the Willis Ave water main, which is taking an old water main installed in 19-whatever to a new water main. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3685.763s">So</a>  that was funded through MWA program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3688.564s">And</a>  then the State Revolving Fund also provides funding for that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3693.427s">The</a>  difference is that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3696.853s">the</a>  regulatory pressure from the DEP and the EPA is what kind of sets us apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3702.595s">Also,</a>  the other thing that sets us apart is that if we continue to do it the way we have been doing it, which is we do ours, you guys do yours, and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3713.059s">we</a>  all walk away and it's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3715.02s">That</a>  they're finding out that that makes it worse for the homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3718.322s">So</a>  that's the other sort of circumstance here, which is why they're saying, okay, listen, we'll give you, if you take $8 million out, we'll give you $2 million of that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3727.467s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3728.328s">And,</a>  and the, and the bonds, the previous bond, it was zero interest, but there wasn't like 25% rebate or. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3733.451s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3734.231s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3735.972s">Councilor</a>  Collins and Councilor</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3740.766s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3741.767s">Really</a>  appreciate the big picture, the granular information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3746.892s">Thank</a>  you for all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3749.435s">Just</a>  want to go back to one clarifying question that I had from your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3752.437s">And</a>  sorry, I'm sure that you made this very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3755.24s">I'm</a>  just trying to keep track of the numbers you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3759.304s">For</a>  example, there's a certain thousand number of <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3762.48s">lines</a>  that are classified as copper, for example, and you said of that number of lines, there's a percentage that we know to be, that gave me the impression that even the lines that already have a classification, we're going back and double checking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3774.912s">Is</a>  that the case?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3777.074s">Where</a>  we're digging, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3779.176s">So</a>  when we dig down ones that are copper, are copper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3783.18s">We've</a>  never found one that is not copper.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3785.693s">OK,</a>  so it sounds like the trends are things that we think to be copper, broadly are copper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3791.459s">Things</a>  we think to be lead, broadly are lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3793.481s">And</a>  then it sounded like, and correct me if I misheard you, that most of the unknowns are turning out not to be lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3798.686s">OK,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3799.466s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3800.287s">And</a>  it also sounded like most of the lead, only 30% to 40% of the lead are actually lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3804.771s">So</a>  most of the leads aren't lead.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3806.537s">Right,</a>  you have to remember that our records date back to like, some of them date back to 1896. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3811.819s">Like</a>  they were initially done and then anything that was redone and we didn't have, we lost those records. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3820.761s">So</a>  we have the originals.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3822.382s">So</a>  you might have a record that says it was lead and then it was replaced, but that second record got burned in a fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3826.863s">So</a>  you're calling it lead, but it actually got replaced.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3829.163s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3829.684s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3830.404s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3833.241s">Thanks,</a>  just one super quick question, and I think you already said it, but if you can repeat, when would this work be completed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3841.326s">Approximately,</a>  do we have any ideas?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3842.867s">Yes,</a>  we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3845.289s">So</a>  the program that we're introducing today is three years, so it'll last three years, approximately. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3850.592s">But</a>  we have a deadline of 2032 to get our lead service lines out of the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3855.455s">That's</a>  a really aggressive deadline for this, which is why we're really hoping that those numbers that we just talked about, those two categories, lead and unknown, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3863.322s">really</a>  hoping the trend continues that 30% of the lead are actually not lead.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3870.106s">Can</a>  I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3870.867s">So</a>  I'm specifically thinking of some constituents who have reached out to me and like begged me for any sort of resources that they can do that they can possibly get for replacing their lines because they know they have lead in their water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3886.265s">Do</a>  you have any thoughts on should they just pay to do it themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3891.228s">If</a>  they replace their part, but then the other part isn't replaced, is that then possibly going to be worse? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3897.692s">What</a>  should they do, given that they're concerned right now?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3901.814s">Well,</a>  speaking as a resident and speaking as someone who also tested my children when they were very young, and they did have <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3914.99s">but</a>  in their system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3917.277s">And,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3920.098s">I</a>  have a water system at my house that filters it, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3924.141s">It's</a>  a reverse osmosis system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3926.023s">So</a>  that's probably the most cost effective way to do something on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3930.507s">But</a>  I would recommend that you, if you own a house and your house is worth six figures plus, you know, obviously most of them are around here, it's well worth your investment to spend the three or $4,000 it's going to be to replace, fully replace your lead service line with copper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3949.49s">well</a>  worth it, the incredible investment that you can make. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3952.373s">Now,</a>  if you want to wait for the city to come to you and do your whole line, you certainly can do that, and many people will do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3958.999s">But</a>  if you are a family with young children and our inventory says that you have a lead line in your house and you own your house, there are options available to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3968.567s">The</a>  cheapest one, like I said, is some sort of reverse osmosis system for your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3974.518s">Then</a>  there's, well, actually there's one thing cheaper than that, that's just best practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3979.042s">When</a>  you wake up in the morning, run your faucet for a little while, go through your fixtures, make sure your fixtures don't have lead or old brass in them, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3990.471s">So</a>  there are lots of very cheap things that you can do that are more best practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3994.655s">Then</a>  there's filtering systems that you can get. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3997.217s">And</a>  then obviously the standard, the gold standard is just replace the lime with copper.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4002.861s">It's</a>  so incredibly helpful.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4003.921s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4004.902s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4005.202s">And</a>  we offer $1,000 right now, and that program is active.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4007.543s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4008.623s">And</a>  I think also just should be noted, just to reiterate your point, it's not always the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4013.885s">It</a>  could be fixtures or something else in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4017.127s">Be</a>  systemic about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4019.168s">We</a>  just saw at the middle schools, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4021.449s">The</a>  lines are probably fine, but you had some fixtures with issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4024.11s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4025.41s">Usually</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4026.01s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4027.871s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4028.831s">Any</a>  further questions on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4035.234s">We</a>  can motion to approve for first reading or we can motion to approve for third reading with if there's no objection. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4041.157s">We</a>  can't do it with a loan or needs three. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4043.519s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4044.659s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4045.58s">So</a>  the motion would be to approve the first reading if there is one on the motion of councilor Callahan, seconded by councils are to approve for first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4053.205s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4228.519s">I</a>  have affirmative and negative motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4230.62s">Thanks</a>  you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4233.145s">25</a>  or three one submitted my brain occurred if we do this in one minute I would have bet with the clerk home real petition institutional master plans I respect the request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following home real petition and transmit the general court for their consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4246.636s">This</a>  is an act granting the city of Medford the authority to require the adoption of institutional master plan subject to the review and approval of the municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4253.622s">This</a>  is, I think, the fourth refiling of this Home Rule petition, and essentially would allow the city to require that large-scale institutional facilities, for example, a Tufts University, that they have to provide a master plan to the city, and that the city can impose institutional master plan review to regulate the use of land or structures for land owned, leased, or otherwise occupied by hospitals, healthcare institutions, colleges, universities, and nonprofit educational corporations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4281.805s">I</a>  will go to what looks to be Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4287.749s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4288.63s">This</a>  is something that has come up in a lot of recent discussions in the community lately, including but not limited to city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4298.777s">Such</a>  a measure if communities like Medford were allowed to institute mandatory institutional master plans would give us <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4308.224s">the</a>  greater latitude and authority that I think we all know that we need and deserve over the very large institutions that take up a lot of real estate and take a lot of land and footprint within our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4322.314s">I</a>  think a lot of people can recognize by gut instinct that a community should be able to have some level of mandatory at least conversation and co-planning with institutions that have such a large footprint in their communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4335.924s">Currently</a>  we are very disenfranchised and being able to enforce that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4340.547s">This</a>  legislation around institutional master plans which is something we're not currently enabled to do this home repetition would be asking for the permission to set up that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4349.088s">mandate</a>  that regulation would allow us to equalize the playing field with community partners such as Tufts University, other very large institutions, so that we can do a better job of collaborating or do the collaboration that we've been wanting to do all along on these issues that affect both the institutions and the communities like ours that host them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4367.337s">So</a>  I motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4371.219s">On</a>  the motion to approve by Vice President Collins and submit this to the legislature, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4376.202s">I</a>  saw your request, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4379.263s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4381.506s">Yes,</a>  I wish there were much more that we could do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4385.011s">It</a>  is really, I believe, quite ridiculous that we cannot actually get this without a home rule petition, which is almost certainly going to be denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4394.083s">We</a>  should be getting <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4397.5s">real</a>  estate taxes from these large institutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4401.564s">A</a>  master plan is really small potatoes, and it is quite frustrating that we have to do a homeown petition, and it is unlikely to be approved, but I am certainly in favor of this homeown petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4412.674s">I</a>  hope that it passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4413.876s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4414.77s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan, and I also am in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4417.913s">I'm,</a>  you know, continually frustrated by the exemptions that especially large institutions get from the basic processes and procedures that this community asks of every other member of the community, down to the 3,000 square foot lot owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4436.168s">Nevermind</a>  that Tufts has a budget <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4439.563s">of</a>  you know, many attend or more times the size of the city of Medford and endowment certainly bigger than any sort of reserve fund that the city of Medford has and the ability to leverage all of that to their advantage in addition to their legal protections. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4456.133s">So</a>  very supportive of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4458.134s">I</a>  will go to Councilor Lazzaro and then we do a public participation on this.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4462.972s">And</a>  just one thing I would like to add is that many of us in this community have strong opinions about a lot of things but but something it seems like we can almost all of us can agree on is that we think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4476.711s">it</a>  would be nice if Tufts University could come to the table and meet us as an equal partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4486.459s">It</a>  really brings our community together when we talk about stuff like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4490.703s">So</a>  it would be nice if the state house would also meet us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4496.267s">We</a>  would really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4497.368s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4500.131s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4500.871s">I</a>  will go now to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4503.814s">We</a>  have a hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4506.134s">name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4507.855s">And</a>  once I'm here, you'll have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4510.976s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4512.956s">Here</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4514.017s">Matthew</a>  Page.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4516.358s">Yes,</a>  Matthew Page, Lieberman and 15 Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4518.778s">I</a>  was watching this bill in the last session. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4522.04s">And</a>  you know, it was mothballed to go off to a study committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4526.461s">I</a>  reached out to Representative Barber last month <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4529.505s">about</a>  because she was the lead sponsor, and I reached out to the planning department about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4536.848s">I</a>  watched the hearing, which was two years ago for this bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4541.39s">Representative</a>  Barber spoke, Representative Mayor Lungo-Koehn spoke for our bill, and there was also Mayor Ballentine, because there's an analog bill that Somerville has. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4552.555s">Mayor</a>  Ballentine really gave some compelling arguments <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4557.422s">Our</a>  mayor said that the bill had previously been introduced twice, and our mayor was hoping that the third time would be a charm. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4566.149s">I</a>  think that when bills come from the administration or requests come to the administration or to the city council, I would hope that the administration would explain how they're going to try to do something differently elsewhere, you know, just <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4582.244s">re-asking</a>  for something, going through the motions and expecting for it to die. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4586.368s">Else,</a>  you know, our mayor may be saying, you know, this time, perhaps the fourth time will be a charm and not expecting anything differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4598.121s">We</a>  can assume that Tufts has lawyers, you know, that are lobbying <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4602.445s">you</a>  know, legislators not to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4604.846s">And</a>  it would be nice if perhaps the planning department would appear in the hearing and explain this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4610.689s">It</a>  would be nice if the administration were to be able to communicate to residents why this is important and also get residents involved to give testimony. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4621.133s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4624.255s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4624.755s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4631.09s">No,</a>  I owe the clerk one piece of candy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4636.554s">That</a>  man always has them and he's not here to defend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4638.756s">So,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4640.997s">On</a>  the motion of vice-president Collins, seconded by councilor Sang. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4645.2s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>
