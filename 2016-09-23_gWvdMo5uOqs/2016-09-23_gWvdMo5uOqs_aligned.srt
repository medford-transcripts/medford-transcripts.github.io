00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:20,594
Hello, this is DP reporting here in Mr. Tucci's office for our first edition of Faculty Friday with Mr. Tucci.

17
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,636
Mr. Tucci, how are you doing today?

18
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:23,957
I'm doing lovely.

19
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:25,178
Happy Friday to everybody.

20
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,980
And I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,080
Sure can.

22
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:31,081
All right.

23
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:34,543
So how are you feeling getting back into the swing of things of school?

24
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:35,944
How has it been going?

25
00:02:35,964 --> 00:02:36,904
Has it been rocky?

26
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:38,065
Has it been going smoothly?

27
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,841
So far, it's been great.

28
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:44,402
It's actually been really nice to see all the new faces with the freshmen of the class of 2020.

29
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:46,963
I'm very excited to start the school year off.

30
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:50,984
And September is full of awesome emotions, but a lot of excitement.

31
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:54,205
And overall, I think the school year has been off to a pretty good start.

32
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:56,666
We have an awesome senior class.

33
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:58,907
Like I said, the freshman class is looking good.

34
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:02,928
And I definitely know my juniors are ready to do awesome things this year, too, as well.

35
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:06,970
Speaking of the juniors, how do you feel about the junior class?

36
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,122
Do you think they're doing well with the transition to being upperclassmen?

37
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,011
So the class of 2018 has always been one of my favorites.

38
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:19,413
They're a very bright, young group of people.

39
00:03:19,553 --> 00:03:22,535
They're also excellent on and off the sports field, too.

40
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:25,598
They're very active with club and athletics and things like that, too.

41
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,399
So it's been a pleasure working with them.

42
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:31,382
Look forward to seeing them do awesome things in their junior year, because it's an important academic year.

43
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:39,228
We want to see them do very well and excel on and off the field and in the classroom and in their sports and in the band and in the extracurriculars that they're doing.

44
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:41,484
but we want them to enjoy it too.

45
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:48,851
So we have an exciting welcome back dance coming up at the end of September, September 30th, sponsored by the GSA.

46
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:54,497
And then we also have club and activities fair coming up on this Friday, which is going to be right outside the cafeterias.

47
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:59,122
So we hope that more people get involved with a lot of the great activities and clubs that we have to offer too.

48
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:00,578
That's great.

49
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:11,770
I know most of us here at the Mustang Report, we're all involved in different extracurricular activities, so it's really good that people will put themselves out there to try something new and hopefully enjoy it.

50
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,672
I have one more question for you.

51
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:17,977
I know this year we switched to a new system called School Brains.

52
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:19,638
How is that working out for MHS?

53
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:21,884
You know, it's working out.

54
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:27,248
You know, it's been a transition, you know, to learn a new system for our faculty and to also schedule students into that.

55
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:40,598
But at the same point in time, I think the long-term prospects of School Brains is going to help our students, our faculty, and our community and help us better communicate with the community how students are doing and also help you guys see what type of progress you're doing in your classes too as well.

56
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:45,742
So we're looking forward to getting to know the system more and hopefully utilizing it to its best capacity.

57
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,464
So look forward to a great year along those lines.

58
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:52,811
All right, thank you for taking the time out of your day to do an interview with us.

59
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,653
I'm DP, here with Mr. Tucci for the Mustang Report.

60
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:11,820
Yeah!

61
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:18,123
Go, go, go, go!

62
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:30,295
yeah oh my god oh no

63
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,621
What do we have?

64
00:05:59,142 --> 00:05:59,422
What?

65
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:00,983
I hear something, sir.

66
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:02,364
Region number.

67
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:03,726
That's the first of the shift.

68
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,027
It's an expectation here.

69
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,688
That's an expectation.

70
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:15,796
Yeah, to our offensive line.

71
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:16,477
He's in.

72
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:16,897
He's in.

73
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:17,317
He's in.

74
00:06:25,783 --> 00:06:32,317
Hi, my name is Karen Luchares from the Mustang Rapport and I'm here with Anthony McKillop, the leader and creator of the Stang Gang.

75
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:35,162
Anthony, can you tell us a little bit about what your club's about?

76
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:40,277
All right, so what we do is we get a bunch of kids from the school that want to have a lot of school spirit.

77
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:43,239
We bring them to two sporting events a week.

78
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,100
We get the crowd pumped up.

79
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,881
We get the team.

80
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,643
We give them confidence, you know what I mean?

81
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,504
We just pump them up with cheers.

82
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,245
We give them cheers.

83
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:55,448
We give them everything they need to get that dub, to get that win, all right?

84
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:56,308
That's what we do.

85
00:06:56,348 --> 00:07:00,631
I want to see everybody else here that watches this to the games, all right?

86
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:01,672
Tell me about singing.

87
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,372
You're wearing the shirt.

88
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:04,614
You've got to represent Stanging.

89
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:05,355
Tell me all about it.

90
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:10,398
We just try to get as many people as we can, get them to the sporting events, and go wild.

91
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:14,841
Just go wild.

92
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:18,924
Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan.

93
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:22,587
I'm here with the Mustang Report at Medford's High opening football game this season.

94
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:28,331
I'm here with Dr. Perrella, our headmaster, superintendent, Mr. Bellison, and student council committee, Ms.

95
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:28,732
Cuno.

96
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:30,193
How are you guys doing tonight?

97
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,159
Fabulous, it's a beautiful evening.

98
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,620
It's a great night for the band and the football team.

99
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,981
It's a great opening night to see everyone here tonight.

100
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,701
I'm here with the athletic director, Mr. Maloney.

101
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,162
How's your night going tonight?

102
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:44,222
It's going pretty good.

103
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:45,062
We have a good crowd.

104
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,302
The weather's fantastic.

105
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:48,023
We started off 8-0.

106
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:53,244
We had a struggle in the second quarter, but hopefully we have a better second half and we can pull this out tonight.

107
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:58,785
And I also noticed that they have been doing construction in the gymnasium, and I was just wondering what that was.

108
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:01,384
Yeah, we're thrilled.

109
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:06,346
Mia Burke, Superintendent Belson, the school committee and the city council got us some money.

110
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:10,488
We're getting all brand new baskets, all new pulley systems.

111
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:14,290
So at the end of next week we'll have a brand new gymnasium.

112
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,070
It's going to be beautiful.

113
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,551
It's so exciting.

114
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:20,533
I hope the basketball team will like it and we can obviously use it for the school too as well during gym.

115
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:21,541
Absolutely.

116
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:26,383
Volleyball will be happy, basketball will be happy, the phys ed classes and all the rentals.

117
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,464
It's a state-of-the-art facility once this stuff gets completed.

118
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:42,368
Hi, I'm Hallie Fowle and I'm here with Emma.

119
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,328
So Emma, how do you think the game's going so far?

120
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:45,369
I think it's going pretty good.

121
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:46,329
They're playing pretty well.

122
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:47,974
Do you think they're going to win?

123
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:49,415
I have faith in them.

124
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:50,495
I think they have a chance.

125
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:54,096
How do you think the basketball team is going to do this year?

126
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:55,837
I'm hoping we're going to do pretty good.

127
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:57,337
It's looking good so far.

128
00:08:58,177 --> 00:08:58,798
Sounds good.

129
00:08:58,838 --> 00:08:59,358
Thanks, Emma.

130
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,902
What are some of the advantages of joining the Stang Gang?

131
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:46,303
A couple reasons.

132
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:49,605
One, it's a great way to get involved with Medford community.

133
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:57,031
If you're a freshman or sophomore, you're not involved with any activity or club, this is a great way to connect with your peers.

134
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:01,835
Also, students will receive community service for every event that they go to.

135
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:13,967
We've been doing this for four years, the Medford Strong Motorcycle Run for the Crystal Campbell Scholarship Fund.

136
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:34,402
For you guys, the students of Medford High School, the scholarship was designed through the Medford Strong Motorcycle Run in Crystal's name with the sponsors and the bikers who come out today, they pay a certain amount to ride, $20 on each rider, and we get to put that money into the scholarship.

137
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:42,999
Now we'll cruise right by the Peace Garden.

138
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,601
I'm hoping to get 300 to 400 bikes to really make some noise.

139
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,442
I put a lot of work into this.

140
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:51,884
I couldn't do it without the riders, without the bikers who supported me.

141
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,726
Of course, my friends, give it up for my volunteers over here on the right.

142
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:56,967
There's too many to mention.

143
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:58,348
They always come out.

144
00:10:58,388 --> 00:10:59,788
They always do a great job.

145
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:01,649
Really impressive stuff.

146
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,613
And of course, the VFW for putting this together with us and everybody working as one.

147
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:15,479
So how excited are you guys for today?

148
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,441
I am stoked.

149
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:22,025
I got to kick it off last year when I was a candidate and now being there it's official.

150
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:27,569
So I'm really excited to kick it off and get them started and start it safe and start it tight.

151
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:36,457
And I'm excited as well because I think it shows that Medford is strong and Medford can get together and we're going to do something great.

152
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:53,135
and we're all excited and waiting for the opening of the Bristol Canyon Park and that's going to be another milestone for the City of Medford and just making everybody in Medford happy that we have an opportunity to remember those who were involved.

153
00:11:55,293 --> 00:12:05,801
actually next Sunday we're unveiling the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden and it'll be a very special and very serious offer in some ways and yet looking towards the future of faith healing and camaraderie and peace.

154
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:15,289
So we're really looking forward to next Sunday coming out at 2 o'clock at the Brighton-Memphis Queer at the CrossFit Hotel.

155
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,271
Crystal Campbell Peace Garden unveiling.

156
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:19,072
Thank you so much.

157
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:19,572
Thank you.

158
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:42,793
Hello, this is DP here reporting from the first Medford High varsity volleyball game.

159
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:48,175
I'm here with Bree, Lucy, and Tia, who are three of my fellow teammates on the varsity team.

160
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:51,437
So girls, how do you think the season's gonna go for us this year?

161
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,775
I think we're gonna do actually really good.

162
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:56,835
Our team's pretty solid.

163
00:12:57,856 --> 00:13:00,276
We're like a family, so I think we're gonna work very well together.

164
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:10,019
Yeah, we're like really excited this year and we're like, like Bree said, we're basically a family and we're all very comfortable and like our coach helps us with everything and it's just great.

165
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,201
I know we lost a lot of seniors this year, but I feel like it's still gonna be a great year.

166
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:16,701
New people, new team.

167
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:18,642
Let's go Mustangs.

168
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:20,748
I know, I'm very excited as well.

169
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,230
And what do you guys think that our strengths are as a team?

170
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,792
I would say helping each other out.

171
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:38,637
We all have certain strengths and I think each one of us helps each other out to figure out what we should work on and what we can do better.

172
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:44,293
Yeah, really coming together as a team and just giving it our all out on the court.

173
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:46,414
It's one of our big strengths.

174
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:48,235
Yeah, we mesh really well.

175
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,196
We know how to work with each other and how to help each other out.

176
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,716
So here's more of a personal question.

177
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:55,877
How did each of you get into volleyball?

178
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:59,138
Why did you decide to pick volleyball over any other sport?

179
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:02,061
My cousin actually plays volleyball.

180
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:04,906
She plays for Curry now as a sophomore.

181
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:08,152
And she kind of encouraged me to play the sport.

182
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:11,037
And I started my freshman year, and I immediately took to it.

183
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:17,872
Yeah, I knew a senior that was on the team when I was a freshman, and she was just super friendly.

184
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,634
And she said everyone else on the team was super friendly, like her.

185
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:23,255
And I just really wanted to be a part of a sport.

186
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:26,956
And I thought it would be a good way to make friends before the school year started.

187
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:34,859
Having my aunt and my mom and everyone really play volleyball, especially my aunt, because she played for Great Britain, it really influenced me.

188
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,701
I felt like I had to keep the legacy going of a great sport.

189
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:48,210
That's good, that's so nice to hear how different people like inspired you to be like where you are today with all of your success in volleyball.

190
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:55,677
Well I hope that the varsity team is gonna have a first, have a great first game and let's hope for the best.

191
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,199

211
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,622
Well, I mean, I've been playing volleyball ever since I was a kid, so like it's nice to take it like professional now.

212
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:56,194
I wish you guys the best of luck and I hope for the best of your game.
