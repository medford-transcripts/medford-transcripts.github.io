00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Tucci, how are you doing today?

18
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:23,957
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing lovely.

19
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:25,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy Friday to everybody.

20
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,980
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure can.

22
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:31,081
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

23
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:34,543
[SPEAKER_07]: So how are you feeling getting back into the swing of things of school?

24
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:35,944
[SPEAKER_07]: How has it been going?

25
00:02:35,964 --> 00:02:36,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Has it been rocky?

26
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:38,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Has it been going smoothly?

27
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,841
[SPEAKER_12]: So far, it's been great.

28
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:44,402
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually been really nice to see all the new faces with the freshmen of the class of 2020.

29
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:46,963
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very excited to start the school year off.

30
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:50,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And September is full of awesome emotions, but a lot of excitement.

31
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:54,205
[SPEAKER_12]: And overall, I think the school year has been off to a pretty good start.

32
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:56,666
[SPEAKER_12]: We have an awesome senior class.

33
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:58,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, the freshman class is looking good.

34
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:02,928
[SPEAKER_12]: And I definitely know my juniors are ready to do awesome things this year, too, as well.

35
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:06,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of the juniors, how do you feel about the junior class?

36
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think they're doing well with the transition to being upperclassmen?

37
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,011
[SPEAKER_12]: So the class of 2018 has always been one of my favorites.

38
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:19,413
[SPEAKER_12]: They're a very bright, young group of people.

39
00:03:19,553 --> 00:03:22,535
[SPEAKER_12]: They're also excellent on and off the sports field, too.

40
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:25,598
[SPEAKER_12]: They're very active with club and athletics and things like that, too.

41
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,399
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's been a pleasure working with them.

42
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:31,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Look forward to seeing them do awesome things in their junior year, because it's an important academic year.

43
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:39,228
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to see them do very well and excel on and off the field and in the classroom and in their sports and in the band and in the extracurriculars that they're doing.

44
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:41,484
[SPEAKER_12]: but we want them to enjoy it too.

45
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:48,851
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have an exciting welcome back dance coming up at the end of September, September 30th, sponsored by the GSA.

46
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:54,497
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we also have club and activities fair coming up on this Friday, which is going to be right outside the cafeterias.

47
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:59,122
[SPEAKER_12]: So we hope that more people get involved with a lot of the great activities and clubs that we have to offer too.

48
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:00,578
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

49
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:11,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I know most of us here at the Mustang Report, we're all involved in different extracurricular activities, so it's really good that people will put themselves out there to try something new and hopefully enjoy it.

50
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one more question for you.

51
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:17,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this year we switched to a new system called School Brains.

52
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:19,638
[SPEAKER_07]: How is that working out for MHS?

53
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:21,884
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's working out.

54
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:27,248
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's been a transition, you know, to learn a new system for our faculty and to also schedule students into that.

55
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:40,598
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same point in time, I think the long-term prospects of School Brains is going to help our students, our faculty, and our community and help us better communicate with the community how students are doing and also help you guys see what type of progress you're doing in your classes too as well.

56
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:45,742
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're looking forward to getting to know the system more and hopefully utilizing it to its best capacity.

57
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,464
[SPEAKER_12]: So look forward to a great year along those lines.

58
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:52,811
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you for taking the time out of your day to do an interview with us.

59
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm DP, here with Mr. Tucci for the Mustang Report.

60
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:11,820
Yeah!

61
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:18,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Go, go, go, go!

62
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:30,295
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah oh my god oh no

63
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,621
What do we have?

64
00:05:59,142 --> 00:05:59,422
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

65
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:00,983
[SPEAKER_18]: I hear something, sir.

66
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:02,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Region number.

67
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:03,726
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the first of the shift.

68
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,027
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an expectation here.

69
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,688
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an expectation.

70
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:15,796
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, to our offensive line.

71
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:16,477
[SPEAKER_10]: He's in.

72
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:16,897
[SPEAKER_10]: He's in.

73
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:17,317
[SPEAKER_10]: He's in.

74
00:06:25,783 --> 00:06:32,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, my name is Karen Luchares from the Mustang Rapport and I'm here with Anthony McKillop, the leader and creator of the Stang Gang.

75
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:35,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Anthony, can you tell us a little bit about what your club's about?

76
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:40,277
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so what we do is we get a bunch of kids from the school that want to have a lot of school spirit.

77
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:43,239
[SPEAKER_14]: We bring them to two sporting events a week.

78
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,100
[SPEAKER_14]: We get the crowd pumped up.

79
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,881
[SPEAKER_14]: We get the team.

80
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,643
[SPEAKER_14]: We give them confidence, you know what I mean?

81
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,504
[SPEAKER_14]: We just pump them up with cheers.

82
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,245
[SPEAKER_14]: We give them cheers.

83
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:55,448
[SPEAKER_14]: We give them everything they need to get that dub, to get that win, all right?

84
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:56,308
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we do.

85
00:06:56,348 --> 00:07:00,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to see everybody else here that watches this to the games, all right?

86
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:01,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell me about singing.

87
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,372
[SPEAKER_16]: You're wearing the shirt.

88
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:04,614
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got to represent Stanging.

89
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:05,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell me all about it.

90
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:10,398
[SPEAKER_14]: We just try to get as many people as we can, get them to the sporting events, and go wild.

91
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:14,841
[SPEAKER_18]: Just go wild.

92
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:18,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan.

93
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:22,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with the Mustang Report at Medford's High opening football game this season.

94
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:28,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Dr. Perrella, our headmaster, superintendent, Mr. Bellison, and student council committee, Ms.

95
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:28,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

96
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:30,193
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys doing tonight?

97
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Fabulous, it's a beautiful evening.

98
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,620
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great night for the band and the football team.

99
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,981
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great opening night to see everyone here tonight.

100
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with the athletic director, Mr. Maloney.

101
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,162
[SPEAKER_03]: How's your night going tonight?

102
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:44,222
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going pretty good.

103
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:45,062
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good crowd.

104
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,302
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather's fantastic.

105
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:48,023
[SPEAKER_00]: We started off 8-0.

106
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:53,244
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a struggle in the second quarter, but hopefully we have a better second half and we can pull this out tonight.

107
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:58,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also noticed that they have been doing construction in the gymnasium, and I was just wondering what that was.

108
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:01,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're thrilled.

109
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:06,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Mia Burke, Superintendent Belson, the school committee and the city council got us some money.

110
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:10,488
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting all brand new baskets, all new pulley systems.

111
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:14,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of next week we'll have a brand new gymnasium.

112
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,070
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be beautiful.

113
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,551
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so exciting.

114
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:20,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the basketball team will like it and we can obviously use it for the school too as well during gym.

115
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:21,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

116
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:26,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Volleyball will be happy, basketball will be happy, the phys ed classes and all the rentals.

117
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,464
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a state-of-the-art facility once this stuff gets completed.

118
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:42,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Hallie Fowle and I'm here with Emma.

119
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,328
[SPEAKER_06]: So Emma, how do you think the game's going so far?

120
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:45,369
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's going pretty good.

121
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:46,329
[SPEAKER_15]: They're playing pretty well.

122
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:47,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think they're going to win?

123
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:49,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I have faith in them.

124
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:50,495
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they have a chance.

125
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:54,096
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you think the basketball team is going to do this year?

126
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:55,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hoping we're going to do pretty good.

127
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:57,337
[SPEAKER_15]: It's looking good so far.

128
00:08:58,177 --> 00:08:58,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

129
00:08:58,838 --> 00:08:59,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Emma.

130
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,902
[SPEAKER_10]: What are some of the advantages of joining the Stang Gang?

131
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:46,303
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple reasons.

132
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:49,605
[SPEAKER_13]: One, it's a great way to get involved with Medford community.

133
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:57,031
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're a freshman or sophomore, you're not involved with any activity or club, this is a great way to connect with your peers.

134
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:01,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, students will receive community service for every event that they go to.

135
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:13,967
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been doing this for four years, the Medford Strong Motorcycle Run for the Crystal Campbell Scholarship Fund.

136
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:34,402
[SPEAKER_11]: For you guys, the students of Medford High School, the scholarship was designed through the Medford Strong Motorcycle Run in Crystal's name with the sponsors and the bikers who come out today, they pay a certain amount to ride, $20 on each rider, and we get to put that money into the scholarship.

137
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:42,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we'll cruise right by the Peace Garden.

138
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,601
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping to get 300 to 400 bikes to really make some noise.

139
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I put a lot of work into this.

140
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:51,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't do it without the riders, without the bikers who supported me.

141
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, my friends, give it up for my volunteers over here on the right.

142
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:56,967
[SPEAKER_11]: There's too many to mention.

143
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:58,348
[SPEAKER_11]: They always come out.

144
00:10:58,388 --> 00:10:59,788
[SPEAKER_11]: They always do a great job.

145
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:01,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Really impressive stuff.

146
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,613
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, the VFW for putting this together with us and everybody working as one.

147
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:15,479
[SPEAKER_19]: So how excited are you guys for today?

148
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I am stoked.

149
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:22,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to kick it off last year when I was a candidate and now being there it's official.

150
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:27,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited to kick it off and get them started and start it safe and start it tight.

151
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:36,457
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm excited as well because I think it shows that Medford is strong and Medford can get together and we're going to do something great.

152
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:53,135
[SPEAKER_10]: and we're all excited and waiting for the opening of the Bristol Canyon Park and that's going to be another milestone for the City of Medford and just making everybody in Medford happy that we have an opportunity to remember those who were involved.

153
00:11:55,293 --> 00:12:05,801
[SPEAKER_02]: actually next Sunday we're unveiling the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden and it'll be a very special and very serious offer in some ways and yet looking towards the future of faith healing and camaraderie and peace.

154
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really looking forward to next Sunday coming out at 2 o'clock at the Brighton-Medford Queer at the CrossFit Hotel.

00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Crystal Campbell Peace Garden unveiling.

159
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:48,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with Bree, Lucy, and Tia, who are three of my fellow teammates on the varsity team.

160
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:51,437
[SPEAKER_07]: So girls, how do you think the season's gonna go for us this year?

161
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're gonna do actually really good.

162
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:56,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Our team's pretty solid.

163
00:12:57,856 --> 00:13:00,276
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like a family, so I think we're gonna work very well together.

164
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:10,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're like really excited this year and we're like, like Bree said, we're basically a family and we're all very comfortable and like our coach helps us with everything and it's just great.

165
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we lost a lot of seniors this year, but I feel like it's still gonna be a great year.

166
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:16,701
[SPEAKER_08]: New people, new team.

167
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:18,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go Mustangs.

168
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:20,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I'm very excited as well.

169
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do you guys think that our strengths are as a team?

170
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say helping each other out.

171
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:38,637
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have certain strengths and I think each one of us helps each other out to figure out what we should work on and what we can do better.

172
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:44,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really coming together as a team and just giving it our all out on the court.

173
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:46,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of our big strengths.

174
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:48,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we mesh really well.

175
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,196
[SPEAKER_08]: We know how to work with each other and how to help each other out.

176
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's more of a personal question.

177
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:55,877
[SPEAKER_07]: How did each of you get into volleyball?

178
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:59,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did you decide to pick volleyball over any other sport?

179
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:02,061
[SPEAKER_04]: My cousin actually plays volleyball.

180
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:04,906
[SPEAKER_04]: She plays for Curry now as a sophomore.

181
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:08,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And she kind of encouraged me to play the sport.

182
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:11,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started my freshman year, and I immediately took to it.

183
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:17,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I knew a senior that was on the team when I was a freshman, and she was just super friendly.

184
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said everyone else on the team was super friendly, like her.

185
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:23,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just really wanted to be a part of a sport.

186
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:26,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought it would be a good way to make friends before the school year started.

187
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:34,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Having my aunt and my mom and everyone really play volleyball, especially my aunt, because she played for Great Britain, it really influenced me.

188
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt like I had to keep the legacy going of a great sport.

189
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:48,210
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good, that's so nice to hear how different people like inspired you to be like where you are today with all of your success in volleyball.

190
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:55,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Well I hope that the varsity team is gonna have a first, have a great first game and let's hope for the best.
