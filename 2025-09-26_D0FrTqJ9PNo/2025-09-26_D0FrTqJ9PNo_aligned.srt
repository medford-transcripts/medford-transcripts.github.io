Hello everyone and welcome to Method Happenings, a show farming about the city of Method.

00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:35,503

00:00:46,565 --> 00:01:10,751
And before I introduce today's guest, I want to take a moment to extend an invitation to any member of the Meffitt City Council, any member of the Meffitt School Committee who is a candidate for re-election, or to any new candidate running for office in Meffitt to appear on Meffitt Happenings.

5
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:15,754
You can share your positions on current issues facing our city.

00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:34,913
Thanks, John.

9
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:35,854
How are you my friend?

10
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:40,859
It's good to have you here George's Let's see.

11
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:44,243
I think you're the last guest but that means you're also isn't it?

12
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:46,805
The last is always the best job.

13
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:54,714
That's what they say That's what I said All right, so as usual we're just gonna get right into the show I

14
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:00,779
I know you have a lot to offer, George, so we'll get started.

15
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,420
Just, you know, give the audience a little background, you know, yourself.

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,561
Who's George Scott Pelley?

17
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:07,421
Sure.

18
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,621
Well, I'm George Scott Pelley.

19
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:12,342
I'm a father of two amazing kids, John and Gianna.

20
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:15,543
John's a senior at Merrimack in college.

21
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:34,574
finance and my beautiful daughter Gianna is a junior at Bridgewater State College and she's going to school to work with special needs students and I'm married to an amazing amazing woman Dina and we live up in the heights we live on Butler Street and

22
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:37,986
I work for the City of St.

23
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:39,707
Louis Parks and Recreation Department.

24
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:42,169
I'm the assistant director.

25
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:43,689
I've been there for 18 years.

26
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,913
Prior to that, I was a school teacher here in Medford for 15 years.

27
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:51,294
I coached

28
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:56,318
girls' softball and girls' soccer and boys' soccer and girls' basketball.

29
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:06,506
And on the side, I fell in love with the solar world and have a solar company, which I have as a passion.

30
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:07,726
So yeah, I've been very busy.

31
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,468
You're a busy guy, George.

32
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:11,249
All good things, by the way.

33
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:11,849
Thank you.

34
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,914
And the only thing I do have to ask you, George, add to it, how many years have you been reelected?

35
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:19,175
How many years on the council?

36
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,737
Because you've served a long time and you served well.

37
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,118
I appreciate that.

38
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:37,747
It's been a great ride and I know that when I left Medford I taught for 15 years and I was given an amazing opportunity to work for Mayor Joe Curtatone in the City of Somerville in administration and I took that opportunity and

39
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:47,155
It gave me another opportunity to come back and make sure I gave back to Medford and I think that's one of the reasons why I ran for office as a former teacher.

40
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,517
I wanted to make a difference in the school committee.

41
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:59,586
So in 2009 I ran for the school committee and since then I've been an elected official either in the council now for 10 years and before that as a school committee member.

42
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:01,388
And you've done a great job.

43
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,049
I appreciate that.

44
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:02,729
I have to say it.

45
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:03,310
Well, you have.

46
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,251
Thank you.

47
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:06,373
So you're running again.

48
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:13,860
Yeah, I'm not going to get into a whole ton of stuff here, but just real quick, you know,

49
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:41,316
what what do you can what's the reason what what do you consider the uh... important reasons for you to be uh... running again meanwhile well i think that most important peace john is that you know when you run you really want to get back to the community you feel you have something to offer and uh... that's why we do we do and i think that night i i commend all of all the candidates are running in my is city council is in school kid members because it's a it's not easy position but i will tell you

50
00:04:43,356 --> 00:05:00,663
In the last few years, the meeting has been a lot stronger, and it's given me a lot more energy and drive, and that's making sure that our residents in the City of Medford, every single one of them, not the ones that vote for George Scott Pelley, but everybody that calls or emails, that they have a voice.

51
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:08,846
That's something we've seen that has been lacking with this council over the last few years, and part of the school committee.

52
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:16,956
I feel like I'm obligated to stand there and fight and make sure that there's a voice for every member of the community.

53
00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:18,318
Okay.

54
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:19,339
Very, very good.

55
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:26,209
As a current city councilor, okay?

56
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:30,119
But we don't have an hour and a half, George.

57
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,880
So this is the question I got to ask you, though.

58
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,760
Listen, you've done a lot.

59
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:42,904
Give us a couple of things you're really, really happy that you did, accomplishments that were done.

60
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:50,147
Well, I think some of the big things, there's a lot of little things that I think that are more important than the big things.

61
00:05:51,327 --> 00:06:07,531
really picking up that phone when someone calls when they're in need, or helping someone that's homeless, or reaching out to a family that's in crisis because of immigration or other outside factors that they need someone they can trust.

62
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:09,071
And I think that's important.

63
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:13,512
But, you know, I hang my hat on some very important initiatives that we started a long time ago.

64
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:18,853
For instance, the creation of the full-time method parks and recreation department.

65
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:20,434
I think that's something that

66
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:28,359
we could see our families and residents of Method really taken advantage of, and it's something that was needed for years, and we've done that.

67
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:43,671
So, but, you know, there are so many others that, you know, as a team that we've done, you know, with Council Falco at the time and Councilor Carviello and Councilor Marks and Councilor Knight that, you know, a few years back we've seen a lot of

68
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:55,355
Unbelievable, you know the the library, you know, Councilor Carviello really started that and we supported him and Councilor Moxwell the Arts Council moving that forward So yeah, there's so much to be done.

69
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,356
I mean this previous council started the reclassification of the zoning.

70
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:00,597
I think that's important, right?

71
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:15,540
I think that we're in a crisis right now with our zoning process today that I'm sure everybody's heard about and a little nervous about, but, you know, that's something that needs to be revisited and needs to be redone, and we're here to do that, so.

72
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,200
Okay.

73
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,281
We're going to get back on that in a little bit.

74
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:23,842
Last Tuesday, 17 candidates ran in the primary election.

75
00:07:23,882 --> 00:07:26,522
I think that's a great thing to have, 17 candidates.

76
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:29,143
And they ran for a seat on the city council.

77
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:36,708
So we got 14 people will now be on the ballot for this November.

78
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:41,692
I gotta ask you, how do you feel about the election results?

79
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:54,741
First let me say it's it was I'm honored that I received 4,000 votes and that's a lot for primary right but also Realizing that as soon as I woke up Wednesday morning.

80
00:07:55,101 --> 00:08:08,030
I had zero votes again and I think that's important for people to understand because November 4th is when it really counts right and Where we are and why I'm feeling so excited about this process this time around is that?

81
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:20,545
people have traditionally run independent on their own and working on their own and asking for the bullet vote means that instead of voting for seven, four, five, that you vote for one person.

82
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:23,309
And that was the old traditional style of voting.

83
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,994
And we realized that my colleagues have woken

84
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:31,097
the community up and realize what happens when you run on a slate.

85
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,419
And that's what we've seen the last few years.

86
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:53,033
And when you have an elected body that has one vision, one purpose, and one ownership of one word, and that's it, and that's by contract, that whatever is put forth, that they have to work together and vote six to zero on that.

87
00:08:53,533 --> 00:09:02,661
And we've seen the negative impacts that you see in a community when you don't have an opportunity to have open discourse, to have an opportunity to agree and disagree.

88
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:13,550
And what I find really exciting is that we have now seven candidates left on the ballot that can agree to disagree.

89
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:21,237
I've talked to every single candidate, and I've met with them, and they're amazing people, and they're hardworking people, they're intelligent people, they're passionate people.

90
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:32,670
not to say that my colleagues aren't, but the one big difference is that the people that are running as independent voices are people that are going to listen

91
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:39,191
follow through with what people are saying and make the best decision for what they think.

92
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:43,896
Their individual thought, their neighbors, their community thinks is the best option for the city of Manfred.

93
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:47,118
Not what a national agenda tells you to.

94
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,160
So I think that's what I'm more excited about.

95
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,166
And I tell people, I've told people across the board as we started this process, there are seven candidates.

96
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:58,428
And if you appreciate George Scott Pelley and you appreciate the work that I've done,

97
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:08,984
I implore that all of you, stepping to that box in November, that you vote for seven independent voice candidates, because I think that's important.

98
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:17,169
We have to go back to the times when you could sit across someone in the rail, look them in the eye, agree to disagree, and move forward.

99
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:20,251
And I think that's a healthy engagement.

100
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,953
What we're seeing right now is total divide in our community.

101
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:23,614
You can feel it.

102
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:24,694
You can hear it.

103
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:31,523
You know, you're already hearing it already, the discourse of what this seven group is and who they are.

104
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:41,076
No, I'll be honest with you, all seven candidates, I don't agree in some of the things they believe in and vice versa, but that's okay.

105
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:43,018
That's where we are and that's where we should be.

106
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:44,418
It's what we need.

107
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:45,440
It really is.

108
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,124
We don't need rulers anymore.

109
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:54,132
We need independent people that are going to work for the residents because we're not getting that right now.

110
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:55,354
I agree with you.

111
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:57,758
I want to get back to the zoning.

112
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:03,830
Boy, oh boy, every year I go for a cup of coffee, someone always talks about zoning, zoning, zoning.

113
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:07,873
We're just looking, you know, George, give us some kind of an idea.

114
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,133
What's your position?

115
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:18,579
I mean... Well, I've been... I'm glad you brought this question up, John, because from the beginning, I was part of the process with the former council where we recodified the zoning rules.

116
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:28,485
Then as we sat together and decided, how do we craft an RFP to find a partner that can help us move to the next level of rezoning?

117
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:33,088
Because the truth of the point is that we need the rezoning.

118
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:35,270
We haven't touched this in many, many years.

119
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,491
It needs to be done.

120
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:43,956
And the process is really the number one piece that we had back with the previous council when we started the RFP process.

121
00:11:44,736 --> 00:12:01,768
We asked for a company that would partner with us, there's a city council in the city, that would put a comprehensive plan, outreach plan, that would go into the neighborhoods and meet with the neighborhoods that are being zoned, rezoned, and get their input and understand what they want their neighborhood to look like.

122
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:03,708
Unfortunately, we didn't get that.

123
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:25,513
Unfortunately, the first meeting with the new council, we explained this is the process, this is who we're hiring, and I brought it up in the meeting, and I was told that, well, that's not what we decided on, and the director and the city council president at the time decided they would write the RFP the way they did, and this is where we are today.

124
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:31,675
And it's been difficult to watch because if you look at all the votes, I don't support

125
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:40,301
I don't support any of the zoning initiatives as we see today for the fact that it's changing the fabric of our community.

126
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:43,403
You're hurting what makes this city so great.

127
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:55,892
We have great corridors that should be, that we need to rezone, that we need the mixed use, we need the increased density, we need to bring vibrancy back into some of the corridors.

128
00:12:56,933 --> 00:13:14,743
But when you talk about encroaching into the neighborhoods, the neighborhoods that made Medford what it is today, why people are moving to Medford, and you want to change those rules to open it up to densification that will then harm everything that built the city for what it is, it's dangerous.

129
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:22,448
And, you know, I look at my colleagues and we've asked to please slow the process down.

130
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:25,449
and I was mocked and disrespected.

131
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:26,649
Yes, you were.

132
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:42,536
I've asked them to have the partners to put together a zoning plan that would be broken down in layman's terms so everybody can read it and understand what it means, because it's very difficult.

133
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:45,617
I've been doing this for many, many years, and I find it very difficult.

134
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:46,137
I'm not lying.

135
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:47,118
I'm not a zoning expert.

136
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,819
So I find it very difficult, and I'm in this day-to-day.

137
00:13:50,539 --> 00:14:05,318
So it's been very difficult, and when I see my colleagues all of a sudden backpedal, I realize the reasoning is so obvious, and I hope people can see that, that

138
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:17,260
My colleagues decided to support the halt of the rezoning until we have different pieces in place.

139
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,745
Blaming themselves for not asking for more money and blaming the mayor that she didn't give them what they wanted.

140
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:24,287
That's not true.

141
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:25,128
No, it's not.

142
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:26,189
This is what they wanted.

143
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,210
This is what they got.

144
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,753
When I would say that we haven't had enough meetings,

145
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:55,368
our council vice president would respond by saying we've had x amount of meetings twenty thirty meetings just because you call it a meeting doesn't mean it's a meeting if it's not getting to the residents of the city of medford it's not being effective when we see what we're hearing now and i appreciate the mayor for slowing the process down because i think it's needed i think the community development board works very hard and they've overwhelmed i think that uh...

146
00:14:56,008 --> 00:15:01,153
trying to push things through so there's something that you could put in an election flyer is wrong.

147
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:11,043
And optimistically, I'm seeing a lot of positive reaction from our neighbors because they're standing up and they're saying, you know what, enough is enough.

148
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:13,726
This is hurting the fabric of our community.

149
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:15,768
This will change Medford forever.

150
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:19,389
If you want to live in Somerville and Cambridge, go live in Somerville and Cambridge.

151
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:20,530
This is Medford.

152
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:26,832
We have pockets that are just like those communities, and we should increase that vibrancy and focus on those areas.

153
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:39,297
But when you're talking about single-family neighborhoods, you're going to really devastate a lot of people, a lot of neighborhoods, and it would really change what Medford is, and that's not why people came to this community.

154
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:47,825
And this election, I'm just going to throw this in, but this election is really important because my gut is telling me if

155
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:56,394
the same group of characters get in, they're just going to push forward in February whenever, as soon as they can.

156
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:57,694
Well, I'll give you an example, John.

157
00:15:57,734 --> 00:16:14,519
I appreciate that you're saying that, but I hate to cut you off, but I'm so fired up about this for the fact that when Council President backpedaled and said that we are now going to go to the neighborhoods and talk to residents, let residents get involved, they had that opportunity.

158
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:17,060
They had that opportunity with Salem Street.

159
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,920
When the mayor

160
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:20,148
gave us that opportunity.

161
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:26,793
We had over 200 people at the Roberts School talking about what that neighborhood wanted to see there.

162
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,234
And they said they listened.

163
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:31,996
And everything that they put together went off to the Community Development Board.

164
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:38,501
And the Community Development Board looked at all these requests from the neighbors, and they've taken pieces and said yes, and they've taken pieces and said no.

165
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:40,222
And it went to the City Council.

166
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:46,447
And the City Council listened at one evening to all of these residents standing up for their community.

167
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:49,037
and it was going to move forward.

168
00:16:49,638 --> 00:17:01,116
As those people left, Councilor Lemming turned around and made the motion to bring back one of the most important pieces, the strongest piece of that change,

169
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:27,982
that would destroy the neighborhood of salem street right and the council agreed to move back when everybody left that just gives you an example what you said you're right they had that opportunity so just to say that now because they're getting this fear and it's an election year and now people are looking for wait a second i want people that know that know that want that haven't followed this follow the city council go to youtube in previous meetings understand

170
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:33,013
that this council had that opportunity with the Salem Street families and their neighbors.

171
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:40,323
And they had that opportunity to stand up and listen and say we'll move forward and we'll understand what the neighbors want.

172
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:43,106
And instead of doing that, they turned around

173
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:51,016
And they brought it back to a place where leave the families and the residents of Sound Street and fear of what their neighborhood is going to look like.

174
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:52,197
So thank you.

175
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:53,917
I thank you for that answer, George.

176
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:54,598
I really do.

177
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:55,038
Thank you.

178
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:55,899
I thank you.

179
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:57,379
Honest and truth.

180
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,201
You know, I just want to go back.

181
00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:07,211
We had recent overrides, two out of the three passed.

182
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:09,252
It's a done deal.

183
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:16,078
If I told you how many people still come up to me and say, well, it's only one year, it's only one year.

184
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,880
I don't know where they come up with that, but anyhow.

185
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,501
What did you think?

186
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:25,005
You're the expert, seriously, what do you think about the overrides?

187
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:31,533
Well, I think that people that have been following this know that I was opposed to this from the beginning.

188
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:36,619
And it's funny because I know the other side wants to tell you, see, he doesn't want to help the schools.

189
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:37,540
He doesn't want to help teachers.

190
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,241
He doesn't want to help kids.

191
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,102
He doesn't want to help families.

192
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:40,544
And that's totally wrong.

193
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,326
What I've said from the beginning with this override,

194
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:44,947
was let's slow the process down.

195
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:52,734
Let's put together a team of financial experts that'll guide us in making sure we're making the right decision whether we need an override or not.

196
00:18:53,414 --> 00:19:06,766
And if you look back and you watch the process and you see who's in that process, that process consisted of the city council president, school committee members that are all our revolution, the mayor's chief of staff,

197
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:18,772
And no one from the financial department in Method City Hall, no one from the assessors, nobody from the business community, nobody from the banking community, nobody from the education community.

198
00:19:20,352 --> 00:19:23,853
It was put out there to say that this is what they needed.

199
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:29,634
And as the process went on, and the override passed, very minimally, by the way.

200
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:31,494
It wasn't an override.

201
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:42,116
The understanding of what the impact meant to people that are vulnerable, our seniors, our veterans, our neighbors that are disabled, and what that means to them.

202
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:46,457
Well, you're hearing it resoundingly now that we have people that are hurting.

203
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:47,958
Our senior citizens are hurting.

204
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:49,598
Our neighbors are hurting.

205
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:56,043
It's not their fault they were blessed 50 years ago to purchase a home in Medford for $50,000, $20,000.

206
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:02,728
It's not their fault that the property value is now, you know, the house is now appraised at a million.

207
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:12,996
And the only way they can live in that home that they built and they created is that they focus on day-to-day cost and how they can survive.

208
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:19,819
not preparing our senior citizens, not preparing our community of what that impact would make.

209
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,181
You know, we heard it back then there would be only $40, only $40.

210
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:31,905
I had phone call after phone call, email after email from vulnerable residents of this community that saw $1,800, $2,400, $3,000 increases that needed to be paid now.

211
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,988
And we saw that because you see the people moving, you see people having to leave.

212
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:42,809
Not because they want to, because they have to.

213
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:43,729
And that's not fair.

214
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:45,029
No, it isn't.

215
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:52,552
And again, I know that you're hearing dialogue now because you spin the truth to make something happen.

216
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:56,129
So, we didn't want to help the schools.

217
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:57,049
Total opposite.

218
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,292
At the time, we had $23 million in free cash.

219
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:04,135
And free cash, again, is our taxpayers' money.

220
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:10,359
That's money that hasn't been used throughout that budget year for some reason, one or the other.

221
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:11,280
So, we had funds.

222
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:17,124
We had $4.5 million we could have put to the school, level-funded everything, and then gone to the process.

223
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:18,045
I only bring this up because

224
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:24,397
Back in 2008-2009, I was working for the City of Somerville, and I worked with Mayor Curt Atoni.

225
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:27,904
And they were investigating to figure out whether they needed an override in the City of Somerville.

226
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:29,146
What he did was...

227
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:34,239
He compiled experts, his team of financial experts in City Hall.

228
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:36,100
Assessor, finance director.

229
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:40,784
He had two bank presidents, a Sloan family and another bank president.

230
00:21:41,145 --> 00:21:44,828
He had financial geniuses from Tufts, MIT, Harvard.

231
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,031
He also brought in the business community and educated

232
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:52,200
neighbors that work in this field.

233
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:59,588
And they came to a conclusion after meetings, transparent meetings, that everybody knew what was being said, how it was being done.

234
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:03,032
And they figured out that they had to make a few changes.

235
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:04,654
They showed the changes.

236
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:09,736
and they showed how they can bring in some revenue, and they didn't need that override.

237
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:22,598
With that then came Assembly Row, and then with Assembly Row brought a whole new neighborhood, another tax bracket, more new growth, and the city flourished from there.

238
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:24,139
So we didn't see that.

239
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,760
And as we're talking about that override and where we stand, I didn't believe in it, not because we didn't need it,

240
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,721
But because how we got there.

241
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:32,041
Right.

242
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:32,681
Yeah.

243
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:32,921
Yeah.

244
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:33,662
But that's a key.

245
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:34,682
Yeah.

246
00:22:34,782 --> 00:22:35,843
It's how we got there.

247
00:22:36,363 --> 00:22:42,946
And unfortunately, I know a couple of people that long time, long time residents and it's they do.

248
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,288
They are struggling to keep up.

249
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:47,409
All right.

250
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:49,730
So we're all aware.

251
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,052
I mean, it's no secret the revenue in this city.

252
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:56,253
Boy, we need some growth.

253
00:22:58,891 --> 00:22:59,932
What do you do, George?

254
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:00,832
How do you fix it?

255
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:03,153
I mean, what do you do?

256
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:10,476
It's difficult, because if someone's going to say that, you know, George Scott Pelley and the seven independent candidates, they don't want rezoning, they're wrong.

257
00:23:11,276 --> 00:23:12,077
You need rezoning.

258
00:23:12,217 --> 00:23:14,818
And rezoning is important because of new growth.

259
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:24,302
When you look at corridors like Mystic Ave, when you look at corridors like Meffitt Square, that's vital space that we can use to bring in new growth to help fund this community.

260
00:23:24,742 --> 00:23:24,942
Right.

261
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:30,525
When you look at the rezoning, you look at densification, how dangerous can be.

262
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:38,831
When you see the tax bracket that could be increased, let's look at some of the projects that are about to kick off.

263
00:23:39,672 --> 00:23:42,514
You're talking about over 400 units on the Fouls Way.

264
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:47,098
You're talking about, oh, maybe two to three, 400 units at the Cappy site.

265
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,321
They're fenced around the Gold's Gym site on Mystic Valley Parkway.

266
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,702
You're talking about the GE site.

267
00:23:54,504 --> 00:23:55,548
There are so many sites.

268
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:56,771
There's so many areas.

269
00:23:58,095 --> 00:23:59,419
But the key is this, John.

270
00:24:00,723 --> 00:24:06,244
to create revenue, to increase our finances, it has to be done thoughtfully.

271
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:08,405
It's smart growth and development.

272
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:13,346
It's not, you know, affordable housing, densification, and throw it out there.

273
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:22,288
It has to be a process where we're meeting with the school department, you're meeting with the police, the fire department, you're meeting with the DPW, making sure that our infrastructure is strong.

274
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:26,850
These are the key issues that we need to know before moving forward.

275
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,270
Right.

276
00:24:27,671 --> 00:24:35,837
And it's funny, because part of that is, well, we're going to be asking, you know, two questions that were brought up, and you look in the future, well, we're going to need a new high school.

277
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:37,639
And we do.

278
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:40,781
No one's arguing about that.

279
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:41,562
No one is arguing.

280
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:49,749
And you're hearing the scuttlebutt from the other side saying, well, you don't want these seven, because they don't want a new high school.

281
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:52,372
Not one of us have said that.

282
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:56,194
I will tell you personally, we need to do something about Meffitt High School.

283
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:56,734
Yes, we do.

284
00:24:57,474 --> 00:24:58,355
The whole city knows.

285
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:03,757
Listen, if we're lucky enough for the state to come back and give us, you know, the old percentages, let's do it.

286
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:04,277
Right.

287
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,238
But let's look at refurbishing.

288
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:06,739
Yeah.

289
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:12,982
We might have to look at the whole process again, John, for the fact that if we're looking in to bring 2,000 new units in the city,

290
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:18,465
And we're looking at now, we're looking at a huge increase in the school population.

291
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:24,969
We might have to look at making maybe part of the high school, maybe a middle school and a shared high school now.

292
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:37,377
You don't know, but until everything is on the table, until you educate yourselves, educate the community and understand what the impacts are, bring all the people to the table, you don't know what that'll bring.

293
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,420
But you look at a site like the Budweiser site,

294
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:49,683
You want to talk about new growth and how we could have really captured a lot of new growth, but at the same time really given the community something great?

295
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:58,270
I looked at that and said about a year and a half ago, why isn't our community development director, why aren't we working with that owner?

296
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:05,436
Why aren't we looking at that land and saying, hey, wouldn't you like to see a Linfield Marketplace there?

297
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:17,583
mix-use would have been great businesses apartments community space recreational space it would have been a great opportunity instead what we have right now

298
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:23,602
We're going to be losing about $500,000 in tax bracket with the MBTA.

299
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:33,811
And then even worse, not even understanding the implications of the increased fees that we're going to have to pay to the MBTA because those buses will be housed in Medford.

300
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:36,093
So, you know, it's been difficult.

301
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:40,536
It's been difficult to watch because I've talked to my former colleagues that are

302
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:43,378
education leaders in Medford and teachers.

303
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:48,020
I've talked to family members that their kids are in the Medford public schools.

304
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:57,203
And if you ask them, not the school committee, not the people that are afraid to say the truth, but if you ask them, have you seen a huge impact with this override money?

305
00:26:57,543 --> 00:26:59,124
And the answer is resoundingly no.

306
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,605
No, they haven't.

307
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:04,686
We talk about the $500,000 for sidewalk and hot tub.

308
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:06,467
We haven't seen it.

309
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:06,767
No.

310
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:08,988
One thing I find disturbing

311
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:19,096
is that our community stood up and said, let's listen to our firefighters, because that's the only organization that stood up in strength and did what was right.

312
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:21,037
They didn't sit there and take something.

313
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:22,778
They said, stop.

314
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:32,285
This fire station is an inferior product, and all it is, it will cause Medford harm, financial harm, as early as two to three years once it's built.

315
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:32,865
Right.

316
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:36,709
So they supported the city and educated the city says do not support this and we didn't.

317
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:37,169
Right.

318
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:41,053
You know what's sad, John, we haven't talked once about what we're going to do for our firefighters.

319
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:43,975
That Main Street fire station is deplorable.

320
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:44,596
Oh, I know.

321
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:45,436
It should be condemned.

322
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:46,317
Yeah, I agree.

323
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:47,158
So I agree.

324
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,382
I know that our new facilities manager is doing his best.

325
00:27:52,957 --> 00:28:01,643
But you look at that override, and if you did it the right way, and you sat at the table with people, and you said, instead of 6.5, we really need 8 million.

326
00:28:02,284 --> 00:28:03,385
Let's ask the residents.

327
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:08,148
Would you commit to that extra 1.5?

328
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:11,650
I would guarantee you most people would have gone with that.

329
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:17,114
As a debt exclusion, that money would come back to you after that loan is over.

330
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:20,297
But when you look at the override,

331
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,871
It really wasn't needed at the time for the fact of what we had.

332
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:27,552
Because what do we have this year in free cash at the end of the year?

333
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:29,932
Over $25 million again.

334
00:28:30,973 --> 00:28:32,193
Now, I said it over and over again.

335
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:37,194
I'm not blaming anybody or accusing anybody that they're doing something funny or illegal.

336
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:42,676
What I've been saying for years is that this is blatant mismanagement of city funds.

337
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,716
And I've asked my colleagues on the City Council.

338
00:28:46,237 --> 00:28:47,357
I asked them for an audit.

339
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:50,199
And they threw it back at my face and they said, we do an audit.

340
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,324
Now the audit that gets done for the city, people don't know, every year our city gets audited.

341
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:56,066
But the audit is very simple.

342
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,390
The audit just looks at how many apples you have.

343
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:02,567
How did you spend, did you spend those apples?

344
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,308
And that's it.

345
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:26,052
The audit, I'm requesting, and I've reached out to DeZoglio's office to help with the state auditor, and asked for some guidance, and they said, you need the support first of the council, and then the mayor's approval, and they would come in with an audit, and look at the city's method, and you could see, where is the money going, how are we spending it, why didn't we spend it?

346
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:27,913
And I think that's the key.

347
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,053
It needs to be done.

348
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:31,734
It's important, George.

349
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:32,874
No, it needs to be done.

350
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:38,897
I hear you, and hopefully a lot more people are going to hear you too, George.

351
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:47,441
The council, you know, the council, the way you guys meet now, George,

352
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:51,990
No, I'm just asking.

353
00:29:52,030 --> 00:30:02,418
I have to ask it because... John, when this came forth that we would cut our meetings instead of weekly to go bi-weekly...

354
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,163
I made a recommendation that we wouldn't do that.

355
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:11,346
I then made the recommendation that if we're only going to work half of the month, we should only get paid for that.

356
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:11,866
Right.

357
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:15,729
Some of the council members said that we can't do that because they've got to pay their rent.

358
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:16,509
Yeah, right.

359
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:17,330
Yep, yep.

360
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:17,890
I remember that.

361
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,690
This isn't about money.

362
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,033
To work in a city council, if you're working for money, you're doing it for the wrong reasons.

363
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:26,675
Now, when you look at the situation we are, think about it.

364
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:31,158
You have one day every two weeks.

365
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:41,329
You have a podium that my former colleagues educated me that made sure that I knew that that podium was the people's podium where people could speak.

366
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:51,260
I've seen the most disrespectful, disgusting actions by my council team, the way they treat people at that podium.

367
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:55,267
People can't express themselves freely.

368
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:57,047
People are afraid to come up.

369
00:30:57,227 --> 00:31:01,308
Or what they do is you'll have a very, very important initiative.

370
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:02,228
We've had a lot lately.

371
00:31:03,048 --> 00:31:05,009
And what happens, it gets pushed off and pushed off.

372
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:11,050
And then all of a sudden at 11 o'clock, 11.30, 12 o'clock at night, it's put in front of the people.

373
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:13,251
John, I'll be honest with you.

374
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:18,087
I said this in the past, that anything after 11 o'clock should be shut down.

375
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:20,148
Some people even mention 10 o'clock.

376
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:23,169
But when you're talking, the other night, 1.30 in the morning I got home.

377
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:23,169
1.30.

378
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,791
We weren't talking about, you know, we weren't talking about simple issues.

379
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:31,173
We were talking about major, major concerns in our community.

380
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,013
So we need to go back to that.

381
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:38,156
And I hope we have four counselors that are elected that we can look back and change the process back to where it was.

382
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:39,336
We need to go back.

383
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:42,017
And I've been to some of those meetings.

384
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:49,283
You know, you hate to say certain things, but boy, it's done on purpose, and that's all I can say.

385
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:49,683
It is.

386
00:31:49,963 --> 00:32:00,112
I mean, no one wants to say it, but the way it's done and, you know, my opinion, they just... They do.

387
00:32:00,412 --> 00:32:01,853
They shut down a lot of people.

388
00:32:01,913 --> 00:32:02,574
It's not fair.

389
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:04,955
They're not listening to the people.

390
00:32:05,816 --> 00:32:11,541
I want to get back on the charter.

391
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:13,549
very important.

392
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:18,994
Yeah, I gotta ask you, like, what's, I mean, they're huge.

393
00:32:19,514 --> 00:32:21,937
They did a ton of work on that, the Charter Commission.

394
00:32:22,237 --> 00:32:30,485
I gotta ask you, the revised charter, I mean, a lot of people aren't really sure what's going on, what's going through.

395
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:31,366
I mean, can you

396
00:32:32,488 --> 00:32:33,430
Well, there's a lot.

397
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,872
I mean, first, I'll be honest with you.

398
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:37,296
I was one of those city councilors that didn't support the charter.

399
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,179
I didn't want the charter.

400
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,982
I didn't believe in ward representation.

401
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,705
I was totally against it.

402
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:50,236
But then when you started doing your homework and getting more involved in understanding the process, you realize how important that is, especially in government.

403
00:32:50,956 --> 00:32:56,760
When you look at a charter to make sure that every quarter represented, and especially as you change, right?

404
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,985
We have a lot of new residents in the city of Medford, and they've come from communities where they've always had that representative that lived in their backyard.

405
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:05,906
Oh yeah, that's true.

406
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:09,948
And a lot of new residents don't feel comfortable because they don't know who that person is.

407
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:11,829
They don't know they can reach out to everybody.

408
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,270
Right.

409
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,983
But more importantly, I realized how it supports the diversity of our community.

410
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:29,691
It really looks at those people that really want to get involved in their neighborhood, that don't have the finances, that don't have the time, that don't have the ability to reach citywide.

411
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:50,971
right and i think that's why slates work that's why the revolution works yeah because when you're talking citywide you're working as a team you're funded you have a lot of money and it's easy for you right yeah but when you look at ward representation you don't have to raise fifteen thousand dollars no you raise a couple thousand dollars you're knocking on people's doors you're talking to neighbors right

412
00:33:51,611 --> 00:33:54,633
Now, if you've seen the makeup of our council, that's true.

413
00:33:54,653 --> 00:33:57,955
It's been a lot of times it was mostly white men.

414
00:33:59,155 --> 00:34:01,076
And that's where it was.

415
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:03,698
As we're moving forward, you want to see that diversity.

416
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:06,079
You want to see more people of color.

417
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:08,240
I think everyone agrees with you.

418
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:11,082
We want people that truly represent our community.

419
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:15,505
And with the charter, my colleagues, I found myself

420
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,687
I called it that night, it was bizarro world.

421
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:28,875
I said, I couldn't believe that we had people like Milva McDonald and her team, and that was the Charter Review Committee, who did hundreds of meetings.

422
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:30,657
I'd say over a hundred meetings.

423
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:36,581
I know she laughs because it gets bigger and bigger every time we talk the story, but we've had over a hundred meetings.

424
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:41,665
Milva and her team have gone out and interviewed everybody, the sitting city councilors as well.

425
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:49,025
And they've all supported one major point, and that's ward and precinct representation.

426
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:54,407
That means eight representatives in each ward, and then three at-large members.

427
00:34:55,568 --> 00:34:59,149
And that, you realized, that's an exciting new change.

428
00:34:59,209 --> 00:34:59,769
We need that.

429
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:00,590
Absolutely.

430
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:05,472
So the council, I remember when Milva came out, and we had representatives from U.S.

431
00:35:05,512 --> 00:35:09,853
Boston that were experts in this field, and they shared all their information.

432
00:35:09,913 --> 00:35:11,154
I thought this was going to be a great night.

433
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:17,927
And my council colleagues stopped it because they now wanted to go to district representation.

434
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:19,634
And that's wrong.

435
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:23,737
And it was funny because I was getting emails from people that normally don't email me.

436
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:29,541
They seem to think they follow that dialogue because it's easy when you're on one side, they have to villainize you on the other side.

437
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:46,352
So they said, George, I know that we haven't seen eye to eye in years, but maybe we might not align politically, but I'm so disappointed with our members of this council that ran on the mission of eight representations, three at large.

438
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:50,129
And then when they came to that night, they changed it to district.

439
00:35:50,730 --> 00:36:01,479
And I found myself as a member, a former member now of the Our Revolution family, sent me my colleagues' breakdown of their mission.

440
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:11,587
And their number one mission, one of their number one missions, last election term, was the charter review and ward precinct representation.

441
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:13,749
And I'm telling you, even today,

442
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,430
We need it.

443
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:18,793
People voted for them because of that reason.

444
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:24,456
Melvin McDonald and her team worked her tail off to make sure that we got all the information we needed.

445
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:26,017
The homework was done.

446
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:27,638
It was vetted properly.

447
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,539
It was put forth properly.

448
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,543
And I know they've made some changes and the mayor had to make some concessions that

449
00:36:35,143 --> 00:36:44,666
that my colleagues wanted, that I don't agree with, but you look forward to where we are right now, and I think it's something that people have to realize.

450
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:58,890
Not only just voting the seven independent candidates on November 4th, but also, if it's on the back of the page, wherever it is, find the question on the ballot for charter change, and please support the charter change.

451
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,391
It's just as vital.

452
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:05,196
Trust me, believe me, I think it's very important and I think people have to stand up.

453
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:20,491
I'm going to challenge all of my colleagues and future colleagues that we should come out publicly whether you'll support the charter and really spread the word because you have 14 candidates.

454
00:37:20,511 --> 00:37:21,492
That's a great platform.

455
00:37:22,092 --> 00:37:30,056
What a way to 14 people reaching out to all their neighbors and saying, hey listen, you might not agree in a candidate or two, but one thing we can all agree on is this charter change.

456
00:37:30,076 --> 00:37:30,697
It needs to be done.

457
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:31,637
It needs to be done.

458
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:32,237
It's vital.

459
00:37:33,478 --> 00:37:34,558
Great answer, George.

460
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:38,901
It's just been great to have you here.

461
00:37:41,742 --> 00:38:05,837
this is just something we ask everybody uh we're coming to the end of the show yeah uh real you know quick if you don't mind you've been around a long time you know every inch of the city if you had something you know your least and most favorite things uh that you like to do in the city yeah as it's funny as an elected official i will tell you the best part of the city is really talking to people

462
00:38:06,457 --> 00:38:15,651
And I think what you see right now is you see our firefighters, you see our police, we see our DPW workers, you see our teachers, you see the most vital members of our community.

463
00:38:16,683 --> 00:38:18,264
making sure that they're treated fairly.

464
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:32,111
Our working men and women of our community, our union members, making sure they're taken care of, because those people, if we're taking care of those people, then that group of people are taking care of us every single day, no matter what.

465
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:39,735
They're the first one running in a fire, the first one when someone's pulling a gun, they're the first ones when someone's passed out, they're doing the right thing.

466
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:41,356
They're taking care of our children every day,

467
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:42,997
And I love doing that.

468
00:38:43,817 --> 00:38:46,698
Now, it's funny, for fun, I'm a very simple person.

469
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:47,839
I love being home.

470
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:48,799
I love my neighbors.

471
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:49,640
I love my neighborhood.

472
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,861
I love my dog, walking my dog.

473
00:38:51,901 --> 00:38:52,601
That's a good thing.

474
00:38:52,761 --> 00:39:02,946
I love watching games, you know, watching the Little League game at Carr Park or going, you know, at Gillis Park or going up to the high school and catching a high school game.

475
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:06,208
You know, I miss it since the kids have graduated.

476
00:39:06,228 --> 00:39:08,649
I know my daughter Gianna still plays lacrosse at Bridgewater State.

477
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:15,193
I just love doing that because that truly gives you the true feeling of community.

478
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,855
You know, you're a Mustang, you're blue and white, and it means a lot.

479
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:19,596
We are.

480
00:39:19,696 --> 00:39:20,617
It does mean a lot.

481
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:20,957
It does.

482
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:22,098
And the football team won.

483
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:23,499
They won 20-0.

484
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:24,960
Coach Curley doing a great job.

485
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,181
Great, great job.

486
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:29,623
And I'll tell you with that, I'll give you a good example.

487
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:44,619
You might, if you're looking at wins and losses for teams, you can criticize any team, but what I love what the football team does, I don't know if people see what they do, but they have implemented a part that I think is invaluable.

488
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:59,906
They go out and perform community service all over this community, whether you're a senior citizen, whether they're helping the hunger, whether they're supporting the Kiwanians, I think that's what community's about and I'm so proud of them and I'm proud about schools and teachers and coaches, so I can go on and on.

489
00:39:59,986 --> 00:40:01,687
Yeah, there's a lot of that going on in Memphis.

490
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:10,249
That's all the good stuff, and it's good to hear someone mention all the good stuff, because there is a tremendous amount of good going on.

491
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:11,590
Yeah, we have a great community.

492
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,130
We do.

493
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:12,950
We really do.

494
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,510
We just have to find a way to come together.

495
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:14,911
Right.

496
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:16,791
And that's the most difficult part.

497
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:29,095
Listen, if that's with or without George Scapelli, we have to find a way to heal and get together, because right now, there are so many questionable initiatives that are out there that are really hurting and dividing our community, and we need to find a way to come together.

498
00:40:29,935 --> 00:40:31,756
It's got to be with George Scott Pelley.

499
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:33,496
Yeah, well, we hope so and I appreciate that.

500
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,257
We need George.

501
00:40:34,697 --> 00:40:35,917
We do.

502
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:39,439
All right, is there anything going on with you coming up?

503
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:40,899
This will be the last question.

504
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:43,260
I mean, anything going on coming up?

505
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,962
I'll be, you know, a lot of people said, geez, George, you've been a little stagnant.

506
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:50,683
And, you know, unfortunately, a couple of the candidates' nights, I

507
00:40:52,003 --> 00:40:57,605
I'm now acting as one of the managers that are overseeing the recreation department at Somerville.

508
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:07,609
Our director has moved on, so I find myself very busy at work, especially in the evening, so I find it very difficult to get out to some of these events, and I appreciate you doing this for me.

509
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:08,570
I want to thank you.

510
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,491
And your team, you've been amazing.

511
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,472
This is a great platform.

512
00:41:12,492 --> 00:41:19,115
And I hope my colleagues really take you up on coming down and sharing their input, because I think it's important.

513
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:21,036
So it's that dialogue that we need.

514
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:26,279
But I will tell you, I'm putting together a fundraiser soon, and we'll start meeting some people.

515
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,481
But my phone number, it's public everywhere, 781-858-0240.

516
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:34,229
Anybody can call me.

517
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:34,789
And they do.

518
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:35,850
Okay, and they do.

519
00:41:36,431 --> 00:41:37,692
You can ask my wife and kids.

520
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:38,673
We know.

521
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:52,664
But in my email, I use my personal email because it's easy to get me, and that's scarpg at comcast.net, or just send me a message on Facebook, and I'll be there.

522
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,085
I mean, I listen sometimes.

523
00:41:54,526 --> 00:42:00,551
It's not what people want to hear, but a lot of times all our residents want to do is talk to somebody that's listening.

524
00:42:00,671 --> 00:42:01,752
Right, yeah, yeah.

525
00:42:02,392 --> 00:42:03,413
I, you know, that's it.

526
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:10,259
I mean, the time, the show's overdrawn, but I can go on with you, you know.

527
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,904
Marco and Paul, I appreciate, in the background, doing all the hard work, but I appreciate you doing this.

528
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:21,488
This is important, and I beg everybody, if I can, one last thing is, please come out November 4th.

529
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:23,170
We need

530
00:42:24,122 --> 00:42:25,383
everybody to be heard.

531
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:39,393
We need you to look at the seven independent candidates that are not running on a slate, that are working independently with their own voices to bring what each neighborhood needs to see what's best for the city of Medford.

532
00:42:39,793 --> 00:42:41,414
So, I thank you for having me, my friend.

533
00:42:41,454 --> 00:42:43,536
Oh no, George, it's all our pleasure.

534
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:47,699
You've done, like I said, you have, you don't get

535
00:42:48,688 --> 00:42:51,570
enough pats on the back and what you've been dealing with.

536
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:59,376
No, seriously, the last few years, it isn't easy, but you've really done a great job.

537
00:42:59,396 --> 00:43:00,937
You've done a great job.

538
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:05,761
I'll take this again because I love the city of Medford and I want to be there for the residents, so thank you.

539
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:06,582
And we thank you.

540
00:43:07,402 --> 00:43:07,803
All right.

541
00:43:09,624 --> 00:43:11,606
I want to thank George Garpelli first.

542
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:19,315
for joining us on Method Happenings today, and of course for running for re-election, Method City Council.

543
00:43:20,435 --> 00:43:25,396
You couldn't get a better counselor, and I think a lot of people agree with that.

544
00:43:26,457 --> 00:43:37,780
Before we close, I just want to let you know we are looking for a few Method residents, or actually we're looking for a lot of Method residents, to appear on Method Happenings.

545
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:46,970
just, you know, just to share their views on what they expect from the incoming or the next city council.

546
00:43:48,311 --> 00:43:55,119
And if you're interested in doing something like that, you can contact us at Medford Happenings
