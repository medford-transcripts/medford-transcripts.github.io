1
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:51,106
Yeah, we're having a great conversation right now.

2
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:52,691
Tomorrow we're going to have this conversation.

3
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:28,685
Oh, there it goes.

4
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:29,005
Okay.

5
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:31,006
Um, thank you.

6
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:33,107
Oh, was I muted?

7
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:33,447
Okay.

8
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:33,927
That's great.

9
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:34,227
All right.

10
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:37,048
Uh, this meeting will come to order.

11
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:40,310
This is the public health and community safety committee, August 13th, 2024.

12
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,192
Um, uh, clerk, can you call the roll?

13
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,692
We have one member on zoom.

14
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:47,273
Yes.

15
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:50,154
Councilor Callahan said she's on her way.

16
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:51,982
Vice President Collins.

17
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:53,243
Present.

18
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:54,784
Councilor Lemmon.

19
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:56,044
Present.

20
00:10:58,826 --> 00:10:59,387
Councilor Seng.

21
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:00,087
Present.

22
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:00,868
Chair Lozano.

23
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:02,049
Present.

24
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,992
That is four present, one absent, and this meeting is called to order.

25
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:15,018
Today we are talking about 23-449 offered by Vice President Collins, resolution to draft wildlife feeding ordinance.

26
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:18,660
This paper has been in this committee for a little while and

27
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:27,349
The Health Director, Animal Control Officer, Code Enforcement Officers, and a representative of KP Law are invited to attend this meeting.

28
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:39,221
And Vice President Collins, if you would like to talk about where we have come since our last meeting and where we're going now and what we still have to discuss.

29
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:42,094
Sure, thank you, Chair Lozaro.

30
00:11:43,155 --> 00:12:01,741
So I, again, wanna thank the Board of Health Director, Director O'Connor, and Officer Hogan, as well as the Code Enforcement Officers for, I know Director O'Connor is on the call tonight, and other city staff gave some really helpful insight onto this ordinance between,

31
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:06,184
this meeting and our last one when the committee reported out some specific questions for them.

32
00:12:06,204 --> 00:12:07,284
So just thank you so much for being here.

33
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:08,685
Thank you for your time and your thoughts on this.

34
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:15,390
Um, at our last committee meeting on this ordinance, which I was, I want to say was in June.

35
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,611
It's either late May or June.

36
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:31,881
Um, we had just received the legal review of the draft ordinance, which just as a recap, I, uh, this committee authorized me as lead sponsor to write that, um, which I did pulling from example ordinances from a couple

37
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:52,708
communities, which it sought to create local ordinances towards the same purpose, which is essentially, you know, not to penalize anybody accidentally leaving some, you know, something tasty out for a critter one time, not to penalize your bird feeder, but just to create a legal mechanism so that if there is really inappropriate

38
00:12:54,409 --> 00:13:08,720
intentional repeated wildlife feeding going on in inappropriate areas, such as in a backyard in such a way that it is creating a nuisance or creating a health hazard that the city essentially has cover to go and help out residents in those cases where it is getting problematic.

39
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,804
So the initial draft of the ordinance came from other communities that created ordinances along the same goals.

40
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:20,128
At our last meeting, we reviewed some initial feedback from city staff.

41
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:20,929
We also reviewed

42
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,572
the legal opinion on that draft ordinance.

43
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:36,701
At the last meeting, we also motioned to ask several further questions of city staff, just to kind of run some of that legal feedback by them to get their take on it from an implementation standpoint.

44
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:46,248
So what I have prepared for tonight is a, I did a tracked changes version of the most recent draft

45
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:50,937
of the draft ordinance, which does have the suggestions from legal in there.

46
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:56,941
I also incorporated several of the suggestions that legal made, but didn't draft that city staff then went on to endorse.

47
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:07,847
So what I'd like to do, if this sounds good, is to, I'd be happy to walk us through the track changes version of the ordinance, just so we can see what was suggested by whom.

48
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:14,351
And then at the end, I'd be happy to, you know, entertain motions to adopt as much of the changes the committee agrees.

49
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,276
you know, we'd like to include.

50
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:24,781
And I think that, you know, we've had a really robust process so far of getting city staff feedback on this and hearing from residents about why they want this in the first place.

51
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:32,185
So I'd love it if we could kind of review all of the final tweaks and additions tonight, and then hopefully report this out to be reviewed by the full body of the council.

52
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:35,828
Wonderful.

53
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:39,650
Are you able to pull up the, yeah, and do the track changes there?

54
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,072
Yes, I will share my screen.

55
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:51,094
Please let me know if this is visible.

56
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:55,577
All right, looks like it is.

57
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:57,978
Okay, I will just start running through this top to bottom.

58
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:00,360
I mean, the ordinance is not terribly long start to finish.

59
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:05,564
Please feel free to interrupt me with any questions or if I should slow down or speed up.

60
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:22,490
So once again, this is the original version of the ordinance with modifications by KP Law and then further additions based on the legal feedback that city staff said they liked and endorsed and thought would find useful.

61
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,952
So I'll just go from the top, the purpose section.

62
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:30,013
I don't think this is meant to be deleted.

63
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:32,012
Purpose and intent.

64
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:40,199
I think Attorney Braun from KP Law thought that we should start with a really high level statement of intent.

65
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:47,166
The intent of this ordinance is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community via curtailing the inappropriate feeding of wildlife.

66
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:58,661
We then have some just slight language tweaks to the rest of that section, which was present in my initial draft of the ordinance, just kind of laying the groundwork.

67
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:15,326
We're doing this because, you know, obviously we share permeable boundaries with the fells, many other natural areas, but we want to make sure that wildlife are staying where is appropriate for them, where they are safe, and we are not doing things to inappropriately entice wildlife into residential areas.

68
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:28,491
We talk about the nuisances and health hazards that can be created for residents, how it can hamper residents' enjoyment of their outdoor spaces when wildlife are inordinately or inappropriately attracted onto those spaces.

69
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:38,615
And Attorney Braun included some additional color into that section here, saying it can interrupt their normal feeding patterns, cause nutritional issues, threaten their health, promote the spread of diseases.

70
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:44,217
So this is for the sake of animals, not just for the sake of residents and their enjoyments of their backyards.

71
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:55,913
Attorney Braun also added, this ordinance should not be interpreted in any way to interfere with the authority of Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife or any other state agency with jurisdiction over wildlife.

72
00:16:56,293 --> 00:17:02,418
I think for a lot of us that goes without saying that city ordinances are subservient to state level laws.

73
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:09,344
We have added a couple definitions into the definitions section.

74
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:12,287
You can see there's some minor language changes from Attorney Braun.

75
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:16,908
I'm just adding some other commonly found wildlife in Medford into our list.

76
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,633
We have definitions of what wildlife means, what feed or feeding means, and then what we've added.

77
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:28,938
Because further down in the ordinance, we reference bird feeders and that we exempt them.

78
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,265
KP Law, as well as Director O'Connor, thought it'd be very helpful to have a definition of what we mean when we say bird feeder.

79
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:51,651
We also later in the ordinance will add a section that has to do with the treatment of feral or stray cats or exceptions that make sense for people who are taking care of feral or stray cats and seeking to domesticate, neuter, and spay them.

80
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:56,273
So we also added a definition of pets just so that it's crystal clear what we're talking about.

81
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:02,715
Then we get into the meat of the ordinance, what is prohibited.

82
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:08,717
This is substantively the same as it was in June.

83
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:14,748
I just want to highlight two substantive comments that Attorney Braun from KP Law had on this.

84
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:20,469
Attorney Braun mentioned, it might be helpful to add an intent section.

85
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:36,093
I think something that you probably heard me emphasize verbally in previous committee meetings was that the point of this is not to, you know, create a way to ticket somebody who like accidentally leaves out something that an animal construes as feed and eats on one time.

86
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:36,833
We're not looking to

87
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:47,175
police people's behavior, or trying to distinguish between repeated inappropriate intentional wildlife feeding and stuff that just happens one time or accidentally.

88
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:56,978
And so following that suggestion, we added subsection B, whenever the animal control officer becomes aware that wildlife has been found feeding on any substance.

89
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:09,307
and the resident for the property has been notified thereof, any subsequent feedings shall be evidence that the feeding was with the knowledge or intent of the resident or the person responsible for the property.

90
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:21,396
So essentially that's saying it happens one time and it's enough of a problem that the animal control officer hears about it, he or she will first say, hey, it seems like this is becoming a problem, don't do it again.

91
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:27,241
And then if it happens again, when we know that notice has been given, then we can start that kind of enforcement ladder.

92
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:40,511
Attorney Braun also suggested, in addition, having to do with if animals are feeding on substances found within outdoor trash or compost receptacles.

93
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:45,734
And here it's, you know, a very similar theme.

94
00:19:47,675 --> 00:20:07,392
If animals are getting into, if a trash or compost receptacle is compromised and it's causing enough of a problem that the animal control officer or director of health hears about it, first they will just get in contact with the resident or property owner and say, hey, it looks like this is causing a problem that's escalated to the level of a nuisance, please fix it.

95
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:10,275
Then if they have the opportunity to do so and they don't,

96
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:20,654
you know, then the city does have a mechanism to intervene again, again, just to make sure that wildlife are not making a habit of inappropriately feeding in residential areas.

97
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:29,257
We then get into exceptions, and this is largely unchanged for the last time we reviewed this ordinance.

98
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,359
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit bird feeders.

99
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:44,364
However, if a bird feeder is determined to be the cause of a public safety threat or nuisance, then the animal control officer, health director, or code enforcement officers can intervene to have it removed.

100
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:47,685
But again, like the standard here is bird feeders are okay.

101
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,066
Bird feeders are not often an issue.

102
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:50,847
We also add

103
00:20:52,887 --> 00:21:01,891
or also we kept the exception that this has nothing to do with normal appropriate feeding of pets.

104
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:09,975
Again, it's the same thing as if your trash bin has a huge hole in it and raccoons are getting into it, that's an issue.

105
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:13,357
Ditto if you keep your dog food outside and raccoons are getting into it, that's an issue too.

106
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:15,238
But if it's not an issue, it's not an issue.

107
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:24,038
This is a new section that we talked about at length in our last committee meeting in June on stray or feral cats.

108
00:21:24,098 --> 00:21:45,047
I think Chair Lazaro raised an important point that she had heard from some residents essentially saying like, hey, there are people who, you know, for years have volunteered in the community to do the work of, you know, essentially trying to humanely bait stray and feral cats so that they can be neutered, vaccinated, hopefully domesticated, adopted as pets.

109
00:21:47,970 --> 00:22:04,513
Attorney Braun had some helpful language around this, and Officer Hogan and Director O'Connor also gave a lot of great insight on this, endorsing this exception and pointing to the feral cat caretaker ordinances in Medford's Code of Ordinances.

110
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:11,914
So we came up with this language to say explicitly no person shall feed any feral or stray cats with the following exceptions.

111
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:14,595
If you are registered as a feral

112
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:26,699
cat caretaker per this ordinance, you know, there's an exception for you, that work is registered, that work is fine, this ordinance will not interfere with you continuing that work.

113
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:36,582
It says explicitly this section is in no way intended to hinder the work of duly registered feral cat caretakers, and I think this is the language suggested explicitly by

114
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:45,807
Officer Hogan or Attorney Braun, this section shall not apply to persons feeding feral or stray cats with the express purpose of adopting and domesticated said cats.

115
00:22:46,908 --> 00:23:00,216
I think that these specific timetables and citations came from Attorney Braun, which points to mass general law on the topic of vaccination and domestication of feral cats.

116
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:10,205
And I know that Officer Hogan ran this section past, I believe it's Medford Kitty Connections, if I have that right.

117
00:23:13,886 --> 00:23:22,409
leader from that organization did mention, you know, occasionally, depending on the situation, we do have to sometimes feed feral cats for more than 14 days, depending on the situation.

118
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:39,636
So we just included here, if, if there's a litter where the feeding has to go on for more than 14 days before the next steps are taken, I know that the officer control officer and Medford Kitty Connections or other federal cat caretakers are always in communication about situations like these anyway, so that can go on at their discretion.

119
00:23:39,696 --> 00:23:41,877
And I'll pause because I see Councilor Callahan has a hand up.

120
00:23:45,137 --> 00:23:47,238
Councilor Callahan.

121
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:50,139
Thanks.

122
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:51,019
Just one quick question.

123
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,801
I don't see any mention of spaying or neutering, which I assume is intentional.

124
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:56,001
Sorry, I totally missed that.

125
00:23:56,781 --> 00:24:00,302
I don't see any mention of spaying or neutering these feral or stray cats.

126
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:01,643
I assume that's intentional.

127
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:06,085
It does say vaccinating, but it doesn't mention spaying or neutering.

128
00:24:06,765 --> 00:24:12,767
Maybe because of the intention of this ordinance being about feeding and not really about like

129
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,011
the other procedures.

130
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:22,373
I mean, the vaccination isn't really about feeding either, but that is often the intention of the capture of the feral cats.

131
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:31,036
But the vaccination against rabies is a more direct animal control, though so is spaying and neutering.

132
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:32,216
Yeah, that's a good point.

133
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:36,817
Did that come up in your discussion with Kitty Connection or with the animal control officer at all?

134
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:43,042
Yeah, thank you for mentioning that, because I definitely said that out loud, and I think I probably just assumed that spaying and neutering is something that is always done.

135
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:45,063
I'm not sure.

136
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:51,144
I've never, I'm not deeply familiar with the trap neutering.

137
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:56,245
I know there's an acronym, I believe it's TNR, but I'm forgetting what the T and the R stand for.

138
00:24:56,265 --> 00:25:00,346
Release, trap neuter release.

139
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:02,710
Oh, trap, neuter, release.

140
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,951
Oh, thank you, whoever that was.

141
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:27,471
I think in this case, I don't think that this ordinance should prescribe what goes on after the cats are fed and vaccinated, but I appreciate you flagging that, because I wouldn't wanna, I don't wanna say something inaccurate on record, not knowing what the protocols are after they are vaccinated.

142
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:30,817
So that's a major new section.

143
00:25:31,938 --> 00:25:36,061
The rest of this is pretty true to what we reviewed a couple months ago.

144
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:48,592
In terms of enforcement, the animal control officer, health director, code enforcement officers, and Attorney Braun also added police officers, are all authorized to administer and enforce the ordinance.

145
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:56,258
It is enforced according to MGL Chapter 40, which is true of, I believe,

146
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:03,227
all kind of non-criminal disposition of many of our regulatory ordinances at the city level.

147
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:10,482
We have the same kind of offense letter that we had from our earlier reviews of the ordinance.

148
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:12,343
The first offense is just a written warning.

149
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:26,391
The second offense, that's again, after the problem has been raised and discussed with whoever is deemed to be committing the violation, the $50 citation, and then the third and each subsequent defense is $100 citation.

150
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:30,214
We've also added the effective date of immediately upon passage.

151
00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:33,286
So I'll pause there.

152
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:34,547
Thanks for bearing with me through that.

153
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:44,596
And I, again, want to thank Director O'Connor and Officer Hogan and the code enforcement officers for reviewing this a couple of times as this was going through some suggested edits.

154
00:26:46,698 --> 00:26:48,079
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

155
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:50,881
I appreciate your thorough work on this.

156
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:54,825
I have one question about Chapter 6, Article 3, Section 6 through 110.

157
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:58,608
I may have missed this in your description.

158
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:06,550
the registration of feral cat caretaker, is that, sorry, is that our, that's our ordinance?

159
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,570
We already have that?

160
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,430
That exists already?

161
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,411
I'd be happy to pull it up.

162
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:10,691
Okay, no, you don't have to.

163
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:12,531
If it's already on the books, then great.

164
00:27:13,272 --> 00:27:13,672
It is.

165
00:27:15,272 --> 00:27:16,573
I love that for us.

166
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:19,185
Good.

167
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:21,026
So great.

168
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:24,148
So does anybody have any responses or questions or follow-ups?

169
00:27:24,168 --> 00:27:30,611
Do we need to change the language here in section E to include something about spaying and neutering or is it not?

170
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,112
It's neither here nor there.

171
00:27:33,132 --> 00:27:34,753
Okay.

172
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:37,474
Councilor Seng.

173
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:38,294
Thank you.

174
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,096
I think it's neither here nor there.

175
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:43,057
I think

176
00:27:44,571 --> 00:27:57,696
I mean, I think if it's needed, then the feral cat caretakers may be the ones who, you know, that might be part of their duty or they can, you know, could be in their duty to refer this cat to someone else, right?

177
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:03,203
I appreciate the work that Councilor Collins has put into this.

178
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:12,110
I can tell that she's put in a lot of work, communicated across departments, as well as community stakeholders, which I think is super important.

179
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:19,676
The notes that I had in previous meetings, just concerns about vagueness, all of that is addressed in this draft.

180
00:28:19,956 --> 00:28:24,319
I think everything's very clear, the timelines, the punishments,

181
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,342
the enforcement, I should say, everything is very clear, I think, and fair and just.

182
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:33,283
So I'm very happy to support this.

183
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:43,046
Do we have any motions on the floor about perhaps moving this to, yes, Vice President Collins.

184
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:44,566
Thank you, Chair Lozano.

185
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:45,827
I'd be happy to make those motions.

186
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:48,928
I did just want to, again, recognize Director O'Connor

187
00:28:49,958 --> 00:29:05,072
and I'm not sure if Officer Hogan is on the call, but if there's any city staff who were very helpful in crafting this, if they'd like to speak to any aspect of this or raise any final ideas or adjustments, I'd love to hear those before making the motions I planned.

188
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,142
Yes, Director O'Connor, thank you so much for being here.

189
00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:21,906
Thank you and I also want to thank Councilman Collins for all her work.

190
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:29,352
This ordinance is going to be immensely helpful to me, to my department, and to Pat Hogan.

191
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:40,422
So, you know, obviously it has been an issue as far as people wanting to feed wildlife, but it does cause certain problems and we know we have the rodent situation that we do so this will

192
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,823
really allow us to do our work.

193
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,105
And I want to appreciate that.

194
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:50,869
The only thing is at the end where it says the health director, the animal control officer, code enforcement officers.

195
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,073
Is there a reason why we took out other designees?

196
00:29:55,093 --> 00:30:01,018
Because I'm just thinking about the health inspectors who are the ones really out there.

197
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,241
Vice President Collins.

198
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:07,404
Thank you, Director O'Connor.

199
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:08,284
I'm glad you brought that up.

200
00:30:10,168 --> 00:30:18,035
So this is kind of interesting, because I believe in a lot of our other city ordinances, we do include, you know, ex-city staff member or their designees.

201
00:30:18,596 --> 00:30:31,908
Attorney Broad, in this case, offered a legal opinion that, in their opinion, according to, I believe it's MGL Chapter 40, Section 21D, is a, oh wait, I'm not sharing my screen anymore, hang on a sec.

202
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:58,460
Attorney Brown said, specifically, though attorney general review is not applicable to city ordinances, the AG has clarified that under chapter 40, section 21D requires that the bylaw identify the enforcing persons, this decision number 1096 from 2021.

203
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:08,844
If an ordinance allows a party to designate an enforcing person at a later time, it therefore does not identify the enforcing persons in the ordinance itself and fails to put the public on notice of such enforcing.

204
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:10,731
persons.

205
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:14,917
So essentially, this was also, let me try and frame that in human English.

206
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:23,210
A lot of our ordinances do use the language of, you know, say, for example, the director of

207
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:28,649
director of public health or their designee, this opinion says that's actually generally disapproved of.

208
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:45,846
I don't know that it's illegal or out of bounds, but it sounds like recent decisions have discouraged that so that it's crystal clear for the public who exactly the enforcer is to list all of those persons by title in the ordinance itself, instead of saying this department head or their designees.

209
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:47,868
So that's, you know,

210
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:54,651
I kind of like being able to assign it to a department head and say, you know, whoever they want to delegate it to.

211
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:57,272
I think that is really streamlined from an implementation standpoint.

212
00:31:57,692 --> 00:31:59,712
But by way of explanation, that's why that was taken out.

213
00:32:01,013 --> 00:32:07,054
So should we include health inspectors in that list of folks who would be enforcing this?

214
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:09,255
Yes.

215
00:32:09,335 --> 00:32:12,036
Is there any other titles from your office that we should add to that list?

216
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,923
No, that would just be it.

217
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:19,348
Sanitarians, I guess you could, is what their official titles are, sanitarians.

218
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:22,290
Sanitarians instead of health inspectors?

219
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:23,692
Yes.

220
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:25,013
Thank you.

221
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:48,958
And then further up in the ordinance where it specifies that only really speaks to only animal control becoming aware of the issue, should it also identify the other enforcing agencies or people?

222
00:32:53,547 --> 00:33:06,435
Yeah, I'm gonna do a quick search for where it identifies the animal control officer as the administrator and make sure that the health director and sanitarians are included and code enforcement officers are included in that list as well.

223
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:07,536
Thank you.

224
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,541
Thank you, Director O'Connor.

225
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:18,143
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

226
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:22,266
That's actually a good note for us going forward that we should be avoiding

227
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:28,875
using language like or his or her designee, because I think we do that a lot.

228
00:33:30,357 --> 00:33:33,241
And just be really specific about who is in charge of enforcement.

229
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:35,404
And that is good to know.

230
00:33:37,353 --> 00:33:41,134
So do we, yes, Vice President Collins.

231
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:41,935
Thank you.

232
00:33:42,175 --> 00:33:51,778
Yeah, unless there are any other, I would certainly welcome any further comments or questions from members of the public or city staff.

233
00:33:53,839 --> 00:34:03,062
But barring that, I'd be happy to make a motion to adopt all of the changes reflected in this draft changes document that we've reviewed tonight.

234
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:16,532
to adopt the additions, the deletions from city staff and legal review that were present in this draft, and then report that amended draft out to the city council.

235
00:34:18,613 --> 00:34:32,240
On the motion of Vice President Collins to adopt the edits and move this paper to the regular council meeting, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

236
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:36,059
Clerk, can you please call the roll?

237
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:36,779
To the next, yes.

238
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:37,039
Please.

239
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:37,220
Yes.

240
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:37,540
Yes.

241
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:37,640
Yes.

242
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:37,800
Yes.

243
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:37,920
Yes.

244
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,000
Yes.

245
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:08,706
Yes, that is five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, and the motion passes.

246
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:10,186
Do we have a motion to adjourn?

247
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:17,531
On the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Callahan to adjourn the meeting.

248
00:35:19,412 --> 00:35:29,298
Clerk, please call the roll.

249
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:29,638
Yes.

250
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:31,159
Yes.

251
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:32,880
Yes.

252
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:39,062
Yes, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, and the meeting is adjourned.

253
00:35:39,142 --> 00:35:39,483
Thank you.
