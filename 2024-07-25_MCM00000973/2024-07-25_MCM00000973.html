    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=545.586">Yeah,</a>  we are there every Thursday too, so with the Medford Family Network.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=552.531">Okay,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=555.794">I've</a>  only tabled there once before, and that was in June, so.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=559.196">Really?</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=559.757">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=561.081">Yeah,</a>  so maybe we can be all together over there, you know, and take advantage of the kids and the parents right there with Medford Family Network, you know?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=569.485">Yeah,</a>  where is there, do they, wait, do they have a table every week or is it just on certain weeks?</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=575.868">They</a>  have the space, they don't have a table, they have the whole space in front of where the band plays, you know?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=581.95">Oh,</a>  where the kids are playing.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=583.691">On</a>  the grass, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=585.292">Yeah,</a>  that makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=587.413">I</a>  didn't venture over there when I was table last time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=592.483">Um,</a>  yeah, we have the community table, which is up closer towards the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=596.306">Yeah,</a>  I don't know what mystic river family fun day is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=602.491">I</a>  just, I just somebody told me that that was happening at my opportunity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=607.575">I</a>  don't know if we have anybody who will be able to go there, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=614.42">I</a>  added it here just so we can keep track of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=616.542">Um.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=622.846">And</a>  then in September, there's the Missing Rivers celebration on September 21st.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=632.05">You're</a>  not going to, you're not going to be at the night out?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=637.473">That</a>  should light up the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=639.554">Oh,</a>  so I don't have a table for there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=643.175">I</a>  signed up to wait for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=645.576">Um,</a>  but if you guys have a table there, can I, can I bring my stuff to your table?</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=651.871">I</a>  don't see why not.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=653.792">I</a>  mean, you're forgetting that we asked.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=656.895">YMCA,</a>  everybody come on board.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=659.136">Yeah,</a>  so maybe.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=661.138">Ask</a>  Sophie maybe.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=661.738">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=662.859">No,</a>  because last year was just our office and the health department.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=667.843">No,</a>  but it's the YMCA Food Justice Council and we asked in person yesterday when we were here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=673.326">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=674.687">Sophie</a>  and Catherine, if they could have like share a table or have their like table next to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=681.588">And</a>  they said, yeah, so maybe if anything, we can just ask if you guys can both share a table or depending on how it works, we can add on to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=697.113">I</a>  mean, at the very least, we can just, I can just bring flyers instead of the whole big setup that I do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=703.5">The</a>  setup's nice.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=706.264">Yeah,</a>  they love their house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=710.288">The</a>  kids love their house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=712.691">It's</a>  an attraction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=713.792">That'd</a>  be good because that way people go there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=716.961">I</a>  liked your other games that you rented the other day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=719.664">Yeah,</a>  I know.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=721.485">But</a>  the house is a great idea because people start recognizing, well, it's the table with the house, you know, where the lady talks about climate change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=728.732">I'm</a>  serious. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=729.453">My</a>  kids always say that.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=730.874">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=733.576">The</a>  lady with the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=737.84">That's</a>  so funny.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=738.821">We'll</a>  be at the farmer's market again September 26. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=744.937">There's</a>  Run Medford on the 27th and the 28th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=748.438">I</a>  don't know if I'll be able to be there or if the coaches will be able to be there, but maybe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=755.561">And</a>  then there's Tufts Community Day on September 29th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=766.624">So</a>  I'm hoping to be there to talk to Tufts students who are generally renters about <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=774.383">Energy,</a>  I should say, and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=779.868">And</a>  then, sorry, going up through October 5th is Oktoberfest in Medford Square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=788.036">And</a>  our Harvesty Energy Festival is on the 19th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=795.482">Which</a>  is our big event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=799.69">Um,</a>  we do things like we do, we open up the inside of the wind turbine, so you can look up into the wind turbine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=806.694">We</a>  did that last time, no? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=807.935">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=808.855">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=809.156">It</a>  was in October. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=810.496">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=811.117">Last</a>  October.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=811.557">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=811.677">Who</a>  was behind the raw at Loma Glen? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=814.719">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=815.019">I</a>  was at Loma Glen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=815.879">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=816.3">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=816.64">I</a>  saw that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=817.18">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=817.34">It</a>  was really epic. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=819.101">It's</a>  always scary to go up there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=820.382">So</a>  I like, I've never climbed up there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=822.643">They're</a>  like insurance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=824.364">Do</a>  they let you?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=825.505">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=826.405">Okay,</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=827.146">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=827.426">I</a>  was going to say.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=828.246">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=828.887">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=829.54">Oh,</a>  and one more thing I don't have on here is I'm trying to schedule a electric vehicle showcase here at City Hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=841.27">It</a>  looks like either September 7th or the 14th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=844.613">Can</a>  I test drive? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=847.375">So</a>  what we're going to do is we're going to have people who work in City Hall and we're like energy coaches bring their cars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=853.783">if</a>  they hadn't been. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=855.344">And</a>  that way you'll get to talk to people about their own experience rather than talking to a car dealer who's trying to sell something to you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=860.986">That's</a>  very true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=861.886">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=862.026">Cause</a>  they'll be like, Oh, that's the best thing in the world. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=864.847">Cause</a>  you have no idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=866.007">No,</a>  you need to be real. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=868.228">Like</a>  I, I, I panic every time I see like the energy down and I have to go find someone, a place to get, you know, charged.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=877.331">I</a>  have a hard time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=879.632">We're</a>  also going to have e-bikes there too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=883.332">And</a>  I think we're going to have Blue Bikes to talk about their like options. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=888.356">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=889.397">That's</a>  cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=889.937">I</a>  remember, didn't we have, it wasn't there before Blue Bikes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=893.66">What's</a>  that line? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=894.56">It</a>  was line something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=895.861">I</a>  didn't know you had those in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=899.044">I've</a>  seen those before.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=900.064">We</a>  have them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=901.105">And</a>  that like, they don't be left around in my house or on my house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=904.568">That's</a>  why I know, like, I don't need it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=906.409">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=906.709">But</a>  I think- They're in the docking stations, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=908.951">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=909.792">Yeah,</a>  but people would live everywhere. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=912.738">Yeah,</a>  that was the problem, you know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=916.062">So</a>  did that company take over?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=918.365">I</a>  think they just pulled out.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=923.291">Well,</a>  I think the idea that you have a timer for that, and if you don't return them, you keep being charged. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=929.975">I</a>  think that was the way they found for people to return the bikes to their, you know, whatever location they have their, you know, section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=939.299">And</a>  I think that was helpful for the residents, because sometimes I will find in my street, you know, a bike is just sitting there, you know, on my sidewalk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=945.662">I</a>  mean, what's going on over here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=947.503">So</a>  I think they come up with a bad idea and took the business.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=951.125">Yeah,</a>  I think they found some of those bikes thrown into the harbor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=954.466">Really?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=955.686">What</a>  was going on there?</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=959.668">Brenda,</a>  about the events, are your flyers multilingual? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=967.21">Do</a>  you need any help with translations with any of the new ones that are coming up? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=978.264">Like</a>  the Brazilian event is coming up, do you have them in Portuguese that can provide those information in Portuguese? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=984.688">Do</a>  you need help with that?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=986.509">So</a>  we have the flyer, all of our Electrify Medford flyers in the different languages, in the four languages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=994.413">And</a>  then in terms of like advertising for like the Electrify Medford kickoff event, <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1001.822">Like,</a>  I have a little flyer for that that is not translated, but it's also not going to be in a lot of different places. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1007.586">There</a>  aren't a lot of things happening for them.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1009.448">Yeah,</a>  so just keep in mind, if you have anything like that, just send it away, you know, like, so we can get that done.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1019.535">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1021.096">Let</a>  me jump into the...

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1037.285">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1037.765">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1041.746">Yeah,</a>  I think that's it for now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1043.046">We're</a>  into our coming weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1044.147">And</a>  you guys all have access to this document, right?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1046.927">I</a>  thought I sent it out, but let me... <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1058.845">So,</a>  I'm tossing it into the chat right now for the folks who are online. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1064.548">And</a>  then I can email it out to everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1066.849">This</a>  is just an events calendar that I put together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1073.233">Okay,</a>  um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1075.854">For</a>  the elected by my from stuff, because the online city events calendar doesn't seem to be immediately quickly enough.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1082.197">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1083.518">We</a>  have to plan ahead more than that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1085.519">Um.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1093.501">I</a>  don't know, but for me, I feel like it's so like, it's awesome to have like that in our calendar.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1103.105">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1104.146">How</a>  we did it not for like the meetings or like, you see, go Climate Equity Council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1110.389">These</a>  would be really nice to have like too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1113.15">It</a>  might be a good thing for you to like take a look at these and see which ones you guys actually want to be at and add them to your calendars.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1119.353">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1119.913">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1126.222">Okay,</a>  so for electrifying Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1137.088">I</a>  am, so we have the intro flyers translated into the four languages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1142.871">And</a>  the way we're doing it is, so we have one flyer that's in English on one side, and then on the back, it's each of the four languages just in a quick blurb. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1152.228">directing</a>  people to the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1155.17">And</a>  then we have separate flyers with the whole thing in English on one side and then the whole thing in each of the languages, one of the languages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1162.275">And</a>  we have four different versions for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1166.818">Do</a>  you want me to give you copies of those flyers? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1170.3">And</a>  would you like me to email them to you or give you printed copies? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1173.702">What</a>  would be better?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1174.983">I</a>  still have to edit mine and make some changes.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1177.645">Oh,</a>  you do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1178.405">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1178.825">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1179.246">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1181.648">on</a>  there about me.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1191.876">I</a>  think it would be nice for us to have, you know, if you could email us because let's say if we are in an event, you know, and you're not able to come and maybe you can bring to some and bring with us, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1204.105">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1206.386">Natasha</a>  and I are going to be next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1210.99">Sort</a>  of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1212.632">uh</a>  making like boxes for each of us so like for events we're gonna have good flyers and everything from all the stuff that we need so that way we're able to like go so that'd be good for you know any event that we need we have that there so it's great to be able to put it on and if you ever want printed versions and you can't do it here for some reason like let me know and i can get them for you <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1242.837">I'm</a>  also getting, we have that decarbonization roadmap, which is like the, all of the information and for each person that we speak to, we pull out the relevant parts for them into a document for them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1257.484">We're</a>  getting that translated into the four languages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1261.41">And</a>  I got a quote back from Francis about it this week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1265.052">More</a>  expensive than I thought. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1266.313">For</a>  all four languages, it's like $1,800. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1267.793">Because</a>  it's a long document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1271.115">It's</a>  all of the information that people are going to be pulling from for the residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1279.339">But</a>  it's important that we have it in the languages, so I'm definitely going to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1286.923">But</a>  I was surprised that it was that expensive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1293.003">And</a>  then we're also going to, I figured out how to translate the forms in Smartsheet, the online forms where people can sign up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1302.626">I</a>  haven't done that yet, but I figured out how to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1306.727">Basically,</a>  you just have separate forms that are all pointing back to the same document, and there's a way for you to have them going into the same fields, but there's a descriptor <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1321.195">thing</a>  there that you can change for each one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1323.496">So</a>  the name of the field is the same, but the descriptor that people actually see on the front end is from a different language. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1331.538">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1333.839">So</a>  that'll be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1334.979">Once</a>  we have this, that was the one thing that I was really worried about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1338.3">I</a>  couldn't figure that out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1339.461">So</a>  that's going to work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1345.723">Oh,</a>  we've had 16 residents sign up so far. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1351.269">which</a>  I'm excited about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1353.611">I'm</a>  following up with them myself right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1355.732">And</a>  just for this first group of people to work out some of the kinks in the coaching process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1363.437">But</a>  then after this batch, I'll start assigning them to coaches. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1368.1">And</a>  there have been people who I've talked to so far who are looking for help immediately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1376.645">Either</a>  want to switch to a different electricity rate or find a way, <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1381.445">funding</a>  to help them with past year bills, um, or they're installing solar in their home and they want someone to help them like look at quotes that they got from installers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1394.739">Um,</a>  and we have 12 coaches who finished their training. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1400.005">Um,</a>  and there are others that are still finishing it up online. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1405.424">So</a>  I'm excited that we have so many who are trained up now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1407.945">That's</a>  really exciting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1409.166">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1409.947">But</a>  we don't, I'd still like to get Spanish and Portuguese speaking coaches. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1415.43">We</a>  do have one Spanish speaking coach, but she's not, that's not her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1422.033">She's</a>  not a native speaker. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1423.794">So</a>  I'd really love to get a native speaker of Spanish as well as a Portuguese. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1428.317">So</a>  she learned it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1430.078">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1430.518">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1431.038">And</a>  she's a social worker. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1432.299">So</a>  she uses it every day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1435.197">Um,</a>  but I would still like to get a native speaker.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1439.619">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1441.099">So,</a>  if, you know, anybody who might be interested to speak Spanish or speaks Portuguese, please let me know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1446.761">We</a>  still like, onboarding coaches as we go on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1454.164">Do</a>  you have a. Where, like, we can send it to someone like the info. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1462.245">Oh,</a>  yes, there's a sign up form for coaches.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1466.707">You're</a>  all set with Haitians.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1468.787">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1475.55">I</a>  don't have it in front of me right now, but I will email you the sign up for just that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1481.972">I</a>  don't know if you know, but we're. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1488.194">Chairman,</a>  I mean.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1492.712">We're</a>  creating our own, like, Facebook page. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1496.555">So</a>  that way, like, we can, like.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1503.582">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1504.202">When</a>  do you think that will be on Wednesday?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1506.484">We</a>  have a meeting, so we'll see how that goes.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1509.187">Oh,</a>  a couple of things I noted down here.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1518.868">Thank</a>  you for the recommendation to bring more to events in addition to the forms for people to sign up later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1524.873">That</a>  was definitely more helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1528.456">We're</a>  not collecting all of the information that we need to with the online form, but we are having more people sign up for it, so that's awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1537.904">And</a>  we are in process of getting an Electrify Medford banner for events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1550.665">Moving</a>  on from Electrify Medford, curbside composting, we've had over 4,000 people sign up for the program.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1557.908">I</a>  have a question on that.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1559.548">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1560.109">Is</a>  it too late to register people?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1561.669">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1562.049">Because</a>  I have a homeowner that I was explaining, so I didn't know anything about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1566.931">I'm</a>  not even going to read. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1568.111">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1568.372">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1568.692">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1572.093">Right</a>  now, it is only for people in one- to four-unit homes, so sometimes people <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1578.304">might</a>  not have heard about it because they're in a larger apartment building or something but like a two-family oh no two families great yeah yeah two families don't work for this yeah in eight like five units or above the city considers that a commercial building and so the city doesn't do a waste services for commercial buildings um i have some door knockers like door hangers upstairs if you guys want to take some of the door hangers and <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1605.777">and</a>  distribute them, that would be really helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1610.719">And</a>  there's actually, although I think if you're actually going to go door to door to put door hangers up, they would want you to sign up for like a street or something, but yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1622.723">They</a>  have an online form if you wanted to sign up your street or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1626.424">You'd</a>  like to do door hangers on your street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1630.106">Imagine</a>  you just go down the entire map. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1633.959">take</a>  it out of there.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1636.34">I</a>  mean, that's what they're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1646.965">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1648.966">Well,</a>  I personally don't like people knocking on my door.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1652.908">So</a>  well, you don't have to knock on their door that you can just leave the door hanger. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1659.091">It's</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1661.361">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1661.661">Oh</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1661.941">You</a>  don't have to knock on the door. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1665.563">That's</a>  what I'm afraid of.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1668.604">She's</a>  even afraid of my smooch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1670.425">So</a>  after the meeting, like we can go upstairs and I can grab this for you.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1674.506">And</a>  people can sign up anytime. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1678.008">This</a>  is an ongoing thing.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1691.452">Can</a>  you grab some extra so we can give it to us on Wednesday when it's here at the meeting, if you don't mind?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1699.28">Do</a>  you want the door hangers or do you just want flyers?</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1702.123">I</a>  think the door hangers, I can give some.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1713.808">Moving</a>  on to EV charging stations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1717.03">So</a>  the police station charging stations are online. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1721.552">Those</a>  aren't public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1723.513">Those</a>  are just for the police vehicles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1726.174">But</a>  I'm really excited to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1728.455">And</a>  the police are now looking, we're looking at grants to purchase electric vehicles for them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1735.778">Not</a>  for the cruisers themselves, because those aren't really available right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1740.049">But</a>  for, like, the detectives' vehicles, just because they drive so much that it's a really great opportunity to reduce the emissions from those cars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1752.614">And</a>  we're also getting recommendations from National Grid for our entire fleet of vehicles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1760.137">So</a>  basically, we send them our inventory of all of our vehicles, and they'll say, here are electric vehicles that we think will <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1769.178">Be</a>  a good replacement for this, so we're going to replace this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1773.499">We</a>  can say, okay, this might be a good way to replace it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1780.621">We</a>  don't have any right now.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1781.781">Like,</a>  if we promote it, we need to.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1788.91">Yeah,</a>  I mean, staff have a lot of staff like, to be personally, but like, see, yeah, we do have that electric street sweeper. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1800.498">So</a>  that's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1801.359">That</a>  was our 1st.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1806.985">Those</a>  things are terrifying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1809.126">Stop</a>  it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1810.426">I</a>  went in one time and then I was like, you know, he was like nine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1815.228">And</a>  then I turned like I was getting salad and then I turned and he was like, mom, mom, turn around. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1820.149">Like,</a>  what's going on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1821.129">I</a>  turned around and he was right behind me, you know, joking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1823.23">I</a>  was like, I ran. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1824.77">I</a>  was like, bye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1827.771">Look</a>  at the environment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1828.752">It's</a>  just scary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1831.681">I</a>  don't know if the robots in the stores are not for the environment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1838.025">They</a>  put faces on them.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1842.588">No,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1844.409">The</a>  last thing for charging stations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1847.471">We're</a>  still waiting on National Grid to connect the West Medford parking lot station. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1852.354">So</a>  that has been installed for six months now or more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1858.544">just</a>  waiting for electricity to be connected to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1861.786">Then</a>  I think my last update is the school's HVAC project, the McGlynn and the Andrews replacements and then the repairs to the smaller schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1879.453">We're</a>  still finalizing the contract with the designer for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1883.195">We</a>  just did a walkthrough of the schools today with the designer for an existing conditions assessment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1890.559">And</a>  yeah, it's bad. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1893.681">There</a>  are lots of systems that have broken down and we're at least trying to get them repaired so that when students come back to school, they'll have some cooling in place.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1904.526">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1910.767">There's</a>  one time they didn't, they don't have a CVS, so they had to keep the windows. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1916.569">Oh,</a>  and it was horrible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1919.95">My</a>  son would come up.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1921.511">I</a>  feel like they should invest in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1925.012">I</a>  know there are affordable things you can bring in, but those are very expensive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1928.933">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1930.643">Um,</a>  there's a, there was a debate of, of, of, you know, if something does break down and we can't, you know, we can't fix it in time or something, are we going to bring in these portable things or what are we going to for those few days? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1945.228">But</a>  it's that hot when schools in session just have a, just cancel school.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1950.77">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1951.51">Um,</a>  because they can have a personal, like AC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1954.851">Like</a>  van.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1960.82">No,</a>  like for the window, like, you know, the window that you see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1963.743">Well,</a>  that was another discussion that we had to, again, very expensive and a very temporary solution. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1969.167">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1971.029">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1972.109">That's</a>  that's always the trade off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1973.751">Something</a>  I was like, no, I was pointing at my hand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1977.474">You</a>  know, we didn't get one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1980.216">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1980.717">I</a>  mean, they should and they should have it there for like, you know, when they need it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1984.76">Like</a>  is this come on, Brenda.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1990.22">Can</a>  you imagine having like 30 of those in a room? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1993.043">All</a>  you would hear was the buzzing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1995.325">I</a>  know, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1996.045">That's</a>  true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=1997.867">I</a>  mean, yeah, I guess.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2001.51">I</a>  heard, so I thought it was in my head. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2005.995">I</a>  didn't think that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2008.697">Because</a>  I wear it all the time, I don't notice it.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2012.641">But</a>  we're very close to getting that contract signed, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2015.557">We</a>  should be starting the design very soon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2019.959">And</a>  then starting, we could start some pre-construction probably next spring, and then do the bulk of the construction in the summer so that by next fall, not this fall, next fall, there'll be new systems in place at the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2034.024">There's</a>  a new one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2035.805">I</a>  can't even read it anymore.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2037.085">I</a>  know.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2039.826">Yeah,</a>  well, we're trying to repair the systems right now, so you can laugh at that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2044.902">Is</a>  it just for like these schools here or high school as well? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2049.506">Not,</a>  the high school hasn't been part of that project so far. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2052.508">Are</a>  there issues in the high school? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2054.29">For</a>  heating? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2054.77">I</a>  don't remember. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2055.631">I</a>  mean, for cooling? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2056.552">Yeah,</a>  I don't remember that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2057.413">It</a>  would die. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2058.754">And</a>  it's bad up there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2062.557">Like,</a>  it's right, like, you know, like tip of like a mountain, you get like the full effect of the sun. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2068.462">Oh,</a>  really?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2068.982">Yeah,</a>  like trees would be cool.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2074.141">Well,</a>  the high school is going to be either renovated or completely replaced. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2082.685">So</a>  we're not replacing the heating and cooling systems now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2089.128">Is</a>  there an update on that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2093.851">Not</a>  that I have heard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2095.692">They</a>  are going through the process to apply for the MSBA grant, but there's a sort of a <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2102.982">design</a>  process that happens before that point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2106.024">So</a>  you're submitting what the design and the cost is for the data firms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2111.208">So</a>  there's a committee that's working on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2114.651">And</a>  on the Medford events calendar, the meetings of those committee, that committee should show up on there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2124.438">But</a>  I'm not part of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2126.159">And</a>  I haven't gotten any major updates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2131.232">I</a>  mean, I will be involved in the project once we get to that point in the process, but it's not at that point yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2136.974">They're</a>  talking about funding and the MSU grant and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2149.358">I</a>  think that's it for the city updates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2154.26">Any</a>  comments, questions, anything on those?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2161.478">Do</a>  you guys online? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2164.22">Coach</a>  Palmer, same question?</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2167.783">No,</a>  ma'am.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2173.467">It</a>  looks like the Energy and Environment Committee update, isn't it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2176.349">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2178.251">So</a>  yeah, so for our July meeting, we met at one of the members' homes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2187.28">And</a>  he did a tour for everybody of his solar panels and his heat pumps. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2192.161">And</a>  we got to talk with him about that whole process with installing those, in addition to our regular meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2199.743">So</a>  that was fun. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2202.884">And</a>  the Energy and Environment Committee, one of the members, or some of the members, I don't know how many are involved, they're considering applying for Community Preservation Act funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2216.973">to</a>  do a study of invasive plants in city parks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2225.236">And</a>  the reason I think they're doing that is it kind of goes hand in hand with the pollinator garden project that they're interested in doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2237.899">So</a>  yeah, removing invasive plants and then replacing them with native plants that are good for pollinators. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2246.963">And</a>  there was a rain garden planting project this morning, actually at Wright's pond where there used to be a rain garden there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2257.246">And</a>  then I think somebody didn't realize that it was intentional. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2261.307">They</a>  thought it was weeds and they mowed it multiple times and destroyed it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2268.509">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2269.35">Well,</a>  cause if they're native plants, they like maybe, you know, that's intentional. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2275.839">So</a>  they were replanting that this morning and putting signs up to say this is a problem.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2281.043">Can</a>  you imagine getting a knock on your door and being like, lady, be a lawn mower. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2285.506">I</a>  see it outside.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2286.487">You</a>  messed up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2288.228">This</a>  happens more often than you think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2289.749">There</a>  was somebody down along the river who was just weed whacking a bunch of stuff, which to be fair, he was weed whacking invasive plants there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2301.539">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2302.266">But</a>  that wasn't, that's not the way that you get rid of those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2305.127">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2305.647">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2306.467">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2307.527">And</a>  he, the way he was doing it was going to cause erosion into the river. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2311.529">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2313.769">Well</a>  meaning, but yeah.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2315.65">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2317.75">They</a>  need to get educated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2320.991">So</a>  that's it for the energy and environment committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2331.24">So</a>  we want to discuss this year's priorities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2339.524">Let</a>  me share this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2341.985">Can</a>  everybody see that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2348.447">Beautiful.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2349.688">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2349.988">Wait,</a>  wait. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2352.349">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2359.965">Sharpa,</a>  you went into it already. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2361.646">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2367.008">Yeah,</a>  I added those two things at the bottom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2369.328">I</a>  don't know if they're relevant.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2374.11">But</a>  were they extreme heat zones? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2378.832">Talk</a>  about areas in Medford that experience increased vulnerability during extreme heat waves. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2386.431">sea</a>  level rise and coastal flooding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2388.192">You</a>  talked about flooding in areas of America that are susceptible to heavy precipitation events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2392.973">I</a>  think we've looked at the maps of those before, but I remember we haven't really talked about what options can be shared with people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2407.998">So</a>  is that what you're thinking, Sherva?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2410.979">Yeah,</a>  just thinking more about like, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2415.93">building</a>  social resilience and like offering people resources. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2422.574">If</a>  in case these like disasters were to hit, like what can people do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2428.878">What</a>  options do they have? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2430.579">I</a>  know that there's the resilience hubs, but I'm just wondering if there's like other things too.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2436.643">Well,</a>  I mean, we're working towards the resilience hubs, but also in the meantime, what can be done?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2443.848">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2446.148">Oh,</a>  one thing that I learned this week actually about sea level rise is that even if we're not impacted by actual coastal flooding because we have the dam protecting us from that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2461.992">We</a>  could be impacted by groundwater rising because when the sea level rises, it will come in underneath the freshwater and the groundwater because it's denser than the groundwater. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2476.518">So</a>  it'll be like seawater underneath, freshwater on top, and then it'll raise it up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2482.48">So</a>  it'll go into like people's basements, it creates sinkholes, like they're seeing this in places like <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2489.764">Salem.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2490.364">I</a>  saw one on the news.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2492.525">Yeah,</a>  like House of Seven Gables, for instance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2494.686">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2495.227">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2495.907">They're</a>  having serious issues with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2498.808">Screaming.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2499.309">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2500.949">And</a>  I hadn't considered that before as a as an impact of sea level rising. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2505.111">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2505.391">Yes,</a>  I think it's one thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2510.994">It's</a>  another thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2514.716">So,</a>  yeah, so the priorities that we have in here right now, electrify Medford, <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2520.096">composting,</a>  stormwater education for residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2524.86">That</a>  might be, Charbel, that might be sort of the same thing as the sea level rise and coastal flooding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2536.449">Just</a>  water issues related to climate change.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2543.474">I'm</a>  sorry, I didn't catch that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2545.616">Can</a>  you repeat it?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2547.037">Yeah,</a>  so number four here, <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2550.022">And</a>  the fourth one here, stormwater education. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2552.383">It</a>  would be similar outreach work, I think, to sea level rise and coastal flooding.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2561.406">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2562.146">I</a>  think those could be combined. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2563.847">Yeah,</a>  I didn't see that, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2567.969">We</a>  have school outreach, city policy, statewide policy, state, federal policy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2578.935">City</a>  building upgrades, city transportation projects, EV charging stations, blue bike stations, and then the extreme lead zones and the sea level rise and coastal flooding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2596.027">So</a>  is there anything else that people want as priorities that's not on this list that we should add?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2615.728">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2617.609">Temperature.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2618.93">I'm</a>  saying let's see temperature.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2632.235">I</a>  mean, maybe I can't like see like the thing that's like so loud.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2638.913">But,</a>  um, do they have anything for like, like thunder? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2641.674">Like,</a>  you know, like, you have like a horrible, like, thunderstorm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2645.756">Oh,</a>  like power outages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2647.237">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2654.623">Well,</a>  we have the big heat right now, you know, and another day I was going to the city hall, and I walked from the theater to the city hall, and I noticed that Medford needs desperately some more trees, more shade. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2670.566">You</a>  know, it's something that, you know, we're looking at because, man, it was horrible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2682.322">it</a>  will stop to find a shade at all over the area.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2686.023">I</a>  think one of the ways that you can get people involved in that, well, so there's Trees Medford that does a lot of work about preserving trees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2696.824">And</a>  they also give out trees, I don't think, at least once a year, they actually give out saplings for free to anybody who wants them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2707.186">So</a>  publicizing that, I think could be really helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2710.927">And</a>  then <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2711.863">There's</a>  also things like the adopt a tree program where you can sign up to make sure that they, that a tree gets watered during the summer, like a new sapling that was, that was planted in the, in the sidewalk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2726.286">You</a>  just reminded me of something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2727.606">This</a>  is crazy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2729.466">So</a>  next to my house, we had a tree and I don't know if it was my dad in the public city.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2737.288">Can</a>  you get it to talk about? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2740.085">Is</a>  that okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2740.785">Well,</a>  I mean, obviously it's okay that we did it, but I'm saying like, you know, it kind of sucks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2747.009">I</a>  liked having the tree there, but it blocked the house, obviously.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2752.031">Was</a>  it in bad shape? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2753.472">Like</a>  it was going to fall on it or?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2755.193">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2756.914">I</a>  don't think there's a tree that would be in the way.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2760.856">But</a>  we still have one that's right in front of the house that still blocks the view. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2766.138">But</a>  we need to ask permission to cut a tree, right?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2769.403">Yeah,</a>  that hasn't been passed yet though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2771.624">Well,</a>  the tree ordinance I was, I looked in that into that after the last meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2776.507">And</a>  there's an updated version that's going to be sent to city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2780.87">That's</a>  what trees Medford told me that they didn't have it ready yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2784.392">So</a>  they're going to send it to me when they do have it ready and I can share with everybody.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2788.455">Yeah,</a>  I know that you guys, I think it was you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2792.765">Like,</a>  you know how the sidewalks have like the little square that you, that they, that like, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2797.627">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2797.848">So</a>  that's the city thing, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2799.028">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2799.368">So</a>  like on my street of the other, like a little further, there's like in the summer and like in the spring, there's like beautiful, like cherry kind of like cherry blossom trees are like white, pink, like, you know, are those like, or do you're saying tree trees, like green trees?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2818.867">Oh,</a>  no, those are great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2821.628">I</a>  think the city's policy is to try to have as diverse a group of trees that they're planting around the city as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2829.751">Because</a>  in the past, I think there were issues, I don't know about in Medford, but in other cities at least, <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2837.102">issues</a>  where they planted one kind of tree, and then there was like a disease or a pest or something, and they lost a whole bunch of trees all at once. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2844.508">So</a>  I've tried many different kinds of trees as I can, but I just always wondered. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2850.694">I</a>  think Sonia dropped a lobster.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2854.957">Yeah,</a>  I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2857.079">I</a>  just thought that was like funny, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2858.66">Because</a>  like, well, you see normal trees, and then I saw like those trees, and I'm like, what? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2863.084">Why</a>  are they planted not the same ones, you know? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2866.455">But</a>  it makes the, what's it called? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2873.199">The</a>  street look nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2874.4">Do</a>  you know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2875.401">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2876.261">So</a>  that is another plus that we should help. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2880.744">The</a>  aesthetic part of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2883.526">People</a>  are all about that, yes or no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2886.235">It's</a>  a tree that looks aesthetically nice.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2888.416">There's</a>  one tree that my uncle's trying to take off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2891.978">I'm</a>  like, don't do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2894.859">It</a>  is blocking kind of like the second line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2897.8">Yeah,</a>  you know that tree? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2899.381">Yeah,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2901.002">I</a>  was down in Georgia earlier this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2906.124">And</a>  there's a city, City of Savannah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2911.518">yeah</a>  the entire city is like full of trees beautiful yeah and you know you know it gets hot down there like hotter than here but it's like you don't really feel the the heat because the trees the trees everywhere and they like like the branches like uh they're like um i forget what they call the trees that's that's that's true there's not a lot of looking for like mystery</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2941.715">There's</a>  not a lot of like shade. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2943.916">Like,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2945.677">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2946.558">And</a>  definitely in certain areas of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2948.699">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2949.319">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2950.54">Plus</a>  it would, it would be better if it would be good for like the, the pavement, you know, it cools the pavement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2957.624">So,</a>  so that there's not as much like, uh, I guess, uh, what's the word. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2966.838">Um,</a>  you're just like, you're walking on like just the heat island effect there.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2972.242">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2972.642">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2973.422">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2975.083">Um,</a>  are you interested in talking to the tree warden about how the city makes decisions about where trees are planted and things like that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2989.492">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2989.772">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=2994.85">Yeah,</a>  I'll talk to her and see if she can make it to one of our meetings.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3000.073">The</a>  tree warden, that's a that's an awesome title. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3003.955">I</a>  know, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3004.816">The</a>  tree warden.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3010.179">You've</a>  been to the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3012.54">The</a>  whole, like, building is flowers, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3014.501">And</a>  it's like a ward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3017.503">And,</a>  like, they use pollen for psychiatric stuff.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3019.764">It's</a>  a little crazy in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3023.908">All</a>  right, anything else people want to add to the list?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3030.995">Where</a>  are we to make it bigger?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3048.775">Maybe</a>  if I stop sharing it, just a second, I'll try to make it bigger and then stop sharing and then share it again.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3054.82">Just</a>  because my brain is on the last, you know.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3076.282">It's</a>  kind of creepy being here in City Hall.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3080.724">It</a>  was so dark. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3084.685">It</a>  was like lights off.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3086.346">Yeah,</a>  I turned on the lights. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3087.927">Maybe</a>  the maybe the motion detector turned off again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3091.028">I</a>  went in the elevator.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3093.769">I</a>  was like, I threw my flashlight.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3098.791">And</a>  then I ran into the hallway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3100.992">I</a>  only turned the lights on in the stairs.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3102.873">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3103.253">Yeah,</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3104.273">I</a>  was like, run!</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3107.183">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3109.064">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3110.245">Oh,</a>  my sister has a little compost like thing outside her house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3118.911">It's</a>  crazy.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3121.293">I'm</a>  trying to get one of the neighbors.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3125.456">Okay,</a>  so if there's nothing else to add to the list right now, we can always change it in the future if you want to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3130.459">But</a>  what is a lot of stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3134.475">What</a>  areas in particular would you like to focus on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3140.338">With</a>  the composing, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3142.56">So</a>  they put food in it, right?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3146.962">Yeah,</a>  food waste. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3148.363">So</a>  what do they do with that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3153.787">The</a>  process of composting is like basically it decomposes in a hot environment, like in a big pile, basically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3162.8">And</a>  then it turns it into into dirt, essentially. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3166.343">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3167.885">So,</a>  like, one of the things with Garbage to Garden, which is what we're using, is you can order compost from them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3176.573">They</a>  get a reduced rate from what they would normally be selling it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3181.275">use</a>  it in your garden.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3182.155">So</a>  is, because I just, I know he's going to ask me all these questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3186.636">Is</a>  there a specific type, like are they doing just veggies and roots and meat?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3193.117">So</a>  if you were doing it in your backyard, you could only do like fruits and veggies and stuff like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3199.818">But</a>  because they're doing it in a commercial composting facility where the temperatures get hotter, you can do meat, bones, everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3208.92">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3209.54">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3211.224">No</a>  human bodies or anything like that.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3217.388">No,</a>  for real. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3218.089">How</a>  do you know, Brenda?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3218.909">So</a>  with the meat, can they put it in a plastic? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3221.611">Because</a>  they'll be like magnets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3223.592">No,</a>  it has to be all like raw. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3225.674">Yeah,</a>  they'll do magnets and stuff like that.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3230.677">There</a>  are biodegradable bags. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3233.859">And</a>  so that's what I use to like line the inside of my compost bin. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3240.361">So</a>  then they just take the bag out and the bin itself stays cleaner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3248.385">My</a>  question is though, really, how do they know?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3253.436">Like</a>  for real. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3255.637">I</a>  know, but it's crazy.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3257.438">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3258.079">I've</a>  never been to a commercial composting facility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3260.38">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3260.92">Like</a>  how do they like value what they get? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3264.422">You</a>  know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3266.283">Food</a>  waste, not human waste. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3269.585">You</a>  know, that would be weird. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3271.686">I</a>  know it's cycling. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3272.726">So</a>  Natasha, I mean, not here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3275.248">I</a>  hope.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3284.867">Okay,</a>  so sure, you put your name. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3289.129">With</a>  areas that you're particularly interested put my name on the trees.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3294.192">Yeah,</a>  and the trees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3297.433">Yeah,</a>  me too for the trees.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3311.986">Sorry,</a>  what did you say? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3313.326">The</a>  same one.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3315.927">Okay,</a>  with this city transportation, maybe I need to put my name on it because I don't like really what's going on here in Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3326.791">What,</a>  in particular, is it the train? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3333.093">I</a>  think that's always going to be an issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3334.813">Unfortunately,</a>  it's sad to say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3337.194">It's</a>  hard.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3340.264">It's</a>  affecting people's work schedule. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3342.725">Cause</a>  when you're, especially when you're working in the city, it's like, there's always an issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3347.266">You're</a>  being late to work.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3348.946">But</a>  that's like, but this is how I, cause I, I commuted literally all my life since 2018, 19 around there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3361.889">So</a>  for me, like, I know that at the end of the day, it's all like, you're dealing with like people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3370.23">or,</a>  you know, maybe link to work or not even link to work, just like things like come up, you know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3377.053">It's</a>  a human error.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3378.534">So</a>  yeah, it's human error, unless like a lot of it's underfunding, but well, that too, you know, so that that plays a part, you know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3387.258">So</a>  it's like, every time there was a delay or something, I didn't stress about it because I'm like, at the end of the day, thus, <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3394.818">It</a>  happens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3395.478">My</a>  boyfriend just started a job at South station a couple of weeks, near South station a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3400.099">And</a>  his commute is either has been 45 minutes one day and an hour and a half another day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3405.72">So</a>  he was like, how do I plan on this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3407.94">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3408.36">No,</a>  I know that happened to me too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3410.901">It's</a>  wild.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3412.361">I</a>  think a lot of it is also just how like just the overall infrastructure of like Boston and how they handle like the traffic. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3424.298">It's</a>  like very inefficient in some areas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3428.141">Like</a>  in Cambridge, for example, like they make the streets so tight because they're adding like, they added the bike lanes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3437.627">And</a>  that literally leaves like no room for the cars to like, like, let's say, let's say a fire truck was coming through or police car was coming through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3448.514">There's</a>  nowhere the cars can go to let them through, which just causes more traffic.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3454.443">i</a>  like the places where they have like the combo bus bike lane so it's a lane that's just for buses and bicycles basically and then the buses are able to move through the city faster yeah but i mean that only leaves one other lane for the other cars so</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3476.122">Yeah,</a>  there's pros and cons for public transportation.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3483.765">So</a>  I think the city is involved in boards and advocacy groups that try to advocate with the state to try to get better service for the T. For this, this would probably be more <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3504.828">related</a>  to city road projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3510.811">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3511.831">Or,</a>  you know, bus stops, bus routes and things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3519.294">So</a>  the city doesn't run the buses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3521.495">They</a>  can't, they can't, they can't control the MBTA buses, but we do, the city does advocate for those too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3530.119">And</a>  so that's something that's probably more <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3533.922">Specific</a>  that we can give feedback on is like, particular routes and things like that because recently I was talking to the transportation director here and he was saying that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3544.904">Years</a>  ago, a couple of couple of years ago, I think they. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3548.685">Change</a>  the bus routes in in Medford as part of an overall, like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3553.926">System</a>  wide restructuring of the bus routes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3557.95">And</a>  I think the city was promised like an express route or something like that as part of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3565.392">And</a>  like some things were cut back and everyone was upset about it, but then their city was also promised like an express route or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3572.054">And</a>  it doesn't, I don't think that's here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3573.814">So</a>  that's part of life that the city advocates for, but the state is trying to get those sorts of routes.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3580.716">So</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3584.097">I</a>  don't think it's ever going to be as perfect.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3587.71">than</a>  it should be.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3590.112">It's</a>  frustrating. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3593.774">When</a>  I first came to the city, I'm not going to say how many years ago, it was what? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3604.401">It's</a>  so much better than it is now.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3608.444">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3609.545">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3610.245">And</a>  cleaner, I'm sure.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3613.275">I</a>  don't know about that, but it definitely worked for me.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3619.38">I</a>  used to take it when I used to go to high school and that was many years ago.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3625.765">So</a>  anything else that people want to sort of highlight as areas that you want to focus on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3637.534">I</a>  think the extreme beat films too.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3642.098">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3648.601">So</a>  besides the cooling station, what's there?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3651.102">I</a>  like the storm.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3672.387">I</a>  think also city extreme heat zones as well.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3686.558">City</a>  policy.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3695.645">It's</a>  crazy because with climate change, you have to think of things that are immediate and then bigger picture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3703.81">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3704.651">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3705.431">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3705.972">Like</a>  with the school HVAC upgrades, like we need these to be working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3710.295">We</a>  need the AC to be working and the students come back this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3713.317">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3713.497">But</a>  then we also have to do the bigger fix. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3716.959">So</a>  this is a bigger replacement assistance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3724.985">You</a>  said the C-level res, what was the C-level res for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3728.188">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3728.788">I</a>  would probably combine those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3730.229">I</a>  think that people would think of them together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3744.98">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3745.32">All</a>  right, does this look, does this look, the ones where people have actually put down their names, do these look like good high-level priorities? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3759.007">I'll</a>  still give you updates about Electrify Metro, but it sounds like we don't really want to be <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3764.255">involved</a>  in that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3767.358">What</a>  do you mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3767.999">I</a>  didn't even see that there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3770.541">What</a>  about school outreach? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3772.503">Yeah,</a>  we should try to get the youth into this.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3787.754">Oh,</a>  only me?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3790.696">She</a>  just didn't put tab.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3804.584">So</a>  city building upgrades, I'll keep you updated on that and it sounds like you don't want to be actively involved in that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3811.529">Same</a>  with EV charging stations and blue bikes, keep you updated, but not.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3815.568">Unless</a>  I get one of those cars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3819.231">Cool.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3823.915">And</a>  power outages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3825.496">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3827.617">No,</a>  that one, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3828.999">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3829.799">I</a>  almost feel like that could be kind of combined with, you know, it's like extreme heat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3833.882">Yeah,</a>  that's very, very similar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3839.387">Power</a>  outages with heat, but it's also like when it's like <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3844.497">That's</a>  why you put it down with severe weather. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3846.679">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3847.139">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3847.66">Like</a>  the thunder, everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3851.523">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3852.324">I</a>  think that that kind of goes hand in hand with extreme heat because the more, the hotter the air is, the more moisture it can contain. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3861.751">And</a>  so then you're more likely to have thunderstorms and things like that, hurricanes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3866.415">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3869.098">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3871.84">So</a>  I'll probably, what I'll, <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3873.879">do,</a>  I'll combine a couple of them that we talked about, and then the ones where, you know, more people have expressed interest and then we'll put them sort of at the top and then, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3885.983">Do</a>  y'all care about the transportation projects? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3889.264">Chabelle?</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3890.325">I</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3890.745">I</a>  mean, honestly, you could put my name for all of these.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3894.186">I</a>  mean, same.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3895.126">It</a>  just seemed like, it seemed like a bit redundant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3898.147">It's</a>  a lot though.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3899.408">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3904.348">I'm</a>  saying more like, I'm just talking recency, recency bias, because of the heat, you know, so that's the first thing on my mind.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3914.85">Yeah,</a>  that's true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3917.411">Can</a>  we can we talk about that a little bit, actually, because so I feel like the Office of Outreach and Prevention did some communication about heat, like cooling centers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3930.273">I</a>  haven't been involved in those conversations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3933.074">So</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3933.718">I</a>  would love to learn more about what is going on with pooling centers and what people can do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3942.946">Verna,</a>  you have that list of events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3945.488">Which</a>  one's the one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3946.689">I</a>  don't know if you went to one that we did this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3952.714">That</a>  was for health. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3955.176">Do</a>  you remember the one that you couldn't go? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3957.198">I</a>  keep talking about it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3959.199">That</a>  I couldn't go?</p>

    <p>[Zcwx-pW5U0k_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3960.821">Charbel,</a>  do you remember the one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3963.317">where</a>  you met Jessica at the library. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3969.799">Remember</a>  when you met my cousin from Ecuador when she came?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001615_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=3972.2">Yeah.</a> </p>

How crazy is it that I just Googled this and it went up the city webpage, but</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4151.017">I</a>  don't know what it is that like, like residents ask us stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4155.779">And</a>  I'm like, didn't go on the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4159.161">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4159.661">Point</a>  blank.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4173.588">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4174.208">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4174.368">Yeah.</a> </p>

People don't really use the cooling centers that we have set up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4217.056">Or</a>  maybe because people don't know about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4218.917">Because</a>  I bet you a thousand bucks I go to my mom and my sister, they don't even know how we've lived here.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4238.372">Sorry,</a>  we dove into a topic there rather than just doing the priorities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4244.035">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4245.135">All</a>  right, so did these, this is a lot of priorities, but we'll have it as a reference and we can kind of prioritize based on the number of people who are interested in something.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4253.82">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/climate-equity-council-07-19-24&start=4256.381">So</a>  you can do maybe like the ones that have three and then the ones that have two and then, yeah.</p>
