1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:04,207
So motion to start the meeting.

2
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:05,787
We don't need a motion to start the meeting.

3
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:10,089
We just have enough people that we have a board so you can get the meeting started.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,870
Meeting started guys.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:21,855
Okay, first order is administrative review of the minutes from June.

6
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:34,318
It's.

7
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:41,561
I don't know why the previous one's not coming out on my email.

8
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:43,642
Was it the last one?

9
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:46,444
The last one should be on here.

10
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,505
It's working for me.

11
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:50,325
Did you have edits to it, Lisa?

12
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:50,906
No.

13
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:52,346
Oh, okay.

14
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,867
You're just filling it out for reference.

15
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:00,710
I also wanted to fill it out just in case.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,631
Does anybody have edits on it?

17
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:09,945
She's talking, but I can open mine over here for one.

18
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,110
Yeah, did you have any edits to it?

19
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,812
Although I didn't add anything now.

20
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:21,732
OK.

21
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:29,777
Great, do you want me to share?

22
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:30,858
I don't think we need to.

23
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:33,900
If nobody does, do it to the second one.

24
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:46,547
So we would just need a motion to approve the minutes.

25
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:47,168
Yes.

26
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:51,892
The motion guys to approve the minutes.

27
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,936
I second the motion.

28
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,659
All in favor?

29
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:01,239
Aye.

30
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:01,339
Aye.

31
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:08,678
Okay, so the 2nd.

32
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,200
Order is the method connection.

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,701
Yeah, well, we're administrative.

34
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:16,083
Can we talk about next month's meeting?

35
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:24,308
I was hoping, could we move it from it would be the 16th that we kept to our new schedule.

36
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:30,011
And we move it to either the 9th or the 23rd.

37
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:32,673
We're going to have family visiting that weekend.

38
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:36,273
9 to the 23rd.

39
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:37,813
I think the 23rd is fine.

40
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,576
What about guys?

41
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:43,416
9 to the 23rd.

42
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:45,697
That works.

43
00:02:45,837 --> 00:02:48,639
Are those Mondays or Fridays?

44
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,240
It's Fridays.

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,921
Well, we have options for Zoom, just in case.

46
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:54,182
OK.

47
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:58,084
Yeah, it can work.

48
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:02,326
But maybe it's not.

49
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:02,606
Yeah.

50
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:08,660
So does the 23rd works for everybody?

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,640
Yes.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,101
Okay.

53
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:11,001
Awesome.

54
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:13,603
Thank you very much for being flexible.

55
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:20,447
And then one more administrative sort of announcement.

56
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:27,532
I just, just for my office, we had four new interns start this month, all of them from Tufts.

57
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:34,236
There are two undergrads and two grad students in the UEP program, urban and environment,

58
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,904
policy and planning, which is what I did.

59
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:43,388
And one of them is really interested in the sustainability work that we're doing.

60
00:03:43,428 --> 00:03:48,972
So he's really digging into some of the projects that we've, that I've got going.

61
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:55,296
So I'm excited about that because it means we'll be able to move forward with some projects that I've done on the back burner for a while now.

62
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:57,558
Yeah.

63
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,779
Like they've already started working on

64
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:11,715
doing a greenhouse gas inventory for us for this year, updating that, and the Harvest Your Energy Festival, the planning for that for October.

65
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:22,762
All right, so that's all I have for administrative.

66
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:25,684
The owl does make you self-conscious, doesn't it?

67
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:28,768
Yeah, the eyes.

68
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:02,052
The national night out and the Brazilian event.

69
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:06,373
When is the Brazilian event?

70
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:10,554
The 17th of August.

71
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,335
And is that at Andrews?

72
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:17,836
No, it's here.

73
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,996
Changing the venue.

74
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,236
It's outside.

75
00:05:22,217 --> 00:05:22,877
It's outside.

76
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:23,677
Yeah.

77
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:25,718
That's exciting.

78
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:27,278
It's a wonderful weather.

79
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:29,556
just like today.

80
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,457
It should be.

81
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:38,378
What sorts of things are happening at the Brazilian event?

82
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:50,521
So we're going to have the vendors, you know, we're going to encourage the Brazilian business to participate in local organizations and office.

83
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:55,562
You know, of course, we count on you to be there, you know, with your table and teaching people.

84
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:03,343
And we can support you with whatever you need, you know, and our capacity, you know that day.

85
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:10,411
But like it's more like to get everybody together to know a little bit of the culture of Brazil, and get to.

86
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:21,138
let the residents know that the population of Brazilians in Medford has grown, you know, and just like the Hispanic, you know, and Arabic, Haitian.

87
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:27,722
So just want to make sure everybody's welcome and, you know, and you don't need to be Brazilian to be part of the event.

88
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:29,803
It's a city event, so everybody's welcome.

89
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:31,344
That's great.

90
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:32,945
Are we going to have dancing there, too?

91
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:34,686
I think that's been my favorite part.

92
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:40,230
Yeah, isn't it cool you learn different, like, dancing?

93
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:52,559
Are there any other Medford Connects events coming up?

94
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,180
We haven't gotten the lists yet.

95
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,482
I know that they're working on it, Sophie and Catherine.

96
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:03,666
I have a list of potential events for Medford.

97
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:06,628
Let me share the screen here.

98
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,260
Can you all see that?

99
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:18,442
Yes.

100
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:23,366
Oh, now it's back.

101
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:26,689
Okay.

102
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:33,635
Yeah, so coming up in August, there's the Mystic River Family Fun Day is August 3rd.

103
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:38,398
What's that?

104
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:40,660
This is the way that it's like set up.

105
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,481
We should have something like that.

106
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:44,763
I like.

107
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:47,465
Yeah, I should.

108
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:49,587
Let's see.

109
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,688
Oh, and it's starting earlier than that.

110
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:58,554
We were doing the Electrify Medford kickoff event July 31st, and it's actually happening this time.

111
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:00,215
A press release has gone out.

112
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:02,317
It's booked on the Mayors calendar.

113
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:04,718
We're holding that at the library.

114
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,600
It's a Wednesday from five to seven.

115
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:11,526
but I'm very excited we're finally doing that.

116
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:14,528
I would love it if maybe you guys could come.

117
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:14,808
Yeah.

118
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:15,068
Yeah.

119
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:15,709
Yeah.

120
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:18,170
I mean, that's a Wednesday, right?

121
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:22,694
So then we'd have to like let them, let Sophie and Catherine come.

122
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:24,435
So it could be there.

123
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:28,958
So Brenda, you can update the date for the Brazilian day now.

124
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,719
You put it early September.

125
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:30,799
Yes.

126
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,002
It's gonna be August 17th.

127
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:36,203
Wonderful.

128
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:38,185
It's city hall.

129
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:45,049
And you said it was, what time is it?

130
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:47,971
1-4.

131
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:48,791
Awesome.

132
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:55,935
Let's see what else we're doing.

133
00:08:56,075 --> 00:09:01,978
Oh, August 1st, we're going to have an Electrify Medford table at the farmers market.

134
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:11,430
Yeah, we are there every Thursday too, so with the Medford Family Network.

135
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:13,612
Okay, that's great.

136
00:09:15,794 --> 00:09:19,056
I've only tabled there once before, and that was in June, so.

137
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:19,637
Really?

138
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:19,997
Yeah.

139
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:29,365
Yeah, so maybe we can be all together over there, you know, and take advantage of the kids and the parents right there with Medford Family Network, you know?

140
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:35,848
Yeah, where is there, do they, wait, do they have a table every week or is it just on certain weeks?

141
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:41,930
They have the space, they don't have a table, they have the whole space in front of where the band plays, you know?

142
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,631
Oh, where the kids are playing.

143
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:44,832
On the grass, yeah.

144
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,412
Yeah, that makes sense.

145
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:50,114
I didn't venture over there when I was table last time.

146
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:56,286
Um, yeah, we have the community table, which is up closer towards the street.

147
00:09:56,306 --> 00:10:02,311
Yeah, I don't know what mystic river family fun day is.

148
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:07,555
I just, I just somebody told me that that was happening at my opportunity.

149
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:11,558
I don't know if we have anybody who will be able to go there, but.

150
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,522
I added it here just so we can keep track of it.

151
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:16,582
Um.

152
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:30,930
And then in September, there's the Missing Rivers celebration on September 21st.

153
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,392
You're not going to, you're not going to be at the night out?

154
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:38,713
That should light up the.

155
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:43,095
Oh, so I don't have a table for there.

156
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,676
I signed up to wait for that.

157
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:50,799
Um, but if you guys have a table there, can I, can I bring my stuff to your table?

158
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:53,152
I don't see why not.

159
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,374
I mean, you're forgetting that we asked.

160
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,936
YMCA, everybody come on board.

161
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,998
Yeah, so maybe.

162
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:01,718
Ask Sophie maybe.

163
00:11:01,738 --> 00:11:02,058
Yeah.

164
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:07,022
No, because last year was just our office and the health department.

165
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:13,306
No, but it's the YMCA Food Justice Council and we asked in person yesterday when we were here.

166
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:14,587
Oh, okay.

167
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:20,932
Sophie and Catherine, if they could have like share a table or have their like table next to us.

168
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:35,780
And they said, yeah, so maybe if anything, we can just ask if you guys can both share a table or depending on how it works, we can add on to it.

169
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:43,460
I mean, at the very least, we can just, I can just bring flyers instead of the whole big setup that I do.

170
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,103
The setup's nice.

171
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:49,728
Yeah, they love their house.

172
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:51,349
The kids love their house.

173
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:53,732
It's an attraction.

174
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,995
That'd be good because that way people go there.

175
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:59,363
I liked your other games that you rented the other day.

176
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:00,644
Yeah, I know.

177
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:08,331
But the house is a great idea because people start recognizing, well, it's the table with the house, you know, where the lady talks about climate change.

178
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:09,432
I'm serious.

179
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:10,854
My kids always say that.

180
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:13,516
That's great.

181
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:17,800
The lady with the house.

182
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,441
That's so funny.

183
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,184
We'll be at the farmer's market again September 26.

184
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:28,298
There's Run Medford on the 27th and the 28th.

185
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:35,541
I don't know if I'll be able to be there or if the coaches will be able to be there, but maybe.

186
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:42,983
And then there's Tufts Community Day on September 29th.

187
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:54,027
So I'm hoping to be there to talk to Tufts students who are generally renters about

188
00:12:54,383 --> 00:12:55,764
Energy, I should say, and stuff.

189
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:05,493
And then, sorry, going up through October 5th is Oktoberfest in Medford Square.

190
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:15,422
And our Harvesty Energy Festival is on the 19th.

191
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:17,064
Which is our big event.

192
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:25,714
Um, we do things like we do, we open up the inside of the wind turbine, so you can look up into the wind turbine.

193
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:27,755
We did that last time, no?

194
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,235
Yeah.

195
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:29,116
Yeah.

196
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,296
It was in October.

197
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:30,736
Yeah.

198
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:31,497
Last October.

199
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:31,637
Yeah.

200
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,998
Who was behind the raw at Loma Glen?

201
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:34,979
Yeah.

202
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:35,719
I was at Loma Glen.

203
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,039
Yep.

204
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,620
Exactly.

205
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,080
I saw that.

206
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,320
Yeah.

207
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,221
It was really epic.

208
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:40,362
It's always scary to go up there.

209
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:42,623
So I like, I've never climbed up there.

210
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:44,344
They're like insurance.

211
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,165
Do they let you?

212
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:46,165
Yeah.

213
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:46,966
Okay, good.

214
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:47,366
Yeah.

215
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,146
I was going to say.

216
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:48,467
Yep.

217
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:49,067
Yep.

218
00:13:49,540 --> 00:14:01,050
Oh, and one more thing I don't have on here is I'm trying to schedule a electric vehicle showcase here at City Hall.

219
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,112
It looks like either September 7th or the 14th.

220
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,135
Can I test drive?

221
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:13,140
So what we're going to do is we're going to have people who work in City Hall and we're like energy coaches bring their cars.

222
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:15,143
if they hadn't been.

223
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:20,965
And that way you'll get to talk to people about their own experience rather than talking to a car dealer who's trying to sell something to you.

224
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:21,866
That's very true.

225
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:22,006
Yeah.

226
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:24,147
Cause they'll be like, Oh, that's the best thing in the world.

227
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:25,907
Cause you have no idea.

228
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:27,168
No, you need to be real.

229
00:14:28,228 --> 00:14:37,011
Like I, I, I panic every time I see like the energy down and I have to go find someone, a place to get, you know, charged.

230
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:38,151
I have a hard time.

231
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:41,252
We're also going to have e-bikes there too.

232
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:48,336
And I think we're going to have Blue Bikes to talk about their like options.

233
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:48,876
Yeah.

234
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:49,837
That's cool.

235
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:53,039
I remember, didn't we have, it wasn't there before Blue Bikes.

236
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,540
What's that line?

237
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,841
It was line something.

238
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,283
I didn't know you had those in Medford.

239
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:00,024
I've seen those before.

240
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:00,725
We have them.

241
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:04,548
And that like, they don't be left around in my house or on my house.

242
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:06,189
That's why I know, like, I don't need it.

243
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:06,689
Yeah.

244
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,791
But I think- They're in the docking stations, right?

245
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:09,191
Yeah.

246
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,533
Yeah, but people would live everywhere.

247
00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:14,660
Yeah, that was the problem, you know.

248
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:18,345
So did that company take over?

249
00:15:18,365 --> 00:15:20,587
I think they just pulled out.

250
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:29,374
Well, I think the idea that you have a timer for that, and if you don't return them, you keep being charged.

251
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:38,639
I think that was the way they found for people to return the bikes to their, you know, whatever location they have their, you know, section.

252
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:45,602
And I think that was helpful for the residents, because sometimes I will find in my street, you know, a bike is just sitting there, you know, on my sidewalk.

253
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:46,663
I mean, what's going on over here?

254
00:15:47,503 --> 00:15:50,505
So I think they come up with a bad idea and took the business.

255
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,446
Yeah, I think they found some of those bikes thrown into the harbor.

256
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:55,386
Really?

257
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:58,247
What was going on there?

258
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:07,150
Brenda, about the events, are your flyers multilingual?

259
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,411
Do you need any help with translations with any of the new ones that are coming up?

260
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:24,648
Like the Brazilian event is coming up, do you have them in Portuguese that can provide those information in Portuguese?

261
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:25,788
Do you need help with that?

262
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:33,473
So we have the flyer, all of our Electrify Medford flyers in the different languages, in the four languages.

263
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:41,057
And then in terms of like advertising for like the Electrify Medford kickoff event,

264
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:47,566
Like, I have a little flyer for that that is not translated, but it's also not going to be in a lot of different places.

265
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:49,428
There aren't a lot of things happening for them.

266
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:57,113
Yeah, so just keep in mind, if you have anything like that, just send it away, you know, like, so we can get that done.

267
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:01,076
Oh, yeah.

268
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:04,359
Let me jump into the... Sorry.

269
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,044
Let me jump into the ElectroFanMet for updates if we don't have...

270
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:16,085
Any more events that we want to talk about?

271
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:17,745
Okay.

272
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:18,305
Let's see.

273
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:22,986
Yeah, I think that's it for now.

274
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:24,067
We're into our coming weeks.

275
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:26,887
And you guys all have access to this document, right?

276
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:30,008
I thought I sent it out, but let me...

277
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:43,788
So, I'm tossing it into the chat right now for the folks who are online.

278
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:46,829
And then I can email it out to everybody.

279
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:53,213
This is just an events calendar that I put together.

280
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,873
Okay, um.

281
00:17:55,854 --> 00:18:02,177
For the elected by my from stuff, because the online city events calendar doesn't seem to be immediately quickly enough.

282
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:02,998
Yeah.

283
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,499
We have to plan ahead more than that.

284
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:05,559
Um.

285
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:22,085
I don't know, but for me, I feel like it's so like, it's awesome to have like that in our calendar.

286
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:24,106
You know what I mean?

287
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:29,928
How we did it not for like the meetings or like, you see, go Climate Equity Council.

288
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:32,490
These would be really nice to have like too.

289
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,772
It might be a good thing for you to like take a look at these and see which ones you guys actually want to be at and add them to your calendars.

290
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:39,613
Yeah.

291
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:40,113
Yeah.

292
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:55,407
Okay, so for electrifying Medford.

293
00:18:57,088 --> 00:19:02,311
I am, so we have the intro flyers translated into the four languages.

294
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:10,675
And the way we're doing it is, so we have one flyer that's in English on one side, and then on the back, it's each of the four languages just in a quick blurb.

295
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:13,829
directing people to the website.

296
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:22,255
And then we have separate flyers with the whole thing in English on one side and then the whole thing in each of the languages, one of the languages.

297
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:24,116
And we have four different versions for that.

298
00:19:26,818 --> 00:19:30,220
Do you want me to give you copies of those flyers?

299
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,682
And would you like me to email them to you or give you printed copies?

300
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:34,963
What would be better?

301
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:37,625
I still have to edit mine and make some changes.

302
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:38,085
Oh, you do?

303
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:38,545
Yeah.

304
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:39,146
Okay.

305
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:39,426
Yeah.

306
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:51,455
on there about me.

307
00:19:51,876 --> 00:20:04,025
I think it would be nice for us to have, you know, if you could email us because let's say if we are in an event, you know, and you're not able to come and maybe you can bring to some and bring with us, you know.

308
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:04,505
Yeah.

309
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:09,308
Natasha and I are going to be next week.

310
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,390
Sort of.

311
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:39,306
uh making like boxes for each of us so like for events we're gonna have good flyers and everything from all the stuff that we need so that way we're able to like go so that'd be good for you know any event that we need we have that there so it's great to be able to put it on and if you ever want printed versions and you can't do it here for some reason like let me know and i can get them for you

312
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:57,003
I'm also getting, we have that decarbonization roadmap, which is like the, all of the information and for each person that we speak to, we pull out the relevant parts for them into a document for them.

313
00:20:57,484 --> 00:21:00,225
We're getting that translated into the four languages.

314
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,352
And I got a quote back from Francis about it this week.

315
00:21:05,052 --> 00:21:06,293
More expensive than I thought.

316
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:07,753
For all four languages, it's like $1,800.

317
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:11,055
Because it's a long document.

318
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:17,518
It's all of the information that people are going to be pulling from for the residents.

319
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:26,883
But it's important that we have it in the languages, so I'm definitely going to do it.

320
00:21:26,923 --> 00:21:28,924
But I was surprised that it was that expensive.

321
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:42,346
And then we're also going to, I figured out how to translate the forms in Smartsheet, the online forms where people can sign up.

322
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:46,507
I haven't done that yet, but I figured out how to do it.

323
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:59,570
Basically, you just have separate forms that are all pointing back to the same document, and there's a way for you to have them going into the same fields, but there's a descriptor

324
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,056
thing there that you can change for each one.

325
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:11,218
So the name of the field is the same, but the descriptor that people actually see on the front end is from a different language.

326
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:11,798
Yeah.

327
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:14,899
So that'll be good.

328
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:18,280
Once we have this, that was the one thing that I was really worried about.

329
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,381
I couldn't figure that out.

330
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:25,703
So that's going to work.

331
00:22:25,723 --> 00:22:29,984
Oh, we've had 16 residents sign up so far.

332
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:32,790
which I'm excited about.

333
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:35,712
I'm following up with them myself right now.

334
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:42,957
And just for this first group of people to work out some of the kinks in the coaching process.

335
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:46,199
But then after this batch, I'll start assigning them to coaches.

336
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:55,184
And there have been people who I've talked to so far who are looking for help immediately.

337
00:22:56,645 --> 00:23:00,228
Either want to switch to a different electricity rate or find a way,

338
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:11,135
funding to help them with past year bills, um, or they're installing solar in their home and they want someone to help them like look at quotes that they got from installers.

339
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:19,985
Um, and we have 12 coaches who finished their training.

340
00:23:20,005 --> 00:23:24,049
Um, and there are others that are still finishing it up online.

341
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:27,905
So I'm excited that we have so many who are trained up now.

342
00:23:27,945 --> 00:23:29,106
That's really exciting.

343
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:29,426
Yeah.

344
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:35,370
But we don't, I'd still like to get Spanish and Portuguese speaking coaches.

345
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:40,853
We do have one Spanish speaking coach, but she's not, that's not her.

346
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:43,094
She's not a native speaker.

347
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:48,297
So I'd really love to get a native speaker of Spanish as well as a Portuguese.

348
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:49,237
So she learned it.

349
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:50,338
Yes.

350
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:50,918
Yeah.

351
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:52,219
And she's a social worker.

352
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,220
So she uses it every day.

353
00:23:55,197 --> 00:23:59,339
Um, but I would still like to get a native speaker.

354
00:23:59,619 --> 00:23:59,899
Yeah.

355
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:06,741
So, if, you know, anybody who might be interested to speak Spanish or speaks Portuguese, please let me know.

356
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:13,704
We still like, onboarding coaches as we go on.

357
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:20,767
Do you have a. Where, like, we can send it to someone like the info.

358
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:25,666
Oh, yes, there's a sign up form for coaches.

359
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:28,767
You're all set with Haitians.

360
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:35,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:41,952
I don't have it in front of me right now, but I will email you the sign up for just that.

362
00:24:41,972 --> 00:24:44,332
I don't know if you know, but we're.

363
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:48,874
Chairman, I mean.

364
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:55,194
We're creating our own, like, Facebook page.

365
00:24:56,555 --> 00:25:02,541
So that way, like, we can, like.

366
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:04,122
That's great.

367
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,464
When do you think that will be on Wednesday?

368
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:09,167
We have a meeting, so we'll see how that goes.

369
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:15,732
Oh, a couple of things I noted down here.

370
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:24,853
Thank you for the recommendation to bring more to events in addition to the forms for people to sign up later.

371
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:27,775
That was definitely more helpful.

372
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:37,083
We're not collecting all of the information that we need to with the online form, but we are having more people sign up for it, so that's awesome.

373
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:42,387
And we are in process of getting an Electrify Medford banner for events.

374
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:57,888
Moving on from Electrify Medford, curbside composting, we've had over 4,000 people sign up for the program.

375
00:25:57,908 --> 00:25:59,268
I have a question on that.

376
00:25:59,548 --> 00:25:59,728
Yeah.

377
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:01,569
Is it too late to register people?

378
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:02,029
No.

379
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:06,891
Because I have a homeowner that I was explaining, so I didn't know anything about that.

380
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:07,851
I'm not even going to read.

381
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:08,352
Yeah.

382
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:08,412
OK.

383
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,613
That would be great.

384
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:17,215
Right now, it is only for people in one- to four-unit homes, so sometimes people

385
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:45,249
might not have heard about it because they're in a larger apartment building or something but like a two-family oh no two families great yeah yeah two families don't work for this yeah in eight like five units or above the city considers that a commercial building and so the city doesn't do a waste services for commercial buildings um i have some door knockers like door hangers upstairs if you guys want to take some of the door hangers and

386
00:26:45,777 --> 00:26:48,358
and distribute them, that would be really helpful.

387
00:26:50,719 --> 00:27:01,203
And there's actually, although I think if you're actually going to go door to door to put door hangers up, they would want you to sign up for like a street or something, but yeah.

388
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:05,984
They have an online form if you wanted to sign up your street or something.

389
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,365
You'd like to do door hangers on your street.

390
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:12,367
Imagine you just go down the entire map.

391
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:16,320
take it out of there.

392
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:26,525
I mean, that's what they're doing.

393
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:28,126
Yeah.

394
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:31,768
Well, I personally don't like people knocking on my door.

395
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:38,951
So well, you don't have to knock on their door that you can just leave the door hanger.

396
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:39,672
It's okay.

397
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:41,641
Yeah.

398
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:41,921
Oh yeah.

399
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:45,463
You don't have to knock on the door.

400
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,564
That's what I'm afraid of.

401
00:27:48,604 --> 00:27:50,405
She's even afraid of my smooch.

402
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:54,406
So after the meeting, like we can go upstairs and I can grab this for you.

403
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,988
And people can sign up anytime.

404
00:27:58,008 --> 00:27:59,068
This is an ongoing thing.

405
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:18,740
Can you grab some extra so we can give it to us on Wednesday when it's here at the meeting, if you don't mind?

406
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,723
Do you want the door hangers or do you just want flyers?

407
00:28:22,123 --> 00:28:24,546
I think the door hangers, I can give some.

408
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:36,549
Moving on to EV charging stations.

409
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,771
So the police station charging stations are online.

410
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:43,392
Those aren't public.

411
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,393
Those are just for the police vehicles.

412
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:48,315
But I'm really excited to do that.

413
00:28:48,455 --> 00:28:54,338
And the police are now looking, we're looking at grants to purchase electric vehicles for them.

414
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:59,360
Not for the cruisers themselves, because those aren't really available right now.

415
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:10,793
But for, like, the detectives' vehicles, just because they drive so much that it's a really great opportunity to reduce the emissions from those cars.

416
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:20,057
And we're also getting recommendations from National Grid for our entire fleet of vehicles.

417
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:28,000
So basically, we send them our inventory of all of our vehicles, and they'll say, here are electric vehicles that we think will

418
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:33,459
Be a good replacement for this, so we're going to replace this.

419
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:38,060
We can say, okay, this might be a good way to replace it.

420
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:41,761
We don't have any right now.

421
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,962
Like, if we promote it, we need to.

422
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:58,937
Yeah, I mean, staff have a lot of staff like, to be personally, but like, see, yeah, we do have that electric street sweeper.

423
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,199
So that's good.

424
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:01,859
That was our 1st.

425
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:09,086
Those things are terrifying.

426
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:09,746
Stop it.

427
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:14,707
I went in one time and then I was like, you know, he was like nine.

428
00:30:15,228 --> 00:30:20,069
And then I turned like I was getting salad and then I turned and he was like, mom, mom, turn around.

429
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:21,069
Like, what's going on?

430
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:23,210
I turned around and he was right behind me, you know, joking.

431
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,710
I was like, I ran.

432
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,291
I was like, bye.

433
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:28,692
Look at the environment.

434
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:29,592
It's just scary.

435
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:37,945
I don't know if the robots in the stores are not for the environment.

436
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:39,526
They put faces on them.

437
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:43,369
No, thank you.

438
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,831
The last thing for charging stations.

439
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:52,334
We're still waiting on National Grid to connect the West Medford parking lot station.

440
00:30:52,354 --> 00:30:57,638
So that has been installed for six months now or more.

441
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:00,825
just waiting for electricity to be connected to it.

442
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:17,993
Then I think my last update is the school's HVAC project, the McGlynn and the Andrews replacements and then the repairs to the smaller schools.

443
00:31:19,453 --> 00:31:22,475
We're still finalizing the contract with the designer for that.

444
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:29,598
We just did a walkthrough of the schools today with the designer for an existing conditions assessment.

445
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,620
And yeah, it's bad.

446
00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:44,486
There are lots of systems that have broken down and we're at least trying to get them repaired so that when students come back to school, they'll have some cooling in place.

447
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:45,047
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

448
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:56,549
There's one time they didn't, they don't have a CVS, so they had to keep the windows.

449
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:59,910
Oh, and it was horrible.

450
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,010
My son would come up.

451
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:04,992
I feel like they should invest in.

452
00:32:05,012 --> 00:32:08,893
I know there are affordable things you can bring in, but those are very expensive.

453
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:09,073
So.

454
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:25,108
Um, there's a, there was a debate of, of, of, you know, if something does break down and we can't, you know, we can't fix it in time or something, are we going to bring in these portable things or what are we going to for those few days?

455
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:30,370
But it's that hot when schools in session just have a, just cancel school.

456
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,050
Yeah.

457
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,831
Um, because they can have a personal, like AC.

458
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:36,892
Like van.

459
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,662
No, like for the window, like, you know, the window that you see.

460
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:49,107
Well, that was another discussion that we had to, again, very expensive and a very temporary solution.

461
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:49,527
Yeah.

462
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:51,209
Yeah.

463
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:53,711
That's that's always the trade off.

464
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:57,454
Something I was like, no, I was pointing at my hand.

465
00:32:57,474 --> 00:32:59,636
You know, we didn't get one.

466
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:00,536
Yeah.

467
00:33:00,717 --> 00:33:04,640
I mean, they should and they should have it there for like, you know, when they need it.

468
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,383
Like is this come on, Brenda.

469
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,023
Can you imagine having like 30 of those in a room?

470
00:33:13,043 --> 00:33:15,245
All you would hear was the buzzing.

471
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:16,025
I know, right?

472
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:17,387
That's true.

473
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:20,349
I mean, yeah, I guess.

474
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,975
I heard, so I thought it was in my head.

475
00:33:25,995 --> 00:33:27,696
I didn't think that.

476
00:33:28,697 --> 00:33:30,739
Because I wear it all the time, I don't notice it.

477
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:34,662
But we're very close to getting that contract signed, so.

478
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:39,078
We should be starting the design very soon.

479
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:54,004
And then starting, we could start some pre-construction probably next spring, and then do the bulk of the construction in the summer so that by next fall, not this fall, next fall, there'll be new systems in place at the end.

480
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:54,724
There's a new one.

481
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:56,985
I can't even read it anymore.

482
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:57,445
I know.

483
00:33:59,826 --> 00:34:03,988
Yeah, well, we're trying to repair the systems right now, so you can laugh at that one.

484
00:34:04,902 --> 00:34:07,324
Is it just for like these schools here or high school as well?

485
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:12,008
Not, the high school hasn't been part of that project so far.

486
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,850
Are there issues in the high school?

487
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:14,750
For heating?

488
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,551
I don't remember.

489
00:34:15,631 --> 00:34:16,512
I mean, for cooling?

490
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:17,392
Yeah, I don't remember that.

491
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:18,734
It would die.

492
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:22,437
And it's bad up there.

493
00:34:22,557 --> 00:34:28,282
Like, it's right, like, you know, like tip of like a mountain, you get like the full effect of the sun.

494
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:28,962
Oh, really?

495
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:31,104
Yeah, like trees would be cool.

496
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:42,305
Well, the high school is going to be either renovated or completely replaced.

497
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:49,068
So we're not replacing the heating and cooling systems now.

498
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,089
Is there an update on that?

499
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:54,971
Not that I have heard.

500
00:34:55,692 --> 00:35:01,375
They are going through the process to apply for the MSBA grant, but there's a sort of a

501
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:06,004
design process that happens before that point.

502
00:35:06,024 --> 00:35:09,767
So you're submitting what the design and the cost is for the data firms.

503
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,810
So there's a committee that's working on that.

504
00:35:14,651 --> 00:35:22,356
And on the Medford events calendar, the meetings of those committee, that committee should show up on there.

505
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:25,899
But I'm not part of it.

506
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:28,361
And I haven't gotten any major updates.

507
00:35:31,232 --> 00:35:36,954
I mean, I will be involved in the project once we get to that point in the process, but it's not at that point yet.

508
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:48,598
They're talking about funding and the MSU grant and stuff.

509
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,079
I think that's it for the city updates.

510
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,221
Any comments, questions, anything on those?

511
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:03,199
Do you guys online?

512
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,601
Coach Palmer, same question?

513
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:08,263
No, ma'am.

514
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:16,049
It looks like the Energy and Environment Committee update, isn't it?

515
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:17,450
Yes.

516
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:25,636
So yeah, so for our July meeting, we met at one of the members' homes.

517
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,841
And he did a tour for everybody of his solar panels and his heat pumps.

518
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:39,603
And we got to talk with him about that whole process with installing those, in addition to our regular meeting.

519
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:40,744
So that was fun.

520
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:55,728
And the Energy and Environment Committee, one of the members, or some of the members, I don't know how many are involved, they're considering applying for Community Preservation Act funding.

521
00:36:56,973 --> 00:37:03,775
to do a study of invasive plants in city parks.

522
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:15,719
And the reason I think they're doing that is it kind of goes hand in hand with the pollinator garden project that they're interested in doing.

523
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:24,081
So yeah, removing invasive plants and then replacing them with native plants that are good for pollinators.

524
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:37,126
And there was a rain garden planting project this morning, actually at Wright's pond where there used to be a rain garden there.

525
00:37:37,246 --> 00:37:41,287
And then I think somebody didn't realize that it was intentional.

526
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:47,049
They thought it was weeds and they mowed it multiple times and destroyed it.

527
00:37:48,509 --> 00:37:48,789
Yeah.

528
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,771
Well, cause if they're native plants, they like maybe, you know, that's intentional.

529
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,023
So they were replanting that this morning and putting signs up to say this is a problem.

530
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:05,326
Can you imagine getting a knock on your door and being like, lady, be a lawn mower.

531
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:06,287
I see it outside.

532
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:08,208
You messed up.

533
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:09,709
This happens more often than you think.

534
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:21,319
There was somebody down along the river who was just weed whacking a bunch of stuff, which to be fair, he was weed whacking invasive plants there.

535
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:21,739
Yeah.

536
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,967
But that wasn't, that's not the way that you get rid of those.

537
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:25,567
Right.

538
00:38:25,647 --> 00:38:26,007
Yeah.

539
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:26,707
Yeah.

540
00:38:27,527 --> 00:38:31,268
And he, the way he was doing it was going to cause erosion into the river.

541
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:31,789
Yeah.

542
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,630
Well meaning, but yeah.

543
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,730
Yeah.

544
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,291
They need to get educated.

545
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:47,393
So that's it for the energy and environment committee.

546
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:59,364
So we want to discuss this year's priorities.

547
00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:01,244
Let me share this.

548
00:39:01,985 --> 00:39:07,987
Can everybody see that?

549
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:08,948
Beautiful.

550
00:39:09,688 --> 00:39:09,948
Yeah.

551
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:12,329
Wait, wait.

552
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:12,689
There we go.

553
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:21,606
Sharpa, you went into it already.

554
00:39:21,646 --> 00:39:22,306
That's great.

555
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:29,308
Yeah, I added those two things at the bottom.

556
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:33,050
I don't know if they're relevant.

557
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,291
But were they extreme heat zones?

558
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:43,494
Talk about areas in Medford that experience increased vulnerability during extreme heat waves.

559
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:48,152
sea level rise and coastal flooding.

560
00:39:48,192 --> 00:39:52,653
You talked about flooding in areas of America that are susceptible to heavy precipitation events.

561
00:39:52,973 --> 00:40:07,398
I think we've looked at the maps of those before, but I remember we haven't really talked about what options can be shared with people.

562
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:09,399
So is that what you're thinking, Sherva?

563
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:14,661
Yeah, just thinking more about like, you know,

564
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:21,934
building social resilience and like offering people resources.

565
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:28,798
If in case these like disasters were to hit, like what can people do?

566
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:30,119
What options do they have?

567
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:35,603
I know that there's the resilience hubs, but I'm just wondering if there's like other things too.

568
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:43,028
Well, I mean, we're working towards the resilience hubs, but also in the meantime, what can be done?

569
00:40:43,848 --> 00:40:44,048
Yes.

570
00:40:46,148 --> 00:40:58,184
Oh, one thing that I learned this week actually about sea level rise is that even if we're not impacted by actual coastal flooding because we have the dam protecting us from that.

571
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:16,478
We could be impacted by groundwater rising because when the sea level rises, it will come in underneath the freshwater and the groundwater because it's denser than the groundwater.

572
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:22,120
So it'll be like seawater underneath, freshwater on top, and then it'll raise it up.

573
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,823
So it'll go into like people's basements, it creates sinkholes, like they're seeing this in places like

574
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:30,224
Salem.

575
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:32,145
I saw one on the news.

576
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:34,606
Yeah, like House of Seven Gables, for instance.

577
00:41:34,686 --> 00:41:34,906
Yeah.

578
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:35,847
Yeah.

579
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:38,168
They're having serious issues with that.

580
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:39,289
Screaming.

581
00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:40,309
Yeah.

582
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:45,051
And I hadn't considered that before as a as an impact of sea level rising.

583
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:45,371
So.

584
00:41:45,391 --> 00:41:50,954
Yes, I think it's one thing.

585
00:41:50,994 --> 00:41:51,895
It's another thing.

586
00:41:54,716 --> 00:41:59,018
So, yeah, so the priorities that we have in here right now, electrify Medford,

587
00:42:00,096 --> 00:42:04,439
composting, stormwater education for residents.

588
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:12,065
That might be, Charbel, that might be sort of the same thing as the sea level rise and coastal flooding.

589
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:20,632
Just water issues related to climate change.

590
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,556
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

591
00:42:25,616 --> 00:42:26,276
Can you repeat it?

592
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:28,418
Yeah, so number four here,

593
00:42:30,022 --> 00:42:32,363
And the fourth one here, stormwater education.

594
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:40,466
It would be similar outreach work, I think, to sea level rise and coastal flooding.

595
00:42:41,406 --> 00:42:42,126
Right, right.

596
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:43,307
I think those could be combined.

597
00:42:43,847 --> 00:42:45,288
Yeah, I didn't see that, sorry.

598
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:57,072
We have school outreach, city policy, statewide policy, state, federal policy.

599
00:42:58,935 --> 00:43:13,425
City building upgrades, city transportation projects, EV charging stations, blue bike stations, and then the extreme lead zones and the sea level rise and coastal flooding.

600
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:22,792
So is there anything else that people want as priorities that's not on this list that we should add?

601
00:43:35,728 --> 00:43:36,489
Let's see.

602
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:38,269
Temperature.

603
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,471
I'm saying let's see temperature.

604
00:43:52,235 --> 00:43:58,018
I mean, maybe I can't like see like the thing that's like so loud.

605
00:43:58,913 --> 00:44:01,654
But, um, do they have anything for like, like thunder?

606
00:44:01,674 --> 00:44:05,576
Like, you know, like, you have like a horrible, like, thunderstorm.

607
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:07,197
Oh, like power outages.

608
00:44:07,237 --> 00:44:07,417
Yeah.

609
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:29,786
Well, we have the big heat right now, you know, and another day I was going to the city hall, and I walked from the theater to the city hall, and I noticed that Medford needs desperately some more trees, more shade.

610
00:44:30,566 --> 00:44:39,608
You know, it's something that, you know, we're looking at because, man, it was horrible.

611
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:44,822
it will stop to find a shade at all over the area.

612
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:55,744
I think one of the ways that you can get people involved in that, well, so there's Trees Medford that does a lot of work about preserving trees.

613
00:44:56,824 --> 00:45:06,526
And they also give out trees, I don't think, at least once a year, they actually give out saplings for free to anybody who wants them.

614
00:45:07,186 --> 00:45:10,227
So publicizing that, I think could be really helpful.

615
00:45:10,927 --> 00:45:11,247
And then

616
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:25,826
There's also things like the adopt a tree program where you can sign up to make sure that they, that a tree gets watered during the summer, like a new sapling that was, that was planted in the, in the sidewalk.

617
00:45:26,286 --> 00:45:27,566
You just reminded me of something.

618
00:45:27,606 --> 00:45:28,926
This is crazy.

619
00:45:29,466 --> 00:45:37,268
So next to my house, we had a tree and I don't know if it was my dad in the public city.

620
00:45:37,288 --> 00:45:39,388
Can you get it to talk about?

621
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:40,765
Is that okay?

622
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:46,688
Well, I mean, obviously it's okay that we did it, but I'm saying like, you know, it kind of sucks.

623
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:51,011
I liked having the tree there, but it blocked the house, obviously.

624
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:53,432
Was it in bad shape?

625
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:55,133
Like it was going to fall on it or?

626
00:45:55,193 --> 00:45:56,814
I don't know.

627
00:45:56,914 --> 00:46:00,796
I don't think there's a tree that would be in the way.

628
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:05,518
But we still have one that's right in front of the house that still blocks the view.

629
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,560
But we need to ask permission to cut a tree, right?

630
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:11,604
Yeah, that hasn't been passed yet though.

631
00:46:11,624 --> 00:46:15,707
Well, the tree ordinance I was, I looked in that into that after the last meeting.

632
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:20,830
And there's an updated version that's going to be sent to city council.

633
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,172
That's what trees Medford told me that they didn't have it ready yet.

634
00:46:24,392 --> 00:46:28,435
So they're going to send it to me when they do have it ready and I can share with everybody.

635
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:32,057
Yeah, I know that you guys, I think it was you guys.

636
00:46:32,765 --> 00:46:37,447
Like, you know how the sidewalks have like the little square that you, that they, that like, yeah.

637
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:37,828
Okay.

638
00:46:37,848 --> 00:46:38,928
So that's the city thing, right?

639
00:46:39,028 --> 00:46:39,308
Yeah.

640
00:46:39,368 --> 00:46:58,278
So like on my street of the other, like a little further, there's like in the summer and like in the spring, there's like beautiful, like cherry kind of like cherry blossom trees are like white, pink, like, you know, are those like, or do you're saying tree trees, like green trees?

641
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:01,368
Oh, no, those are great.

642
00:47:01,628 --> 00:47:09,491
I think the city's policy is to try to have as diverse a group of trees that they're planting around the city as possible.

643
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:16,293
Because in the past, I think there were issues, I don't know about in Medford, but in other cities at least,

644
00:47:17,102 --> 00:47:24,408
issues where they planted one kind of tree, and then there was like a disease or a pest or something, and they lost a whole bunch of trees all at once.

645
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:30,674
So I've tried many different kinds of trees as I can, but I just always wondered.

646
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:34,937
I think Sonia dropped a lobster.

647
00:47:34,957 --> 00:47:36,999
Yeah, I don't know.

648
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:38,640
I just thought that was like funny, right?

649
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,203
Because like, well, you see normal trees, and then I saw like those trees, and I'm like, what?

650
00:47:43,084 --> 00:47:45,226
Why are they planted not the same ones, you know?

651
00:47:46,455 --> 00:47:51,718
But it makes the, what's it called?

652
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:54,180
The street look nice.

653
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,361
Do you know what I mean?

654
00:47:55,401 --> 00:47:55,641
Yeah.

655
00:47:56,261 --> 00:48:00,704
So that is another plus that we should help.

656
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,886
The aesthetic part of it.

657
00:48:03,526 --> 00:48:04,927
People are all about that, yes or no.

658
00:48:06,235 --> 00:48:08,316
It's a tree that looks aesthetically nice.

659
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:11,918
There's one tree that my uncle's trying to take off.

660
00:48:11,978 --> 00:48:13,578
I'm like, don't do that.

661
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:17,740
It is blocking kind of like the second line.

662
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,901
Yeah, you know that tree?

663
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:20,802
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:26,104
I was down in Georgia earlier this year.

665
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:30,566
And there's a city, City of Savannah.

666
00:48:31,518 --> 00:49:01,408
yeah the entire city is like full of trees beautiful yeah and you know you know it gets hot down there like hotter than here but it's like you don't really feel the the heat because the trees the trees everywhere and they like like the branches like uh they're like um i forget what they call the trees that's that's that's true there's not a lot of looking for like mystery

667
00:49:01,715 --> 00:49:03,116
There's not a lot of like shade.

668
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:04,777
Like, yeah.

669
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:06,258
Yeah.

670
00:49:06,558 --> 00:49:08,659
And definitely in certain areas of Medford.

671
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:09,019
Yeah.

672
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:09,640
Yeah.

673
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:17,584
Plus it would, it would be better if it would be good for like the, the pavement, you know, it cools the pavement.

674
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:23,748
So, so that there's not as much like, uh, I guess, uh, what's the word.

675
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:32,202
Um, you're just like, you're walking on like just the heat island effect there.

676
00:49:32,242 --> 00:49:32,542
Right.

677
00:49:32,642 --> 00:49:33,142
Yeah.

678
00:49:33,422 --> 00:49:33,682
Yeah.

679
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:49,072
Um, are you interested in talking to the tree warden about how the city makes decisions about where trees are planted and things like that?

680
00:49:49,492 --> 00:49:49,732
Yeah.

681
00:49:49,772 --> 00:49:49,933
Yeah.

682
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:58,352
Yeah, I'll talk to her and see if she can make it to one of our meetings.

683
00:50:00,073 --> 00:50:03,915
The tree warden, that's a that's an awesome title.

684
00:50:03,955 --> 00:50:04,796
I know, right?

685
00:50:04,816 --> 00:50:07,217
The tree warden.

686
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:11,259
You've been to the house.

687
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,421
The whole, like, building is flowers, right?

688
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:16,402
And it's like a ward.

689
00:50:17,503 --> 00:50:19,564
And, like, they use pollen for psychiatric stuff.

690
00:50:19,764 --> 00:50:21,085
It's a little crazy in there.

691
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:26,611
All right, anything else people want to add to the list?

692
00:50:30,995 --> 00:50:43,708
Where are we to make it bigger?

693
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:54,800
Maybe if I stop sharing it, just a second, I'll try to make it bigger and then stop sharing and then share it again.

694
00:50:54,820 --> 00:51:10,771
Just because my brain is on the last, you know.

695
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:20,524
It's kind of creepy being here in City Hall.

696
00:51:20,724 --> 00:51:24,445
It was so dark.

697
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:25,946
It was like lights off.

698
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:27,787
Yeah, I turned on the lights.

699
00:51:27,927 --> 00:51:31,008
Maybe the maybe the motion detector turned off again.

700
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:33,749
I went in the elevator.

701
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:37,971
I was like, I threw my flashlight.

702
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,972
And then I ran into the hallway.

703
00:51:40,992 --> 00:51:42,753
I only turned the lights on in the stairs.

704
00:51:42,873 --> 00:51:43,233
Okay.

705
00:51:43,253 --> 00:51:44,253
Yeah, no.

706
00:51:44,273 --> 00:51:45,514
I was like, run!

707
00:51:47,183 --> 00:51:47,383
Yep.

708
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,005
Okay.

709
00:51:50,245 --> 00:51:58,831
Oh, my sister has a little compost like thing outside her house.

710
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:00,632
It's crazy.

711
00:52:01,293 --> 00:52:03,334
I'm trying to get one of the neighbors.

712
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:10,339
Okay, so if there's nothing else to add to the list right now, we can always change it in the future if you want to.

713
00:52:10,459 --> 00:52:12,901
But what is a lot of stuff.

714
00:52:14,475 --> 00:52:20,278
What areas in particular would you like to focus on?

715
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:21,859
With the composing, right?

716
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,621
So they put food in it, right?

717
00:52:26,962 --> 00:52:28,323
Yeah, food waste.

718
00:52:28,363 --> 00:52:33,747
So what do they do with that?

719
00:52:33,787 --> 00:52:42,292
The process of composting is like basically it decomposes in a hot environment, like in a big pile, basically.

720
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,063
And then it turns it into into dirt, essentially.

721
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:47,645
Yeah.

722
00:52:47,885 --> 00:52:55,672
So, like, one of the things with Garbage to Garden, which is what we're using, is you can order compost from them.

723
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,336
They get a reduced rate from what they would normally be selling it.

724
00:53:01,275 --> 00:53:02,135
use it in your garden.

725
00:53:02,155 --> 00:53:06,496
So is, because I just, I know he's going to ask me all these questions.

726
00:53:06,636 --> 00:53:13,077
Is there a specific type, like are they doing just veggies and roots and meat?

727
00:53:13,117 --> 00:53:18,678
So if you were doing it in your backyard, you could only do like fruits and veggies and stuff like that.

728
00:53:19,818 --> 00:53:28,900
But because they're doing it in a commercial composting facility where the temperatures get hotter, you can do meat, bones, everything.

729
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,180
Yeah.

730
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:29,700
Yeah.

731
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:37,148
No human bodies or anything like that.

732
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:38,049
No, for real.

733
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:38,869
How do you know, Brenda?

734
00:53:38,909 --> 00:53:41,591
So with the meat, can they put it in a plastic?

735
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:43,472
Because they'll be like magnets.

736
00:53:43,592 --> 00:53:45,453
No, it has to be all like raw.

737
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:50,377
Yeah, they'll do magnets and stuff like that.

738
00:53:50,677 --> 00:53:53,038
There are biodegradable bags.

739
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:58,562
And so that's what I use to like line the inside of my compost bin.

740
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:06,824
So then they just take the bag out and the bin itself stays cleaner.

741
00:54:08,385 --> 00:54:10,986
My question is though, really, how do they know?

742
00:54:13,436 --> 00:54:14,777
Like for real.

743
00:54:15,637 --> 00:54:17,038
I know, but it's crazy.

744
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:17,878
Yeah.

745
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,340
I've never been to a commercial composting facility.

746
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:20,840
I don't know.

747
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,182
Like how do they like value what they get?

748
00:54:24,422 --> 00:54:26,183
You know what I mean?

749
00:54:26,283 --> 00:54:29,405
Food waste, not human waste.

750
00:54:29,585 --> 00:54:31,166
You know, that would be weird.

751
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:32,706
I know it's cycling.

752
00:54:32,726 --> 00:54:35,228
So Natasha, I mean, not here.

753
00:54:35,248 --> 00:54:35,508
I hope.

754
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:46,988
Okay, so sure, you put your name.

755
00:54:49,129 --> 00:54:54,032
With areas that you're particularly interested put my name on the trees.

756
00:54:54,192 --> 00:54:55,432
Yeah, and the trees.

757
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:58,694
Yeah, me too for the trees.

758
00:55:11,986 --> 00:55:13,286
Sorry, what did you say?

759
00:55:13,326 --> 00:55:14,667
The same one.

760
00:55:15,927 --> 00:55:24,710
Okay, with this city transportation, maybe I need to put my name on it because I don't like really what's going on here in Massachusetts.

761
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:32,313
What, in particular, is it the train?

762
00:55:33,093 --> 00:55:34,753
I think that's always going to be an issue.

763
00:55:34,813 --> 00:55:36,494
Unfortunately, it's sad to say.

764
00:55:37,194 --> 00:55:37,874
It's hard.

765
00:55:40,264 --> 00:55:42,685
It's affecting people's work schedule.

766
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:47,226
Cause when you're, especially when you're working in the city, it's like, there's always an issue.

767
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:48,566
You're being late to work.

768
00:55:48,946 --> 00:56:01,149
But that's like, but this is how I, cause I, I commuted literally all my life since 2018, 19 around there.

769
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:09,431
So for me, like, I know that at the end of the day, it's all like, you're dealing with like people.

770
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:17,013
or, you know, maybe link to work or not even link to work, just like things like come up, you know what I mean?

771
00:56:17,053 --> 00:56:18,134
It's a human error.

772
00:56:18,534 --> 00:56:27,238
So yeah, it's human error, unless like a lot of it's underfunding, but well, that too, you know, so that that plays a part, you know what I mean?

773
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:34,182
So it's like, every time there was a delay or something, I didn't stress about it because I'm like, at the end of the day, thus,

774
00:56:34,818 --> 00:56:35,378
It happens.

775
00:56:35,478 --> 00:56:39,899
My boyfriend just started a job at South station a couple of weeks, near South station a couple of weeks ago.

776
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:45,680
And his commute is either has been 45 minutes one day and an hour and a half another day.

777
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,840
So he was like, how do I plan on this?

778
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,160
Yeah.

779
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,801
No, I know that happened to me too.

780
00:56:50,901 --> 00:56:51,461
It's wild.

781
00:56:52,361 --> 00:57:03,103
I think a lot of it is also just how like just the overall infrastructure of like Boston and how they handle like the traffic.

782
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:07,380
It's like very inefficient in some areas.

783
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:16,226
Like in Cambridge, for example, like they make the streets so tight because they're adding like, they added the bike lanes.

784
00:57:17,627 --> 00:57:28,054
And that literally leaves like no room for the cars to like, like, let's say, let's say a fire truck was coming through or police car was coming through.

785
00:57:28,514 --> 00:57:33,097
There's nowhere the cars can go to let them through, which just causes more traffic.

786
00:57:34,443 --> 00:57:54,260
i like the places where they have like the combo bus bike lane so it's a lane that's just for buses and bicycles basically and then the buses are able to move through the city faster yeah but i mean that only leaves one other lane for the other cars so

787
00:57:56,122 --> 00:58:01,984
Yeah, there's pros and cons for public transportation.

788
00:58:03,765 --> 00:58:23,973
So I think the city is involved in boards and advocacy groups that try to advocate with the state to try to get better service for the T. For this, this would probably be more

789
00:58:24,828 --> 00:58:29,790
related to city road projects.

790
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:31,811
Yeah, exactly.

791
00:58:31,831 --> 00:58:39,214
Or, you know, bus stops, bus routes and things.

792
00:58:39,294 --> 00:58:41,375
So the city doesn't run the buses.

793
00:58:41,495 --> 00:58:49,939
They can't, they can't, they can't control the MBTA buses, but we do, the city does advocate for those too.

794
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:52,140
And so that's something that's probably more

795
00:58:53,922 --> 00:59:04,084
Specific that we can give feedback on is like, particular routes and things like that because recently I was talking to the transportation director here and he was saying that.

796
00:59:04,904 --> 00:59:07,945
Years ago, a couple of couple of years ago, I think they.

797
00:59:08,685 --> 00:59:13,266
Change the bus routes in in Medford as part of an overall, like.

798
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:16,987
System wide restructuring of the bus routes.

799
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:24,592
And I think the city was promised like an express route or something like that as part of that.

800
00:59:25,392 --> 00:59:31,854
And like some things were cut back and everyone was upset about it, but then their city was also promised like an express route or something.

801
00:59:32,054 --> 00:59:33,734
And it doesn't, I don't think that's here.

802
00:59:33,814 --> 00:59:40,576
So that's part of life that the city advocates for, but the state is trying to get those sorts of routes.

803
00:59:40,716 --> 00:59:43,797
So that's fine.

804
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:46,518
I don't think it's ever going to be as perfect.

805
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,931
than it should be.

806
00:59:50,112 --> 00:59:53,714
It's frustrating.

807
00:59:53,774 --> 01:00:04,321
When I first came to the city, I'm not going to say how many years ago, it was what?

808
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:06,843
It's so much better than it is now.

809
01:00:08,444 --> 01:00:08,804
Yeah.

810
01:00:09,545 --> 01:00:10,045
Yes.

811
01:00:10,245 --> 01:00:11,546
And cleaner, I'm sure.

812
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:18,799
I don't know about that, but it definitely worked for me.

813
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:25,245
I used to take it when I used to go to high school and that was many years ago.

814
01:00:25,765 --> 01:00:35,273
So anything else that people want to sort of highlight as areas that you want to focus on?

815
01:00:37,534 --> 01:00:40,657
I think the extreme beat films too.

816
01:00:42,098 --> 01:00:42,498
Yeah.

817
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:43,459
Oops.

818
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:51,082
So besides the cooling station, what's there?

819
01:00:51,102 --> 01:00:52,143
I like the storm.

820
01:01:12,387 --> 01:01:21,914
I think also city extreme heat zones as well.

821
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:29,200
City policy.

822
01:01:35,645 --> 01:01:42,090
It's crazy because with climate change, you have to think of things that are immediate and then bigger picture.

823
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:44,551
You know what I mean?

824
01:01:44,651 --> 01:01:44,851
Yeah.

825
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:45,651
Yeah.

826
01:01:45,972 --> 01:01:50,235
Like with the school HVAC upgrades, like we need these to be working.

827
01:01:50,295 --> 01:01:53,297
We need the AC to be working and the students come back this year.

828
01:01:53,317 --> 01:01:53,397
Yeah.

829
01:01:53,497 --> 01:01:56,879
But then we also have to do the bigger fix.

830
01:01:56,959 --> 01:02:00,342
So this is a bigger replacement assistance.

831
01:02:04,985 --> 01:02:07,687
You said the C-level res, what was the C-level res for?

832
01:02:08,188 --> 01:02:08,628
Yeah.

833
01:02:08,788 --> 01:02:10,089
I would probably combine those.

834
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:12,931
I think that people would think of them together.

835
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,300
So.

836
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:38,066
All right, does this look, does this look, the ones where people have actually put down their names, do these look like good high-level priorities?

837
01:02:39,007 --> 01:02:42,629
I'll still give you updates about Electrify Metro, but it sounds like we don't really want to be

838
01:02:44,255 --> 01:02:45,616
involved in that.

839
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:47,979
What do you mean?

840
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:50,501
I didn't even see that there.

841
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:52,463
What about school outreach?

842
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:55,425
Yeah, we should try to get the youth into this.

843
01:03:07,754 --> 01:03:09,435
Oh, only me?

844
01:03:10,696 --> 01:03:24,204
She just didn't put tab.

845
01:03:24,584 --> 01:03:30,588
So city building upgrades, I'll keep you updated on that and it sounds like you don't want to be actively involved in that.

846
01:03:31,529 --> 01:03:34,691
Same with EV charging stations and blue bikes, keep you updated, but not.

847
01:03:35,568 --> 01:03:39,211
Unless I get one of those cars.

848
01:03:39,231 --> 01:03:42,974
Cool.

849
01:03:43,915 --> 01:03:44,995
And power outages.

850
01:03:45,496 --> 01:03:47,097
Oh, yeah.

851
01:03:47,617 --> 01:03:48,979
No, that one, yes.

852
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:49,079
Yeah.

853
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:53,822
I almost feel like that could be kind of combined with, you know, it's like extreme heat.

854
01:03:53,882 --> 01:03:56,504
Yeah, that's very, very similar.

855
01:03:59,387 --> 01:04:03,610
Power outages with heat, but it's also like when it's like

856
01:04:04,497 --> 01:04:06,659
That's why you put it down with severe weather.

857
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:06,879
Yeah.

858
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:07,419
Yeah.

859
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:10,922
Like the thunder, everything.

860
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:12,163
Yeah.

861
01:04:12,324 --> 01:04:21,511
I think that that kind of goes hand in hand with extreme heat because the more, the hotter the air is, the more moisture it can contain.

862
01:04:21,751 --> 01:04:26,315
And so then you're more likely to have thunderstorms and things like that, hurricanes.

863
01:04:26,415 --> 01:04:28,977
Yeah.

864
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:31,600
Okay.

865
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,121
So I'll probably, what I'll,

866
01:04:33,879 --> 01:04:43,842
do, I'll combine a couple of them that we talked about, and then the ones where, you know, more people have expressed interest and then we'll put them sort of at the top and then, yeah.

867
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:48,224
Do y'all care about the transportation projects?

868
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:49,765
Chabelle?

869
01:04:50,325 --> 01:04:50,725
I do.

870
01:04:50,745 --> 01:04:54,086
I mean, honestly, you could put my name for all of these.

871
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:55,026
I mean, same.

872
01:04:55,126 --> 01:04:57,927
It just seemed like, it seemed like a bit redundant.

873
01:04:58,147 --> 01:04:59,368
It's a lot though.

874
01:04:59,408 --> 01:04:59,548
Yeah.

875
01:05:04,348 --> 01:05:14,690
I'm saying more like, I'm just talking recency, recency bias, because of the heat, you know, so that's the first thing on my mind.

876
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:16,050
Yeah, that's true.

877
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:29,553
Can we can we talk about that a little bit, actually, because so I feel like the Office of Outreach and Prevention did some communication about heat, like cooling centers.

878
01:05:30,273 --> 01:05:32,974
I haven't been involved in those conversations.

879
01:05:33,074 --> 01:05:33,214
So

880
01:05:33,718 --> 01:05:40,103
I would love to learn more about what is going on with pooling centers and what people can do.

881
01:05:42,946 --> 01:05:44,767
Verna, you have that list of events.

882
01:05:45,488 --> 01:05:46,669
Which one's the one?

883
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:51,933
I don't know if you went to one that we did this year.

884
01:05:52,714 --> 01:05:55,116
That was for health.

885
01:05:55,176 --> 01:05:57,138
Do you remember the one that you couldn't go?

886
01:05:57,198 --> 01:05:58,018
I keep talking about it.

887
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:00,020
That I couldn't go?

888
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:00,480
Yeah.

889
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:02,242
Charbel, do you remember the one?

890
01:06:03,317 --> 01:06:08,859
where you met Jessica at the library.

891
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,180
Remember when you met my cousin from Ecuador when she came?

892
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,641
Yeah.

893
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:16,942
Okay, do you remember in the library, what event was that?

894
01:06:22,464 --> 01:06:29,426
It had like everything about kids, health, us, like,

895
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:31,793
also like physical activities.

896
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:35,417
There's some kind of a job fair, resource fair.

897
01:06:36,678 --> 01:06:37,619
But I have to do it.

898
01:06:37,779 --> 01:06:40,262
It's rather like counseling.

899
01:06:43,585 --> 01:06:44,005
Yeah.

900
01:06:44,025 --> 01:06:49,791
I know exactly what you're talking about, but I don't remember the name.

901
01:06:49,812 --> 01:06:52,094
Maybe if I check my calendar.

902
01:06:53,526 --> 01:06:56,147
I was gonna say, if we had that, that would be perfect for it.

903
01:06:56,527 --> 01:06:57,068
We weren't there.

904
01:06:57,128 --> 01:06:58,088
Those resources.

905
01:06:58,128 --> 01:06:59,489
Yeah, you weren't there.

906
01:07:00,109 --> 01:07:04,070
This was like, when did my cousin come home?

907
01:07:04,351 --> 01:07:08,392
No, no, but remember my cousin, health and wellness fair.

908
01:07:09,153 --> 01:07:11,253
That was, it was March 30th.

909
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:16,456
I don't know.

910
01:07:17,336 --> 01:07:19,697
And like what resources did you share around like,

911
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:26,333
So we didn't have that at the time, but that's what I'm saying.

912
01:07:26,453 --> 01:07:43,023
We had traction there, so that's a good, like, you know, people came in and we had like the passport, like a cage, where like they had to go to each like table and stamp it.

913
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:46,365
So that way like they get like something or like, I don't know.

914
01:07:47,293 --> 01:08:12,450
or like they're able to win something but point is like a lot of people kept going to all of the stations so that way you know you get your information yeah so that's like a good we should be doing that to be honest i know and like our event and stuff yeah because that way you're you're like the kids forcefully like take their kids their parents and stuff around the block and say like okay like we can give them like even like

915
01:08:12,947 --> 01:08:19,228
You know, we're ordering like the stress balls, the pens and all that stuff.

916
01:08:19,348 --> 01:08:21,669
Yeah, anything like that.

917
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:30,191
So I saw that there were three pooling centers right now, right?

918
01:08:30,211 --> 01:08:38,153
And there's the library, there's the police station, and there's... Where's the third one?

919
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:38,893
Here.

920
01:08:40,353 --> 01:08:41,054
Is here one of them?

921
01:08:44,747 --> 01:08:47,348
City Hall is not one of them.

922
01:08:49,988 --> 01:08:58,450
The library, the police station, the Western Community Center maybe?

923
01:08:58,670 --> 01:08:59,631
Oh, the senior center.

924
01:08:59,651 --> 01:09:01,631
The senior center, so yeah.

925
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:09,873
But those are... How crazy is it that I just Googled this and it went up the city webpage, but

926
01:09:11,017 --> 01:09:14,839
I don't know what it is that like, like residents ask us stuff.

927
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:18,881
And I'm like, didn't go on the website.

928
01:09:19,161 --> 01:09:19,501
Yeah.

929
01:09:19,661 --> 01:09:20,182
Point blank.

930
01:09:20,202 --> 01:09:23,563
I mean, some people do, but the people who are asking.

931
01:09:23,903 --> 01:09:24,304
Yeah.

932
01:09:24,384 --> 01:09:24,704
Yeah.

933
01:09:24,944 --> 01:09:33,268
But like, sometimes like things are like, can't even open the tabs, like things, cause there's so much information.

934
01:09:33,588 --> 01:09:34,188
You know what I mean?

935
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:34,288
Yeah.

936
01:09:34,368 --> 01:09:34,589
Yeah.

937
01:09:36,121 --> 01:09:38,542
But none of those are open overnight, are they?

938
01:09:38,822 --> 01:09:42,524
No, so this one, the police one, is available 24 hours a day.

939
01:09:43,244 --> 01:09:45,705
The Medford Senior Center is from 8 a.m.

940
01:09:45,745 --> 01:09:49,347
to 6 p.m., and then the Medford Public Library is from 9 a.m.

941
01:09:49,847 --> 01:09:51,208
to 9 p.m.

942
01:09:51,368 --> 01:09:59,251
on July 26th, 27th, and then there's just certain times and certain days.

943
01:09:59,871 --> 01:10:03,113
In addition to visiting police centers, residents are encouraged to follow

944
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:06,891
other extreme hot weather safety tips.

945
01:10:07,832 --> 01:10:10,713
That's what they tell us.

946
01:10:11,593 --> 01:10:16,996
And then we actually have... People don't really use the cooling centers that we have set up.

947
01:10:17,056 --> 01:10:18,897
Or maybe because people don't know about it.

948
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:25,099
Because I bet you a thousand bucks I go to my mom and my sister, they don't even know how we've lived here.

949
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:27,660
And then some of them probably can't get there.

950
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,501
Yeah.

951
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:29,621
They're seniors.

952
01:10:31,442 --> 01:10:31,702
Yeah.

953
01:10:32,122 --> 01:10:33,483
People who don't have transportation.

954
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:38,072
Yeah.

955
01:10:38,372 --> 01:10:43,935
Sorry, we dove into a topic there rather than just doing the priorities.

956
01:10:44,035 --> 01:10:44,755
Sorry about that.

957
01:10:45,135 --> 01:10:53,800
All right, so did these, this is a lot of priorities, but we'll have it as a reference and we can kind of prioritize based on the number of people who are interested in something.

958
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,601
Yeah.

959
01:10:56,381 --> 01:11:01,343
So you can do maybe like the ones that have three and then the ones that have two and then, yeah.

960
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:03,689
Cool.

961
01:11:03,849 --> 01:11:04,129
Okay.

962
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,070
Anything else on the priorities?

963
01:11:08,391 --> 01:11:15,133
No, but can you share them with us in an email just in case we think of anything else?

964
01:11:15,153 --> 01:11:19,615
Yeah, I shared it with the agenda, but I can share the minutes and stuff too.

965
01:11:21,035 --> 01:11:26,497
Okay.

966
01:11:33,401 --> 01:11:36,462
I think the only thing we have left is new business.

967
01:11:40,324 --> 01:11:42,385
Um, it says future meeting topic.

968
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:43,165
Okay.

969
01:11:43,245 --> 01:11:43,526
Yeah.

970
01:11:44,426 --> 01:11:47,927
So.

971
01:11:47,947 --> 01:11:55,671
1 thing that I think you've got someone had asked about it a previous meeting was doing like a condensed, like, electrify Medford coach training.

972
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,752
Just to, like, learn about the technologies that.

973
01:11:59,513 --> 01:12:00,333
That we're talking about.

974
01:12:00,944 --> 01:12:03,626
That would take up a meeting by itself though.

975
01:12:03,727 --> 01:12:05,728
Are you guys interested in doing that?

976
01:12:05,748 --> 01:12:06,729
Okay.

977
01:12:06,809 --> 01:12:07,950
I mean, it's one meeting.

978
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:10,513
It's not like, yeah, a recurring thing.

979
01:12:10,533 --> 01:12:16,398
So I think it's worth it.

980
01:12:16,698 --> 01:12:19,461
Didn't we come up with ideas for the table too?

981
01:12:19,481 --> 01:12:23,304
Or are we coming up with ideas to like, get more traction?

982
01:12:24,025 --> 01:12:25,005
So like, people remember?

983
01:12:25,025 --> 01:12:27,728
Because we talked about the dollhouse.

984
01:12:28,995 --> 01:12:32,516
And then like we were talking, remember I said something about the thunder?

985
01:12:34,157 --> 01:12:35,257
Yeah, yeah.

986
01:12:35,337 --> 01:12:35,537
Okay.

987
01:12:35,577 --> 01:12:35,797
Yeah.

988
01:12:35,877 --> 01:12:36,177
Oh yeah.

989
01:12:36,197 --> 01:12:39,559
I'm just saying where you're at with that.

990
01:12:41,499 --> 01:12:42,119
Yeah.

991
01:12:42,299 --> 01:12:44,220
I'm not very far with that.

992
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,360
I'm getting the banner.

993
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:48,942
That's as far as I am with that right now.

994
01:12:48,962 --> 01:12:58,165
No, I'm saying like, you know, sometimes there's weeks where we need more like hours, even though like right now for me, I have a lot.

995
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,964
That could be something that we can help with.

996
01:13:02,365 --> 01:13:03,106
Oh, yeah.

997
01:13:03,206 --> 01:13:06,449
That would be awesome.

998
01:13:06,669 --> 01:13:08,091
We should talk outside of this then.

999
01:13:08,271 --> 01:13:13,196
Yeah.

1000
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:20,383
And it sounds like you came up here asking the tree warden to come to a future meeting.

1001
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:33,235
I don't know if the transportation director is going to have time to come to a meeting himself.

1002
01:13:33,255 --> 01:13:36,076
It's sort of a one-man office.

1003
01:13:36,136 --> 01:13:37,737
Yeah, that's crazy.

1004
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:46,120
But maybe I can get updates from him and bring them to future meetings and then bring questions back to him.

1005
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:46,860
Yeah.

1006
01:13:49,002 --> 01:13:52,343
Maybe give them an option to zoom in for at least.

1007
01:13:53,403 --> 01:14:01,586
There's a lot of evening meetings too, so I think this thing might be like an evening meeting.

1008
01:14:02,246 --> 01:14:02,546
Yeah.

1009
01:14:03,407 --> 01:14:09,669
Anything else that we want to have to queue up for a future meeting?

1010
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:24,233
Would you say that you might want to look at the school?

1011
01:14:25,553 --> 01:14:27,233
About the school?

1012
01:14:29,074 --> 01:14:40,136
About the school average?

1013
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:41,417
The HVAC upgrades?

1014
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:42,937
The heating and cooling system?

1015
01:14:42,977 --> 01:14:43,337
Yeah, yeah.

1016
01:14:43,457 --> 01:14:46,818
Are we getting updates from that from you?

1017
01:14:47,338 --> 01:14:47,578
Oh, yeah.

1018
01:14:47,618 --> 01:14:48,859
That would just be my opinion.

1019
01:14:48,919 --> 01:14:49,219
Okay.

1020
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:49,639
Yeah.

1021
01:14:50,179 --> 01:14:50,439
Yeah.

1022
01:14:50,829 --> 01:14:54,591
I'm working with the assistant superintendent on that.

1023
01:14:55,431 --> 01:14:57,452
And the facilities director for the schools.

1024
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:07,198
Actually, and the city facilities director, because it's a big project, so he's getting involved, too.

1025
01:15:07,278 --> 01:15:07,818
Yeah.

1026
01:15:08,078 --> 01:15:09,779
Do you have a question?

1027
01:15:10,059 --> 01:15:10,239
No.

1028
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:11,420
Charbel?

1029
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,701
I'm all set.

1030
01:15:15,342 --> 01:15:15,782
Thank you.

1031
01:15:16,622 --> 01:15:16,823
Cool.

1032
01:15:22,109 --> 01:15:22,589
Thank you.

1033
01:15:22,849 --> 01:15:26,351
All right, so we need a motion to adjourn, if there's nothing else.

1034
01:15:27,031 --> 01:15:29,232
Motion for the meeting to adjourn.

1035
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:30,753
Everybody?

1036
01:15:31,413 --> 01:15:32,373
Motion granted.

1037
01:15:33,414 --> 01:15:35,154

1039
01:15:39,056 --> 01:15:41,057
Yes, that's unanimous.

1040
01:15:41,097 --> 01:15:44,098
There are only three right now, so.

1041
01:15:44,138 --> 01:15:45,059
