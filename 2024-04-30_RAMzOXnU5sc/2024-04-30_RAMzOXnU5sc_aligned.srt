Enjoy.

139
01:04:07,256 --> 01:04:09,177
We do not have any reports of subcommittees.

140
01:04:10,165 --> 01:04:12,706
five reports under our reports of superintendent.

141
01:04:12,826 --> 01:04:17,748
First up is Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, our superintendent, with her updates and comments.

142
01:04:20,229 --> 01:04:20,809
Good evening.

143
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:31,714
I hope that everyone enjoyed their April vacation and that the recent warmer weather that we're experiencing is definitely welcome.

144
01:04:33,067 --> 01:04:39,253
Spring is here and it comes with all of the exciting activities we've missed over the winter.

145
01:04:39,693 --> 01:04:51,623
Walks and bike rides, spring sports like baseball and softball, tennis and crew, gardening and barbecues, and many other warm weather activities.

146
01:04:53,045 --> 01:05:03,974
I have some great news to share that over the April break, Medford High School Ethics Bowl team finished sixth in the nation in the National Ethics Bowl.

147
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:10,399
We are very proud of our students and send our congratulations to them and their families.

148
01:05:10,919 --> 01:05:12,801
Congratulations on a job well done.

149
01:05:14,591 --> 01:05:22,717
We also want to thank the community, students, caregivers, all who participated in the citywide cleanup this past weekend.

150
01:05:23,898 --> 01:05:35,367
This annual event directly benefits and impacts our schools with many volunteers helping to clean up trash and beautify the spaces around our schools and playgrounds.

151
01:05:36,027 --> 01:05:41,291
Thank you so much for putting your time and effort into supporting our community.

152
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:52,141
Although we are at the end of April, I do want to mark that it is the conclusion of Childhood Sexual Abuse Month.

153
01:05:53,241 --> 01:06:01,743
In 2021, the most recent year in which data is available, there were 83,644 cases of child abuse and neglect reported in Massachusetts.

154
01:06:08,244 --> 01:06:28,549
Adverse childhood experiences, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and neglect, household substance abuse, household mental illness, and domestic violence can have lasting negative effects on health, well-being, and opportunities in life.

155
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:34,630
At the Medford Public Schools, we are committed to protecting all of the children under our care,

156
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:49,084
Recently, over 500 Medford administrators and staff participated in training with mass kids at the start of our school year to identify signs of childhood sexual abuse.

157
01:06:50,224 --> 01:07:05,927
Through the professional development session, awareness raising and close collaboration with local law enforcement, social service providers and nonprofit organizations, we will work all the time to prevent child abuse in our community.

158
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:27,380
I also was recently working on a ed talk with and I want to say a special thank you to Jetta Bernier and to former member McLaughlin and state rep gobbledy who participated in a conversation about childhood abuse last week.

159
01:07:30,189 --> 01:07:31,450
I have a few reminders.

160
01:07:32,071 --> 01:07:38,977
This Wednesday, May 1 is the statewide walk, bike, and roll to school day.

161
01:07:39,658 --> 01:07:51,469
This great occasion coordinated by the Massachusetts Safe Routes to School program is a perfect opportunity for students and families to travel to school as a pedestrian.

162
01:07:52,149 --> 01:08:01,375
As we all know, it's good for the environment and our individual health when we can take the chance to walk, bike, or roll to a frequent destination.

163
01:08:02,115 --> 01:08:06,458
Check in with your school principal to learn more about plans for Wednesday.

164
01:08:08,283 --> 01:08:12,865
Since our last meeting, we have conducted our middle school placement lottery.

165
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:16,447
The results are available and posted on our website.

166
01:08:17,587 --> 01:08:33,435
Grade five students and their families are invited to attend an orientation program at their assigned middle school to tour the building, learn about programs and activities, meet their principal and assistant principal, teachers, and other staff.

167
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:46,627
The McGlynn Middle School Orientation is scheduled for this Thursday, May 2nd at 6pm, and the Andrews Middle School Orientation is on Monday, May 6th at 6pm.

168
01:08:48,148 --> 01:08:59,459
Also, this coming Friday, May 3rd, it's School Lunch Hero Day, an opportunity to recognize our wonderful staff who work in our school lunch programs.

169
01:09:00,905 --> 01:09:04,388
So for tonight's meeting, we do have another busy agenda.

170
01:09:05,088 --> 01:09:15,116
We're particularly excited to hear about all the wonderful things that are happening and performing and fine arts, and we have Miss Haley relo and miss Suzanne fee, who will provide us with an update.

171
01:09:16,559 --> 01:09:27,048
and also recognize our wonderful students for the wonderful gold medal that they received earlier this spring by our high school orchestra.

172
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:35,556
I also want to thank again the Schmidt family for their generous donation to support our string ensemble.

173
01:09:37,217 --> 01:09:48,463
We will also hear about the trip to Puerto Rico which was approved but we know next spring our students who have the opportunity to travel will definitely have a wonderful learning experience.

174
01:09:49,444 --> 01:09:54,767
Also, I want to thank the presentation that will be coming this evening about our HVAC system.

175
01:09:55,667 --> 01:10:06,469
I want to thank all of the engineers and environmental experts that are here and thank Alicia hunt and her team for supporting us this evening.

176
01:10:07,429 --> 01:10:12,970
We also will share with you a proposed rate card for the next school year.

177
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:20,972
And I will present a report on the district's report on suspension and discipline data.

178
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:35,016
Finally, we'd like to remind the community that our next school committee meeting is on Monday, May 6, which will also include our public hearing on the fiscal year 25 budget.

179
01:10:36,237 --> 01:10:51,381
This important occasion is the main opportunity for us to receive feedback on the proposed budget, that meeting will begin at 5pm in person here or at at City Hall, and also available on zoom.

180
01:10:54,377 --> 01:10:55,438
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

181
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:01,022
We have Arts Programs Update and Recognition of Orchestra Gold Medal, Ms.

182
01:11:01,062 --> 01:11:03,283
Suzanne Fee, Coordinator of Fine Arts, and Ms.

183
01:11:03,303 --> 01:11:05,665
Haley Rello, Coordinator of Performing Arts.

184
01:11:05,965 --> 01:11:06,306
Welcome.

185
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:14,572
Hello, everyone.

186
01:11:14,672 --> 01:11:15,132
Good evening.

187
01:11:15,152 --> 01:11:15,993
Nice to see you all.

188
01:11:16,653 --> 01:11:18,875
I'm going to share a presentation with you.

189
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:33,790
in a moment, but this is just gonna be a fine arts update about the visual arts happenings that have taken place across the district so far this year, across all of our public schools.

190
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:45,198
I'm gonna go over some highlights, talk about our exciting arts month that is happening, and fill you in about a summer workshop that we're excited to get started.

191
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:51,203
At the high school level, we are working to increase our course offerings.

192
01:11:51,623 --> 01:12:00,128
And for next year on our schedule, we have design two, which will build upon what students have learned in design one.

193
01:12:00,148 --> 01:12:02,949
I've been teaching design one at the high school for two years now.

194
01:12:03,009 --> 01:12:05,210
So design two is just an extension of that.

195
01:12:05,811 --> 01:12:15,136
And it's gonna focus more specifically on different careers and career paths students may be able to take like fashion design, advertising design, interior design,

196
01:12:16,215 --> 01:12:16,655
and the like.

197
01:12:17,275 --> 01:12:43,103
The other course we're offering that I'm really excited about is a unified comprehensive art class, which is basically a comprehensive art class, but it's styled after the unified sports teams you might've heard about or unified PE where different students of different levels are gonna come together to work on equal terms through ongoing artistic, creative and community building activities.

198
01:12:43,183 --> 01:12:45,784
So we're really excited about getting that program working.

199
01:12:47,846 --> 01:13:02,343
Another exciting addition at the high school level is that I was able to, through the kindness and hard work of Molly Layden and Anthony Tortora, we were able to get some of the Tufts Macs into the design class for next year.

200
01:13:02,363 --> 01:13:05,606
If you could go to the next slide, Mr. Cushing.

201
01:13:07,368 --> 01:13:07,769
And so

202
01:13:08,365 --> 01:13:14,146
That's really gonna enhance our design classes, and we're gonna have the Adobe Suite installed by the fall.

203
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:24,428
So we'll have Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, and that's really gonna enhance our work and give some more real-world connections for those students in design class.

204
01:13:24,448 --> 01:13:33,769
The next thing I wanna talk about, and I'll go through quickly, the Fine Arts Department, the visual art teachers and I have applied and received over 10 different grants this year.

205
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:36,610
And through these grants, our teachers were able to stick

206
01:13:36,943 --> 01:13:51,535
pure funding to support all our art shows that I'm gonna talk to you about our arts month coming up, but a lot of the grant money went to funding some supplemental activities and just enhancements at the shows, but that is not all we did with the grants.

207
01:13:53,377 --> 01:13:59,522
First off, you may know, we finished, we completed a grant that was a couple of years old, the Rainbow Mural Mosaic.

208
01:13:59,682 --> 01:14:05,707
That was sort of how we kicked off our school year in the Fine Arts Department, where we had our first outdoor

209
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:22,722
art installation at Medford high and that was a community project students from every single school across the district contributed to that project so that was a really exciting way to start but looking forward to some of the grants that we were able to receive and implement this year.

210
01:14:23,802 --> 01:14:30,465
is we received a grant to do a kindness campaign across all of our public schools.

211
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:36,927
So high school students designed a bunch of different posters and stickers promoting kindness.

212
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:40,109
And I'm going to leave these here to be hung at City Hall, hopefully.

213
01:14:41,069 --> 01:14:48,332
But we're going to distribute them across every school and hopefully at the Medford Public Library and even some small businesses.

214
01:14:48,452 --> 01:14:53,054
So the students designed the posters and the stickers, and we're just going to

215
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:55,046
share that message with the community.

216
01:14:56,808 --> 01:15:02,475
We also got a grant for an art supply lending library at the high school level where it's just a

217
01:15:04,204 --> 01:15:10,627
a dedicated space and supplies for students who want to continue their art exploration on their own.

218
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:20,432
And it's really been nice to see kids who aren't in the arts programs have an opportunity to interact with the materials and even visit the classrooms to pick up the stuff.

219
01:15:20,932 --> 01:15:33,239
And it's also really been good in supporting students who have academic projects, but, you know, don't have their poster board or the markers or easy access to them so they can come and borrow them from the library.

220
01:15:33,259 --> 01:15:33,759
So, so far,

221
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:35,866
It's been a great success.

222
01:15:37,648 --> 01:15:42,414
We're doing an interactive look and find board outside the EL testing office.

223
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:43,776
It's another one of our grants.

224
01:15:46,266 --> 01:15:57,988
We noticed that outside the testing office, there's always, you know, small children waiting and we wanted to create like a welcoming experience for them all without any sort of language barrier.

225
01:15:58,048 --> 01:16:04,930
So it's just kind of going to be this large display board with different objects and then the little sheets to like look and find.

226
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:11,311
So it's just a fun activity and a welcoming activity for those students.

227
01:16:11,371 --> 01:16:12,651
And we noticed a need for that.

228
01:16:12,711 --> 01:16:15,192
So that's another small grant we received.

229
01:16:17,304 --> 01:16:25,458
Beyond the grants we're doing a beautification project around Medford high school and it's been great so far students in Mr. Kane's class.

230
01:16:27,631 --> 01:16:29,092
have their artwork nicely framed.

231
01:16:29,132 --> 01:16:34,194
We had the frames donated and those are in B building and they look great.

232
01:16:34,234 --> 01:16:37,596
We've gotten awesome feedback on it and we are expanding that project.

233
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,958
We're on the hunt for donated frames.

234
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:46,701
I have reached out to the target community giving to try to get more frames.

235
01:16:46,721 --> 01:16:49,122
So we're extending that to other parts throughout the building.

236
01:16:51,423 --> 01:16:54,105
The next thing that I'm really excited about is our murals.

237
01:16:57,031 --> 01:16:58,212
if you want to bump up one.

238
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:07,698
We've had a total of six murals created this year, along with a long waiting list of teachers who are looking for more.

239
01:17:08,358 --> 01:17:12,801
The mural supplies are funded by a Medford Arts Council grant from last year.

240
01:17:12,821 --> 01:17:17,404
And we're sharing those supplies with senior class students who are working on

241
01:17:18,244 --> 01:17:19,665
murals and other school groups.

242
01:17:20,525 --> 01:17:32,752
I really want to emphasize that the great thing about the murals projects and the National Art Honor Society is that it's been a wonderful way of connecting with students who are in the vocational programs who aren't able to take the art electives.

243
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:35,554
It's, it's been a great bridge.

244
01:17:36,575 --> 01:17:46,965
And if these two murals were done in the CTE, one in the classroom and one in the bistro, and they were completed by vocational students.

245
01:17:47,205 --> 01:17:57,055
So that's really something we're excited about is involving students outside of the classes into some of the arts projects.

246
01:17:57,836 --> 01:18:01,459
And the next slide is just a fun picture of some of the works in progress.

247
01:18:01,879 --> 01:18:07,764
We're in crunch time here, especially my seniors trying to get them done by the end of the year, but it's been a lot of fun.

248
01:18:10,046 --> 01:18:15,550
We had three Scholastic Art Award winners this year, winning a total of five awards.

249
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:17,992
This one is Lily Verhagen.

250
01:18:18,112 --> 01:18:24,177
She won a silver key for this, and she also won another honorable mention for a different piece that's not pictured here.

251
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:31,786
The next one is Dakota Mahoney for her pencil illustration.

252
01:18:31,847 --> 01:18:33,169
She won an Honorable Mention.

253
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:41,581
And lastly, our senior Stella Heinig won an Honorable Mention and a Gold Key for her ceramic work.

254
01:18:44,348 --> 01:18:59,257
We've brought the art into the after school program through the NHS, our members developed and lead an art activity on the February half day for all the students in the after school programs at the McGlynn Elementary School, the half day is kind of a long day for those kiddos.

255
01:19:00,664 --> 01:19:07,125
We were approached about doing something to kind of bring a little bit more fun to those longer days and it was a great success.

256
01:19:07,245 --> 01:19:17,687
They painted and illustrated bookmarks that we had like as a free giveaway in the Medford High School Library.

257
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:18,567
So it was kind of fun.

258
01:19:18,607 --> 01:19:24,228
The older kids were enjoying the bookmarks made by younger students.

259
01:19:24,788 --> 01:19:29,629
We have a library exhibit right now happening at Medford Public Library.

260
01:19:31,022 --> 01:19:45,005
And I'm really forging a strong partnership with the Medford Public Library, so we now have a spot reserved every year for our students, and there's gonna be a display of 3D work next month in a different part of the library.

261
01:19:45,925 --> 01:19:55,066
We also had a children's art showcase at the River's Edge, and one of our students is a 10th grader who basically puts on this whole show.

262
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:57,227
I sort of am her assistant, but she,

263
01:19:58,247 --> 01:20:00,928
collects the work and hangs the work and promotes the show.

264
01:20:00,948 --> 01:20:05,910
And we had elementary, middle school and high school artists participate in that as well.

265
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:11,111
So that's everything we have done so far this year.

266
01:20:11,171 --> 01:20:14,072
But next month is really going to be an exciting month.

267
01:20:14,132 --> 01:20:15,673
And I'm not going to talk about it too much.

268
01:20:15,713 --> 01:20:16,273
I'll let Haley

269
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:24,221
share a little bit as well, but we wanted to make a dedicated month to celebrate the arts and all the wonderful things that are happening.

270
01:20:24,341 --> 01:20:31,603
So arts month on the visual art end, you can expect to see an art show at every single school.

271
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:46,225
And we have art tea Fridays, just as a fun way to promote the month where we're asking students and staff to show their appreciation for the arts by wearing their favorite band or musician or artist t-shirt.

272
01:20:47,578 --> 01:20:51,541
Our art shows at the elementary level all have supplementary activities as well.

273
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:58,566
We're having a ceramics display at Medford Public Library, and we're gonna have merch on sale.

274
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:04,251
And there's a lot of musical and drama events happening as well, but I'll let Ms.

275
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:05,472
Rello tell you about those.

276
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:10,236
We will also be at West Bedford Open Studios.

277
01:21:10,936 --> 01:21:14,898
This year we go every year and students have the opportunity to showcase and sell their work.

278
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:16,118
So we'll be there this year.

279
01:21:17,179 --> 01:21:26,123
And then lastly, I just want to talk about a summer program that we are kicking off that's funded by the Cummings Foundation and the Medford Arts Council.

280
01:21:26,163 --> 01:21:29,645
And it's kind of a partnership with the CCSR.

281
01:21:30,788 --> 01:21:37,269
So we're gonna do a summer workshop for all grade levels, grades one to three, grades four to eight in a high school level.

282
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:53,692
And it's going to be art instruction, but it's also going to focus on how art can be used as a tool for, as a force for good and to promote and share different topics and issues that are meaningful to you.

283
01:21:53,752 --> 01:21:58,793
And it's sort of just a way to teach kids about finding their voice through art.

284
01:22:00,197 --> 01:22:09,120
So at the elementary level, it's going to, I won't read the whole thing, but they'll hone their skills to discover the joy of using art for a force of good in the world.

285
01:22:10,261 --> 01:22:13,262
Grades four through eight, it's going to be split.

286
01:22:13,302 --> 01:22:17,744
So half of the class will be spent developing artistic skills through direct instruction.

287
01:22:17,804 --> 01:22:26,207
And then the second half will be spent as sort of like an open studio time in which students will create a piece that reflects an issue or a topic that's meaningful for them.

288
01:22:27,864 --> 01:22:40,230
And then at the high school level, it's going to be more of sort of like a studio or an artist in residence experience where they are going to be, these students will be our dedicated students.

289
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:44,612
A lot of them I anticipate will be students who plan on pursuing art in college.

290
01:22:45,012 --> 01:22:54,177
And again, they will be working independently, but they're gonna create a piece of art that is inspired or comments on any social issue

291
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:56,791
or topic that's meaningful for them.

292
01:22:57,071 --> 01:22:58,111
So we're really excited.

293
01:22:58,151 --> 01:23:00,012
We're going to be able to offer this for free.

294
01:23:00,532 --> 01:23:06,435
And we're in the process of finding our teachers who want to participate in this program with us.

295
01:23:08,345 --> 01:23:13,866
And lastly, I just wanna share, I'm so thrilled about everything that's been happening in our school.

296
01:23:14,846 --> 01:23:28,809
And from our webpage, when I was putting this all together, I noticed that in our description, it says that while recognizing the intrinsic value of the arts, students will also discover how the arts contribute to their communities and cultures around the world.

297
01:23:29,249 --> 01:23:33,669
And I really feel like when I reflect on all the work that's been done, that's the work that we are doing.

298
01:23:34,149 --> 01:23:36,670
I think the work we've done at the high school has really helped

299
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:43,893
to build school spirit and connect the two different programs, which I know that's something that's been really important.

300
01:23:43,913 --> 01:23:46,335
So I feel like we're doing this work and it's working.

301
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:49,736
And I'm just so thrilled to be able to share this with you all.

302
01:23:50,977 --> 01:23:51,357
That's all.

303
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,238
And I'm going to leave these with you.

304
01:23:54,499 --> 01:23:54,839
Thank you, Ms.

305
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:55,059
Faye.

306
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,480
Great, great presentation.

307
01:23:58,681 --> 01:24:00,282
If there's no questions, I'll invite Ms.

308
01:24:00,362 --> 01:24:00,622
Rell up.

309
01:24:09,554 --> 01:24:10,981
I don't know if that's true.

310
01:24:42,324 --> 01:24:44,306
Oh, sorry.

311
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:45,487
There we go.

312
01:24:47,448 --> 01:24:47,809
Thank you.

313
01:24:48,009 --> 01:24:49,510
It's my theater projection.

314
01:24:52,573 --> 01:24:54,874
All right, so we're going to start with a jumpstart.

315
01:24:56,956 --> 01:24:57,697
Peter will pull it up for me.

316
01:24:58,838 --> 01:24:58,998
But

317
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,701
All right, I'll talk about it.

318
01:25:01,782 --> 01:25:15,431
We started our really awesome amazing year with jumpstart music camp, when we worked with over 150 students for two weeks, providing them with band and orchestra instruction ensemble work and technique, which would help give them a jumpstart to their school year.

319
01:25:16,532 --> 01:25:20,316
We also compete in the Jumpstart Olympics, very important for brain breaks.

320
01:25:21,557 --> 01:25:24,700
And we had a very successful group that really rocked this year.

321
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:35,950
Our end of camp showcase brought in our largest crowd yet, and also featured members of our high school string ensemble and the Medford Mustang Marching Band, which came to surprise our campers as guest performers.

322
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:39,173
So there's some pictures from Jumpstart.

323
01:25:40,614 --> 01:25:42,236
Our next slide was the fall play.

324
01:25:43,581 --> 01:25:48,466
The Drama Club put on an amazing fall production this year, which was The Dining Room by A.R.

325
01:25:48,506 --> 01:25:48,866
Gurney.

326
01:25:49,426 --> 01:25:54,411
The entire play takes place in the same dining room across multiple generations.

327
01:25:54,451 --> 01:25:57,934
The students did a fantastic job with character development and comedic timing.

328
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:07,303
And I will give them a little plug now that this weekend they are opening Mamma Mia, which they are currently at the high school right now perfecting.

329
01:26:07,883 --> 01:26:08,845
for their final dress.

330
01:26:09,586 --> 01:26:15,012
And it will be Thursday, Friday and Saturday at seven and Saturday at a matinee at two o'clock.

331
01:26:15,493 --> 01:26:18,857
So if you need tickets, just reach out to me.

332
01:26:18,877 --> 01:26:21,080
It's going to be a super fun time.

333
01:26:23,167 --> 01:26:24,409
Our next slide is a parade.

334
01:26:25,209 --> 01:26:34,379
So the Medford Mustang Marching Band proudly represented the city of Medford in the Woburn Halloween Parade and the North End Athletic Association's Christmas Parade this past year.

335
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:40,565
The students really enjoyed bringing holiday spirit to the parade goers and finding some fellow Mustangs along the way.

336
01:26:41,246 --> 01:26:45,468
We have a lot of alumni that shouted out to us when they saw the truck and the band go by.

337
01:26:45,488 --> 01:26:50,271
They were very excited to tell us they were Medford alumni and they were so excited to see the Mustang.

338
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:54,513
So that was really nice for the kids to see that, you know, once you're a Mustang, always a Mustang.

339
01:26:54,633 --> 01:26:56,214
So that was a lot of fun.

340
01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:00,332
Our next slide is districts.

341
01:27:00,932 --> 01:27:04,415
So we had four students that got accepted to the Northeast Districts this year.

342
01:27:05,035 --> 01:27:11,181
Jayden Veal and Samuel Keith from the high school got accepted to perform with the Northeast Senior District Orchestra.

343
01:27:11,821 --> 01:27:16,845
And Jayden Wu and Saffron Jacobs were invited to perform with the Northeast Junior Districts Orchestra.

344
01:27:18,387 --> 01:27:23,671
The Northeast District is very competitive, so these students have to practice really hard and study privately and

345
01:27:25,219 --> 01:27:30,162
work and through all their nerves for auditions and compete against all the other high schools in our area.

346
01:27:30,262 --> 01:27:33,904
So we were really proud of them that they, they excelled at it really well.

347
01:27:36,286 --> 01:27:39,768
Our next slide is from the MMA Music Educators Conference.

348
01:27:40,809 --> 01:27:45,892
Our Modern Music Ensemble, which is a class at the high school, got to perform this year.

349
01:27:45,932 --> 01:27:49,254
They were one of two Massachusetts high school ensembles that were asked to perform.

350
01:27:50,733 --> 01:27:52,954
They got to perform for music educators all around the state.

351
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:59,657
The concert took place at the DCU Center in Worcester, and they were able to perform four songs of various genres.

352
01:28:00,498 --> 01:28:09,502
The Modern Music Ensemble is also performing this Wednesday at the band's spring concert, and they are performing on Saturday, May 25th.

353
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:13,784
They're doing a brunch performance at the Byrne in Somerville from 12 to two, so.

354
01:28:15,046 --> 01:28:20,552
They get to play some different venues and what's better than a little bit of, you know, Mustang music and brunch.

355
01:28:20,873 --> 01:28:21,854
I think that sounds wonderful.

356
01:28:24,617 --> 01:28:25,919
Our next one's a lot of awards.

357
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:28,802
We won a lot of awards this year, which is pretty awesome.

358
01:28:29,123 --> 01:28:30,144
So hang on.

359
01:28:31,697 --> 01:28:39,939
The marching band took home nine trophies this fall and won the New England Scholastic Band Association Championship finals with a platinum medal.

360
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,279
This is the first time they've ever won finals.

361
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:46,200
It's also the first time they ever received a platinum medal, which is a 95 or above.

362
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,821
So we made Medford history.

363
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:54,102
This past weekend at the Music in the Parks competition, they placed second in their division with an overall rating of excellent.

364
01:28:55,196 --> 01:29:02,278
The Medford High School Orchestra won a gold medal at MICA this year, again making Medford history the first time the high school has ever won a gold.

365
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:12,182
And this past weekend at Music in the Parks, they placed first in their division with a superior rating and won best overall orchestra for the entire event, which is pretty amazing.

366
01:29:13,602 --> 01:29:20,104
The Medford Mustang Winter Guard won the New England Scholastic Band Association Championship Finals this year for the seventh year in a row.

367
01:29:21,024 --> 01:29:21,865
And they were,

368
01:29:22,961 --> 01:29:28,064
moved halfway through the season this year because they were beating their competition by too many points.

369
01:29:28,524 --> 01:29:30,065
So they moved them up to a higher division.

370
01:29:30,105 --> 01:29:35,208
And I think the kids are a little, um, upset at first, but they still ended up taking home the championship.

371
01:29:35,268 --> 01:29:37,870
They really rose the occasion and took on the extra work.

372
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:39,511
So we're really proud of them.

373
01:29:40,491 --> 01:29:44,794
Um, the middle school string ensemble competed at Micah this year and took home a silver medal.

374
01:29:44,814 --> 01:29:49,957
Um, and they continue to dazzle audiences with their excellent talent, dedication, and hard work.

375
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:54,639
If you've ever seen these students, they're always in the hallways practicing and working on sectionals.

376
01:29:54,939 --> 01:29:59,081
And for their age group, they work very, very hard and they're very dedicated.

377
01:30:01,722 --> 01:30:02,882
All right, arts month.

378
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:03,342
So Ms.

379
01:30:03,382 --> 01:30:05,003
Fee already started talking about this.

380
01:30:05,823 --> 01:30:09,144
We are opening arts month on Wednesday with the band concert.

381
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:14,946
Our grades four through 12 bands will be performing as well as our modern music ensemble and our color guard.

382
01:30:15,976 --> 01:30:19,977
And then the drama club production will be going up the second, third and fourth.

383
01:30:20,697 --> 01:30:27,219
At every arts or specialist night at the elementary level and middle school level, there will be both instrumental and art components.

384
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:32,721
The modern music ensemble is performing at the burn on the 25th.

385
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:36,502
The 15th is the string concert grades four through 12.

386
01:30:37,501 --> 01:30:42,790
And we are closing out the month with the Middle School Drama Club, which is putting on a production of Grease.

387
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:47,919
So we have lots of theater, art, and music offerings.

388
01:30:49,051 --> 01:31:00,642
Um, some more updates from this year is we did add a new jazz, middle school jazz ensemble, Mr crescent team is Baptist started that they'll have their debut performance at the spring band concert on Wednesday.

389
01:31:01,643 --> 01:31:04,346
We're looking continuing our jazz program for the future.

390
01:31:04,906 --> 01:31:11,472
It's something we had in pre coven, but unfortunately it's one of those things that kind of lost along the way so we're hoping to kind of put it back in.

391
01:31:13,483 --> 01:31:21,105
We already have 75 students registered for this year's Jumpstart Music Camp, and we are pleased to be offering sessions in band, orchestra, and color guard.

392
01:31:22,246 --> 01:31:41,551
The Medford Band Parent Organization, which is a 513C that supports our band program, just received a grant from Tufts University that will help supply musical instruments to Jumpstart Music Camp for students that are on scholarship, and will also provide age-appropriate color guard equipment for our new color guard session, which we are excited to bring to Jumpstart this year.

393
01:31:42,475 --> 01:31:47,657
Students can sign up for a band session, a orchestra session, or a color guard session.

394
01:31:48,717 --> 01:32:00,001
And we're hoping if everything goes well this summer, we're hoping to eventually add a theater session in because we know we have a lot of theater goers and excitement for theater here in Medford.

395
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:02,081
So this is the first year at the high school.

396
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:04,242
We did bring our theater classes back in action.

397
01:32:04,362 --> 01:32:09,024
So we have lots of theater buzzing around the high school right now, and we're hoping to continue that growing.

398
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:12,480
Any questions?

399
01:32:13,321 --> 01:32:15,062
I know member Ntapa has a question.

400
01:32:15,622 --> 01:32:15,962
Sure.

401
01:32:15,982 --> 01:32:16,563
From Zoom.

402
01:32:18,364 --> 01:32:19,545
Hey all, sorry.

403
01:32:19,885 --> 01:32:26,709
I had a question as well for the previous, well not a question, more of a statement for the previous presentation as well.

404
01:32:26,769 --> 01:32:38,416
Thank you both for presenting all this really wonderful information as someone who actually holds a bachelor's in art and design education with a design degree.

405
01:32:47,879 --> 01:32:55,323
as Miss Rowland knows, as I went through the many programs she hosts as well, proud product of, you know, the theater and everything.

406
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:58,644
I'm going to be guidance over Tony's idea as well.

407
01:32:59,044 --> 01:33:06,208
But just wanted to really echo my, I can't say speechless because I'm talking too much right now, and also apologize I can't be there right now.

408
01:33:06,228 --> 01:33:08,289
I'm coping well with somebody here as well.

409
01:33:09,961 --> 01:33:18,288
Yeah, I just really want to reading through the slideshow was really happy and also really cool to hear that the band actually needed to be replaced and put in another division.

410
01:33:18,328 --> 01:33:19,929
And even then they still did really well.

411
01:33:19,969 --> 01:33:22,791
So thank you to both for all the work you do.

412
01:33:23,172 --> 01:33:24,713
And yeah, that's all I have.

413
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:25,173
Thank you.

414
01:33:26,234 --> 01:33:26,695
Thank you.

415
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:27,675
Thank you, Member Ntapa.

416
01:33:27,695 --> 01:33:28,376
Awesome.

417
01:33:29,217 --> 01:33:30,738
Thank you very much for the presentation.

418
01:33:30,778 --> 01:33:31,058
You're welcome.

419
01:33:31,098 --> 01:33:31,779
And love the t-shirts.

420
01:33:31,799 --> 01:33:32,099
Yes, very much.

421
01:33:32,119 --> 01:33:32,399
T-shirts.

422
01:33:32,419 --> 01:33:37,283
You can get them at all of our events.

423
01:33:37,303 --> 01:33:37,483
All right.

424
01:33:37,503 --> 01:33:38,104
All right.

425
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:41,697
Mayor.

426
01:33:41,717 --> 01:33:44,698
We're going to introduce the student reps and then I'm going to go to you.

427
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:50,020
I was going to make a motion to spend the rules and take item 2024 dash 24 out of order.

428
01:34:00,475 --> 01:34:00,735
Good evening.

429
01:34:00,775 --> 01:34:05,058
I just wanted to make sure that I recognize our student reps who are here today.

430
01:34:05,618 --> 01:34:10,221
Darren wrong, thank you for being here in chambers, and know what you're asking who's online.

431
01:34:10,761 --> 01:34:11,742
Thank you to the both of you.

432
01:34:11,762 --> 01:34:13,923
Yes, welcome and thanks for being here.

433
01:34:14,723 --> 01:34:20,327
Motion to suspend the rules by member so seconded by second member Graham.

434
01:34:20,807 --> 01:34:22,148
All those roll call please.

435
01:34:23,989 --> 01:34:24,689
Remember Brantley.

436
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:26,590
Remember Graham.

437
01:34:26,831 --> 01:34:27,031
Yes.

438
01:34:27,431 --> 01:34:28,131
Remember and Papa.

439
01:34:29,994 --> 01:34:30,695
Member Olapade?

440
01:34:30,835 --> 01:34:31,115
Yes.

441
01:34:31,695 --> 01:34:32,316
Member Rheinfeld?

442
01:34:32,476 --> 01:34:32,716
Yes.

443
01:34:33,016 --> 01:34:33,497
Member Russo?

444
01:34:33,517 --> 01:34:33,717
Yes.

445
01:34:33,777 --> 01:34:34,437
Mayor Longo?

446
01:34:34,617 --> 01:34:34,837
Yes.

447
01:34:35,018 --> 01:34:36,278
On the affirmative, zero on the negative.

448
01:34:36,779 --> 01:34:37,519
Motion is approved.

449
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:41,382
Offered by Member Russo, Member Rheinfeld, and Member Olapade.

450
01:34:41,963 --> 01:34:57,994
Resolution on the end of fossil fuel building equipment purchases, whereas the buildings of the Memphis Public Schools are exclusively the responsibility of the Memphis School Committee pursuant to Mass General Law, Chapter 71, Section 68, whereas the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law

451
01:34:58,393 --> 01:35:24,466
both provided significant opportunities for schools to end our dependence on fossil fuel infrastructure, whereas the climate crisis is an existential threat to the survival of our species and countless other species we share our planet with, whereas the climate crisis is primarily caused by human activity through the release of greenhouse gases, whereas today's leaders must take action now to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.

452
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:27,368
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee

453
01:35:28,081 --> 01:35:51,273
One, bans the purchase of new or replacement fossil fuels powered equipment used to operate our school facilities, such as HVAC equipment and kitchen equipment, may authorize the purchase of banned equipment in emergency situations at a regular or special meeting of the committee, and must authorize equipment purchases covered by this resolution, regardless of the revenue source, such as municipal funding or grants from governmental or non-governmental organizations.

454
01:35:53,649 --> 01:35:59,113
I know we have our team, our city team, and they brought some guests with us to discuss the HVAC system.

455
01:35:59,694 --> 01:36:09,261
I think I was talking to Brenda this weekend about the process to fixing our HVAC at the two middle schools, somewhat related here.

456
01:36:09,321 --> 01:36:13,725
So I don't know if you want to hear from them or a member that has this resolution.

457
01:36:13,745 --> 01:36:15,747
I'd like to speak on it.

458
01:36:17,028 --> 01:36:17,468
Member Russo.

459
01:36:17,793 --> 01:36:18,193
Thank you.

460
01:36:20,355 --> 01:36:23,037
The resolution does speak for itself pretty clearly, I think.

461
01:36:23,378 --> 01:36:31,064
And I think it's, you know, Medford has done things differently than lots of other communities.

462
01:36:31,144 --> 01:36:34,367
In fact, doing things that are, oh, that sun is right in my eyes.

463
01:36:36,108 --> 01:36:43,234
And done a lot of things that are frankly not even, that are explicitly laid out in the law, in mass general law, that should be done differently.

464
01:36:43,594 --> 01:36:46,557
And there's sort of a mountain of things in that category.

465
01:36:48,026 --> 01:36:48,167
The.

466
01:36:49,389 --> 01:36:58,913
Unlike Somerville, where they have transferred the buildings over to the city, in which case the school committee has no authority over school buildings, also doesn't have to pay for any utilities.

467
01:37:00,553 --> 01:37:05,275
And during COVID, the school committee could not open their buildings because they had no authority.

468
01:37:05,435 --> 01:37:06,976
The city had all authority.

469
01:37:07,396 --> 01:37:14,499
But in Medford and the vast majority of communities in Massachusetts, the school committee has explicit and total control over our buildings.

470
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:32,010
I know that that is not then how Medford is operated, but we should be doing no capital improvements to our buildings, we should be doing no emergency repairs to our buildings, unless the school committee has authorized them.

471
01:37:32,971 --> 01:37:36,834
And so that's a part of the resolution that's not actually stated clearly.

472
01:37:37,154 --> 01:37:38,315
Well, I guess it is in the beginning.

473
01:37:39,015 --> 01:37:50,499
Um, and I just want to make it clear that this committee, um, the majority of the folks that ran for office, um, included in their platforms that we would stop, uh, using fossil fuels.

474
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:54,701
And, um, I just, uh, that's what this resolution is about.

475
01:37:55,041 --> 01:38:00,583
And so, um, I'd make a motion to approve unless somebody else wants to talk on it.

476
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:05,605
Member Reinfeldt, do you want to say anything?

477
01:38:06,573 --> 01:38:17,613
Yes, I just I just wanted to say that I would like to see the default to be to consider the non fossil fuel solutions for our building projects.

478
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:22,643
which I think is a reverse of kind of historically what we as a society has done.

479
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:36,391
I'm, and I think provision three here in particular is about bringing these decisions to the school committee so we can evaluate the language in terms of the climate goals that we have for the city the sustainability goals.

480
01:38:37,491 --> 01:38:53,362
And, and not just the financial goals looking being able to look comprehensively at upfront costs and then sustained maintenance costs, and I think that's really important that we're not just making the decisions based on what it costs right now to do this, but also to

481
01:38:54,483 --> 01:39:04,611
maintain these systems and make them sustainable for the future, because we know a lot of our buildings are about to experience some major stresses with age.

482
01:39:04,831 --> 01:39:09,795
And this right here right now is the time to be planning for that.

483
01:39:11,656 --> 01:39:12,197
Director Hunt.

484
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:18,061
Madam Mayor, I assume we call you that at these meetings.

485
01:39:18,101 --> 01:39:19,623
Sorry, I'm not usually at school committee.

486
01:39:19,643 --> 01:39:22,605
Alicia Hunt, I'm the director of planning, development and sustainability.

487
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:41,323
I've been the city's, essentially, sustainability director since 2012, and I've done a lot of work in the schools, and I would like to respectfully request that you wait and see our presentation and hear the work that we've been doing and to understand some of the concerns that we have.

488
01:39:41,403 --> 01:39:46,624
As you all know, I am the champion of renewable energy in our buildings.

489
01:39:47,044 --> 01:39:52,025
I am the force behind why our police station is all electric, why our new library

490
01:39:52,423 --> 01:39:54,525
is all electric and designed to be net zero.

491
01:39:54,885 --> 01:40:04,553
And I think that the question about renovating buildings and upgrading heating systems is complicated, and we're prepared to share a bunch of that information with you this evening.

492
01:40:04,894 --> 01:40:18,766
So I was hoping that you would be hearing sort of what our findings are and our information before voting, deliberating on something like this, whether you were to then send it to committee or to vote after a presentation.

493
01:40:19,386 --> 01:40:22,829
I would respectfully request that you may want to see what we have first.

494
01:40:23,329 --> 01:40:25,911
Is there a motion to table?

495
01:40:27,032 --> 01:40:29,714
I certainly am very interested in this presentation.

496
01:40:29,855 --> 01:40:33,457
I read it, and I have a lot of questions.

497
01:40:33,758 --> 01:40:35,659
This resolution provides an out.

498
01:40:35,839 --> 01:40:39,562
There are going to be situations for which we must continue to use fossil fuels.

499
01:40:40,843 --> 01:40:43,686
For instance, I think sometimes when it comes to the backup options,

500
01:40:45,447 --> 01:40:50,680
having an electric primary system and a backup system that's fossil fuels right now might be the most

501
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:52,430
appropriate thing.

502
01:40:52,890 --> 01:41:01,212
But when I hear that the city's hiring an OPM to do a project that the school committee has not even authorized, I can't help but feel like there's a big problem here.

503
01:41:01,612 --> 01:41:03,133
So I'm not interested.

504
01:41:03,753 --> 01:41:10,214
If at the end of that presentation, we need to have a meeting to discuss approving that project to use fossil fuels, that's fine.

505
01:41:10,254 --> 01:41:12,235
And that would become the new policy of the school committee.

506
01:41:13,135 --> 01:41:16,116
Putting it ahead of this, to me, feels a bit like

507
01:41:16,656 --> 01:41:19,198
we're gonna go ahead, hire an OPM and start doing some work.

508
01:41:19,258 --> 01:41:22,680
And then after the fact, the school committee said, you can't do that going forward.

509
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:26,583
Well, that's not okay.

510
01:41:26,723 --> 01:41:32,366
I mean, the law is explicit that we have this authority and nobody should be touching our buildings without our approval.

511
01:41:33,427 --> 01:41:41,833
So I'm incredibly interested in this presentation and look forward to it and definitely want to know a whole heck of a lot more about

512
01:41:43,257 --> 01:41:48,398
the options and the site challenges I understand that we have with geothermal in that area.

513
01:41:49,339 --> 01:42:00,222
But if in 10 years, the federal government says, under no circumstance could public buildings use fossil fuels anymore, did we just blow however many millions of dollars and have to rip it all out?

514
01:42:01,522 --> 01:42:07,244
We don't know what the future holds, other than the fact that from the climate, we sort of have a pretty ugly picture.

515
01:42:07,644 --> 01:42:11,045
But we don't know what higher levels of government are going to do

516
01:42:11,598 --> 01:42:19,340
when they finally come to grips and finally start taking very strong action to stop the use of fossil fuels.

517
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:25,901
And public buildings are usually the first thing they go for because that's the stuff they have control over.

518
01:42:25,981 --> 01:42:35,483
So I respect very much director Hunt and her work and especially the work around the library and the police station.

519
01:42:36,543 --> 01:42:41,568
I look forward to working with her and lots of other folks on the new high school.

520
01:42:42,729 --> 01:42:45,171
But I think we need to draw a line in the sand someday.

521
01:42:45,191 --> 01:42:52,397
And I don't know when anybody else would like to draw the line, but I feel like it should have been done 50 years ago.

522
01:42:53,138 --> 01:42:55,860
So maybe now's a good time to draw the line in the sand on this.

523
01:42:57,139 --> 01:43:09,323
Again, this resolution allows for us to decide, okay, we're gonna stick another fossil fuel thing in our buildings and just pretend that the climate is not completely falling apart.

524
01:43:09,603 --> 01:43:14,104
That's an option, but we need to make that vote when we make that decision.

525
01:43:14,444 --> 01:43:16,925
And today, we aren't even being asked about these things.

526
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:18,425
Thank you.

527
01:43:20,206 --> 01:43:22,727
If I may, just from the chair, and then I'm gonna acknowledge

528
01:43:25,502 --> 01:43:50,028
Director Hunt and her team have taken on quite a bit to help, plus Paul Riggi, who's our facilities and maintenance director over in the city side and through requests coming from me, which obviously are coming through the school committee, they've spent a lot of time working on the light posts on Freedom Way, keys, new cameras, and now HVAC, so I understand you want to move this forward tonight, but

529
01:43:50,919 --> 01:43:57,964
Director Hunt respectfully asked that we table this basically until they at least give their presentation and we can always go back to it.

530
01:43:58,024 --> 01:44:09,633
So I think out of respect for city staff working tirelessly for school needs because they want to help, I would ask that the committee respect that request.

531
01:44:10,754 --> 01:44:13,596
member Rousseau and then.

532
01:44:14,237 --> 01:44:19,901
Everything you said except for one thing I agree with, you do not speak for the committee without us voting.

533
01:44:20,362 --> 01:44:28,828
And I really take offense to the idea that the chair who by definition the chair is the servant of the body is not the head of the body.

534
01:44:29,309 --> 01:44:30,690
That is the definition of a chair.

535
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:33,392
And we did not ask you to do this.

536
01:44:33,712 --> 01:44:36,694
So I appreciate that as the mayor with the purse strings,

537
01:44:37,622 --> 01:44:43,223
that there's a lot you can do and there's a lot only you can do, but we didn't ask you to do this.

538
01:44:44,183 --> 01:44:55,245
And so you didn't, as the school come forward as a representative of the school committee to get this work done, you came forward as a chair, as the mayor, you don't have that authority.

539
01:44:55,686 --> 01:45:01,527
So, I mean, that's very upsetting to think that you can speak for us if we have not voted, because you cannot.

540
01:45:04,284 --> 01:45:05,144
approved funding.

541
01:45:05,224 --> 01:45:06,965
I have not signed a contract.

542
01:45:07,085 --> 01:45:15,389
That's why they're presenting tonight on work that I asked them to do, but it was the committee that has discussed it over and over again.

543
01:45:15,449 --> 01:45:18,891
It's the teachers union who brought a grievance because our air conditioning doesn't work.

544
01:45:19,331 --> 01:45:22,753
And we said we were going to commit to fixing the air conditioning.

545
01:45:23,033 --> 01:45:29,316
So this is the base work and they're here before I've ever even signed a contract because obviously they're going to present to you first.

546
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:32,938
So I don't know why fixing air conditioning is so upsetting.

547
01:45:34,724 --> 01:45:38,166
Miss Member Brantley and then Miss Smith, sorry.

548
01:45:41,908 --> 01:45:47,130
Your mic's not on.

549
01:45:53,613 --> 01:45:54,253
Oh, there we go.

550
01:45:56,014 --> 01:45:58,455
So I can understand everybody's point here.

551
01:45:58,885 --> 01:46:03,087
but I feel like if we're gonna draw the line, can we just wait for the presentation and then we can draw the line?

552
01:46:03,527 --> 01:46:07,229
I don't see why, I feel like it's a little disrespectful to the team.

553
01:46:10,011 --> 01:46:11,372
Yes, motion to table, please.

554
01:46:16,494 --> 01:46:21,677
I mean, yeah, can we just, can we table until they speak?

555
01:46:22,597 --> 01:46:23,378
Is that possible?

556
01:46:25,373 --> 01:46:29,036
Yes, so let's just table the vote until we can listen to them speak.

557
01:46:46,774 --> 01:46:51,638
Sorry, I've had my member on top of work on the vote.

558
01:46:52,018 --> 01:46:53,459
It's motion to table is undebatable.

559
01:46:53,499 --> 01:46:55,621
So we'll just hold on for your name to be called.

560
01:46:55,641 --> 01:46:59,283
Remember, we're mostly the table.

561
01:46:59,624 --> 01:47:02,205
I'm not sure what the motion is.

562
01:47:02,246 --> 01:47:04,908
motion to table by member Brandley seconded by member Graham.

563
01:47:05,808 --> 01:47:06,028
Yes.

564
01:47:06,048 --> 01:47:08,770
Remember all the potty?

565
01:47:09,111 --> 01:47:09,311
Yes.

566
01:47:10,209 --> 01:47:10,889
Member Reinfeldt.

567
01:47:11,049 --> 01:47:11,270
Yes.

568
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:12,550
Member Russo, yes.

569
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:13,551
Mayor Longo, correct.

570
01:47:13,671 --> 01:47:13,931
Yes.

571
01:47:14,171 --> 01:47:16,092
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

572
01:47:16,452 --> 01:47:17,433
Motion to table is approved.

573
01:47:18,213 --> 01:47:20,314
Is there a motion to revert back to regular order of business?

574
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:21,555
You want to talk on the next paper?

575
01:47:22,155 --> 01:47:22,655
Smith, sorry.

576
01:47:22,675 --> 01:47:24,696
Order of business?

577
01:47:24,956 --> 01:47:26,477
By Member Russo, seconded by... Second.

578
01:47:27,677 --> 01:47:28,018
Second.

579
01:47:28,118 --> 01:47:30,239
Member Reinfeldt, roll call, please.

580
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:34,641
Member Brandley.

581
01:47:34,901 --> 01:47:35,121
Yes.

582
01:47:35,621 --> 01:47:36,101
Member Graham.

583
01:47:37,102 --> 01:47:37,302
Yes.

584
01:47:37,662 --> 01:47:38,222
Member Antapa.

585
01:47:38,943 --> 01:47:39,143
Yes.

586
01:47:40,692 --> 01:47:41,673
member right bill.

587
01:47:42,014 --> 01:47:42,214
Yes.

588
01:47:42,394 --> 01:47:43,516
Remember all the body.

589
01:47:43,756 --> 01:47:43,916
Yes.

590
01:47:43,976 --> 01:47:45,318
Remember I'm filled.

591
01:47:45,378 --> 01:47:45,678
Yes.

592
01:47:45,999 --> 01:47:47,240
Member Rousseau yes Maryland.

593
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:53,368
Okay, yes 70 affirmative zero and the negative motion to revert has been approved we're going to go to number three HVAC update.

594
01:47:53,808 --> 01:48:00,176
Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of schools, Miss Brenda Pike and director Alicia Hunt.

595
01:48:06,152 --> 01:48:12,898
Good evening Madam Mayor and members of the committee thank you very much really appreciate this opportunity to present today on this very important topic, just prior to getting started.

596
01:48:14,925 --> 01:48:16,786
Is we good?

597
01:48:16,926 --> 01:48:26,771
Just prior to getting started, I do wanna just piggyback on something the superintendent said earlier, school lunch hero day, the end of this week, if you can come out and support our lunch staff.

598
01:48:27,311 --> 01:48:30,433
Last year in April, we were averaging over 12,000 meals a week.

599
01:48:30,913 --> 01:48:34,154
Last week, we served over 16,000 meals.

600
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:39,197
I just felt like that's really important for you to know as we move into this really important topic.

601
01:48:39,917 --> 01:48:41,759
So I will share my screen.

602
01:48:42,819 --> 01:48:57,269
And as you'll see, we have members of our OPM team and our engineers with us here as well, including Alicia Hunt and Brenda Pike, who we've been trying to work with on this.

603
01:48:57,509 --> 01:48:59,611
So let me just go through our agenda.

604
01:49:00,632 --> 01:49:02,113
First, team introductions.

605
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:27,883
We'll do a look at the comprehensive assessment that has been done, some viable options that we have, some real world challenges that we have as well that kind of go to the previous conversation around full electrification and really our desire as well to do everything we can to make sure that we're combating the climate crisis, a proposed timeline and time for your questions as well.

606
01:49:28,955 --> 01:49:33,498
So, as we move through, I'll ask people to stand up and be recognized.

607
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:36,080
So myself assistant superintendent.

608
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:39,902
This is the operations, part of my title.

609
01:49:40,543 --> 01:49:44,906
Also Alicia hunt director of planning development and sustainability for the city of Medford.

610
01:49:45,506 --> 01:49:48,368
Brenda Pike, our Climate Planner for the city.

611
01:49:49,348 --> 01:49:53,130
John McLaughlin, Director of Buildings and Grounds, unfortunately cannot be here this evening.

612
01:49:53,650 --> 01:50:14,622
Paul Riggi, Director of Facilities for the city, who cannot be here this evening, but also with us tonight is Josh Doolittle from our Design Representative B2Q, who also conducted the comprehensive assessment of the Andrews Middle School a little bit over a year ago, that was in process and then completed.

613
01:50:15,642 --> 01:50:18,384
Gabby Cole, designer representative from B2Q.

614
01:50:20,686 --> 01:50:24,248
Joey Redmond, designer representative from B2Q.

615
01:50:24,789 --> 01:50:28,131
And then Tom Ellis, who is our OPM representative.

616
01:50:28,511 --> 01:50:35,596
And while not under contract yet, we have gone through comprehensive interviews that myself, Mr. McLaughlin,

617
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:55,409
Alicia Hunt, members of the city's finance team, and Brenda sat in on to conduct a comprehensive review of those organizations who submitted applications for this and to really vet out the type of work that they've done in these areas and the type of work that they propose to do.

618
01:50:56,589 --> 01:50:59,831
So I'll now hand it over to Alicia and others.

619
01:51:02,469 --> 01:51:02,949
Good evening.

620
01:51:02,969 --> 01:51:07,271
So as I mentioned before, I have actually been, sorry, I have to get not too close.

621
01:51:07,291 --> 01:51:08,432
It's really echoey out here.

622
01:51:09,432 --> 01:51:13,374
Doing a lot of, Peter, can we actually have this here so it's easier to see?

623
01:51:14,154 --> 01:51:16,856
Thank you, because it's hard to see the same words up there.

624
01:51:18,677 --> 01:51:20,437
We can work it if you want us to.

625
01:51:20,537 --> 01:51:22,959
That works.

626
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:26,680
Sorry, I'm actually used to doing my own presentations when I go to city council.

627
01:51:27,561 --> 01:51:32,263
So we did do a comprehensive assessment of

628
01:51:32,788 --> 01:51:39,715
The Andrews and McGlynn, the Andrew school so we basically we looked at we worked with National Grid to say what can we afford what could

629
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,040
What would things cost?

630
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:42,781
What would National Grid pay for?

631
01:51:43,101 --> 01:51:51,904
And so this was partially funded by National Grid and partially funded by the city to do a comprehensive assessment of the Andrews School as a role model.

632
01:51:52,384 --> 01:52:00,166
And I'm just gonna go, I'm gonna assume that people don't know so much about the buildings because I realized that also the general public watches these meetings as well.

633
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:03,708
So please forgive me if you think that I'm telling you things you all know.

634
01:52:05,268 --> 01:52:22,475
But the schools, the five, what I always call the lower schools, not the high school, the other five, were in fact designed by the same designers and built by the same contractors and the same OPM over a series of a couple of years, opening in 2001 and 2003.

635
01:52:22,555 --> 01:52:27,137
They have generally the same kinds of equipment.

636
01:52:27,177 --> 01:52:28,077
They have the same models.

637
01:52:28,117 --> 01:52:30,358
They were installed the same way at the same time.

638
01:52:30,891 --> 01:52:38,295
So what we did was we said we were already doing a project at the Andrews looking at solar and battery and trying to make that work.

639
01:52:38,355 --> 01:52:39,735
And we already had work going on.

640
01:52:40,116 --> 01:52:48,780
And as that, we have been running a piece of software in the school for a couple of years that gives us like a constant commissioning of it, telling us what's working and not working.

641
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:58,805
So B2Q is the team that's been working with me at the Andrews School for many years, already had a baseline, heavy, strong knowledge of the Andrews School.

642
01:52:59,338 --> 01:53:01,519
So we said, let's do this assessment.

643
01:53:01,559 --> 01:53:03,120
We understand what's going on.

644
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:11,986
When people came to us and said, you know, the HVAC is not working, there are troubles with the heat, there are ventilation, like not ventilation, but you know, the systems aren't all working correctly.

645
01:53:13,006 --> 01:53:15,488
We said, look, we've already got a headstart at this building.

646
01:53:16,428 --> 01:53:20,111
Therefore, it would be most cost effective for us to do an assessment of this one building.

647
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:27,375
And it would tell us a lot about all of our other buildings, because we understand that it's the same types of systems in the same way.

648
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:32,082
So we contracted at the time with B2Q to do that.

649
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:39,063
So I'm going to ask B2Q to actually speak to their comprehensive, the assessment they did of the Andrews and their recommendations.

650
01:53:39,483 --> 01:53:41,024
And then I also have information.

651
01:53:41,084 --> 01:53:47,865
We had an HVAC technician go into all of the schools and do some poking at them and understanding of what's going on.

652
01:53:48,125 --> 01:53:49,966
So I have a slide sort of addressing that.

653
01:53:50,366 --> 01:53:56,467
And then I'm going to come back and talk about sort of what some of the difficulties are with some of the things that we want

654
01:53:56,752 --> 01:53:59,113
we would love to be able to do in these buildings.

655
01:53:59,533 --> 01:54:05,656
So I'm gonna start by asking the B2Q staff to come up and talk to the assessment that they did in the Andrews School.

656
01:54:05,676 --> 01:54:13,519
Hi everyone, thanks for having us tonight.

657
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:19,302
So as Alicia mentioned, we did the comprehensive study at the Andrews School.

658
01:54:19,442 --> 01:54:26,265
So this slide and the review I will go over will focus on the condition of the major HVAC equipment.

659
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:39,767
There are air handling units on the roof that provide heating and cooling to mainly administrative spaces, the gymnasium and the cafeteria.

660
01:54:40,267 --> 01:54:46,951
And then each classroom also has what is called a unit ventilator to do the heating and cooling for those spaces.

661
01:54:47,871 --> 01:54:52,774
Of those units at the Andrews School at the time of our study last year in 2023, the cooling system

662
01:54:56,141 --> 01:54:58,723
for the gymnasium was not operational.

663
01:54:59,003 --> 01:55:03,326
All the compressors had failed and there was therefore no cooling in the gym.

664
01:55:04,407 --> 01:55:17,936
The cafeteria cooling unit had three out of four of the fans were not operational at the time of our study, meaning there was very little capacity to provide adequate cooling to the cafeteria.

665
01:55:19,184 --> 01:55:37,714
Additionally, the air cooled chiller, that is the machine that provides cooling to all the classrooms in the building, that was somewhat operational, but it required a facilities maintenance personnel to go up to the unit on the roof, climb a ladder every day and manually reset it.

666
01:55:37,914 --> 01:55:44,317
So each morning when it came on, it wasn't able to come on automatically and needed that manual intervention to operate.

667
01:55:45,646 --> 01:55:55,094
Lastly, during our study, one of the two boilers at the Andrews School had a glycol leak and was valve off and not operating.

668
01:55:55,655 --> 01:56:04,222
The one boiler was able to provide the heating to the school, but in the case of an additional failure, there was a lack of backup capacity.

669
01:56:06,628 --> 01:56:08,989
So that is the summary of the Andrews School.

670
01:56:09,209 --> 01:56:17,493
I've also can speak a little more generally to the McGlynn School based on some information that Mr. Cushing has provided us.

671
01:56:18,073 --> 01:56:31,060
My understanding of last year is that similar issues were experienced at the McGlynn and that cooling was not being provided due to equipment failures in at least I believe the gym, cafeteria and auditorium.

672
01:56:32,201 --> 01:56:42,830
Additionally, the chillers providing cooling to the classrooms were operating at about 50% capacity, so not able to provide full cooling on the hottest days of the year.

673
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:45,312
Anything you'd like to add?

674
01:56:49,896 --> 01:56:59,104
All right, so I'd like to summarize the recommended option that we considered in detail during our comprehensive study at the Andrews School.

675
01:57:00,522 --> 01:57:04,344
The concept, I will start by talking about the solution for the classrooms.

676
01:57:05,044 --> 01:57:10,787
The concept is to replace the air cooled chiller on the roof with what's called an air to water heat pump.

677
01:57:11,588 --> 01:57:18,611
This heat pump would be able to provide chilled water cooling to the classrooms during the summer, doing the same function as the chiller.

678
01:57:19,611 --> 01:57:25,634
But the heat pump would also be able to provide hot water to the classrooms in the winter to do the heating.

679
01:57:26,155 --> 01:57:28,896
So one piece of equipment, a heat pump would provide

680
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:34,380
heating and cooling to all the classrooms through an electrified method.

681
01:57:35,781 --> 01:57:45,767
This concept also proposed to replace the failing boilers with new updated condensing gas boilers, which are more efficient than the existing cast iron boilers in place.

682
01:57:46,567 --> 01:57:49,269
The purpose of these boilers would be to provide

683
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:52,554
a few different things.

684
01:57:52,574 --> 01:58:02,620
A, it could provide backup heating to the classrooms on the coldest days of the year or supplemental heat if an air to water heat pump was unable to keep up with the demand.

685
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:16,367
Second, there are still some devices in the school that without being upgraded would require a hot water temperature higher than what a heat pump, the heat pumping contemplate could produce.

686
01:58:17,441 --> 01:58:21,983
In that case, the boilers could still provide hot water to those devices.

687
01:58:22,403 --> 01:58:34,527
That includes like perimeter baseboard radiation that provides heat under windows and some of the supplementary heating in administrative areas like the principal's office, for an example.

688
01:58:36,041 --> 01:58:44,108
And last, these boilers would also provide the heating that would be needed if the building were to lose power and not have electricity.

689
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:50,854
So in case of a power outage, there is a generator to provide some standby power to the building.

690
01:58:51,335 --> 01:58:54,117
The Andrews School is the city's emergency shelter.

691
01:58:54,638 --> 01:59:02,545
And these boilers could continue to provide hot water to continue to heat the school if there was an outage or an emergency situation.

692
01:59:04,358 --> 01:59:11,487
I'd like to just conclude by discussing the other systems in the building, those air handlers we mentioned.

693
01:59:12,188 --> 01:59:18,896
Right now, they get hot water from the boiler for heating, and then we have those cooling units up on the roof that I mentioned that do the cooling.

694
01:59:19,815 --> 01:59:26,537
So our study considered replacing those cooling units on the roof with heat pump units.

695
01:59:26,618 --> 01:59:37,221
So these would be variable refrigerant flow heat pumps that would be able to do heating in the winter and cooling in the summer with one heat pump device.

696
01:59:38,922 --> 01:59:44,064
We are also considering, with the air handler replacements, still maintaining a hot water coil

697
01:59:44,659 --> 01:59:48,803
for those backup purposes for the resiliency in case of the power outage.

698
01:59:49,264 --> 01:59:54,529
So heat could be provided to areas where people may assemble like the cafeteria in the gymnasium.

699
01:59:55,591 --> 01:59:59,615
So overall, this would result in about an over 50%

700
02:00:01,412 --> 02:00:16,016
savings in your current natural gas use, which is right now equivalent to approximately 39% of the greenhouse gas emissions, which would increase upwards towards 58% with full renewable electricity.

701
02:00:16,816 --> 02:00:22,278
And Alicia can speak to this, but solar power is being contemplated and planned for the Andrews School.

702
02:00:22,338 --> 02:00:26,039
So hopefully those greenhouse gas emissions would go up over time.

703
02:00:32,614 --> 02:00:32,774
Um.

704
02:00:35,595 --> 02:00:44,196
So what we didn't mention, and I omitted from putting on the slides, but I do just want to keep putting on the table, um, is that, um.

705
02:00:45,456 --> 02:00:46,157
We talked.

706
02:00:46,477 --> 02:00:50,197
I talked with members of the school committee, uh, pre covid.

707
02:00:50,257 --> 02:00:54,378
So I believe it was in 2019 about the roofs in the states of the roofs of the school.

708
02:00:54,958 --> 02:00:59,319
At that time, we authorized and, uh,

709
02:01:00,728 --> 02:01:13,376
I want to call it a repair, but it was a restoration of the roof at the Andrew school so that roof has a 20 year lifespan on it now and we I actually have in my email a con a proposed contract to put.

710
02:01:14,194 --> 02:01:16,116
solar on the roof of the Andrews School.

711
02:01:16,456 --> 02:01:27,904
It's actually looking like our best option, given the new federal direct pay incentives, is for us to actually purchase this solar, which could also result in us saving money.

712
02:01:28,325 --> 02:01:32,928
My goal is to actually move that project forward this summer, if at all possible.

713
02:01:33,609 --> 02:01:40,414
But frankly, I'd like to read the contract before I commit to something, but the pricing actually is excellent.

714
02:01:40,514 --> 02:01:41,034
I'm thrilled.

715
02:01:42,115 --> 02:01:43,356
I mentioned that because

716
02:01:44,082 --> 02:01:48,184
We need to start doing our roofs, we need to start replacing our roofs.

717
02:01:48,624 --> 02:02:06,092
The right thing to do is a full replacement that also includes new insulation, which would reduce the amount of energy we need for heating and cooling the schools, and could actually if we did it at the McGlynn school at the same time, could help us size down the size of the equipment we would need

718
02:02:06,505 --> 02:02:19,657
at the McGlynn School, at least, because of all the insulation it would add to it, would then also allow us to pursue, and I would pursue it sort of as the roof, I think it would make sense to fold into this project, pursuing solar on that.

719
02:02:19,737 --> 02:02:26,083
I would probably just do that as a separate piece to go out and procure solar for the roof of the McGlynn School.

720
02:02:26,443 --> 02:02:29,024
and see if we could get some excellent pricing on that as well.

721
02:02:29,344 --> 02:02:32,085
So I just wanna put that on the table that we're really looking at that.

722
02:02:32,645 --> 02:02:38,628
There's also always the option to buy renewable credits to offset electricity usage.

723
02:02:39,288 --> 02:02:47,771
So the city also had an opportunity and we employed an HVAC technician to review the equipment in all of the schools.

724
02:02:48,091 --> 02:02:54,454
He produced a nine page report that said that the reports for the

725
02:02:55,626 --> 02:02:59,428
Andrews and the McGlynn, he also agreed, were like, this is failed.

726
02:02:59,508 --> 02:03:01,949
This needs new equipment.

727
02:03:01,989 --> 02:03:03,049
This is not repairable.

728
02:03:03,470 --> 02:03:23,099
The other three schools all seemed to be that they needed some repairs, some serious maintenance, like a little more than heavy maintenance, some retro commissioning, but that they could be kept running for several years, which would give us a chance to do this project, see how the Andrews and McGlynn go,

729
02:03:24,406 --> 02:03:34,069
and then to start doing some capital planning to come back and do, because these systems won't last forever, but can we keep them another five years, possibly 10, yes.

730
02:03:35,029 --> 02:03:53,694
So, however, my recommendation is that we actually have the same OPM and design teams do these projects at the same time so that the things that do need to be changed are changed inconsistent with our values and goals around renewable energy, around lowering energy usage,

731
02:03:54,701 --> 02:04:01,763
and our similar equipment so that we can make it easier on our maintenance staff to maintain similar things.

732
02:04:01,823 --> 02:04:06,804
It is easier for them when things are on the same control system, same kinds of stuff.

733
02:04:07,224 --> 02:04:11,466
Oh, this is what works at the Brooks, it's the same stuff at the Roberts, and it's the same stuff at the McGlynn.

734
02:04:11,526 --> 02:04:12,866
It is in fact helpful for them.

735
02:04:13,379 --> 02:04:28,189
So that's my recommendation is to just rather than trying to have our facilities department or someone else managing what are kind of significant repairs and in some places replacement, we just roll it in and try and move that forward quickly.

736
02:04:30,430 --> 02:04:36,694
So then I just wanted to talk about the elephant in the room, which is geothermal, because we are all hearing about geothermal.

737
02:04:36,814 --> 02:04:39,696
I have been on the calls with our delegation.

738
02:04:39,716 --> 02:04:41,177
I have been looking at the various

739
02:04:41,604 --> 02:04:44,668
opportunities, there's a lot of federal money right now.

740
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:54,582
If we do solar, we can get these federal, it's not rebates, sorry, I keep forgetting the exact word for it.

741
02:04:55,410 --> 02:05:00,393
Direct pay is what they're calling it, but different federal agencies are referring to the term differently, but direct pay.

742
02:05:00,413 --> 02:05:16,761
But what it is, is that as a homeowner, as somebody with a tax burden, if I was to do solar or one of these renewable projects, I would get a tax credit, like not reduce my income by that amount, but actually, oh, I owe 50,000 in taxes.

743
02:05:16,781 --> 02:05:21,583
You can take 30% of the cost of your project off the taxes you owe to the government.

744
02:05:22,143 --> 02:05:25,225
We as a nonprofit, as a non-tax bearing entity,

745
02:05:25,598 --> 02:05:35,042
we do not have the tax liability, this new system actually allows us to get a check back from the IRS for that money, which is brilliant.

746
02:05:35,458 --> 02:05:55,768
So for the solar, it would be for the solar, I do think and I'm pushing on this little bit if we did a roof and solar together that we could get, we may be able to get the money for the roof, the 30%, as well as the solar, but the rules for this program, while the law was passed about 18 months ago, the rules have just started coming out in January and February.

747
02:05:56,072 --> 02:06:02,639
And so then people have to sort of like understand what are these rules mean, and nobody's tested the rules because they literally just came out.

748
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:05,042
So we are looking at that.

749
02:06:05,802 --> 02:06:11,829
But there's also a lot of money for geothermal and if your project involves geothermal, then you can start looking at these 30% tax

750
02:06:13,484 --> 02:06:24,950
incentives basically um so some of it is that there is a lot of piping in this in the classrooms and I would actually honestly need gabby and Josh to speak to specifically which piping what.

751
02:06:25,351 --> 02:06:36,817
would need to be at a different sizing to be able to handle the temperature of geothermal water that would include very disruptive work in our schools would take more than we could do in a summer.

752
02:06:37,216 --> 02:06:42,923
and would be disruptive in displacement of classes, perhaps the entire building in order to do that work.

753
02:06:43,323 --> 02:06:45,366
We don't have swing space like that.

754
02:06:45,766 --> 02:06:49,391
So that's one of my concerns, although actually the swing space would be your concern.

755
02:06:50,344 --> 02:06:59,207
My concern would be the work and the saying like the students couldn't, the work we're contemplating, we do believe we can do a large chunk of it over the summer.

756
02:07:00,047 --> 02:07:12,871
We'll get back to the schedule but a large chunk over the summer, and that we could do it without being disruptive to classes and that classes could continue, we could be there in the fall doing the work, and we would not have to displace any classes to do the work.

757
02:07:14,662 --> 02:07:22,884
Other things with geothermal, though, is that, and I have a map about, maybe I'll just flip the map up and then I'll come back to the words.

758
02:07:24,104 --> 02:07:40,807
So the activity use limitation means that there is known contamination under the ground and that it has been, we've had a licensed site professional, we've done studies, we have done testing, and then a limitation like this basically says

759
02:07:41,263 --> 02:07:44,604
here's what's underground, here's what you may or may not do on the property.

760
02:07:45,044 --> 02:07:52,186
So a lot of this, the areas in orange, you can dig down to six feet deep without having an issue.

761
02:07:52,527 --> 02:07:55,447
You can't dig deeper than that because of the contamination.

762
02:07:57,008 --> 02:08:03,490
And we're not concerned about in any way about students coming into contact with the clean dirt on top.

763
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:07,511
But if you start digging wells, we would have to deal with that.

764
02:08:07,811 --> 02:08:09,752
And there are concerns about how that happens.

765
02:08:10,265 --> 02:08:20,669
And there are general knowledge that this entire area, different portions of it, have had dumping on them.

766
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:27,972
And we know that the whole area used to be a salt marsh and that it was created as solid land by dumping materials from the construction of 93.

767
02:08:29,093 --> 02:08:34,055
So there's a lot of concern about what you are going to hit if you start digging in this area.

768
02:08:34,615 --> 02:08:50,150
And that is not, again, insurmountable, but when you dig a well and you have to get rid of the dirt, hundreds of feet of the dirt, and the dirt has contamination in it, that is an order of magnitude more expensive than getting rid of dirt that's clean.

769
02:08:50,570 --> 02:08:53,973
And in fact, hopefully you've all seen our beautiful labyrinth.

770
02:08:54,574 --> 02:08:55,715
It is wonderful.

771
02:08:55,855 --> 02:08:56,255
I love it.

772
02:08:57,336 --> 02:09:04,242
But it is a contamination cap because the land there was so expensive, we couldn't afford to clean up the land under that.

773
02:09:04,702 --> 02:09:13,149
And so we built this beautiful art piece that people love, but it's because the contamination in that corner of the property is actually that bad.

774
02:09:15,131 --> 02:09:18,914
So additionally, there's a conservation restriction on the entire property.

775
02:09:18,934 --> 02:09:21,796
This property was transferred to the city in 1999 from the state.

776
02:09:24,642 --> 02:09:39,931
and everything inside the red, the section nearest the river has a conservation restriction on it, or the whole area has conservation restriction, and the area closest to the river actually has a conservation easement, and I meant to refresh myself on the difference between the two.

777
02:09:40,332 --> 02:09:45,655
Suffice it to say, anything that we do in this area, we actually have to get permission from DCR.

778
02:09:46,415 --> 02:09:53,080
We had to go to DCR for the labyrinth, for the dog park, for the McGlynn playground work, for the wind turbine,

779
02:09:54,344 --> 02:09:56,965
but it's a conservation restriction.

780
02:09:57,805 --> 02:10:01,366
One of the things, and then actually that includes Hormel Stadium, fascinatingly.

781
02:10:02,246 --> 02:10:08,608
So one of the things that I've learned about geothermal is that it is extremely disruptive to the area.

782
02:10:08,948 --> 02:10:15,390
You have to dig up, you have drilling rigs that have to go down hundreds of feet and you have to do a lot of holes.

783
02:10:15,790 --> 02:10:21,592
Sorry, we did the math earlier and I have it on this screen, but we were talking about

784
02:10:27,601 --> 02:10:33,024
Approximately 200 wells to support the Andrews and the McGlynn schools.

785
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:40,788
And we need the area of approximately two Hormel stadiums, sort of more than the football fields that would need to be dug up.

786
02:10:41,328 --> 02:10:48,932
And I understand that one rig can do about either one well or half a well a day.

787
02:10:49,553 --> 02:10:50,453
So we're talking about 200,

788
02:10:52,267 --> 02:10:54,809
days of rigs drilling.

789
02:10:54,829 --> 02:10:59,153
So maybe we can get two or three rigs, but still that's a huge amount of time.

790
02:10:59,533 --> 02:11:04,197
It would be dump trucks in and out of the area for months taking this dirt out.

791
02:11:04,517 --> 02:11:20,731
So that's some of our concerns about it, that it's not that you can't do it, but then also if we hit contamination above and beyond what we were expecting, it could slow the project and it could add costs that we were not even anticipating, even if we anticipate the expense of the contamination.

792
02:11:21,308 --> 02:11:37,381
We have not yet determined whether if you're using direct pay and you hit contamination, you can get the 30% tax credit on the 30% of the cost of disposing that soil, because you could if you were disposing the clean fill, definitely.

793
02:11:37,921 --> 02:11:42,503
But if it's dirty, we need to, I'm not sure if anybody's asked yet, frankly.

794
02:11:43,424 --> 02:11:46,865
So those are some of the things that have come up around geothermal.

795
02:11:47,186 --> 02:11:51,688
Now to be clear, I do think we should be seriously considering geothermal for Medford High School.

796
02:11:52,068 --> 02:11:54,509
And I think about where are we looking at?

797
02:11:54,589 --> 02:11:55,730
What is the location?

798
02:11:56,170 --> 02:11:57,030
Is this possible?

799
02:11:57,290 --> 02:12:06,635
But when you're doing a massive building construction, a new construction, you're already displacing students, you're putting in new HVAC equipment, you're putting in all new stuff,

800
02:12:07,148 --> 02:12:11,799
I definitely think it needs to be on the table for that project.

801
02:12:12,821 --> 02:12:15,067
I have significant concerns here, though.

802
02:12:16,874 --> 02:12:22,977
And then the other thing we so we talked about, could we do it like Cornell Stadium needs actually new turf in the next few years?

803
02:12:23,097 --> 02:12:26,619
Could you dig it all up and put boring holes under the turf?

804
02:12:26,999 --> 02:12:32,101
Turns out, yes, we're told that you can put boring holes and put the turf on top of it.

805
02:12:32,481 --> 02:12:35,083
So that is, in fact, not out of the question.

806
02:12:35,103 --> 02:12:41,406
We do have another giant turf in Medford that that is perhaps this could be on the table for.

807
02:12:42,830 --> 02:12:44,131
So we're looking at these things.

808
02:12:44,871 --> 02:12:51,294
But again, if you did it, you can do it under a parking lots, you can put it under parking lots and put your pavement right over it and that's fine as well.

809
02:12:52,875 --> 02:12:55,876
But again, that's a lot of time for your parking lots to be disturbed.

810
02:12:56,314 --> 02:13:02,036
So I feel like we I really wanted to go into that because I think a lot of people are saying, why not geothermal.

811
02:13:03,617 --> 02:13:14,801
We would still also need to use a lot of electricity with geothermal geothermal does not negate the need for using electricity and your electricity use goes up because of all the pumps that are involved with it as well.

812
02:13:17,782 --> 02:13:38,199
I will then just sort of, because we didn't examine geothermal for the police station and the library and the cost benefit for the energy savings, like the greenhouse gas reductions from an all electric building or an all electric with geothermal was not significant because of the amount of electricity we still needed in the building for the geothermal.

813
02:13:39,079 --> 02:13:41,962
Like it was a real number, but it wasn't like, oh, we'll cut it by 50%.

814
02:13:42,062 --> 02:13:45,985
It was like another five or 10%, if I remember correctly.

815
02:13:48,243 --> 02:13:56,849
So then there are other issues with the full electrification, because in addition to geothermal, you could use electric resistive boilers.

816
02:13:57,330 --> 02:14:02,614
And I'm just saying that those use a lot of electricity, like a lot of electricity.

817
02:14:03,094 --> 02:14:06,817
And that is, would be in my opinion, very wasteful.

818
02:14:08,138 --> 02:14:13,822
But regardless, if you did a lot of, if you did electrification, all electrification, even with geothermal,

819
02:14:14,363 --> 02:14:18,145
we would need upgrades to the National Grid infrastructure in the area.

820
02:14:18,425 --> 02:14:33,331
That was actually something that we've been butting up against for the solar battery project that we were working on, that the cost of the electrical upgrades were gonna be, at that time I was quoted around $350,000 and National Grid was putting it on us.

821
02:14:33,751 --> 02:14:35,732
And I was looking at a million dollar project.

822
02:14:35,772 --> 02:14:36,912
I was like, this is insane.

823
02:14:38,353 --> 02:14:41,735
So that is something that is a serious, a significant concern.

824
02:14:43,655 --> 02:14:50,817
We would also if we went all electric, we would need a significantly larger generator than we currently have at each of the buildings.

825
02:14:51,437 --> 02:14:59,240
Now if we did that a larger building a generator would not physically fit into each of those buildings, so we actually talked about could we put a.

826
02:15:00,492 --> 02:15:06,954
an external generator between the two buildings in like a separate outbuilding that would serve both buildings.

827
02:15:07,894 --> 02:15:09,035
Yes, it would be possible.

828
02:15:09,515 --> 02:15:13,476
It might not actually be a bad idea if we needed a larger generator.

829
02:15:14,136 --> 02:15:17,477
We would also need the special permits from DCR because of that.

830
02:15:18,117 --> 02:15:22,139
So that's something to sort of like, so there were some, some of these were the concerns.

831
02:15:22,579 --> 02:15:29,221
And then we were also looking at the kitchen hoods, which would need a heat recovery ventilator because the,

832
02:15:30,925 --> 02:15:33,406
outdoor air hitting the coil could damage the heat pump.

833
02:15:33,466 --> 02:15:35,787
Okay, I'm sorry.

834
02:15:36,267 --> 02:15:47,110
Somebody, one of the other experts would have to explain that at this point, because I am aware, and I believe Rhetta may be here to speak to this, that we are already upgrading a lot of our kitchen equipment to all electric.

835
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:55,112
And we are in fact running into electrical problems, as I understand it, because of that, but we are trying to move forward with electric ones.

836
02:15:56,372 --> 02:15:58,713
So very briefly, I'll just touch on

837
02:15:59,363 --> 02:16:03,761
This is the, our team, our current team has.

838
02:16:04,454 --> 02:16:06,275
the most knowledge about the Andrew School.

839
02:16:06,475 --> 02:16:20,901
We believe that the McGlynn School schedule would be very similar, but we have to reserve sort of this caveat of we've done extensive reviews of all of the equipment in the Andrew School, and we have a lot of knowledge and a lot of confidence in this schedule.

840
02:16:21,281 --> 02:16:30,725
The McGlynn School would probably move on the same timeline, but once they get in there digging into the details of the building, it's possible that there'll be some unexpected conditions that could

841
02:16:31,405 --> 02:16:39,515
delay our off derail us a little there's actually a bunch of pre work that is needed, this is a major project looking at.

842
02:16:40,496 --> 02:16:49,206
Some potentially sub metering understanding exactly the loads that are needed in this building what what do we need to put in here some conceptual design.

843
02:16:49,548 --> 02:16:55,332
There's a phase where you work with the owners of the building to determine the owner's project requirements.

844
02:16:55,412 --> 02:17:04,377
So this committee would be involved in determining the owner's project requirements of the project, and then the design of the project, construction documents.

845
02:17:05,138 --> 02:17:08,140
We're exploring the best way to move this forward.

846
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:11,422
Some of this equipment has extremely long lead times.

847
02:17:11,522 --> 02:17:13,443
Gabby's actually been making some phone calls.

848
02:17:13,843 --> 02:17:17,244
there's one piece of equipment that right now has a 32 week lead time.

849
02:17:18,004 --> 02:17:21,385
And one of the key, I wrote it down, which one.

850
02:17:22,565 --> 02:17:40,369
So there's a recommendation around what procurement process we should use and whether we should actually consider a construction manager at risk process, because that would allow us to pre-purchase a bunch of the equipment to do the design and purchase the equipment before the rest of it.

851
02:17:42,009 --> 02:17:43,630
in order to hit these lead times.

852
02:17:45,311 --> 02:17:48,372
And then what we're looking at here is to start the work.

853
02:17:48,412 --> 02:17:52,394
We would be ready to start the work with all the procurement actually next summer.

854
02:17:52,934 --> 02:17:57,936
So we'd be looking maybe at a May start, but maybe you don't want to start it during finals.

855
02:17:57,956 --> 02:18:01,058
We'd have to be able to understand what exactly we're talking about.

856
02:18:01,158 --> 02:18:02,358
Would there be disruption?

857
02:18:02,918 --> 02:18:07,621
If there's no air conditioning, we might as well be using the space anyhow and working on the equipment.

858
02:18:08,971 --> 02:18:14,495
through the summer and then into the fall with it being ready for the heating season to be up and running.

859
02:18:15,295 --> 02:18:24,541
I originally had hoped that we could do it this summer, but that is not possible with a project of this scale and not with the equipment lead times that we're seeing right now.

860
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:34,075
So that is a lot, but I also have, Gabby and Josh have also their electrical lead here as well.

861
02:18:34,675 --> 02:18:44,780
And we've also brought, Tom is the representative from the OPM that we are recommending that we work with, who has experience with these kinds of projects.

862
02:18:45,401 --> 02:18:52,905
So once we start to get into the details, frankly, I'm good at the high level, and we hit a point where I have to turn to them for the details.

863
02:18:55,555 --> 02:18:55,835
Thank you.

864
02:18:56,156 --> 02:18:56,296
Ms.

865
02:18:56,316 --> 02:18:59,300
Smith, do you wanna come up and speak on this?

866
02:19:00,562 --> 02:19:01,503
Sorry, we tabled it, so.

867
02:19:01,523 --> 02:19:05,349
That's all right, thanks.

868
02:19:06,355 --> 02:19:12,600
I just wanted to say with respect to the kitchens, we have a lot of equipment that needs to be replaced.

869
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:19,826
We've been working on borrowed time this year, I had planned and had hoped to replace all of the gas equipment with electric.

870
02:19:20,566 --> 02:19:21,807
So I started working on it.

871
02:19:22,808 --> 02:19:28,573
In the beginning of October, getting electricians in saying okay can we do this what equipment what I need to purchase.

872
02:19:29,113 --> 02:19:39,285
getting it ordered installed so now we're almost may I have three beautiful shiny new pieces of equipment in the Andrews and we cannot use them because we're still not.

873
02:19:41,127 --> 02:19:42,388
we're not connected yet.

874
02:19:42,968 --> 02:19:46,589
So there are some real challenges in making this happen.

875
02:19:47,009 --> 02:19:52,471
I've also had electricians look at the McGlynn, because I have already purchased one piece of equipment that's there also.

876
02:19:53,032 --> 02:19:59,934
And they've told me that the board, it was a mess from day one, like wrong sized wires, things are mislabeled.

877
02:20:00,034 --> 02:20:06,717
So it's a bigger task than just purchasing the equipment and getting the connections.

878
02:20:07,279 --> 02:20:20,862
And I'm hesitant to try to continue working towards electrical until I can really use the Andrews as a guinea pig and figuring out once we start using it, can the building actually handle the load because it draws a lot of power.

879
02:20:22,202 --> 02:20:24,503
So that's just a lot of concerns.

880
02:20:24,543 --> 02:20:30,124
And in the meantime, I still have all of these other schools with equipment that needs to be replaced and the clock is ticking.

881
02:20:30,624 --> 02:20:35,545
So that's just what I wanted to share is my experience with trying to make this happen.

882
02:20:36,348 --> 02:20:38,690
not being as easy as it seems.

883
02:20:41,371 --> 02:20:42,832
And that's, thank you, Ms.

884
02:20:43,253 --> 02:20:44,814
Smith, that's relevant too.

885
02:20:44,874 --> 02:20:54,981
If you had to come before us each time, you maybe couldn't do electric because of our panels or the work needs to be done on that aspect.

886
02:20:56,422 --> 02:20:56,882
Member Rousseau?

887
02:20:57,622 --> 02:20:57,982
Thank you.

888
02:20:58,502 --> 02:21:15,171
I like the presentation I especially like the additions to it that were spoken because there was things sort of missing I thought from the presentation that you answered about the backup gas boiler backup is probably the wrong word since it will actually need to be in use anyways.

889
02:21:18,995 --> 02:21:22,057
This is my seventh year in school committee so I'm just going to be blunt.

890
02:21:23,058 --> 02:21:25,679
If a future superintendent doesn't like the electric bill.

891
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:32,824
Can they turn off that system and just go to the gas system to save some money, because that's, that's an, that's a Medford mo.

892
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:35,421
we're gonna cut this budget this year.

893
02:21:36,162 --> 02:21:44,468
And if we stop using electric at the Andrews and just use the gas backup system and it costs way less money, that is a decision that won't come to the school committee.

894
02:21:44,528 --> 02:22:03,282
It'll just be somebody in facilities or in the superintendent's office, no offense to the superintendent, but when the pandemic began, or maybe it was just before the pandemic, Director Hunt evaluated the high school about what it would be, how we could save money by installing

895
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:07,362
more efficient equipment to heat or cool the place.

896
02:22:07,782 --> 02:22:12,224
It turns out there's no such thing as more efficient because all of the equipment was turned off or dead.

897
02:22:12,244 --> 02:22:14,466
So you can't do better than zero.

898
02:22:15,686 --> 02:22:24,491
And so I'm just deeply concerned as this is a system that could support just in perpetuity if somebody decided the electric bill was too high.

899
02:22:28,914 --> 02:22:30,575
Yes, that is a possibility.

900
02:22:31,806 --> 02:22:32,146
Thank you.

901
02:22:32,167 --> 02:22:37,694
I assumed I just, you know, just thinking about like how we're going to figure out how to make sure that that does not happen.

902
02:22:37,794 --> 02:22:38,755
It's not for you all.

903
02:22:41,018 --> 02:22:43,241
I'm super excited by the solar on the Andrew stuff.

904
02:22:43,281 --> 02:22:45,163
That's very exciting.

905
02:22:46,605 --> 02:22:49,809
I had a question about what is construction manager at risk process.

906
02:22:59,741 --> 02:23:02,082
Hello, I'm Tom Ellis with Jones Lang LaSalle.

907
02:23:02,803 --> 02:23:20,452
The construction management at risk construction delivery was part of the construction reform law of 2004, which allowed for alternative construction delivery over Chapter 149, which is a traditional design, bid, build process sequentially.

908
02:23:21,272 --> 02:23:36,820
construction management risk allows qualification based selection of firms that are builders but then can get them involved earlier in the design process so that things like early procurement of long need items can be secured.

909
02:23:37,820 --> 02:23:38,501
Many of the

910
02:23:39,581 --> 02:23:43,462
Projects in the Commonwealth are now going at construction management risk.

911
02:23:43,542 --> 02:23:54,244
I actually participated in a session on Monday where Deputy Director Jay Mitchell was really advocating for it and telling the process.

912
02:23:54,284 --> 02:24:01,646
Actually, I can provide a link, which is really a good 30-minute presentation by him on the benefits of construction management risk.

913
02:24:01,986 --> 02:24:19,408
But it really becomes a forming a partnership with a builder, instead of having an adversarial condition where a chapter 149 kind of creates that low bid process and then, and then it also allows the, the builder to participate in the budgeting cost estimating scheduling.

914
02:24:19,768 --> 02:24:35,360
So it's a, you agree upon a fee early on it's a competitive process, and the legislation requires certain attributes to happen on the selection process, so it's very clear and open about how it's done, but it's a more of a qualifications based process.

915
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:42,925
But it has proven itself over, let's say, almost 20 years now of being in place that it's really beneficial.

916
02:24:43,125 --> 02:24:45,867
The quality of the construction goes up substantially.

917
02:24:45,967 --> 02:24:52,651
So there's a lot of discussion, but I'll provide that link, and it's a really good presentation if you're interested.

918
02:24:52,872 --> 02:24:53,432
Great, thank you.

919
02:24:53,452 --> 02:24:56,434
That's nice to hear that it's not the

920
02:24:58,786 --> 02:25:09,370
waterfall approach or whatever it was called where you have to just wait and wait and then you get the low bid and it's the lowest bid by a long shot and everybody's like uh-oh like what did we get a bid for?

921
02:25:09,390 --> 02:25:19,494
I'm not sure my colleagues will have other questions but I'll come back to my question because I gotta find it.

922
02:25:22,555 --> 02:25:23,135
Member Graham.

923
02:25:24,216 --> 02:25:24,536
Thank you.

924
02:25:26,690 --> 02:25:27,731
A couple of questions.

925
02:25:28,791 --> 02:25:39,477
On one of the slides, it says partial decarbonization is the practical solution for the moment, but full decarbonization could be done in the future with more time and money.

926
02:25:39,497 --> 02:25:49,363
And it looks like the timeline for the Andrews is really through the summer of 2025.

927
02:25:50,704 --> 02:25:53,745
So what does that mean for the McGlynn?

928
02:25:56,326 --> 02:25:59,829
what would it mean if we were to pursue full decarbonization?

929
02:25:59,869 --> 02:26:06,695
Like what is the timing differential between what you're proposing and what full decarbonization would look like?

930
02:26:11,339 --> 02:26:17,824
Yeah, so as it relates to the McGlynn School first, I'll do that one with the partial and then moving to the full.

931
02:26:18,525 --> 02:26:19,566
So, you know,

932
02:26:21,513 --> 02:26:24,336
The McGlynn School and the Andrews School, like Alicia mentioned, are very similar.

933
02:26:25,017 --> 02:26:30,202
And so we hope that they would follow a similar timeline with this concept that is being currently contemplated.

934
02:26:30,905 --> 02:26:42,616
And not to get too technical, but in the future, additional equipment could be added to this system, which would enable it to be more electrified, more 100% electric.

935
02:26:42,676 --> 02:26:55,327
However, there are certain caveats associated with that, most notably that the electric service to the school would likely need to be upgraded in order to support more electric resistive loads and other heat pumps.

936
02:26:57,051 --> 02:27:16,741
So the timetable for that is really a similar project to this in terms of, you know, one to two years from conception to implementation, possibly sooner depending on the scope that's contemplated as it relates to 100% electrification through geothermal is

937
02:27:18,232 --> 02:27:19,633
a longer process.

938
02:27:20,133 --> 02:27:30,900
It is a process that should be looked at as taking up to three years in a facility of this size, possibly longer.

939
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:38,665
I say three years, not including any potential unforeseen issues related to contamination.

940
02:27:39,165 --> 02:27:41,466
So it is certainly a longer timeline.

941
02:27:41,866 --> 02:27:54,549
While certain activities during design and construction could be compressed or performed in parallel, it is still going to be a notably longer timeline to implement.

942
02:27:55,489 --> 02:27:57,910
So I just want to make sure I'm understanding.

943
02:27:57,970 --> 02:28:00,830
So it's about two years per school.

944
02:28:01,871 --> 02:28:07,152
And if we were pursuing geotherm, like full electrification, it would be

945
02:28:07,867 --> 02:28:20,493
three minimum per school, maybe more, and obviously cost being the big variable there because of the potential contamination, which I think we all are worried about.

946
02:28:22,133 --> 02:28:28,836
Dogs digging there, and my dog digging there, and my kids going to school there, none of that makes me feel super warm and fuzzy.

947
02:28:28,876 --> 02:28:33,578
So I absolutely understand the contamination concerns on the property.

948
02:28:33,598 --> 02:28:34,519
So I'm just trying to understand

949
02:28:35,532 --> 02:28:38,374
scope wise, what would it what would it look like?

950
02:28:38,674 --> 02:28:46,279
And, you know, frankly, do we have could can could we wait six years really for one of those schools to be done?

951
02:28:46,459 --> 02:28:49,221
Or are you proposing that these two would be done sort of in parallel?

952
02:28:50,127 --> 02:29:05,834
I realized that that was perhaps one of the confusions we are absolutely proposing that these two schools be done in parallel that we're doing these at the same time that we would start the Anderson the McGlynn right now, both of them and our goal is that both of them go to construction this time next year.

953
02:29:07,528 --> 02:29:13,051
But we have confidence in where the Andrews is that we can move it at that timeline.

954
02:29:13,391 --> 02:29:21,755
And we believe that we can make the McGlynn have that also going to construction around this time next, like, you know, May, June of next year.

955
02:29:22,556 --> 02:29:27,498
But we have to just have that reservation of we really have to get in and look at all the details.

956
02:29:28,359 --> 02:29:32,281
And there's some pieces that we can, things that can be doing in advance, some that can't.

957
02:29:32,521 --> 02:29:34,682
If you've ever been in actually the,

958
02:29:35,930 --> 02:29:48,978
Those are the boiler rooms right the central the interior rooms, their interior to the school, and on the Andrews I know that there's these big vents that we're going to have to remove and try and get equipment in and out through these vents.

959
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:52,741
And we still haven't quite figured out how that's going to happen at the McGlynn.

960
02:29:53,121 --> 02:29:58,843
And one of the reasons actually to do the CM at risk program is that they would be part of the design team.

961
02:29:59,303 --> 02:30:07,006
So as rather than us saying, oh, we are engineers and we have figured out how you're going to get this equipment in and out.

962
02:30:07,306 --> 02:30:14,949
We work with the people who will actually be responsible for getting the equipment in and out to make that decision about how it's going to work.

963
02:30:15,535 --> 02:30:18,837
And that is actually one of the big reasons I'm very interested in.

964
02:30:19,198 --> 02:30:37,331
We've never done CM at risk in Medford, but it seems to me that for something like this, where it's not just, well, here's a flat piece of land, build a building, this is an existing building that'll be occupied, that we need the person doing the work to be our partner in figuring out how exactly this is gonna happen.

965
02:30:37,451 --> 02:30:39,172
There's some interesting spaces in there.

966
02:30:40,168 --> 02:30:42,850
Yeah, so just one more question.

967
02:30:43,570 --> 02:30:56,897
If I am understanding correctly what your proposal is, that the chiller would be replaced with an air to water electric heat pump, and the air handling units would be replaced with heat pumps, which are also electric.

968
02:30:56,938 --> 02:31:02,301
So the remaining gas component would be the condensing boilers.

969
02:31:02,481 --> 02:31:03,981
Is that accurate?

970
02:31:05,722 --> 02:31:07,844
And domestic hot water, yeah.

971
02:31:09,628 --> 02:31:16,309
So the central equipment, which would be remaining gas, would be the condensing boilers.

972
02:31:16,529 --> 02:31:34,693
And what they would serve would be reheat coils, which are hot water coils in the ductwork downstream of the air handlers, as well as perimeter hot water radiation, which basically heats the exterior of the building surface so that occupants do not feel cold.

973
02:31:35,753 --> 02:31:36,013
Got it.

974
02:31:36,614 --> 02:31:43,297
And so are we saying that the scope of what you're proposing does include the insulation and the roof replacement?

975
02:31:46,559 --> 02:31:47,899
Just trying to understand where those are at.

976
02:31:47,919 --> 02:31:51,061
The scope at present does not at the Andrews.

977
02:31:51,681 --> 02:31:55,363
But hopefully, the scope at the McGlynn would.

978
02:31:55,783 --> 02:32:00,065
Because the Andrews had a restoration film.

979
02:32:00,726 --> 02:32:03,347
Anyone is glad to join us on the roof of the Andrews?

980
02:32:04,546 --> 02:32:10,831
see this white, it's a it's a white roof film that was put in in Google View might have it by now right.

981
02:32:11,271 --> 02:32:28,827
And then we also have the McGlynn roof which is significantly larger, that with a solar and with a project, there would probably be the best decision to redo that roof, and to see what costs we could recoup through those, for lack of a better word direct pay tax credits.

982
02:32:29,936 --> 02:32:43,119
I do also just want to say, though, that when you mentioned scope, the scope of this project does not include the piping that runs through the building, and it does not include the unit ventilators in the classrooms, all right?

983
02:32:43,319 --> 02:32:45,340
That is not contemplated in this.

984
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:47,180
I just want to be clear about that.

985
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:49,781
And why are you being clear about that?

986
02:32:50,748 --> 02:32:59,114
Well, it's why do I need to know that it's because if something if we come back in five years or so on and we say we now need to replace the unit ventilators.

987
02:32:59,614 --> 02:33:05,178
All right, I don't want you to, I don't want people to think that this is a soup to nuts replacement of systems.

988
02:33:06,418 --> 02:33:14,364
And the other problem with waiting, waiting years is, in particular with these two schools, we need to act.

989
02:33:18,184 --> 02:33:26,550
And so when we talk about scope so we have a pretty solid cost of what we think the Andrews project would cost that we've been basing this on.

990
02:33:26,963 --> 02:33:29,584
We know that the McGlynn is about 60% bigger.

991
02:33:29,684 --> 02:33:32,805
We know we have an inventory of the equipment that's in there.

992
02:33:33,126 --> 02:33:35,407
So we have a general cost of what this would cost.

993
02:33:35,447 --> 02:33:50,013
So we've been banding some numbers about, but until they actually do design work, it would be September or October when we'll get estimates that are, this is how much we should, we actually need to pay for the whole project.

994
02:33:50,373 --> 02:33:51,593
We don't have that number yet.

995
02:33:52,394 --> 02:33:55,275
We also have not gone out and gotten what is that number for the roof?

996
02:33:55,655 --> 02:34:07,855
You can't actually have a solid construction but by the time we get that number in September, especially if we do see them at risk, it'll be a solid number, they'll be like yes this is how much we need like okay we're going to

997
02:34:08,986 --> 02:34:20,771
I am not your expert on how do we pay for things, but so if I were to say, okay, it's time to go get a bond, assuming that's what we did, then we would have, we would know how big that bond should be at that window.

998
02:34:21,111 --> 02:34:29,815
Right now, we're talking in big round numbers, numbers that are big enough that legally require we must have an OPM to do the project, right?

999
02:34:29,875 --> 02:34:31,476
So that's where we kind of are in budgeting.

1000
02:34:31,496 --> 02:34:33,136
So can you give us an idea of that estimate?

1001
02:34:33,176 --> 02:34:34,457
Like what is that round number?

1002
02:34:34,637 --> 02:34:41,071
We, we've been looking at a number between 15 and $20 million to do both these projects at both schools.

1003
02:34:42,771 --> 02:34:44,812
if we have not really costed roofs.

1004
02:34:45,092 --> 02:34:53,217
When I did that back in 2019, we were looking at one to two million to do a full roof replacement.

1005
02:34:53,757 --> 02:35:02,722
I haven't asked for pricing since then, but that was frankly, I was looking at orders of magnitude because in my work, we go get a grant to pay for things.

1006
02:35:03,122 --> 02:35:07,125
We need to know, is that grant big enough or that grant big enough?

1007
02:35:07,185 --> 02:35:09,746
So those are sort of the round numbers.

1008
02:35:10,046 --> 02:35:10,146
Yep.

1009
02:35:12,153 --> 02:35:18,299
why we actually need to hire the consultants to do the design, to do the engineering, to figure out solid numbers.

1010
02:35:18,820 --> 02:35:20,422
But these are big numbers.

1011
02:35:20,722 --> 02:35:21,563
These are not small.

1012
02:35:21,663 --> 02:35:22,263
I realized that.

1013
02:35:22,303 --> 02:35:23,705
I was on our building projects.

1014
02:35:25,046 --> 02:35:31,773
So I think my other question is, when we talk about how would we pay for this, I think that's

1015
02:35:33,100 --> 02:35:35,441
the school budget has like nothing in it for maintenance.

1016
02:35:35,501 --> 02:35:37,182
We've started having that discussion.

1017
02:35:38,282 --> 02:35:46,105
We could talk about why that is all day, but the bottom line is there's like a fraction of what is even needed to maintain the buildings in there today.

1018
02:35:46,225 --> 02:35:55,349
So where does $20 million come from in terms of like what procedurally has to happen and how can we support this process?

1019
02:35:55,389 --> 02:36:00,711
Because those two buildings need this work urgently and probably long ago.

1020
02:36:01,772 --> 02:36:02,912
So I, you know,

1021
02:36:03,476 --> 02:36:11,038
concern that we have taken so long to like get to the point of action, which is something that I think we have to just continue to work on.

1022
02:36:11,098 --> 02:36:15,899
But meanwhile, like we have a project in front of us and we're going to have to figure out how to pay for it.

1023
02:36:15,959 --> 02:36:20,501
So where does that where does that come from in terms of like the broader picture of the city?

1024
02:36:21,761 --> 02:36:30,943
Yep, no, I think that what you could do for the project is support this plan and let our teams move forward and get it done.

1025
02:36:31,363 --> 02:36:33,204
OPM is going to be a whole cost in itself.

1026
02:36:33,772 --> 02:36:39,036
So that will come out of ARPA funding, and then we will move forward with most likely a bond.

1027
02:36:40,317 --> 02:36:42,119
Okay.

1028
02:36:42,179 --> 02:36:43,079
That's helpful, thank you.

1029
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:50,305
But we can discuss it more in our financial task force meetings as we map out all the needs of the city and schools.

1030
02:36:51,026 --> 02:36:53,267
So I had two questions.

1031
02:36:53,368 --> 02:36:58,352
So to confirm, we're looking at this coming out of the city budget rather than the school's budget?

1032
02:36:58,552 --> 02:36:59,813
This will not come out of the school budget.

1033
02:37:01,593 --> 02:37:03,335
Just wanted to say it.

1034
02:37:04,116 --> 02:37:15,972
Then my question, Dr. Cushing, you alluded to this, what does compatibility look like for future projects in terms of what equipment we're going to need and being able to

1035
02:37:16,559 --> 02:37:25,644
make the connection move transition into the next stage of renovating this what is more, and I guess maybe I'm asking what is Moore's law for HVAC equipment.

1036
02:37:25,804 --> 02:37:32,567
So, so this, these are the moments where I have to admit what I do and don't know and that's why I have a team of engineers here.

1037
02:37:33,448 --> 02:37:36,630
Because, in all honesty, provided the transition I was expecting them.

1038
02:37:36,670 --> 02:37:36,910
Yeah.

1039
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:39,051
And I will say this, like,

1040
02:37:40,734 --> 02:37:46,001
Earlier this year, I presented on these systems, and I think I said, like, I dove off the deep end.

1041
02:37:46,962 --> 02:37:53,812
And again, recently, I'm amazed that, you know, just the size of the pipes in the building feed in classrooms.

1042
02:37:54,568 --> 02:38:09,954
would need to be different for various temperature changes that geothermal, whatever, like the minutiae of details that need to be paid attention to in these projects is why it's great to have engineers now answer that question for me.

1043
02:38:10,494 --> 02:38:11,855
I would love that, sir.

1044
02:38:13,416 --> 02:38:14,316
Yes.

1045
02:38:14,776 --> 02:38:16,657
So as it relates to kind of

1046
02:38:17,867 --> 02:38:22,570
equipment being kind of obsolete over time and becoming obsolete over time.

1047
02:38:22,590 --> 02:38:30,155
So what we are contemplating replacing is our 22, refrigerant 22 based equipment.

1048
02:38:30,355 --> 02:38:36,039
So it's been installed since original construction in approximately 2001 to 2003.

1049
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:41,483
It has worked for 15 to 20 years, depending on the piece of equipment you're looking at.

1050
02:38:42,504 --> 02:38:48,008
Parts are, you know, for the most part still commercially available refrigerant has been phased out.

1051
02:38:48,488 --> 02:39:05,180
So refrigerant is not really available or available in small quantities and so that kind of refrigerant phase out will continue as there are plans to continue, you know, lower, lowering the global warming potential of different refrigerants, and, you know, in.

1052
02:39:06,661 --> 02:39:11,345
incorporating legislation that requires lower GWP refrigerants to be used.

1053
02:39:11,365 --> 02:39:18,652
So in that case, proceeding today, there will be a certain refrigerant base of equipment that is available.

1054
02:39:20,234 --> 02:39:25,639
And over time, the refrigerants may change, the requirements for refrigerants may change.

1055
02:39:26,099 --> 02:39:40,068
So as it relates to other components of the system, there are compressors, which the technology has improved and evolved, but compressors, which were made 20 years ago are still replaceable today.

1056
02:39:41,689 --> 02:39:50,075
There are control boards and other kind of micro electronics, which are integral parts of these machines.

1057
02:39:50,735 --> 02:39:52,336
And these are probably the,

1058
02:39:53,900 --> 02:40:11,635
most, I guess susceptible to Moore's law in the fact that technology advances related to control boards and PCBs and other types of microelectronics go much faster, other than, you know, compared to mechanical systems like compressor.

1059
02:40:14,676 --> 02:40:23,578
equipment, which is reaching the near near the end of its life, which is widely considered to be 2015 to 20 years, depending on the piece of equipment.

1060
02:40:23,598 --> 02:40:34,381
You know, will over its life necessitate various maintenance procedures, which would include upgrading or replacing control boards as they fail.

1061
02:40:34,901 --> 02:40:37,262
So for the most part,

1062
02:40:39,022 --> 02:40:50,850
control boards and other small components of these devices have been widely available for different pieces of mechanical machinery and HVAC equipment for a long time.

1063
02:40:51,430 --> 02:41:05,440
And so, in other words, you can typically go out or one could typically go out and use a vendor to procure and install a replacement part through the life of the equipment, so for 15, 20 years.

1064
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:08,142
And at that point, somewhere along the way,

1065
02:41:10,043 --> 02:41:21,929
they will, and they being the manufacturers, will start to move on to newer generations of equipment and which they will stop making those parts and they would then be susceptible to Moore's Law.

1066
02:41:21,969 --> 02:41:25,290
So somewhere in the 15 to 20 years is what I would expect.

1067
02:41:25,671 --> 02:41:31,774
Okay, and then will the, do you anticipate, I know nobody can see the future exactly, but do you anticipate there will be

1068
02:41:34,255 --> 02:41:37,720
more climate friendly, more low carbon options.

1069
02:41:38,001 --> 02:41:38,281
Yes.

1070
02:41:38,662 --> 02:41:40,544
And that's kind of what I want to anticipate.

1071
02:41:41,285 --> 02:41:46,573
I don't want to be in a cycle of replacing things with what we have, just because it's the only thing available.

1072
02:41:46,843 --> 02:42:15,192
And the manufacturers are certainly thinking about that too, because as they are kind of working towards lower GWP refrigerants and kind of continuing to manufacture their current market base or current offerings while looking at R&D and developing new offerings, they are saying, well, what happens when I have a refrigerant leak or one of my customers has a refrigerant leak on an old system or needs to repair?

1073
02:42:16,633 --> 02:42:21,517
For example, R22 is not, for a number of reasons, is not desirable.

1074
02:42:22,037 --> 02:42:23,458
So what would you do?

1075
02:42:23,959 --> 02:42:34,308
Presently, there are options to drop in newer refrigerants into systems and they're being made in such a way that future refrigerants should be compatible.

1076
02:42:39,002 --> 02:42:39,302
Thank you.

1077
02:42:39,342 --> 02:42:47,884
So I think you're answering my question about R22, which was that when we're done with this, there will be no more R22 in use at these two buildings.

1078
02:42:48,204 --> 02:42:48,884
That's correct.

1079
02:42:48,924 --> 02:42:49,344
Wonderful.

1080
02:42:49,404 --> 02:42:50,544
Best thing I've heard all night.

1081
02:42:51,725 --> 02:42:53,245
That's not true.

1082
02:42:53,305 --> 02:42:55,406
Our stuff was good, but there's also more great stuff.

1083
02:42:56,306 --> 02:43:00,046
And I'm going to scroll up here.

1084
02:43:01,607 --> 02:43:06,028
So I just renovated my kitchen, and I had to spend a fortune on power upgrade.

1085
02:43:07,796 --> 02:43:14,301
which on scale probably is less than the $350,000 that we were talking about for a whole school.

1086
02:43:18,385 --> 02:43:25,170
This is obviously a problem in probably every municipal building and school building in the country.

1087
02:43:26,751 --> 02:43:31,215
Is there anything going on of interest around how this is funded?

1088
02:43:31,235 --> 02:43:34,518
Because to think that every school building in the country will be able to pop

1089
02:43:36,315 --> 02:43:47,226
a $350,000, right, a $350,000 check for electrical upgrades, that just doesn't seem like a scalable or, you know, we have Prop 2.5 in this state.

1090
02:43:47,326 --> 02:43:56,114
I mean, there's no way every school building is ever going to be electric if everyone has to upgrade their, the do national grids bidding.

1091
02:43:56,134 --> 02:43:58,677
I mean, we all look at our bills and

1092
02:43:59,087 --> 02:44:02,829
It's like we pay this much for electricity and this much for the delivery.

1093
02:44:02,869 --> 02:44:06,730
I don't know what's included in delivery if it doesn't include actually the infrastructure.

1094
02:44:07,351 --> 02:44:10,492
So is this just the way it is right now?

1095
02:44:10,552 --> 02:44:13,833
Is there anybody looking at how to change that?

1096
02:44:15,314 --> 02:44:22,577
Is this sort of like when I upgraded my panel at home, like 8,500 bucks just to install my new kitchen stove?

1097
02:44:23,718 --> 02:44:26,239
Is that what we're talking about?

1098
02:44:27,398 --> 02:44:29,822
So there aren't.

1099
02:44:31,735 --> 02:44:39,680
grant programs that I'm aware of right now, which are funding specifically service upgrades, unless it's rolled into a project.

1100
02:44:39,720 --> 02:44:45,364
So if it's necessary for a project, presumably it could be contemplated subject to reviewing the rules.

1101
02:44:45,944 --> 02:45:00,574
But for example, if a service upgrade was necessary to support a full electrification project that also qualified for the 30% direct pay payment, that it would need to be evaluated whether or not that cost could be covered by that incentive.

1102
02:45:01,889 --> 02:45:13,620
When I did this upgrade at home, which nobody cares about my home projects, but one of the things I'm worried about is, in 20 years, is this going to be enough power in 20 years?

1103
02:45:14,061 --> 02:45:21,108
And so when we talk about these buildings and we spend $350,000 to upgrade the power, is that really enough power no matter what happens?

1104
02:45:21,818 --> 02:45:24,619
Or are we going to potentially have to do this yet again?

1105
02:45:24,639 --> 02:45:34,603
Because I'm sure that the power that's there now was big and powerful and a lot when the building was built, and far more than a building 50 years older.

1106
02:45:34,623 --> 02:45:41,846
So is this just like we're on a treadmill of dumping tons of money to have more power come to buildings?

1107
02:45:42,166 --> 02:45:48,068
Or does this feel like this would be an amount of power that nobody can imagine using at all kind of thing?

1108
02:45:49,870 --> 02:45:54,992
It's, I think there are two elements to your question, which need to be considered.

1109
02:45:55,032 --> 02:45:55,873
It's what's happening.

1110
02:45:56,293 --> 02:46:05,858
If you look at it from what crosses the curb perspective, what's happening on Medford side of the curb and what's happening on the national grid or the utility side of the curb.

1111
02:46:05,938 --> 02:46:17,103
And so there are costs associated with making the building capable of, I guess, accepting that level of demand or having that level of electric demand.

1112
02:46:17,824 --> 02:46:20,166
So the 350,000 is for our side.

1113
02:46:20,947 --> 02:46:27,135
I'm not sure exactly where that number come came from, it might have actually been related to some grid upgrades to support the project.

1114
02:46:29,617 --> 02:46:32,137
Oh, the interconnection costs, yeah, yep.

1115
02:46:32,358 --> 02:46:35,138
So related to the battery solar project, correct, yeah.

1116
02:46:35,558 --> 02:46:45,360
So that's not even really the full service upgrade necessary to the building, switch gears and other electrical infrastructure in order to support a full electric.

1117
02:46:45,700 --> 02:46:47,300
Okay, so that's not a big number.

1118
02:46:47,500 --> 02:46:48,901
All right, thank you.

1119
02:46:48,921 --> 02:46:56,722
I don't need a lesson in electricity, because frankly, that's... And I don't have the numbers right in front of me, and Rhetta would know them right off the top of her head, because she's been

1120
02:46:58,447 --> 02:47:07,033
The costs just on electrical upgrades to move for those three pieces of kitchen equipment have been extremely high.

1121
02:47:07,733 --> 02:47:07,893
Right.

1122
02:47:08,313 --> 02:47:17,359
And, you know, but it's, it's the price we have to pay to move to a decarbonization, because we're moving to 480 volts.

1123
02:47:20,421 --> 02:47:30,707
which then if that breaker trips requires a service call, because you're not supposed to just hit that because of the lethal amount of electricity moving through that breaker.

1124
02:47:32,928 --> 02:47:34,129
A little flip in your kitchen.

1125
02:47:34,409 --> 02:47:36,930
All right, thank you.

1126
02:47:36,950 --> 02:47:37,270
Thank you.

1127
02:47:37,290 --> 02:47:48,537
I think I think I might actually just add that there we have been trying to poke at our I've been for a while we actually the mayor and I met with the Greater Boston Labor Council last summer.

1128
02:47:48,953 --> 02:47:52,194
and the MAPC to start looking at grant opportunities.

1129
02:47:52,574 --> 02:47:58,095
Are there opportunities for us to pull in federal money to help pay for some of these things?

1130
02:47:58,536 --> 02:48:06,698
And what we've been trying to untangle is that the timelines for federal grants don't work for the work that we need to do in these schools right now.

1131
02:48:07,138 --> 02:48:15,540
But we're continuing to try to see if we could set up some pockets of money that could really help with other projects, other big school projects.

1132
02:48:15,947 --> 02:48:25,895
The difficulty is when you apply for a federal grant and a big grant, it usually opens for a window of time that's usually six weeks to 12 weeks, right?

1133
02:48:26,456 --> 02:48:37,345
And then you have to get your application in, and then you often don't know that you've gotten the grant for six to eight to nine months, and then it takes four or five more months to actually access the money.

1134
02:48:37,745 --> 02:48:40,267
Right now, I am working through a Department of Energy grant.

1135
02:48:40,327 --> 02:48:42,269
Actually, Amanda Centrella in my office is.

1136
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:46,000
We received an earmark a year ago.

1137
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:51,442
We were told like a year ago in March that we were getting an earmark for Car Park from the Department of Energy.

1138
02:48:52,102 --> 02:48:54,303
We were offered the paperwork for it.

1139
02:48:54,343 --> 02:48:56,124
So that we didn't even apply for that grant, right?

1140
02:48:56,144 --> 02:49:00,645
We just asked and, you know, Representative Clark was got us the money.

1141
02:49:01,025 --> 02:49:03,126
So we skipped the whole grant application portion.

1142
02:49:03,666 --> 02:49:07,768
And this summer, we started working through the paperwork with them.

1143
02:49:08,268 --> 02:49:10,989
And we are still working through the paperwork

1144
02:49:11,305 --> 02:49:14,726
for the federal government to get approval to spend that.

1145
02:49:14,807 --> 02:49:22,210
We are going to spend a full calendar year working through the paperwork to get the DOE money released so we can spend it.

1146
02:49:22,710 --> 02:49:25,631
And actually there was some complications with it.

1147
02:49:25,931 --> 02:49:33,595
And as a result, we're gonna flip around some of that DOE money will actually help pay for the solar array at the Andrews School and the ARPA money.

1148
02:49:33,635 --> 02:49:35,976
I thought we were gonna, I was gonna ask for that.

1149
02:49:36,036 --> 02:49:40,858
We'll put into the car park project because they can't pay for skate ramps.

1150
02:49:41,325 --> 02:49:46,468
with DOE money, but they said, oh, you have another solar array in the city somewhere.

1151
02:49:46,928 --> 02:49:51,731
Oh, yes, that's part of the same project, because we don't want you to lose your federal earmark money.

1152
02:49:51,751 --> 02:49:58,356
So I just want you to understand, this is part of it, is the cumbersome and the long timelines.

1153
02:49:58,656 --> 02:50:02,858
We need this project done now, and we can't wait for a federal grant to come in.

1154
02:50:03,239 --> 02:50:04,840
That doesn't mean I'm not chasing them.

1155
02:50:05,220 --> 02:50:10,463
It just means I don't think we're going to get them for this project because of the way these timelines work.

1156
02:50:10,796 --> 02:50:13,959
So I just wanted you to know that we're not not looking at them.

1157
02:50:14,299 --> 02:50:14,620
Thank you.

1158
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:15,120
Member Graham.

1159
02:50:16,181 --> 02:50:25,129
I just wanted to make a motion to approve the scope of work provided to us in this presentation and thank the team for being here.

1160
02:50:25,149 --> 02:50:28,693
I know we had a lot of really long, painful questions.

1161
02:50:30,216 --> 02:50:44,123
Thank you all for doing that, but I just wanted to formally approve from our perspective this project and ask that we get regular updates from the group as the process moves forward.

1162
02:50:44,423 --> 02:50:44,983
Great, thank you.

1163
02:50:45,043 --> 02:50:50,186
Motion by Member Graham to approve the scope of this work, seconded by... He said it first.

1164
02:50:50,406 --> 02:50:50,586
Second.

1165
02:50:50,606 --> 02:50:52,447
Member Russo.

1166
02:50:52,887 --> 02:50:53,447
Roll call, please.

1167
02:50:55,728 --> 02:50:56,228
Sorry.

1168
02:50:56,689 --> 02:50:57,269
Member Brandley.

1169
02:50:57,329 --> 02:50:57,529
Yes.

1170
02:50:58,589 --> 02:50:59,030
Member Graham.

1171
02:50:59,330 --> 02:50:59,490
Yes.

1172
02:51:00,754 --> 02:51:01,335
Member Ntapa.

1173
02:51:02,697 --> 02:51:02,897
Yes.

1174
02:51:04,900 --> 02:51:05,580
Member Olopade.

1175
02:51:05,761 --> 02:51:06,041
Yes.

1176
02:51:06,682 --> 02:51:07,323
Member Rheinfeld.

1177
02:51:07,423 --> 02:51:07,663
Yes.

1178
02:51:08,084 --> 02:51:08,765
Member Soyes.

1179
02:51:08,825 --> 02:51:09,426
Mayor Landau-Kirk.

1180
02:51:10,026 --> 02:51:10,247
Yes.

1181
02:51:10,847 --> 02:51:12,129
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1182
02:51:12,890 --> 02:51:13,912
We approve the project.

1183
02:51:13,972 --> 02:51:15,714
And again, thank you for all your hard work.

1184
02:51:16,089 --> 02:51:16,509
We appreciate it.

1185
02:51:16,809 --> 02:51:17,169
Thank you.

1186
02:51:17,329 --> 02:51:27,593
The other last thing I'll just say as we move away from this is that we've been working to change out the lights to full LED throughout our buildings.

1187
02:51:27,653 --> 02:51:32,835
We've even done some of that work, significant amount at Medford High School, because we're still running T12s there.

1188
02:51:33,896 --> 02:51:40,838
And so even though that building will hopefully sunset in the future, the runway is long enough that it will pay off.

1189
02:51:40,858 --> 02:51:42,259
We're using on-bill repayment.

1190
02:51:42,919 --> 02:51:47,725
Uh, the mistletoe in the Brooks of the last two schools that will get this treatment, and that will happen this summer.

1191
02:51:47,905 --> 02:51:48,706
Just so that you're aware.

1192
02:51:49,166 --> 02:51:50,248
Thank you, Dr Cushing.

1193
02:51:50,348 --> 02:51:52,570
We have number four suspension and discipline report.

1194
02:51:52,951 --> 02:51:54,733
Um, Dr Edward Vincent, Superintendent.

1195
02:51:58,206 --> 02:52:11,170
Good evening, the report that I'm going to present right now is suspension data and discipline report, covering the dates of August 28 2023 through March 1 2024.

1196
02:52:20,959 --> 02:52:35,464
In working on this project, this report, I had the opportunity to work with several district leaders, including school building leaders and staff when developing this report to have the context for its data.

1197
02:52:37,165 --> 02:52:46,008
In particular, we strove to ensure that the report doesn't convey identifying details about individual students.

1198
02:52:47,867 --> 02:52:58,690
The disciplinary events which have been captured in this report cover a variety of incident types, student grade levels, and other relevant factors.

1199
02:53:04,031 --> 02:53:08,572
For example, some of the suspensions are the result of pending felony charges.

1200
02:53:11,133 --> 02:53:16,114
There are five official categories that the Medford Public Schools uses when addressing discipline.

1201
02:53:18,427 --> 02:53:26,853
The first one is behaviors that are violent, which could be exhibited through words or the possession of weaponry.

1202
02:53:28,314 --> 02:53:34,338
The second category is behaviors or language or actions that are hostile.

1203
02:53:35,679 --> 02:53:54,472
grounded in racist or discriminatory beliefs that contribute to an environment that is plagued by experiences of marginalization and equity for students based on their race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification, or other immutable characteristics.

1204
02:53:55,673 --> 02:54:11,135
The third category is bullying or retaliatory conduct through words or acts that have the intent of bringing about an intimidating impact on other students.

1205
02:54:12,296 --> 02:54:22,942
The fourth category is for students that have been found to be in possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia, or the intent to distribute drugs to other students.

1206
02:54:23,902 --> 02:54:40,992
And the fifth category is repeated or pronounced disregard for the academic integrity of the school environment through tampering, cheating, plagiarism, or other misrepresentations with respect to their purported work product.

1207
02:54:42,648 --> 02:55:03,283
In this report, there is also a category called other, which could include violations of social media rules, safety guidelines, such as posting photos without consent, false reporting to authority, forgery, trespassing, and again, as I mentioned earlier, felonies outside of school.

1208
02:55:09,605 --> 02:55:19,078
The data that will be presented shows a variety of disciplinary actions, including suspension days taken in response to different behaviors or infractions.

1209
02:55:21,004 --> 02:55:29,548
The data does reveal that students of color students with disabilities and English learners are suspended at a higher rate than their white counterparts.

1210
02:55:30,608 --> 02:55:41,153
This information can help us identify patterns and how schools handle disciplinary cases and highlight areas where additional support or interventions could be beneficial.

1211
02:55:42,694 --> 02:55:57,086
The data also highlights the importance and applicability of implementing effective behavior management strategies interventions and restorative justice to address and reduce the occurrence of negative behaviors in school.

1212
02:55:58,607 --> 02:56:21,253
Some of the things that Medford Public Schools currently uses are detention, Saturday detention, social probation, warnings, behavioral plans, conferences with assistant principals, restorative tasks or meetings, and school recommending referrals for school and or community-based services.

1213
02:56:22,921 --> 02:56:29,543
And all of those strategies are currently deployed in the Medford public schools in lieu of suspension whenever possible.

1214
02:56:31,764 --> 02:56:44,348
So overall, from the timeframe that I mentioned earlier, between the start of school and March 1, there were a total of 61 students that were suspended out of school.

1215
02:56:46,969 --> 02:56:52,575
There were a total of 83 incidents, or 83 actual suspensions.

1216
02:56:53,016 --> 02:57:05,129
So what that means is there are some students that were repeat offenders and we counted them more than once, but in terms of our entire student population.

1217
02:57:06,049 --> 02:57:17,035
When we looked at our October Sims data, we had a total of 4,147 students district wide, and of those 4,147 students, 61 students were suspended over that timeframe, which is 1.47% of our entire population.

1218
02:57:34,975 --> 02:57:39,198
I provide some historical data going back to school year 21, 22, 22, 23, and 23, 24.

1219
02:57:39,258 --> 02:57:49,446
And so what I will share is that of our 4,147 students total population, again, 61 students were suspended during the six and a half month timeframe, which equals 1.47.

1220
02:58:05,478 --> 02:58:07,119
In 2223 school year, we had 4393 students.

1221
02:58:07,179 --> 02:58:11,123
There were 89 students suspended during that time frame, which was a total of two per 2.03% of our population.

1222
02:58:23,494 --> 02:58:28,717
And during the 21-22 school year, we had 4,353 students.

1223
02:58:29,758 --> 02:58:37,602
90 students were suspended over the course of that school year, which results in 2.07% of our population.

1224
02:58:37,622 --> 02:58:39,063
In looking at the data,

1225
02:58:48,251 --> 02:59:00,322
District-wide, over 50% of our behaviors fall in the category of violent or threatening behavior involving fighting.

1226
02:59:02,524 --> 02:59:08,649
The second largest category at 15.7% is obscene language and profanity.

1227
02:59:15,543 --> 02:59:19,825
The third category falls in what we refer to as other.

1228
02:59:20,485 --> 02:59:29,509
Again, social media rules, violations of social media, safety guidelines, posting photos without consent, false reporting.

1229
02:59:31,014 --> 02:59:34,677
forgery trespassing or felonies outside of school.

1230
02:59:36,038 --> 02:59:46,687
And the next area that we are closely monitoring is illegal drugs and paraphernalia, which was 9.6% as a school entire school district.

1231
02:59:54,552 --> 03:00:08,696
I share some data about our ethnicity, our EL suspensions, and our IEP suspensions, and it's data that we are closely monitoring.

1232
03:00:10,277 --> 03:00:22,821
Overall district-wide, our Caucasian students, 36.1% have participated or had an out-of-school suspension.

1233
03:00:24,316 --> 03:00:34,987
black African American students that's 24.6% Latino Hispanic students are 23% are Asian students are 6%, and then other which could be multi ethnic is 9.8%.

1234
03:00:48,433 --> 03:00:53,977
Overall, incident counts by grade level, as mentioned.

1235
03:00:57,160 --> 03:01:06,626
At our middle schools, we had a total of 25 suspensions combined for both of our middle schools.

1236
03:01:07,367 --> 03:01:15,112
Grade seven is the grade with the highest number of suspensions in both schools.

1237
03:01:16,113 --> 03:01:27,209
At the high school level, there were 36 suspensions with grade nine and grade 10 students making up the bulk of those suspensions.

1238
03:01:31,773 --> 03:01:42,242
Of the 25 middle school students, 14 students did attend the Andrews Middle School, and 11 students attended the McGlynn School.

1239
03:01:43,022 --> 03:01:57,494
And due to FERPA guidelines, it dictates that we honor student confidentiality by not disclosing more information about these incidents that might make certain student populations identifiable.

1240
03:02:01,201 --> 03:02:21,268
Again, of the 25 suspensions at the middle school level, we had approximately 976 referrals, which resulted in a total of 41 suspensions.

1241
03:02:21,748 --> 03:02:30,431
So again, there were some students that have been suspended more than once because they were a repeat offender.

1242
03:02:32,071 --> 03:02:40,638
At the high school level, we had 2,599 referrals that were made during the timeframe.

1243
03:02:41,899 --> 03:02:47,883
Of that timeframe, there were 42 suspensions involving 36 students.

1244
03:02:49,425 --> 03:02:53,368
There were eight incidents where the police were notified.

1245
03:02:54,568 --> 03:02:55,449
And again,

1246
03:02:57,648 --> 03:03:11,856
referring to the behaviors at the high school level, the majority of behaviors, 52% were involving violent or threatening behavior.

1247
03:03:13,803 --> 03:03:27,967
And the second largest area 19% was obscene language or profanity, which was the second largest category at the high school level and other 16.7% other.

1248
03:03:35,655 --> 03:03:47,041
At the elementary levels during the timeframe that we were monitoring, there was no data because there were no suspensions.

1249
03:03:49,102 --> 03:03:50,183
So our key findings.

1250
03:03:51,483 --> 03:03:54,345
In summary, there were 61 students out of 4,147 students that were suspended.

1251
03:04:00,071 --> 03:04:04,653
which again equals 1.47% of our student population.

1252
03:04:05,333 --> 03:04:14,596
We are truly committed to carefully reviewing our suspension data with the goal to continue to address discipline and employ alternatives to suspension.

1253
03:04:16,317 --> 03:04:25,180
District-wide, we noticed that 50% of behaviors that result in suspensions fall under violent or threatening behavior.

1254
03:04:26,835 --> 03:04:32,256
written verbal physical threats along with physical fights are included in that category.

1255
03:04:34,096 --> 03:04:45,419
Nearly 16% of suspensions involve obscene language and profanity, which includes racial or discriminatory language.

1256
03:04:45,439 --> 03:04:52,280
13% falls in the other category, which includes violating social media rules and safety guidelines.

1257
03:04:54,770 --> 03:05:03,176
At the high school again, in particular, 52% of behaviors that resulted in suspension fell under violent or threatening behavior.

1258
03:05:03,196 --> 03:05:10,581
19% of those suspensions fall within the obscene language and profanity category.

1259
03:05:10,601 --> 03:05:16,145
And 16.7% fell in the other category.

1260
03:05:17,366 --> 03:05:18,246
At the middle schools,

1261
03:05:19,941 --> 03:05:29,787
Nearly 50% 48.8% of behaviors that resulted in suspensions in middle schools fall under violent or threatening behavior.

1262
03:05:31,428 --> 03:05:41,453
Another concern for the district is that 17.1% of the suspensions involved at the middle school level were related to drugs and drug paraphernalia.

1263
03:05:42,214 --> 03:05:44,235
This was seen across both middle schools.

1264
03:05:44,995 --> 03:05:48,858
We are collaborating with our school counselors and social workers.

1265
03:05:49,958 --> 03:06:05,039
In collaboration with Mr she Shulman, our director of school counseling and behavioral health to address this set of student behaviors 12% of the suspensions involved obscene language and profanity.

1266
03:06:06,129 --> 03:06:20,618
In this area as well, we are working on providing students with effective tools to better express themselves without the use of obscene language or using violent or threatening behavior.

1267
03:06:22,279 --> 03:06:25,621
Suspension is used as a last resort at all levels.

1268
03:06:26,321 --> 03:06:28,683
And again, due to FERPA requirements,

1269
03:06:29,790 --> 03:06:40,255
In the limited number of suspensions, the district did not identify any specific school due to our varied populations and their various needs.

1270
03:06:41,895 --> 03:06:42,336
Actions.

1271
03:06:44,116 --> 03:06:52,280
Out of school suspension and other ways that Medford Public Schools addresses student behavior do include Saturday detention.

1272
03:06:53,717 --> 03:06:56,419
This is for the high school, at the high school level.

1273
03:06:57,200 --> 03:07:02,744
Increased parental involvement, conferences, phone calls, et cetera.

1274
03:07:03,984 --> 03:07:13,811
Detention, student counseling, social work support, meetings with building administrators, principals, assistant principals, et cetera.

1275
03:07:14,632 --> 03:07:22,198
Referral to and coordination with community-based mental health care and substance abuse treatment.

1276
03:07:23,058 --> 03:07:38,557
And so a lot of the things that I mentioned earlier do require significant involvement and support from our community based partners to provide our students with additional mental health care and substance abuse treatment.

1277
03:07:40,334 --> 03:07:50,199
There were requests for additional follow up information and I did provide that to the committee about onboarding and training.

1278
03:07:51,440 --> 03:07:57,503
The August Institute for administrators and staff are trained.

1279
03:07:58,884 --> 03:08:13,159
through principal meetings ongoing throughout the year where they address at school based levels disciplinary challenges and issues that arise in each school on different levels and strategies

1280
03:08:13,659 --> 03:08:23,784
that can be used to help our students on November 7, all staff participated in a bullying training, which touched upon discipline.

1281
03:08:23,804 --> 03:08:28,566
And during the first weeks of six weeks of school our educators.

1282
03:08:29,426 --> 03:08:39,236
at elementary levels and our teachers at the secondary level set rules and expectations for behaviors for the entire year.

1283
03:08:40,257 --> 03:08:52,630
Students participate in morning meeting, nexus classes, and advisory classes at the secondary level to incorporate self-strategies to support our students.

1284
03:08:55,249 --> 03:09:02,335
We, again for the purposes of this report suspension is referring to out of school suspensions.

1285
03:09:05,138 --> 03:09:10,122
There was a request for additional data, which was provided in the three year historical data.

1286
03:09:11,603 --> 03:09:14,344
And there was a question about police involvement.

1287
03:09:15,424 --> 03:09:20,126
The principals do collaborate with the school resource officer, SROs.

1288
03:09:21,046 --> 03:09:27,088
The SROs help to determine if additional police support is needed in any given situation.

1289
03:09:27,988 --> 03:09:37,031
There were eight incidents during the timeframe that was documented where the police were notified to provide additional support.

1290
03:09:38,251 --> 03:09:43,915
Please note that police involvement also takes place after school hours, and on the weekends.

1291
03:09:44,776 --> 03:09:50,280
In those circumstances, we do not notify the police, the police notify the district.

1292
03:09:51,798 --> 03:09:54,819
Since our students are juveniles, their rights are protected.

1293
03:09:55,919 --> 03:10:05,742
Due to ongoing investigations that may involve court matters, the school district has no further comment regarding police involvement.

1294
03:10:06,822 --> 03:10:18,325
And again, I provided some data about Saturday detentions and parent conferences, parent phone calls, detentions and conferences that are set up.

1295
03:10:19,205 --> 03:10:35,813
All discipline referrals are taken seriously and investigated, while some may require a simple conversation with a student or teacher, other referrals may lead to deeper inquiry.

1296
03:10:37,274 --> 03:10:42,577
And revisions were made to the charts to make sure that the colors were aligned.

1297
03:10:43,437 --> 03:10:45,338
So that is my report for this evening.

1298
03:10:50,629 --> 03:10:52,209
Any questions member Bramley?

1299
03:10:55,270 --> 03:11:03,012
Well, I have to say nothing makes me happier than to see this because I feel like there's actually accountability happening and nothing makes me happier than that.

1300
03:11:03,212 --> 03:11:06,192
So I appreciate the report.

1301
03:11:06,992 --> 03:11:12,274
I'm happy that we're still using out of school suspension and I'm happy that it's a last result.

1302
03:11:13,334 --> 03:11:15,614
I think that it's important that it's not off the table.

1303
03:11:18,155 --> 03:11:19,035
I think overall,

1304
03:11:21,337 --> 03:11:24,940
I think it's a staggering number of referrals.

1305
03:11:25,680 --> 03:11:26,801
And that makes me feel sad.

1306
03:11:26,821 --> 03:11:35,168
2599 just at the high school alone, that is a significant amount of work for staff, especially teachers.

1307
03:11:37,810 --> 03:11:43,055
And so I just want to applaud them for, for their due diligence all the time.

1308
03:11:43,355 --> 03:11:44,416
It's I'm always

1309
03:11:45,479 --> 03:11:46,800
amazed by it.

1310
03:11:47,281 --> 03:11:57,888
And then just the follow up between the houses and everybody working collaboratively to make sure that this work is getting done, I think is something that has been needed.

1311
03:11:59,049 --> 03:12:03,232
And I'm happy that it's coming to fruition here.

1312
03:12:03,252 --> 03:12:03,813
So thank you.

1313
03:12:05,254 --> 03:12:06,154
Thank you, Member Brindley.

1314
03:12:07,796 --> 03:12:13,400
We're going to move on to number five, rate card by Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent.

1315
03:12:15,708 --> 03:12:16,110
Break card.

1316
03:12:17,716 --> 03:12:18,399
You're up, sorry.

1317
03:12:34,644 --> 03:12:35,665
I apologize.

1318
03:12:36,265 --> 03:12:38,285
So tonight we're presenting right card.

1319
03:12:38,705 --> 03:12:40,226
It has a lot of numbers in there.

1320
03:12:40,706 --> 03:12:58,131
We're asking for two specific areas of approval, and that's on the facilities rates, which have not increased since 2016 I did a comprehensive analysis, looking at a number of surrounding districts, and we're pretty much in the area that we need to be.

1321
03:12:59,691 --> 03:13:00,232
I also.

1322
03:13:03,863 --> 03:13:13,707
have not included the personnel costs, as we're still working through some of those things, and we'll need to come back to this body to look at those as we move forward.

1323
03:13:14,567 --> 03:13:18,069
And we're also looking at increasing our pool usage fees.

1324
03:13:19,169 --> 03:13:25,395
Some of which went up last year in a modest amount for swim lessons.

1325
03:13:26,235 --> 03:13:37,925
And we've done research on that with surrounding pools, most notably the pool parties for kids birthdays, which just don't cover our costs.

1326
03:13:39,186 --> 03:13:43,188
And that's why there's such a substantial increase on the birthday parties.

1327
03:13:44,148 --> 03:13:54,472
But when you compare it to a goldfish, I believe that their numbers are in the $600 to $700 range for the same timeframe.

1328
03:13:55,293 --> 03:14:00,335
And it really doesn't include much of anything more than we're providing.

1329
03:14:01,840 --> 03:14:09,765
I'm happy to answer any questions, but it's a 10% bump over our fees for our facilities rate card.

1330
03:14:11,046 --> 03:14:19,772
And I don't offhand remember the percentage for the pool, but it's to move us to a more solvent and operating in the black when it comes to the pool.

1331
03:14:26,176 --> 03:14:26,716
Member Rossell.

1332
03:14:27,197 --> 03:14:28,017
Thank you very much.

1333
03:14:28,057 --> 03:14:28,778
I appreciate this.

1334
03:14:30,094 --> 03:14:31,675
the rate card format very much.

1335
03:14:33,256 --> 03:14:34,657
Where did the 10% come from?

1336
03:14:34,697 --> 03:14:45,583
I just threw those numbers into a couple of different intra-inflation calculators or compounding at 2.5% like we can do for increases in our property taxes here.

1337
03:14:45,603 --> 03:14:49,225
And I come up to a number of much bigger than 440.

1338
03:14:49,825 --> 03:14:54,128
As an example, the elementary school gyms in FY16 for

1339
03:14:57,162 --> 03:15:08,194
The four category I actually don't have a category differences, the 400 would actually be $520 and you know we're not swimming in cash so.

1340
03:15:10,056 --> 03:15:10,716
Did you just pick the 10%.

1341
03:15:11,638 --> 03:15:17,921
So what I looked at was over the eight years and realizing that we hadn't had one.

1342
03:15:18,001 --> 03:15:23,124
So the 10% was selected in comparison looking at neighboring districts.

1343
03:15:23,745 --> 03:15:30,348
I also included in your packet a facilities rental agreement that has the category spelled out.

1344
03:15:31,509 --> 03:15:34,210
But trust me, I think that's like 13 pages long.

1345
03:15:34,490 --> 03:15:35,851
So I can totally understand.

1346
03:15:37,672 --> 03:15:41,915
The 10% was to look at we haven't increased in a number of years.

1347
03:15:42,756 --> 03:15:50,001
And what number presenting this in April, late April, is going to not scare away our renters.

1348
03:15:50,962 --> 03:16:01,490
We've been sensitizing our renters to increases in fees, and really trying to make sure that they understand the personnel costs

1349
03:16:02,170 --> 03:16:17,249
that are separate from the facility use fees so that $200 or whatever it is for using a gym for a period of hours still carries with it a $65 per hour charge for custodial.

1350
03:16:18,015 --> 03:16:23,177
and in certain instances, not all instances, a $50 fee.

1351
03:16:23,617 --> 03:16:33,241
So just before you even get to the facility fee, in many instances, it'll be $115 an hour just to open the doors with a four-hour minimum.

1352
03:16:34,162 --> 03:16:35,162
Wonderful, thank you.

1353
03:16:35,202 --> 03:16:37,363
That was my next question, but you answered it.

1354
03:16:37,603 --> 03:16:40,865
Yep.

1355
03:16:40,905 --> 03:16:42,285
Is there a motion for approval?

1356
03:16:42,305 --> 03:16:46,507
Or member, I'm sorry, this is just to approve the pool

1357
03:16:47,447 --> 03:16:48,508
This is pool and facilities.

1358
03:16:48,708 --> 03:16:52,149
Other members of our team, we're still doing work around these.

1359
03:16:52,349 --> 03:16:56,291
I have some questions about the athletics and theater, but that's still under discussion.

1360
03:16:56,351 --> 03:16:57,552
So we'll see that at another point.

1361
03:16:57,772 --> 03:17:00,053
It is still in discussion and we'll be seeing another point.

1362
03:17:00,613 --> 03:17:00,793
Yes.

1363
03:17:00,813 --> 03:17:01,293
All right.

1364
03:17:01,413 --> 03:17:02,514
And I'll motion to approve.

1365
03:17:03,274 --> 03:17:04,174
Motion for approval.

1366
03:17:04,254 --> 03:17:06,876
Pool and facilities rates.

1367
03:17:07,356 --> 03:17:13,418
And we'll look to present this in the future in the February, March timeframe on an annual basis.

1368
03:17:14,119 --> 03:17:14,319
Great.

1369
03:17:14,639 --> 03:17:14,999
Thank you.

1370
03:17:15,659 --> 03:17:16,180

Yes.

1441
03:19:39,753 --> 03:19:40,653
Member Rheinfeldt?

1442
03:19:40,894 --> 03:19:41,134
Yes.

1443
03:19:41,474 --> 03:19:41,914
Member Rossell?

1444
03:19:41,934 --> 03:19:42,134
Yes.

1445
03:19:42,195 --> 03:19:42,835
Mayor Langenberger?

1446
03:19:43,035 --> 03:19:43,315

1452
03:20:11,071 --> 03:20:13,151

1453
03:20:14,812 --> 03:20:17,252
Motion to approve by Member Graham, seconded by?

1454

1455
03:20:18,092 --> 03:20:19,873

03:20:25,434 --> 03:20:25,614
Yes.

1457
03:20:25,654 --> 03:20:25,795
Yep.

1458
03:20:25,855 --> 03:20:32,516
I'm sorry.

1459
03:20:35,148 --> 03:20:35,588
Thank you.

1460
03:20:36,889 --> 03:20:37,490
Member Brantley?

1461
03:20:37,630 --> 03:20:37,850
Yes.

1462
03:20:38,390 --> 03:20:38,931
Member Graham?

1463
03:20:39,491 --> 03:20:39,571
Yes.

1464
03:20:40,192 --> 03:20:40,852
Member Ntapa?

1465
03:20:41,733 --> 03:20:41,993
Yes.

1466
03:20:42,913 --> 03:20:43,634
Member Olopade?

1467
03:20:43,814 --> 03:20:44,074
Yes.

1468
03:20:44,334 --> 03:20:44,935
Member Reinfeldt?

1469
03:20:45,075 --> 03:20:45,315
Yes.

1470
03:20:45,595 --> 03:20:46,056
Member Rossell?

1471
03:20:46,076 --> 03:20:46,316
Yes.

1472
03:20:46,416 --> 03:20:47,056
Mayor Longo?

1473
03:20:47,597 --> 03:20:47,877
Yes.

1474
03:20:48,257 --> 03:20:49,718
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1475
03:20:49,738 --> 03:20:50,479
Motion passes.

1476
03:20:50,499 --> 03:21:03,768
2024-22, offered by Member Graham, be resolved that the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee will meet to discuss whether the Curtis test should be co-located with the Medford High School campus to approve educational outcomes

1477
03:21:04,258 --> 03:21:05,559
for Curtis Tufts students.

1478
03:21:06,139 --> 03:21:11,041
We had further resolved that the subcommittee will invite current and former students and staff to provide comment.

1479
03:21:11,621 --> 03:21:27,369
It also resolved that the committee will report back to the school committee on whether the Curtis Tufts program should be co-located no later than June 3rd, 2024, because this information is critical to the progress of the Metro Comprehensive High School Building Committee as it completes the district's educational profile.

1480
03:21:28,692 --> 03:21:30,253
Member Graham and then Member Bramley.

1481
03:21:30,553 --> 03:21:30,934
Thank you.

1482
03:21:31,734 --> 03:21:46,645
I put this on and would love for the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee to explore this in a little bit more detail to provide some input to the MSBA committee that gets going tomorrow evening.

1483
03:21:47,546 --> 03:21:50,668
And obviously the conversation around

1484
03:21:51,363 --> 03:21:54,805
What the students at Curtis Tufts need is an important one.

1485
03:21:54,885 --> 03:22:01,649
There's lots of things that they just simply can't participate in in the current structure because they are clear across town.

1486
03:22:02,669 --> 03:22:05,731
And there's lots of options from a building perspective to

1487
03:22:07,065 --> 03:22:11,508
bring them onto campus in a way that still works for the students in that program.

1488
03:22:11,568 --> 03:22:30,460
So, um, you know, for example, um, we, we have lots, we have an endless number of options because nothing has been decided yet, but what we do need to do in short order is help MSBA understand our scope intentions so that when we get to the point of talking about like, is it a separate building?

1489
03:22:30,540 --> 03:22:31,520
Is it a separate entrance?

1490
03:22:31,661 --> 03:22:32,041
Is it a,

1491
03:22:33,374 --> 03:22:36,756
stacked building, you know, there's a million choices and options.

1492
03:22:36,816 --> 03:22:44,420
But the first thing that we have to do is describe the educational programming that we intend to happen on the campus.

1493
03:22:45,541 --> 03:22:54,085
And so when we think about the Curtis Tufts, that building obviously is its own historic dinosaur, we'll call it lovingly.

1494
03:22:55,446 --> 03:22:58,568
But it is its own sort of facilities challenge.

1495
03:22:59,048 --> 03:23:00,089
But more importantly,

1496
03:23:01,388 --> 03:23:22,864
I want to hear from the teachers and the students in that program or who have graduated, you know, about their thoughts and reactions about whether this is something that we should pursue, knowing that we're five to seven years away from any of this really being able to materialize because the current building we know is not suitable for the work that happens at Curtis Tufts.

1497
03:23:22,884 --> 03:23:28,508
So we're talking about the future here and we need to talk about that.

1498
03:23:29,994 --> 03:23:38,164
You know, in an important way, because if we don't provide for it now it's it's off the table and can't be designed for and plan for so.

1499
03:23:39,236 --> 03:23:43,779
I'm hoping that the special education subcommittee can move quickly to sort of convene folks.

1500
03:23:44,079 --> 03:23:47,261
Lori Hodgkin is obviously a non-voting member of the school building committee.

1501
03:23:48,561 --> 03:23:57,226
We have been working with the superintendent and Joan Bowen, and they are aware that this is coming and that this is the dialogue we're looking to have.

1502
03:23:58,307 --> 03:24:03,030
But that is sort of a matter for the school committee to be thinking about as well as the building committee.

1503
03:24:03,690 --> 03:24:20,758
we really just need to sort of move that ball forward so that before summer there's some clarity there because that will hold up the rest of our application and it's my goal for us to be able to move quickly enough that those pieces of the application are completed by June 30.

1504
03:24:21,658 --> 03:24:21,978
Thank you.

1505
03:24:22,298 --> 03:24:26,981
Thank you Member Graham, Member Branley, then Member Ntapa and then Member Rousseau.

1506
03:24:27,421 --> 03:24:32,203
So as someone who works in special ed in Somerville, I had spoken to our

1507
03:24:33,151 --> 03:24:36,973
department head over at our alternative school in Somerville.

1508
03:24:37,414 --> 03:24:38,614
He was nice enough to join us tonight.

1509
03:24:38,654 --> 03:24:42,197
So I don't know if it would be, I know it would be beneficial to hear from him.

1510
03:24:43,557 --> 03:24:51,522
So I don't know also if it would be good for him to come to some of those other meetings, Medford resident, and I don't know how much he wants to disclose of him.

1511
03:24:51,883 --> 03:24:59,267
So I'll let him disclose what he'd like to about himself, but I respect his opinion and his work ethic.

1512
03:25:00,268 --> 03:25:01,488
So I just wanted to throw that out there.

1513
03:25:03,297 --> 03:25:08,318
And then subcommittee could be open to public, so definitely welcome.

1514
03:25:09,378 --> 03:25:11,519
Member Joppa, and then if you'd like to speak.

1515
03:25:14,880 --> 03:25:15,880
Sure, sorry.

1516
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:19,241
Just a quick question of clarification in the motion.

1517
03:25:19,261 --> 03:25:23,401
Thank you, Member Graham, for putting this forward, for seeing this.

1518
03:25:23,962 --> 03:25:30,323
So should we motion to amend to invite current and former, also parents, guardians, caregivers as well?

1519
03:25:31,325 --> 03:25:33,906
Would that be something we need to do or should?

1520
03:25:34,026 --> 03:25:43,408
I mean, I feel like we should as well for students and staff, but I'm not sure if it's implied in the motion already, if that is the case, but figured I would put that out there.

1521
03:25:44,848 --> 03:25:45,669
Thank you, member and topper.

1522
03:25:45,689 --> 03:25:55,671
It's a little difficult to hear you, but I think you mentioned inviting parents and yes, this will be an open public meeting where anybody can come and give feedback.

1523
03:25:56,371 --> 03:25:58,512
So it will be open to parents, of course.

1524
03:25:59,426 --> 03:25:59,906
Oh, awesome.

1525
03:25:59,966 --> 03:26:00,467
Thank you.

1526
03:26:00,527 --> 03:26:08,552
I knew it was a it was an open meeting, but I wanted to make sure that the formal invitation was sent to them as well, along with their students, but sorry if it's hard to hear me.

1527
03:26:10,954 --> 03:26:12,295
Thank you, Member Rousseau.

1528
03:26:12,455 --> 03:26:14,036
Yeah, thank you.

1529
03:26:14,216 --> 03:26:18,399
I do think it's important to figure out how we invite people is is a challenge.

1530
03:26:18,419 --> 03:26:19,940
And then scheduling becomes a challenge.

1531
03:26:19,960 --> 03:26:21,321
So more people we add to the list.

1532
03:26:22,161 --> 03:26:25,804
Like in the past, we've said we really wanted to hear from principals on something.

1533
03:26:26,308 --> 03:26:28,329
then we needed to make sure principals could be there.

1534
03:26:29,610 --> 03:26:43,359
It is open so everybody can come, but I think figuring out how to tailor the people that I'm gonna try to reach out to so that it's not going to be November before we can hold the meeting, it's a battle.

1535
03:26:44,299 --> 03:26:49,322
And some groups of people will be people that I will have, none of us will have any way to actually contact them.

1536
03:26:49,702 --> 03:26:52,884
I'm really hopeful somebody will be able to tell us how we can get ahold of former students.

1537
03:26:56,570 --> 03:26:57,690
Maybe Joan's shaking her head.

1538
03:26:57,710 --> 03:26:59,591
I don't know if that means she has some way to do that.

1539
03:26:59,671 --> 03:27:01,031
She does good, it makes me feel better.

1540
03:27:02,411 --> 03:27:18,476
But yeah, so I hope to hear from lots of different people who have a relationship to the Curtis Tufts past and present, because we do have a very important question to answer here and the timeline is not on our side, unfortunately.

1541
03:27:18,636 --> 03:27:23,697
So, I mean, I'm not a fan of rushing anything, but yeah.

1542
03:27:24,631 --> 03:27:26,593
would have a choice here, so thank you.

1543
03:27:27,154 --> 03:27:29,556
I'd make a motion to approve, although I don't know.

1544
03:27:29,676 --> 03:27:32,499
I believe we have a resident that'd like to say a few words.

1545
03:27:34,541 --> 03:27:35,141
Is the mic on?

1546
03:27:35,201 --> 03:27:35,322
Yeah.

1547
03:27:36,943 --> 03:27:37,884
So, I'm Jack Haverty.

1548
03:27:38,184 --> 03:27:39,545
I live in Waterville Road.

1549
03:27:40,026 --> 03:27:42,247
I've been an educator for 18 years.

1550
03:27:42,327 --> 03:27:48,571
Last eight years, I've been the assistant principal at Next Wave Full Circle, which is Somerville's alternative therapeutic school.

1551
03:27:50,092 --> 03:28:04,161
And I feel uniquely qualified to talk about this because we just went through the process of going from the Edgeley, which was our oldest building in the district, to going into Somerville High School and being incorporated into the same community as Somerville High School.

1552
03:28:05,663 --> 03:28:09,189
just happens to be kind of the same situation that is going on in Medford.

1553
03:28:10,230 --> 03:28:16,581
And I would say that there are pros and cons to being in the same space but the pros vastly outweigh the cons.

1554
03:28:18,519 --> 03:28:25,506
Since we have transitioned from the Edgeley to Somerville High School, we've gone from 60 students to over 90 with a wait list.

1555
03:28:26,146 --> 03:28:39,219
None of those 90 students or all of those 90 students have asked to be at our program and none of them have been told to go to that program because we're able to onboard them with visits, which are much easier when you're in the same building.

1556
03:28:39,580 --> 03:28:41,581
They're much easier when you know the staff, the kids.

1557
03:28:42,663 --> 03:28:52,053
It's pretty much impossible to have in really really old building and a really really beautiful building and tell somebody that yeah your kids going to this building and it's the same, but it's not.

1558
03:28:53,815 --> 03:28:54,756
In my opinion, if you.

1559
03:28:56,018 --> 03:29:07,627
decide to redo Medford High School, which you have, and you decide not to incorporate Curtis Tufts, you are making a conscious choice not to invest in alternative therapeutic learning.

1560
03:29:09,109 --> 03:29:22,480
And I would say, listening to 2,500 conduct referrals, a vast majority of those, I presume, are from cutting class, and a vast majority of those, I bet, are from a small percentage of students who are continually cutting class.

1561
03:29:23,820 --> 03:29:40,225
In my experience, I've realized that between five and 10% of students that are in the same percentage of high needs that Medford has need a substantially different avenue to do school.

1562
03:29:41,366 --> 03:29:47,948
And so that's where you see 2,500 referrals from probably 50 kids that continually cut.

1563
03:29:49,228 --> 03:29:50,789
So I'd be happy to

1564
03:29:52,130 --> 03:30:00,952
go through the details, but it's late and I know you guys listened to an hour of HVAC, so happy to answer any questions too.

1565
03:30:01,012 --> 03:30:14,596
We appreciate it and maybe a list of pros even, whether that's emailed to the committee, if you can't make it another night or having that ready to speak on the record for next time, a good list of pros and cons would be helpful for us.

1566
03:30:14,756 --> 03:30:16,416
Member Graham.

1567
03:30:16,936 --> 03:30:19,997
I would definitely love for you, I'm not on this subcommittee,

1568
03:30:21,067 --> 03:30:26,829
And I will be listening in, but I'm delighted to not have my calendar bottleneck you further, because it's a mess.

1569
03:30:26,889 --> 03:30:35,812
But if you can plan to attend that subcommittee meeting, where the point of that subcommittee really is to dive into exactly what you said.

1570
03:30:36,532 --> 03:30:49,456
We brought this forward for exactly the reason that you described, which is you can't build a beautiful new building and then ask some small number of students to go to a 100-year-old building

1571
03:30:50,708 --> 03:30:51,028
floor.

1572
03:30:52,250 --> 03:30:53,391
And that's real.

1573
03:30:53,612 --> 03:31:09,212
So, at the same time though, the needs that we need to sort of care for for those students to thrive are uniquely different and we need to inform our application documents to make sure that we're

1574
03:31:09,927 --> 03:31:14,629
accurately describing what those needs are so that we can have the best of both worlds.

1575
03:31:14,669 --> 03:31:22,013
So certainly, I'm open if the committee comes back and says, no, no, no, this is absolutely a horrible, horrible idea, that's fine.

1576
03:31:22,073 --> 03:31:37,661
But I think more than likely, the subcommittee is going to come back and say, this is an idea we should pursue, but it has to have these qualifiers to what we submit so that we can really meet all of those pros and cons where they're at and the students.

1577
03:31:38,573 --> 03:31:42,483
I would love for you to be part of members of the subcommittee.

1578
03:31:47,719 --> 03:31:48,820
Great, thank you for being here.

1579
03:31:48,840 --> 03:31:49,980
Thank you for waiting this long.

1580
03:31:50,501 --> 03:31:54,663
Yeah, I probably should have done baseball practice and then come, but... Sorry, Jack.

1581
03:31:55,103 --> 03:31:55,604
Sorry.

1582
03:31:55,624 --> 03:32:06,150
The other thing I would say, better than answering any questions or my input would actually be if any of you want to come visit Next Wave Full Circle and see our wing.

1583
03:32:06,210 --> 03:32:09,212
So we have our own entrance at the Gilman Street train.

1584
03:32:10,052 --> 03:32:10,773
That'd be great.

1585
03:32:11,213 --> 03:32:15,235
It'd be more enlightening than asking any questions and answering them, I think.

1586
03:32:15,255 --> 03:32:16,396
That'd be great, yeah.

1587
03:32:17,418 --> 03:32:18,058
Thank you so much.

1588
03:32:18,118 --> 03:32:18,538
Thank you.

1589
03:32:19,119 --> 03:32:27,882
And do you find the students are partaking in theater and sports as well, where we don't really see that because it's so separated?

1590
03:32:28,122 --> 03:32:37,605
Yeah, for the first time, we have tons of our freshmen going through exploratory, which I don't know if you call it exploratory in Medford, but the rotation.

1591
03:32:37,685 --> 03:32:39,946
Some of our kids are captains of the sports teams now.

1592
03:32:41,166 --> 03:32:42,827
It makes a massive impact.

1593
03:32:42,987 --> 03:32:44,807
That's great.

1594
03:32:45,207 --> 03:32:45,748
Thank you.

1595
03:32:45,988 --> 03:32:46,688
Thank you for being here.

1596
03:32:50,140 --> 03:32:51,760
So I have motion to approve that.

1597
03:32:52,141 --> 03:32:54,861
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by second.

1598
03:32:54,981 --> 03:32:55,361
Second.

1599
03:32:57,902 --> 03:32:58,162
Sorry.

1600
03:32:58,182 --> 03:32:59,062
We all want to second this.

1601
03:32:59,102 --> 03:32:59,442
Let's go.

1602
03:33:00,523 --> 03:33:02,183
Member Reinfeldt said it first.

1603
03:33:02,903 --> 03:33:03,423
Roll call, please.

1604
03:33:03,623 --> 03:33:04,264
Member Brandley.

1605
03:33:04,424 --> 03:33:04,724
Yes.

1606
03:33:05,024 --> 03:33:05,584
Member Graham.

1607
03:33:05,884 --> 03:33:06,124
Yes.

1608
03:33:06,344 --> 03:33:07,104
Member Ntapa.

1609
03:33:07,805 --> 03:33:08,085
Yes.

1610
03:33:09,945 --> 03:33:10,225
Yes.

1611
03:33:11,205 --> 03:33:11,846
Member Reinfeldt.

1612
03:33:11,866 --> 03:33:12,106
Yes.

1613
03:33:12,346 --> 03:33:13,106
Member Rousseau, yes.

1614
03:33:13,126 --> 03:33:13,846
Mayor Longo, current.

1615
03:33:13,966 --> 03:33:14,246
Yes.

1616
03:33:14,326 --> 03:33:15,747
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1617
03:33:16,107 --> 03:33:16,807
Motion's approved.

1618
03:33:17,879 --> 03:33:21,742
I would just like you to know that Jack is that calm all the time.

1619
03:33:22,463 --> 03:33:24,184
He calls with chaos and I'm freaking out.

1620
03:33:24,384 --> 03:33:26,966
He's like, so I'm like, okay, check.

1621
03:33:27,306 --> 03:33:28,647
So yeah, he seems he's amazing.

1622
03:33:28,767 --> 03:33:29,688
Perfect for the role.

1623
03:33:29,748 --> 03:33:30,589
Yeah, that's great.

1624
03:33:30,949 --> 03:33:34,892
Thank you for introducing him to us.

1625
03:33:35,112 --> 03:33:41,337
2024 dash 23 offered by member Reinfeldt be resolved that the subcommittee on curriculum instruction assessment

1626
03:33:41,718 --> 03:34:07,998
and accountability meet with the assistant superintendent of academics and instruction and other relevant staff to discuss the development of a process to review and assess recently adopted curricula and assessment tools across the district and to identify the key stakeholders, timelines, and protocols to be involved in this review, consistent with the policies described in section one of the Medford School Committee online policy manual.

1627
03:34:08,598 --> 03:34:09,158
Motion for approval.

1628
03:34:09,899 --> 03:34:11,140
Would you like to speak, Member Reinfeldt?

1629
03:34:11,974 --> 03:34:14,175
I'm happy to answer questions, but it's late.

1630
03:34:14,295 --> 03:34:17,876
Basically, we've had a lot of new curricula come on in the district.

1631
03:34:18,876 --> 03:34:30,919
We have a pretty robust process for introducing the curricula and also our top goal or the number one on our strategic plan is to develop this cycle, so I'd like to get that process moving.

1632
03:34:31,299 --> 03:34:31,640
Wonderful.

1633
03:34:31,820 --> 03:34:32,120

1643
03:34:45,198 --> 03:34:45,478
Yes.

Member Olopade?

1645
03:34:47,239 --> 03:34:47,539
Yes.

1646
03:34:47,939 --> 03:34:48,620
Member Rheinfeld?

1647
03:34:48,740 --> 03:34:48,980

Mayor Langenfeld?

1651
03:34:50,881 --> 03:34:51,101
Yes.

1652
03:34:51,141 --> 03:34:52,642
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1653
03:34:52,742 --> 03:34:53,482
Motion passes.

1654
03:35:00,325 --> 03:35:03,267
Is there a motion to take the paper off the table?

1655
03:35:03,587 --> 03:35:05,008
Motion to take the paper from the table.

Second.

1658
03:35:08,009 --> 03:35:09,590
Member Graham, roll call, please.

1659
03:35:11,547 --> 03:35:14,009
That's paper to 2024 dash 24.

1660
03:35:14,410 --> 03:35:18,113
Remember Brantley.

1661
03:35:18,253 --> 03:35:18,493
Yes.

1662
03:35:18,794 --> 03:35:19,354
Remember Graham.

1663
03:35:19,995 --> 03:35:20,635
Remember and Tapa.

1664
03:35:21,356 --> 03:35:21,636
Yes.

1665
03:35:21,656 --> 03:35:23,278
Remember all the potting.

1666
03:35:23,358 --> 03:35:23,638
Yes.

1667
03:35:23,658 --> 03:35:24,919
Remember, I felt, yes.

1668
03:35:25,319 --> 03:35:26,721
Remember, so yes Marilyn go.

1669
03:35:28,102 --> 03:35:30,924
Yes, 70 affirmatives are in the negative motion passes.

1670
03:35:33,547 --> 03:35:34,548
Motion to approve 2024 dash 24.

1671
03:35:37,334 --> 03:36:02,575
May I, before we move approval, motion for approval by Member Graham, before we move approval, is there, I know John McLaughlin isn't here tonight, but somebody from the administration, just say if this is feasible, how many things would be coming before us, or even maybe if any of the three that have the resolution before us, is this gonna be, I'm just trying to conceptualize how many,

1672
03:36:03,885 --> 03:36:04,946
I'm not sure how that's going to be managed.

1673
03:36:04,966 --> 03:36:09,688
I'm sure that purchases or updates or upgrades would be coming before us each meeting and how that's going to be manageable.

1674
03:36:10,529 --> 03:36:11,069
Member Russo.

1675
03:36:11,489 --> 03:36:23,036
Certainly I did try to think about that in the wording because, uh, we don't want to have like 15 emergency meetings a year just to approve the purchase of something I did not include, um.

1676
03:36:31,755 --> 03:36:38,145
You know, if we replace any of our equipment that way so I mean, this is really aimed at big equipment.

1677
03:36:38,506 --> 03:36:40,229
This, I mean, I don't know.

1678
03:36:41,210 --> 03:36:42,873
Miss Smith is not here anymore.

1679
03:36:43,514 --> 03:36:43,915
Lucky her.

1680
03:36:46,872 --> 03:36:50,334
this equipment that is not actually functional at this point.

1681
03:36:50,514 --> 03:36:53,256
I mean, I don't think she ordered it and it was there a week later.

1682
03:36:54,577 --> 03:37:00,661
And a lot of this HVAC equipment, I mean, we heard, what was that, 32 weeks or something crazy for the lead time.

1683
03:37:00,781 --> 03:37:06,044
So I don't envision this as something that is going to actually gum up the works at all.

1684
03:37:06,124 --> 03:37:08,386
It's more of a FYI.

1685
03:37:08,406 --> 03:37:12,509
Again, it's only FYI if it needs to be a fossil fuel-based equipment.

1686
03:37:12,809 --> 03:37:16,311
If it's not, then spend all the money,

1687
03:37:17,754 --> 03:37:18,054
I can.

1688
03:37:21,137 --> 03:37:45,054
Chair then could it be somewhere where things are located under the consent agenda, for example, and any explanations, like say there's 10 things that week, the explanation could come to us by email so that we would only be, we could approve it all, but obviously ask the questions or disapprove certain pieces that we think

1689
03:37:46,854 --> 03:37:47,655
we're not comfortable with?

1690
03:37:47,955 --> 03:37:56,399
Sure, and if I may, I certainly, first of all, I mean, the kind of equipment that we're talking about is not normally purchased stuff.

1691
03:37:56,419 --> 03:38:01,821
I mean, we're not, fossil fuel stuff is stuff that has to be installed, and like, it's a big effort.

1692
03:38:02,761 --> 03:38:09,644
But there was another, earlier in our consent agenda, we had a couple items that actually shouldn't have been in the consent agenda because of the policy.

1693
03:38:10,065 --> 03:38:12,846
So I went, for the next meeting, I was gonna actually make a

1694
03:38:13,274 --> 03:38:20,504
policy change to our consent agenda to include things like field trips and donations so that we can include those.

1695
03:38:21,045 --> 03:38:24,349
I'm happy to include this as well because why not?

1696
03:38:25,371 --> 03:38:27,093
So sure.

1697
03:38:28,384 --> 03:38:45,797
If I can't, yeah, the one thing I'll say is I think as we start the Capital Improvement Planning Committee, and once we start that work, I think a lot of these items will move through that process as they should, and any issues will be addressed.

1698
03:38:46,217 --> 03:38:46,538
That's all.

1699
03:38:46,998 --> 03:38:47,318
Perfect.

1700
03:38:47,879 --> 03:38:48,539
Yeah, that sounds great.

1701
03:38:48,879 --> 03:38:49,500
Motion to approve.

1702
03:38:49,660 --> 03:38:51,881
Motion to approve by Member Graham, seconded by?

1703
03:38:53,182 --> 03:38:53,543
Second.

1704
03:38:53,763 --> 03:38:54,503
Member Olopade.

1705
03:38:54,543 --> 03:38:55,164
Roll call, please.

1706
03:38:59,660 --> 03:39:00,941
Roll a potty's excitement.

1707
03:39:01,241 --> 03:39:01,621
Second.

1708
03:39:01,902 --> 03:39:02,302
I love it.

1709
03:39:02,842 --> 03:39:06,905
It's very not everybody on the audience can see it, but it's enjoyable.

1710
03:39:07,325 --> 03:39:08,766
Anyways, remember, we're hungry.

1711
03:39:08,806 --> 03:39:09,507
Remember Bramley?

1712
03:39:09,527 --> 03:39:10,447
I'm very hungry, too.

1713
03:39:11,108 --> 03:39:11,448
Yes.

1714
03:39:11,868 --> 03:39:12,629
Member Graham?

1715
03:39:12,769 --> 03:39:13,049
Yes.

1716
03:39:13,229 --> 03:39:13,970
Member Ntapa?

1717
03:39:14,590 --> 03:39:14,950
Yes.

1718
03:39:15,811 --> 03:39:16,411
Roll a potty?

1719
03:39:16,932 --> 03:39:17,252
Yes.

1720
03:39:17,472 --> 03:39:18,233
Member Rheinfeld?

1721
03:39:18,373 --> 03:39:18,653
Yes.

1722
03:39:18,773 --> 03:39:19,293
Member Rossell?

1723
03:39:19,333 --> 03:39:19,554
Yes.

1724
03:39:19,614 --> 03:39:20,114
Mayor Lungo?

1725
03:39:20,374 --> 03:39:20,774
Yes.

1726
03:39:20,794 --> 03:39:22,916
70 affirmative, zero negative.

1727
03:39:22,956 --> 03:39:23,576
Motion passes.

1728
03:39:24,137 --> 03:39:27,519
Okay, next up we have no reports requested and

1729
03:39:27,961 --> 03:39:29,763
Thankfully no condolences next meeting.

1730
03:39:29,783 --> 03:39:44,596
