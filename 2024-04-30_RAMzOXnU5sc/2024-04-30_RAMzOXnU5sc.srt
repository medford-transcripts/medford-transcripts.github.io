01:07:32,071 --> 01:07:38,977
[SPEAKER_01]: This Wednesday, May 1 is the statewide walk, bike, and roll to school day.

161
01:07:39,658 --> 01:07:51,469
[SPEAKER_01]: This great occasion coordinated by the Massachusetts Safe Routes to School program is a perfect opportunity for students and families to travel to school as a pedestrian.

162
01:07:52,149 --> 01:08:01,375
[SPEAKER_01]: As we all know, it's good for the environment and our individual health when we can take the chance to walk, bike, or roll to a frequent destination.

163
01:08:02,115 --> 01:08:06,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Check in with your school principal to learn more about plans for Wednesday.

164
01:08:08,283 --> 01:08:12,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Since our last meeting, we have conducted our middle school placement lottery.

165
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:16,447
[SPEAKER_01]: The results are available and posted on our website.

166
01:08:17,587 --> 01:08:33,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Grade five students and their families are invited to attend an orientation program at their assigned middle school to tour the building, learn about programs and activities, meet their principal and assistant principal, teachers, and other staff.

167
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:46,627
[SPEAKER_01]: The McGlynn Middle School Orientation is scheduled for this Thursday, May 2nd at 6pm, and the Andrews Middle School Orientation is on Monday, May 6th at 6pm.

168
01:08:48,148 --> 01:08:59,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this coming Friday, May 3rd, it's School Lunch Hero Day, an opportunity to recognize our wonderful staff who work in our school lunch programs.

169
01:09:00,905 --> 01:09:04,388
[SPEAKER_01]: So for tonight's meeting, we do have another busy agenda.

170
01:09:05,088 --> 01:09:15,116
[SPEAKER_01]: We're particularly excited to hear about all the wonderful things that are happening and performing and fine arts, and we have Miss Haley relo and miss Suzanne fee, who will provide us with an update.

171
01:09:16,559 --> 01:09:27,048
[SPEAKER_01]: and also recognize our wonderful students for the wonderful gold medal that they received earlier this spring by our high school orchestra.

172
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:35,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank again the Schmidt family for their generous donation to support our string ensemble.

173
01:09:37,217 --> 01:09:48,463
[SPEAKER_01]: We will also hear about the trip to Puerto Rico which was approved but we know next spring our students who have the opportunity to travel will definitely have a wonderful learning experience.

174
01:09:49,444 --> 01:09:54,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to thank the presentation that will be coming this evening about our HVAC system.

175
01:09:55,667 --> 01:10:06,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank all of the engineers and environmental experts that are here and thank Alicia hunt and her team for supporting us this evening.

176
01:10:07,429 --> 01:10:12,970
[SPEAKER_01]: We also will share with you a proposed rate card for the next school year.

177
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:20,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will present a report on the district's report on suspension and discipline data.

178
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:35,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, we'd like to remind the community that our next school committee meeting is on Monday, May 6, which will also include our public hearing on the fiscal year 25 budget.

179
01:10:36,237 --> 01:10:51,381
[SPEAKER_01]: This important occasion is the main opportunity for us to receive feedback on the proposed budget, that meeting will begin at 5pm in person here or at at City Hall, and also available on zoom.

180
01:10:54,377 --> 01:10:55,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

181
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:01,022
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Arts Programs Update and Recognition of Orchestra Gold Medal, Ms.

182
01:11:01,062 --> 01:11:03,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Suzanne Fee, Coordinator of Fine Arts, and Ms.

183
01:11:03,303 --> 01:11:05,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Haley Rello, Coordinator of Performing Arts.

184
01:11:05,965 --> 01:11:06,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

185
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:14,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, everyone.

186
01:11:14,672 --> 01:11:15,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

187
01:11:15,152 --> 01:11:15,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice to see you all.

188
01:11:16,653 --> 01:11:18,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to share a presentation with you.

189
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:33,790
[SPEAKER_13]: in a moment, but this is just gonna be a fine arts update about the visual arts happenings that have taken place across the district so far this year, across all of our public schools.

190
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:45,198
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna go over some highlights, talk about our exciting arts month that is happening, and fill you in about a summer workshop that we're excited to get started.

191
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:51,203
[SPEAKER_13]: At the high school level, we are working to increase our course offerings.

192
01:11:51,623 --> 01:12:00,128
[SPEAKER_13]: And for next year on our schedule, we have design two, which will build upon what students have learned in design one.

193
01:12:00,148 --> 01:12:02,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been teaching design one at the high school for two years now.

194
01:12:03,009 --> 01:12:05,210
[SPEAKER_13]: So design two is just an extension of that.

195
01:12:05,811 --> 01:12:15,136
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's gonna focus more specifically on different careers and career paths students may be able to take like fashion design, advertising design, interior design,

196
01:12:16,215 --> 01:12:16,655
[SPEAKER_13]: and the like.

197
01:12:17,275 --> 01:12:43,103
[SPEAKER_13]: The other course we're offering that I'm really excited about is a unified comprehensive art class, which is basically a comprehensive art class, but it's styled after the unified sports teams you might've heard about or unified PE where different students of different levels are gonna come together to work on equal terms through ongoing artistic, creative and community building activities.

198
01:12:43,183 --> 01:12:45,784
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're really excited about getting that program working.

199
01:12:47,846 --> 01:13:02,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Another exciting addition at the high school level is that I was able to, through the kindness and hard work of Molly Layden and Anthony Tortora, we were able to get some of the Tufts Macs into the design class for next year.

200
01:13:02,363 --> 01:13:05,606
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could go to the next slide, Mr. Cushing.

201
01:13:07,368 --> 01:13:07,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And so

202
01:13:08,365 --> 01:13:14,146
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really gonna enhance our design classes, and we're gonna have the Adobe Suite installed by the fall.

203
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:24,428
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll have Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, and that's really gonna enhance our work and give some more real-world connections for those students in design class.

204
01:13:24,448 --> 01:13:33,769
[SPEAKER_13]: The next thing I wanna talk about, and I'll go through quickly, the Fine Arts Department, the visual art teachers and I have applied and received over 10 different grants this year.

205
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:36,610
[SPEAKER_13]: And through these grants, our teachers were able to stick

206
01:13:36,943 --> 01:13:51,535
[SPEAKER_13]: pure funding to support all our art shows that I'm gonna talk to you about our arts month coming up, but a lot of the grant money went to funding some supplemental activities and just enhancements at the shows, but that is not all we did with the grants.

207
01:13:53,377 --> 01:13:59,522
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, you may know, we finished, we completed a grant that was a couple of years old, the Rainbow Mural Mosaic.

208
01:13:59,682 --> 01:14:05,707
[SPEAKER_13]: That was sort of how we kicked off our school year in the Fine Arts Department, where we had our first outdoor

209
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:22,722
[SPEAKER_13]: art installation at Medford high and that was a community project students from every single school across the district contributed to that project so that was a really exciting way to start but looking forward to some of the grants that we were able to receive and implement this year.

210
01:14:23,802 --> 01:14:30,465
[SPEAKER_13]: is we received a grant to do a kindness campaign across all of our public schools.

211
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:36,927
[SPEAKER_13]: So high school students designed a bunch of different posters and stickers promoting kindness.

212
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:40,109
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to leave these here to be hung at City Hall, hopefully.

213
01:14:41,069 --> 01:14:48,332
[SPEAKER_13]: But we're going to distribute them across every school and hopefully at the Medford Public Library and even some small businesses.

214
01:14:48,452 --> 01:14:53,054
[SPEAKER_13]: So the students designed the posters and the stickers, and we're just going to

215
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:55,046
[SPEAKER_13]: share that message with the community.

216
01:14:56,808 --> 01:15:02,475
[SPEAKER_13]: We also got a grant for an art supply lending library at the high school level where it's just a

217
01:15:04,204 --> 01:15:10,627
[SPEAKER_13]: a dedicated space and supplies for students who want to continue their art exploration on their own.

218
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:20,432
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really been nice to see kids who aren't in the arts programs have an opportunity to interact with the materials and even visit the classrooms to pick up the stuff.

219
01:15:20,932 --> 01:15:33,239
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's also really been good in supporting students who have academic projects, but, you know, don't have their poster board or the markers or easy access to them so they can come and borrow them from the library.

220
01:15:33,259 --> 01:15:33,759
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so far,

221
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:35,866
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a great success.

222
01:15:37,648 --> 01:15:42,414
[SPEAKER_13]: We're doing an interactive look and find board outside the EL testing office.

223
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:43,776
[SPEAKER_13]: It's another one of our grants.

224
01:15:46,266 --> 01:15:57,988
[SPEAKER_13]: We noticed that outside the testing office, there's always, you know, small children waiting and we wanted to create like a welcoming experience for them all without any sort of language barrier.

225
01:15:58,048 --> 01:16:04,930
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just kind of going to be this large display board with different objects and then the little sheets to like look and find.

226
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:11,311
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just a fun activity and a welcoming activity for those students.

227
01:16:11,371 --> 01:16:12,651
[SPEAKER_13]: And we noticed a need for that.

228
01:16:12,711 --> 01:16:15,192
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's another small grant we received.

229
01:16:17,304 --> 01:16:25,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Beyond the grants we're doing a beautification project around Medford high school and it's been great so far students in Mr. Kane's class.

230
01:16:27,631 --> 01:16:29,092
[SPEAKER_13]: have their artwork nicely framed.

231
01:16:29,132 --> 01:16:34,194
[SPEAKER_13]: We had the frames donated and those are in B building and they look great.

232
01:16:34,234 --> 01:16:37,596
[SPEAKER_13]: We've gotten awesome feedback on it and we are expanding that project.

233
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,958
[SPEAKER_13]: We're on the hunt for donated frames.

234
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:46,701
[SPEAKER_13]: I have reached out to the target community giving to try to get more frames.

235
01:16:46,721 --> 01:16:49,122
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're extending that to other parts throughout the building.

236
01:16:51,423 --> 01:16:54,105
[SPEAKER_13]: The next thing that I'm really excited about is our murals.

237
01:16:57,031 --> 01:16:58,212
[SPEAKER_13]: if you want to bump up one.

238
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:07,698
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had a total of six murals created this year, along with a long waiting list of teachers who are looking for more.

239
01:17:08,358 --> 01:17:12,801
[SPEAKER_13]: The mural supplies are funded by a Medford Arts Council grant from last year.

240
01:17:12,821 --> 01:17:17,404
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're sharing those supplies with senior class students who are working on

241
01:17:18,244 --> 01:17:19,665
[SPEAKER_13]: murals and other school groups.

242
01:17:20,525 --> 01:17:32,752
[SPEAKER_13]: I really want to emphasize that the great thing about the murals projects and the National Art Honor Society is that it's been a wonderful way of connecting with students who are in the vocational programs who aren't able to take the art electives.

243
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:35,554
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's been a great bridge.

244
01:17:36,575 --> 01:17:46,965
[SPEAKER_13]: And if these two murals were done in the CTE, one in the classroom and one in the bistro, and they were completed by vocational students.

245
01:17:47,205 --> 01:17:57,055
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's really something we're excited about is involving students outside of the classes into some of the arts projects.

246
01:17:57,836 --> 01:18:01,459
[SPEAKER_13]: And the next slide is just a fun picture of some of the works in progress.

247
01:18:01,879 --> 01:18:07,764
[SPEAKER_13]: We're in crunch time here, especially my seniors trying to get them done by the end of the year, but it's been a lot of fun.

248
01:18:10,046 --> 01:18:15,550
[SPEAKER_13]: We had three Scholastic Art Award winners this year, winning a total of five awards.

249
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:17,992
[SPEAKER_13]: This one is Lily Verhagen.

250
01:18:18,112 --> 01:18:24,177
[SPEAKER_13]: She won a silver key for this, and she also won another honorable mention for a different piece that's not pictured here.

251
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:31,786
[SPEAKER_13]: The next one is Dakota Mahoney for her pencil illustration.

252
01:18:31,847 --> 01:18:33,169
[SPEAKER_13]: She won an Honorable Mention.

253
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:41,581
[SPEAKER_13]: And lastly, our senior Stella Heinig won an Honorable Mention and a Gold Key for her ceramic work.

254
01:18:44,348 --> 01:18:59,257
[SPEAKER_13]: We've brought the art into the after school program through the NHS, our members developed and lead an art activity on the February half day for all the students in the after school programs at the McGlynn Elementary School, the half day is kind of a long day for those kiddos.

255
01:19:00,664 --> 01:19:07,125
[SPEAKER_13]: We were approached about doing something to kind of bring a little bit more fun to those longer days and it was a great success.

256
01:19:07,245 --> 01:19:17,687
[SPEAKER_13]: They painted and illustrated bookmarks that we had like as a free giveaway in the Medford High School Library.

257
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:18,567
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was kind of fun.

258
01:19:18,607 --> 01:19:24,228
[SPEAKER_13]: The older kids were enjoying the bookmarks made by younger students.

259
01:19:24,788 --> 01:19:29,629
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a library exhibit right now happening at Medford Public Library.

260
01:19:31,022 --> 01:19:45,005
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm really forging a strong partnership with the Medford Public Library, so we now have a spot reserved every year for our students, and there's gonna be a display of 3D work next month in a different part of the library.

261
01:19:45,925 --> 01:19:55,066
[SPEAKER_13]: We also had a children's art showcase at the River's Edge, and one of our students is a 10th grader who basically puts on this whole show.

262
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:57,227
[SPEAKER_13]: I sort of am her assistant, but she,

263
01:19:58,247 --> 01:20:00,928
[SPEAKER_13]: collects the work and hangs the work and promotes the show.

264
01:20:00,948 --> 01:20:05,910
[SPEAKER_13]: And we had elementary, middle school and high school artists participate in that as well.

265
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:11,111
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's everything we have done so far this year.

266
01:20:11,171 --> 01:20:14,072
[SPEAKER_13]: But next month is really going to be an exciting month.

267
01:20:14,132 --> 01:20:15,673
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not going to talk about it too much.

268
01:20:15,713 --> 01:20:16,273
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll let Haley

269
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:24,221
[SPEAKER_13]: share a little bit as well, but we wanted to make a dedicated month to celebrate the arts and all the wonderful things that are happening.

270
01:20:24,341 --> 01:20:31,603
[SPEAKER_13]: So arts month on the visual art end, you can expect to see an art show at every single school.

271
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:46,225
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have art tea Fridays, just as a fun way to promote the month where we're asking students and staff to show their appreciation for the arts by wearing their favorite band or musician or artist t-shirt.

272
01:20:47,578 --> 01:20:51,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Our art shows at the elementary level all have supplementary activities as well.

273
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:58,566
[SPEAKER_13]: We're having a ceramics display at Medford Public Library, and we're gonna have merch on sale.

274
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:04,251
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a lot of musical and drama events happening as well, but I'll let Ms.

275
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:05,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Rello tell you about those.

276
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:10,236
[SPEAKER_13]: We will also be at West Bedford Open Studios.

277
01:21:10,936 --> 01:21:14,898
[SPEAKER_13]: This year we go every year and students have the opportunity to showcase and sell their work.

278
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:16,118
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll be there this year.

279
01:21:17,179 --> 01:21:26,123
[SPEAKER_13]: And then lastly, I just want to talk about a summer program that we are kicking off that's funded by the Cummings Foundation and the Medford Arts Council.

280
01:21:26,163 --> 01:21:29,645
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's kind of a partnership with the CCSR.

281
01:21:30,788 --> 01:21:37,269
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're gonna do a summer workshop for all grade levels, grades one to three, grades four to eight in a high school level.

282
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:53,692
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's going to be art instruction, but it's also going to focus on how art can be used as a tool for, as a force for good and to promote and share different topics and issues that are meaningful to you.

283
01:21:53,752 --> 01:21:58,793
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's sort of just a way to teach kids about finding their voice through art.

284
01:22:00,197 --> 01:22:09,120
[SPEAKER_13]: So at the elementary level, it's going to, I won't read the whole thing, but they'll hone their skills to discover the joy of using art for a force of good in the world.

285
01:22:10,261 --> 01:22:13,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Grades four through eight, it's going to be split.

286
01:22:13,302 --> 01:22:17,744
[SPEAKER_13]: So half of the class will be spent developing artistic skills through direct instruction.

287
01:22:17,804 --> 01:22:26,207
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the second half will be spent as sort of like an open studio time in which students will create a piece that reflects an issue or a topic that's meaningful for them.

288
01:22:27,864 --> 01:22:40,230
[SPEAKER_13]: And then at the high school level, it's going to be more of sort of like a studio or an artist in residence experience where they are going to be, these students will be our dedicated students.

289
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:44,612
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of them I anticipate will be students who plan on pursuing art in college.

290
01:22:45,012 --> 01:22:54,177
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, they will be working independently, but they're gonna create a piece of art that is inspired or comments on any social issue

291
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:56,791
[SPEAKER_13]: or topic that's meaningful for them.

292
01:22:57,071 --> 01:22:58,111
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're really excited.

293
01:22:58,151 --> 01:23:00,012
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be able to offer this for free.

294
01:23:00,532 --> 01:23:06,435
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're in the process of finding our teachers who want to participate in this program with us.

295
01:23:08,345 --> 01:23:13,866
[SPEAKER_13]: And lastly, I just wanna share, I'm so thrilled about everything that's been happening in our school.

296
01:23:14,846 --> 01:23:28,809
[SPEAKER_13]: And from our webpage, when I was putting this all together, I noticed that in our description, it says that while recognizing the intrinsic value of the arts, students will also discover how the arts contribute to their communities and cultures around the world.

297
01:23:29,249 --> 01:23:33,669
[SPEAKER_13]: And I really feel like when I reflect on all the work that's been done, that's the work that we are doing.

298
01:23:34,149 --> 01:23:36,670
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the work we've done at the high school has really helped

299
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:43,893
[SPEAKER_13]: to build school spirit and connect the two different programs, which I know that's something that's been really important.

300
01:23:43,913 --> 01:23:46,335
[SPEAKER_13]: So I feel like we're doing this work and it's working.

301
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:49,736
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just so thrilled to be able to share this with you all.

302
01:23:50,977 --> 01:23:51,357
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all.

303
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,238
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to leave these with you.

304
01:23:54,499 --> 01:23:54,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

305
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:55,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Faye.

306
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, great presentation.

307
01:23:58,681 --> 01:24:00,282
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's no questions, I'll invite Ms.

308
01:24:00,362 --> 01:24:00,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Rell up.

309
01:24:09,554 --> 01:24:10,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's true.

310
01:24:42,324 --> 01:24:44,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.

311
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:45,487
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

312
01:24:47,448 --> 01:24:47,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

313
01:24:48,009 --> 01:24:49,510
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my theater projection.

314
01:24:52,573 --> 01:24:54,874
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we're going to start with a jumpstart.

315
01:24:56,956 --> 01:24:57,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter will pull it up for me.

316
01:24:58,838 --> 01:24:58,998
[SPEAKER_09]: But

317
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,701
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I'll talk about it.

318
01:25:01,782 --> 01:25:15,431
[SPEAKER_09]: We started our really awesome amazing year with jumpstart music camp, when we worked with over 150 students for two weeks, providing them with band and orchestra instruction ensemble work and technique, which would help give them a jumpstart to their school year.

319
01:25:16,532 --> 01:25:20,316
[SPEAKER_09]: We also compete in the Jumpstart Olympics, very important for brain breaks.

320
01:25:21,557 --> 01:25:24,700
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had a very successful group that really rocked this year.

321
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:35,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Our end of camp showcase brought in our largest crowd yet, and also featured members of our high school string ensemble and the Medford Mustang Marching Band, which came to surprise our campers as guest performers.

322
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:39,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's some pictures from Jumpstart.

323
01:25:40,614 --> 01:25:42,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next slide was the fall play.

324
01:25:43,581 --> 01:25:48,466
[SPEAKER_09]: The Drama Club put on an amazing fall production this year, which was The Dining Room by A.R.

325
01:25:48,506 --> 01:25:48,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Gurney.

326
01:25:49,426 --> 01:25:54,411
[SPEAKER_09]: The entire play takes place in the same dining room across multiple generations.

327
01:25:54,451 --> 01:25:57,934
[SPEAKER_09]: The students did a fantastic job with character development and comedic timing.

328
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:07,303
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will give them a little plug now that this weekend they are opening Mamma Mia, which they are currently at the high school right now perfecting.

329
01:26:07,883 --> 01:26:08,845
[SPEAKER_09]: for their final dress.

330
01:26:09,586 --> 01:26:15,012
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will be Thursday, Friday and Saturday at seven and Saturday at a matinee at two o'clock.

331
01:26:15,493 --> 01:26:18,857
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you need tickets, just reach out to me.

332
01:26:18,877 --> 01:26:21,080
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a super fun time.

333
01:26:23,167 --> 01:26:24,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next slide is a parade.

334
01:26:25,209 --> 01:26:34,379
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Medford Mustang Marching Band proudly represented the city of Medford in the Woburn Halloween Parade and the North End Athletic Association's Christmas Parade this past year.

335
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:40,565
[SPEAKER_09]: The students really enjoyed bringing holiday spirit to the parade goers and finding some fellow Mustangs along the way.

336
01:26:41,246 --> 01:26:45,468
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot of alumni that shouted out to us when they saw the truck and the band go by.

337
01:26:45,488 --> 01:26:50,271
[SPEAKER_09]: They were very excited to tell us they were Medford alumni and they were so excited to see the Mustang.

338
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:54,513
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was really nice for the kids to see that, you know, once you're a Mustang, always a Mustang.

339
01:26:54,633 --> 01:26:56,214
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was a lot of fun.

340
01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:00,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next slide is districts.

341
01:27:00,932 --> 01:27:04,415
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had four students that got accepted to the Northeast Districts this year.

342
01:27:05,035 --> 01:27:11,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Jayden Veal and Samuel Keith from the high school got accepted to perform with the Northeast Senior District Orchestra.

343
01:27:11,821 --> 01:27:16,845
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jayden Wu and Saffron Jacobs were invited to perform with the Northeast Junior Districts Orchestra.

344
01:27:18,387 --> 01:27:23,671
[SPEAKER_09]: The Northeast District is very competitive, so these students have to practice really hard and study privately and

345
01:27:25,219 --> 01:27:30,162
[SPEAKER_09]: work and through all their nerves for auditions and compete against all the other high schools in our area.

346
01:27:30,262 --> 01:27:33,904
[SPEAKER_09]: So we were really proud of them that they, they excelled at it really well.

347
01:27:36,286 --> 01:27:39,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next slide is from the MMA Music Educators Conference.

348
01:27:40,809 --> 01:27:45,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Our Modern Music Ensemble, which is a class at the high school, got to perform this year.

349
01:27:45,932 --> 01:27:49,254
[SPEAKER_09]: They were one of two Massachusetts high school ensembles that were asked to perform.

350
01:27:50,733 --> 01:27:52,954
[SPEAKER_09]: They got to perform for music educators all around the state.

351
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:59,657
[SPEAKER_09]: The concert took place at the DCU Center in Worcester, and they were able to perform four songs of various genres.

352
01:28:00,498 --> 01:28:09,502
[SPEAKER_09]: The Modern Music Ensemble is also performing this Wednesday at the band's spring concert, and they are performing on Saturday, May 25th.

353
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:13,784
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing a brunch performance at the Byrne in Somerville from 12 to two, so.

354
01:28:15,046 --> 01:28:20,552
[SPEAKER_09]: They get to play some different venues and what's better than a little bit of, you know, Mustang music and brunch.

355
01:28:20,873 --> 01:28:21,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that sounds wonderful.

356
01:28:24,617 --> 01:28:25,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next one's a lot of awards.

357
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:28,802
[SPEAKER_09]: We won a lot of awards this year, which is pretty awesome.

358
01:28:29,123 --> 01:28:30,144
[SPEAKER_09]: So hang on.

359
01:28:31,697 --> 01:28:39,939
[SPEAKER_09]: The marching band took home nine trophies this fall and won the New England Scholastic Band Association Championship finals with a platinum medal.

360
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,279
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the first time they've ever won finals.

361
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:46,200
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also the first time they ever received a platinum medal, which is a 95 or above.

362
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,821
[SPEAKER_09]: So we made Medford history.

363
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:54,102
[SPEAKER_09]: This past weekend at the Music in the Parks competition, they placed second in their division with an overall rating of excellent.

364
01:28:55,196 --> 01:29:02,278
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford High School Orchestra won a gold medal at MICA this year, again making Medford history the first time the high school has ever won a gold.

365
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:12,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And this past weekend at Music in the Parks, they placed first in their division with a superior rating and won best overall orchestra for the entire event, which is pretty amazing.

366
01:29:13,602 --> 01:29:20,104
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford Mustang Winter Guard won the New England Scholastic Band Association Championship Finals this year for the seventh year in a row.

367
01:29:21,024 --> 01:29:21,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were,

368
01:29:22,961 --> 01:29:28,064
[SPEAKER_09]: moved halfway through the season this year because they were beating their competition by too many points.

369
01:29:28,524 --> 01:29:30,065
[SPEAKER_09]: So they moved them up to a higher division.

370
01:29:30,105 --> 01:29:35,208
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the kids are a little, um, upset at first, but they still ended up taking home the championship.

371
01:29:35,268 --> 01:29:37,870
[SPEAKER_09]: They really rose the occasion and took on the extra work.

372
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:39,511
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're really proud of them.

373
01:29:40,491 --> 01:29:44,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the middle school string ensemble competed at Micah this year and took home a silver medal.

374
01:29:44,814 --> 01:29:49,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and they continue to dazzle audiences with their excellent talent, dedication, and hard work.

375
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:54,639
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've ever seen these students, they're always in the hallways practicing and working on sectionals.

376
01:29:54,939 --> 01:29:59,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And for their age group, they work very, very hard and they're very dedicated.

377
01:30:01,722 --> 01:30:02,882
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, arts month.

378
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:03,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So Ms.

379
01:30:03,382 --> 01:30:05,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Fee already started talking about this.

380
01:30:05,823 --> 01:30:09,144
[SPEAKER_09]: We are opening arts month on Wednesday with the band concert.

381
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:14,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Our grades four through 12 bands will be performing as well as our modern music ensemble and our color guard.

[SPEAKER_09]: And then the drama club production will be going up the second, third and fourth.

383
01:30:20,697 --> 01:30:27,219
[SPEAKER_09]: At every arts or specialist night at the elementary level and middle school level, there will be both instrumental and art components.

384
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:32,721
[SPEAKER_09]: The modern music ensemble is performing at the burn on the 25th.

385
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:36,502
[SPEAKER_09]: The 15th is the string concert grades four through 12.

386
01:30:37,501 --> 01:30:42,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are closing out the month with the Middle School Drama Club, which is putting on a production of Grease.

387
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:47,919
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have lots of theater, art, and music offerings.

388
01:30:49,051 --> 01:31:00,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, some more updates from this year is we did add a new jazz, middle school jazz ensemble, Mr crescent team is Baptist started that they'll have their debut performance at the spring band concert on Wednesday.

389
01:31:01,643 --> 01:31:04,346
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking continuing our jazz program for the future.

390
01:31:04,906 --> 01:31:11,472
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something we had in pre coven, but unfortunately it's one of those things that kind of lost along the way so we're hoping to kind of put it back in.

391
01:31:13,483 --> 01:31:21,105
[SPEAKER_09]: We already have 75 students registered for this year's Jumpstart Music Camp, and we are pleased to be offering sessions in band, orchestra, and color guard.

392
01:31:22,246 --> 01:31:41,551
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford Band Parent Organization, which is a 513C that supports our band program, just received a grant from Tufts University that will help supply musical instruments to Jumpstart Music Camp for students that are on scholarship, and will also provide age-appropriate color guard equipment for our new color guard session, which we are excited to bring to Jumpstart this year.

393
01:31:42,475 --> 01:31:47,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Students can sign up for a band session, a orchestra session, or a color guard session.

394
01:31:48,717 --> 01:32:00,001
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're hoping if everything goes well this summer, we're hoping to eventually add a theater session in because we know we have a lot of theater goers and excitement for theater here in Medford.

395
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:02,081
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the first year at the high school.

396
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:04,242
[SPEAKER_09]: We did bring our theater classes back in action.

397
01:32:04,362 --> 01:32:09,024
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have lots of theater buzzing around the high school right now, and we're hoping to continue that growing.

398
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:12,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions?

399
01:32:13,321 --> 01:32:15,062

01:33:37,503 --> 01:33:38,104
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

425
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:41,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor.

426
01:33:41,717 --> 01:33:44,698
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to introduce the student reps and then I'm going to go to you.

427
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:50,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to make a motion to spend the rules and take item 2024 dash 24 out of order.

428
01:34:00,475 --> 01:34:00,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

429
01:34:00,775 --> 01:34:05,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure that I recognize our student reps who are here today.

430
01:34:05,618 --> 01:34:10,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Darren wrong, thank you for being here in chambers, and know what you're asking who's online.

431
01:34:10,761 --> 01:34:11,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to the both of you.

432
01:34:11,762 --> 01:34:13,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, welcome and thanks for being here.

433
01:34:14,723 --> 01:34:20,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to suspend the rules by member so seconded by second member Graham.

434
01:34:20,807 --> 01:34:22,148
[SPEAKER_06]: All those roll call please.

435
01:34:23,989 --> 01:34:24,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Branley.

436
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:26,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Graham.

437
01:34:26,831 --> 01:34:27,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

438
01:34:27,431 --> 01:34:28,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember and Papa.

439
01:34:29,994 --> 01:34:30,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olapade?

440
01:34:30,835 --> 01:34:31,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

441
01:34:31,695 --> 01:34:32,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rheinfeld?

442
01:34:32,476 --> 01:34:32,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

443
01:34:33,016 --> 01:34:33,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

444
01:34:33,517 --> 01:34:33,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

445
01:34:33,777 --> 01:34:34,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor Longo?

446
01:34:34,617 --> 01:34:34,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

447
01:34:35,018 --> 01:34:36,278
[SPEAKER_06]: On the affirmative, zero on the negative.

448
01:34:36,779 --> 01:34:37,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion is approved.

449
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:41,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Member Ruseau, Member Rheinfeld, and Member Olapade.

450
01:34:41,963 --> 01:34:57,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Resolution on the end of fossil fuel building equipment purchases, whereas the buildings of the Medford Public Schools are exclusively the responsibility of the Medford School Committee pursuant to Mass General Law, Chapter 71, Section 68, whereas the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law

451
01:34:58,393 --> 01:35:24,466
[SPEAKER_06]: both provided significant opportunities for schools to end our dependence on fossil fuel infrastructure, whereas the climate crisis is an existential threat to the survival of our species and countless other species we share our planet with, whereas the climate crisis is primarily caused by human activity through the release of greenhouse gases, whereas today's leaders must take action now to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.

452
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:27,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee

453
01:35:28,081 --> 01:35:51,273
[SPEAKER_06]: One, bans the purchase of new or replacement fossil fuels powered equipment used to operate our school facilities, such as HVAC equipment and kitchen equipment, may authorize the purchase of banned equipment in emergency situations at a regular or special meeting of the committee, and must authorize equipment purchases covered by this resolution, regardless of the revenue source, such as municipal funding or grants from governmental or non-governmental organizations.

454
01:35:53,649 --> 01:35:59,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we have our team, our city team, and they brought some guests with us to discuss the HVAC system.

455
01:35:59,694 --> 01:36:09,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I was talking to Brenda this weekend about the process to fixing our HVAC at the two middle schools, somewhat related here.

456
01:36:09,321 --> 01:36:13,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if you want to hear from them or a member that has this resolution.

457
01:36:13,745 --> 01:36:15,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to speak on it.

458
01:36:17,028 --> 01:36:17,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

459
01:36:17,793 --> 01:36:18,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

460
01:36:20,355 --> 01:36:23,037
[SPEAKER_02]: The resolution does speak for itself pretty clearly, I think.

461
01:36:23,378 --> 01:36:31,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's, you know, Medford has done things differently than lots of other communities.

462
01:36:31,144 --> 01:36:34,367
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, doing things that are, oh, that sun is right in my eyes.

463
01:36:36,108 --> 01:36:43,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And done a lot of things that are frankly not even, that are explicitly laid out in the law, in mass general law, that should be done differently.

464
01:36:43,594 --> 01:36:46,557
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's sort of a mountain of things in that category.

465
01:36:48,026 --> 01:36:48,167
[SPEAKER_02]: The.

466
01:36:49,389 --> 01:36:58,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike Somerville, where they have transferred the buildings over to the city, in which case the school committee has no authority over school buildings, also doesn't have to pay for any utilities.

467
01:37:00,553 --> 01:37:05,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And during COVID, the school committee could not open their buildings because they had no authority.

468
01:37:05,435 --> 01:37:06,976
[SPEAKER_02]: The city had all authority.

469
01:37:07,396 --> 01:37:14,499
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Medford and the vast majority of communities in Massachusetts, the school committee has explicit and total control over our buildings.

470
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:32,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that that is not then how Medford is operated, but we should be doing no capital improvements to our buildings, we should be doing no emergency repairs to our buildings, unless the school committee has authorized them.

471
01:37:32,971 --> 01:37:36,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a part of the resolution that's not actually stated clearly.

472
01:37:37,154 --> 01:37:38,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess it is in the beginning.

473
01:37:39,015 --> 01:37:50,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I just want to make it clear that this committee, um, the majority of the folks that ran for office, um, included in their platforms that we would stop, uh, using fossil fuels.

474
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:54,701
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I just, uh, that's what this resolution is about.

475
01:37:55,041 --> 01:38:00,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, I'd make a motion to approve unless somebody else wants to talk on it.

476
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:05,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld, do you want to say anything?

477
01:38:06,573 --> 01:38:17,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I just I just wanted to say that I would like to see the default to be to consider the non fossil fuel solutions for our building projects.

478
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:22,643
[SPEAKER_08]: which I think is a reverse of kind of historically what we as a society has done.

479
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:36,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, and I think provision three here in particular is about bringing these decisions to the school committee so we can evaluate the language in terms of the climate goals that we have for the city the sustainability goals.

480
01:38:37,491 --> 01:38:53,362
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and not just the financial goals looking being able to look comprehensively at upfront costs and then sustained maintenance costs, and I think that's really important that we're not just making the decisions based on what it costs right now to do this, but also to

481
01:38:54,483 --> 01:39:04,611
[SPEAKER_08]: maintain these systems and make them sustainable for the future, because we know a lot of our buildings are about to experience some major stresses with age.

482
01:39:04,831 --> 01:39:09,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And this right here right now is the time to be planning for that.

483
01:39:11,656 --> 01:39:12,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Hunt.

484
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:18,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Mayor, I assume we call you that at these meetings.

485
01:39:18,101 --> 01:39:19,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I'm not usually at school committee.

486
01:39:19,643 --> 01:39:22,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia Hunt, I'm the director of planning, development and sustainability.

487
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:41,323
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been the city's, essentially, sustainability director since 2012, and I've done a lot of work in the schools, and I would like to respectfully request that you wait and see our presentation and hear the work that we've been doing and to understand some of the concerns that we have.

488
01:39:41,403 --> 01:39:46,624
[SPEAKER_14]: As you all know, I am the champion of renewable energy in our buildings.

489
01:39:47,044 --> 01:39:52,025
[SPEAKER_14]: I am the force behind why our police station is all electric, why our new library

490
01:39:52,423 --> 01:39:54,525
[SPEAKER_14]: is all electric and designed to be net zero.

491
01:39:54,885 --> 01:40:04,553
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that the question about renovating buildings and upgrading heating systems is complicated, and we're prepared to share a bunch of that information with you this evening.

492
01:40:04,894 --> 01:40:18,766
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was hoping that you would be hearing sort of what our findings are and our information before voting, deliberating on something like this, whether you were to then send it to committee or to vote after a presentation.

493
01:40:19,386 --> 01:40:22,829
[SPEAKER_14]: I would respectfully request that you may want to see what we have first.

494
01:40:23,329 --> 01:40:25,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to table?

495
01:40:27,032 --> 01:40:29,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly am very interested in this presentation.

496
01:40:29,855 --> 01:40:33,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I read it, and I have a lot of questions.

497
01:40:33,758 --> 01:40:35,659
[SPEAKER_02]: This resolution provides an out.

498
01:40:35,839 --> 01:40:39,562
[SPEAKER_02]: There are going to be situations for which we must continue to use fossil fuels.

499
01:40:40,843 --> 01:40:43,686
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, I think sometimes when it comes to the backup options,

500
01:40:45,447 --> 01:40:50,680
[SPEAKER_02]: having an electric primary system and a backup system that's fossil fuels right now might be the most

501
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:52,430
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate thing.

502
01:40:52,890 --> 01:41:01,212
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I hear that the city's hiring an OPM to do a project that the school committee has not even authorized, I can't help but feel like there's a big problem here.

503
01:41:01,612 --> 01:41:03,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not interested.

504
01:41:03,753 --> 01:41:10,214
[SPEAKER_02]: If at the end of that presentation, we need to have a meeting to discuss approving that project to use fossil fuels, that's fine.

505
01:41:10,254 --> 01:41:12,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would become the new policy of the school committee.

506
01:41:13,135 --> 01:41:16,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting it ahead of this, to me, feels a bit like

507
01:41:16,656 --> 01:41:19,198
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna go ahead, hire an OPM and start doing some work.

508
01:41:19,258 --> 01:41:22,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after the fact, the school committee said, you can't do that going forward.

509
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:26,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's not okay.

510
01:41:26,723 --> 01:41:32,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the law is explicit that we have this authority and nobody should be touching our buildings without our approval.

511
01:41:33,427 --> 01:41:41,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm incredibly interested in this presentation and look forward to it and definitely want to know a whole heck of a lot more about

512
01:41:43,257 --> 01:41:48,398
[SPEAKER_02]: the options and the site challenges I understand that we have with geothermal in that area.

513
01:41:49,339 --> 01:42:00,222
[SPEAKER_02]: But if in 10 years, the federal government says, under no circumstance could public buildings use fossil fuels anymore, did we just blow however many millions of dollars and have to rip it all out?

514
01:42:01,522 --> 01:42:07,244
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what the future holds, other than the fact that from the climate, we sort of have a pretty ugly picture.

515
01:42:07,644 --> 01:42:11,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't know what higher levels of government are going to do

516
01:42:11,598 --> 01:42:19,340
[SPEAKER_02]: when they finally come to grips and finally start taking very strong action to stop the use of fossil fuels.

517
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:25,901
[SPEAKER_02]: And public buildings are usually the first thing they go for because that's the stuff they have control over.

518
01:42:25,981 --> 01:42:35,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So I respect very much director Hunt and her work and especially the work around the library and the police station.

519
01:42:36,543 --> 01:42:41,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to working with her and lots of other folks on the new high school.

520
01:42:42,729 --> 01:42:45,171
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we need to draw a line in the sand someday.

521
01:42:45,191 --> 01:42:52,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know when anybody else would like to draw the line, but I feel like it should have been done 50 years ago.

522
01:42:53,138 --> 01:42:55,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe now's a good time to draw the line in the sand on this.

523
01:42:57,139 --> 01:43:09,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this resolution allows for us to decide, okay, we're gonna stick another fossil fuel thing in our buildings and just pretend that the climate is not completely falling apart.

524
01:43:09,603 --> 01:43:14,104
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an option, but we need to make that vote when we make that decision.

525
01:43:14,444 --> 01:43:16,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, we aren't even being asked about these things.

526
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:18,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

527
01:43:20,206 --> 01:43:22,727
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, just from the chair, and then I'm gonna acknowledge

528
01:43:25,502 --> 01:43:50,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Hunt and her team have taken on quite a bit to help, plus Paul Riggi, who's our facilities and maintenance director over in the city side and through requests coming from me, which obviously are coming through the school committee, they've spent a lot of time working on the light posts on Freedom Way, keys, new cameras, and now HVAC, so I understand you want to move this forward tonight, but

529
01:43:50,919 --> 01:43:57,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Hunt respectfully asked that we table this basically until they at least give their presentation and we can always go back to it.

530
01:43:58,024 --> 01:44:09,633
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think out of respect for city staff working tirelessly for school needs because they want to help, I would ask that the committee respect that request.

531
01:44:10,754 --> 01:44:13,596
[SPEAKER_06]: member Rousseau and then.

532
01:44:14,237 --> 01:44:19,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything you said except for one thing I agree with, you do not speak for the committee without us voting.

533
01:44:20,362 --> 01:44:28,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really take offense to the idea that the chair who by definition the chair is the servant of the body is not the head of the body.

534
01:44:29,309 --> 01:44:30,690
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the definition of a chair.

535
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:33,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did not ask you to do this.

536
01:44:33,712 --> 01:44:36,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate that as the mayor with the purse strings,

537
01:44:37,622 --> 01:44:43,223
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's a lot you can do and there's a lot only you can do, but we didn't ask you to do this.

538
01:44:44,183 --> 01:44:55,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you didn't, as the school come forward as a representative of the school committee to get this work done, you came forward as a chair, as the mayor, you don't have that authority.

539
01:44:55,686 --> 01:45:01,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's very upsetting to think that you can speak for us if we have not voted, because you cannot.

540
01:45:04,284 --> 01:45:05,144
[SPEAKER_06]: approved funding.

541
01:45:05,224 --> 01:45:06,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not signed a contract.

542
01:45:07,085 --> 01:45:15,389
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they're presenting tonight on work that I asked them to do, but it was the committee that has discussed it over and over again.

543
01:45:15,449 --> 01:45:18,891
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the teachers union who brought a grievance because our air conditioning doesn't work.

544
01:45:19,331 --> 01:45:22,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And we said we were going to commit to fixing the air conditioning.

545
01:45:23,033 --> 01:45:29,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the base work and they're here before I've ever even signed a contract because obviously they're going to present to you first.

546
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:32,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know why fixing air conditioning is so upsetting.

547
01:45:34,724 --> 01:45:38,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Miss Member Branley and then Miss Smith, sorry.

548
01:45:41,908 --> 01:45:47,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mic's not on.

549
01:45:53,613 --> 01:45:54,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there we go.

550
01:45:56,014 --> 01:45:58,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can understand everybody's point here.

551
01:45:58,885 --> 01:46:03,087
[SPEAKER_07]: but I feel like if we're gonna draw the line, can we just wait for the presentation and then we can draw the line?

552
01:46:03,527 --> 01:46:07,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see why, I feel like it's a little disrespectful to the team.

553
01:46:10,011 --> 01:46:11,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, motion to table, please.

554
01:46:16,494 --> 01:46:21,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, can we just, can we table until they speak?

555
01:46:22,597 --> 01:46:23,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that possible?

556
01:46:25,373 --> 01:46:29,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so let's just table the vote until we can listen to them speak.

557
01:46:46,774 --> 01:46:51,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I've had my member on top of work on the vote.

558
01:46:52,018 --> 01:46:53,459
[SPEAKER_06]: It's motion to table is undebatable.

559
01:46:53,499 --> 01:46:55,621
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll just hold on for your name to be called.

560
01:46:55,641 --> 01:46:59,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we're mostly the table.

561
01:46:59,624 --> 01:47:02,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what the motion is.

562

[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yes 70 affirmative zero and the negative motion to revert has been approved we're going to go to number three HVAC update.

594
01:47:53,808 --> 01:48:00,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of schools, Miss Brenda Pike and director Alicia Hunt.

595
01:48:06,152 --> 01:48:12,898
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening Madam Mayor and members of the committee thank you very much really appreciate this opportunity to present today on this very important topic, just prior to getting started.

596
01:48:14,925 --> 01:48:16,786
[SPEAKER_18]: Is we good?

597
01:48:16,926 --> 01:48:26,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Just prior to getting started, I do wanna just piggyback on something the superintendent said earlier, school lunch hero day, the end of this week, if you can come out and support our lunch staff.

598
01:48:27,311 --> 01:48:30,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Last year in April, we were averaging over 12,000 meals a week.

599
01:48:30,913 --> 01:48:34,154
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week, we served over 16,000 meals.

600
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:39,197
[SPEAKER_18]: I just felt like that's really important for you to know as we move into this really important topic.

601
01:48:39,917 --> 01:48:41,759
[SPEAKER_18]: So I will share my screen.

602
01:48:42,819 --> 01:48:57,269
[SPEAKER_18]: And as you'll see, we have members of our OPM team and our engineers with us here as well, including Alicia Hunt and Brenda Pike, who we've been trying to work with on this.

603
01:48:57,509 --> 01:48:59,611
[SPEAKER_18]: So let me just go through our agenda.

604
01:49:00,632 --> 01:49:02,113
[SPEAKER_18]: First, team introductions.

605
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:27,883
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do a look at the comprehensive assessment that has been done, some viable options that we have, some real world challenges that we have as well that kind of go to the previous conversation around full electrification and really our desire as well to do everything we can to make sure that we're combating the climate crisis, a proposed timeline and time for your questions as well.

606
01:49:28,955 --> 01:49:33,498
[SPEAKER_18]: So, as we move through, I'll ask people to stand up and be recognized.

607
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:36,080
[SPEAKER_18]: So myself assistant superintendent.

608
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:39,902
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the operations, part of my title.

609
01:49:40,543 --> 01:49:44,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Also Alicia hunt director of planning development and sustainability for the city of Medford.

610
01:49:45,506 --> 01:49:48,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Brenda Pike, our Climate Planner for the city.

611
01:49:49,348 --> 01:49:53,130
[SPEAKER_18]: John McLaughlin, Director of Buildings and Grounds, unfortunately cannot be here this evening.

612
01:49:53,650 --> 01:50:14,622
[SPEAKER_18]: Paul Riggi, Director of Facilities for the city, who cannot be here this evening, but also with us tonight is Josh Doolittle from our Design Representative B2Q, who also conducted the comprehensive assessment of the Andrews Middle School a little bit over a year ago, that was in process and then completed.

613
01:50:15,642 --> 01:50:18,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Gabby Cole, designer representative from B2Q.

614
01:50:20,686 --> 01:50:24,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Joey Redmond, designer representative from B2Q.

615
01:50:24,789 --> 01:50:28,131
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Tom Ellis, who is our OPM representative.

616
01:50:28,511 --> 01:50:35,596
[SPEAKER_18]: And while not under contract yet, we have gone through comprehensive interviews that myself, Mr. McLaughlin,

617
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:55,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Alicia Hunt, members of the city's finance team, and Brenda sat in on to conduct a comprehensive review of those organizations who submitted applications for this and to really vet out the type of work that they've done in these areas and the type of work that they propose to do.

618
01:50:56,589 --> 01:50:59,831
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll now hand it over to Alicia and others.

619
01:51:02,469 --> 01:51:02,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

620
01:51:02,969 --> 01:51:07,271
[SPEAKER_14]: So as I mentioned before, I have actually been, sorry, I have to get not too close.

621
01:51:07,291 --> 01:51:08,432
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really echoey out here.

622
01:51:09,432 --> 01:51:13,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Doing a lot of, Peter, can we actually have this here so it's easier to see?

623
01:51:14,154 --> 01:51:16,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, because it's hard to see the same words up there.

624
01:51:18,677 --> 01:51:20,437
[SPEAKER_14]: We can work it if you want us to.

625
01:51:20,537 --> 01:51:22,959
[SPEAKER_14]: That works.

626
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:26,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I'm actually used to doing my own presentations when I go to city council.

627
01:51:27,561 --> 01:51:32,263
[SPEAKER_14]: So we did do a comprehensive assessment of

628
01:51:32,788 --> 01:51:39,715
[SPEAKER_14]: The Andrews and McGlynn, the Andrew school so we basically we looked at we worked with National Grid to say what can we afford what could

629
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,040
[SPEAKER_14]: What would things cost?

630
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:42,781
[SPEAKER_14]: What would National Grid pay for?

631
01:51:43,101 --> 01:51:51,904
[SPEAKER_14]: And so this was partially funded by National Grid and partially funded by the city to do a comprehensive assessment of the Andrews School as a role model.

632
01:51:52,384 --> 01:52:00,166
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just gonna go, I'm gonna assume that people don't know so much about the buildings because I realized that also the general public watches these meetings as well.

633
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:03,708
[SPEAKER_14]: So please forgive me if you think that I'm telling you things you all know.

634
01:52:05,268 --> 01:52:22,475
[SPEAKER_14]: But the schools, the five, what I always call the lower schools, not the high school, the other five, were in fact designed by the same designers and built by the same contractors and the same OPM over a series of a couple of years, opening in 2001 and 2003.

635
01:52:22,555 --> 01:52:27,137
[SPEAKER_14]: They have generally the same kinds of equipment.

636
01:52:27,177 --> 01:52:28,077
[SPEAKER_14]: They have the same models.

637
01:52:28,117 --> 01:52:30,358
[SPEAKER_14]: They were installed the same way at the same time.

638
01:52:30,891 --> 01:52:38,295
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we did was we said we were already doing a project at the Andrews looking at solar and battery and trying to make that work.

639
01:52:38,355 --> 01:52:39,735
[SPEAKER_14]: And we already had work going on.

640
01:52:40,116 --> 01:52:48,780
[SPEAKER_14]: And as that, we have been running a piece of software in the school for a couple of years that gives us like a constant commissioning of it, telling us what's working and not working.

641
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:58,805
[SPEAKER_14]: So B2Q is the team that's been working with me at the Andrews School for many years, already had a baseline, heavy, strong knowledge of the Andrews School.

642
01:52:59,338 --> 01:53:01,519
[SPEAKER_14]: So we said, let's do this assessment.

643
01:53:01,559 --> 01:53:03,120
[SPEAKER_14]: We understand what's going on.

644
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:11,986
[SPEAKER_14]: When people came to us and said, you know, the HVAC is not working, there are troubles with the heat, there are ventilation, like not ventilation, but you know, the systems aren't all working correctly.

645
01:53:13,006 --> 01:53:15,488
[SPEAKER_14]: We said, look, we've already got a headstart at this building.

646
01:53:16,428 --> 01:53:20,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore, it would be most cost effective for us to do an assessment of this one building.

647
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:27,375
[SPEAKER_14]: And it would tell us a lot about all of our other buildings, because we understand that it's the same types of systems in the same way.

648
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:32,082
[SPEAKER_14]: So we contracted at the time with B2Q to do that.

649
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:39,063
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to ask B2Q to actually speak to their comprehensive, the assessment they did of the Andrews and their recommendations.

650
01:53:39,483 --> 01:53:41,024
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I also have information.

651
01:53:41,084 --> 01:53:47,865
[SPEAKER_14]: We had an HVAC technician go into all of the schools and do some poking at them and understanding of what's going on.

652
01:53:48,125 --> 01:53:49,966
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have a slide sort of addressing that.

653
01:53:50,366 --> 01:53:56,467
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I'm going to come back and talk about sort of what some of the difficulties are with some of the things that we want

654
01:53:56,752 --> 01:53:59,113
[SPEAKER_14]: we would love to be able to do in these buildings.

655
01:53:59,533 --> 01:54:05,656
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm gonna start by asking the B2Q staff to come up and talk to the assessment that they did in the Andrews School.

656
01:54:05,676 --> 01:54:13,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi everyone, thanks for having us tonight.

657
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:19,302
[SPEAKER_10]: So as Alicia mentioned, we did the comprehensive study at the Andrews School.

658
01:54:19,442 --> 01:54:26,265
[SPEAKER_10]: So this slide and the review I will go over will focus on the condition of the major HVAC equipment.

659
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:39,767
[SPEAKER_10]: There are air handling units on the roof that provide heating and cooling to mainly administrative spaces, the gymnasium and the cafeteria.

660
01:54:40,267 --> 01:54:46,951
[SPEAKER_10]: And then each classroom also has what is called a unit ventilator to do the heating and cooling for those spaces.

661
01:54:47,871 --> 01:54:52,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Of those units at the Andrews School at the time of our study last year in 2023, the cooling system

662
01:54:56,141 --> 01:54:58,723
[SPEAKER_10]: for the gymnasium was not operational.

663
01:54:59,003 --> 01:55:03,326
[SPEAKER_10]: All the compressors had failed and there was therefore no cooling in the gym.

664
01:55:04,407 --> 01:55:17,936
[SPEAKER_10]: The cafeteria cooling unit had three out of four of the fans were not operational at the time of our study, meaning there was very little capacity to provide adequate cooling to the cafeteria.

665
01:55:19,184 --> 01:55:37,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, the air cooled chiller, that is the machine that provides cooling to all the classrooms in the building, that was somewhat operational, but it required a facilities maintenance personnel to go up to the unit on the roof, climb a ladder every day and manually reset it.

666
01:55:37,914 --> 01:55:44,317
[SPEAKER_10]: So each morning when it came on, it wasn't able to come on automatically and needed that manual intervention to operate.

667
01:55:45,646 --> 01:55:55,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Lastly, during our study, one of the two boilers at the Andrews School had a glycol leak and was valve off and not operating.

668
01:55:55,655 --> 01:56:04,222
[SPEAKER_10]: The one boiler was able to provide the heating to the school, but in the case of an additional failure, there was a lack of backup capacity.

669
01:56:06,628 --> 01:56:08,989
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is the summary of the Andrews School.

670
01:56:09,209 --> 01:56:17,493
[SPEAKER_10]: I've also can speak a little more generally to the McGlynn School based on some information that Mr. Cushing has provided us.

671
01:56:18,073 --> 01:56:31,060
[SPEAKER_10]: My understanding of last year is that similar issues were experienced at the McGlynn and that cooling was not being provided due to equipment failures in at least I believe the gym, cafeteria and auditorium.

672
01:56:32,201 --> 01:56:42,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, the chillers providing cooling to the classrooms were operating at about 50% capacity, so not able to provide full cooling on the hottest days of the year.

673
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:45,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything you'd like to add?

674
01:56:49,896 --> 01:56:59,104
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so I'd like to summarize the recommended option that we considered in detail during our comprehensive study at the Andrews School.

675
01:57:00,522 --> 01:57:04,344
[SPEAKER_10]: The concept, I will start by talking about the solution for the classrooms.

676
01:57:05,044 --> 01:57:10,787
[SPEAKER_10]: The concept is to replace the air cooled chiller on the roof with what's called an air to water heat pump.

677
01:57:11,588 --> 01:57:18,611
[SPEAKER_10]: This heat pump would be able to provide chilled water cooling to the classrooms during the summer, doing the same function as the chiller.

678
01:57:19,611 --> 01:57:25,634
[SPEAKER_10]: But the heat pump would also be able to provide hot water to the classrooms in the winter to do the heating.

679
01:57:26,155 --> 01:57:28,896
[SPEAKER_10]: So one piece of equipment, a heat pump would provide

680
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:34,380
[SPEAKER_10]: heating and cooling to all the classrooms through an electrified method.

681
01:57:35,781 --> 01:57:45,767
[SPEAKER_10]: This concept also proposed to replace the failing boilers with new updated condensing gas boilers, which are more efficient than the existing cast iron boilers in place.

682
01:57:46,567 --> 01:57:49,269
[SPEAKER_10]: The purpose of these boilers would be to provide

683
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:52,554
[SPEAKER_10]: a few different things.

684
01:57:52,574 --> 01:58:02,620
[SPEAKER_10]: A, it could provide backup heating to the classrooms on the coldest days of the year or supplemental heat if an air to water heat pump was unable to keep up with the demand.

685
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:16,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Second, there are still some devices in the school that without being upgraded would require a hot water temperature higher than what a heat pump, the heat pumping contemplate could produce.

686
01:58:17,441 --> 01:58:21,983
[SPEAKER_10]: In that case, the boilers could still provide hot water to those devices.

687
01:58:22,403 --> 01:58:34,527
[SPEAKER_10]: That includes like perimeter baseboard radiation that provides heat under windows and some of the supplementary heating in administrative areas like the principal's office, for an example.

688
01:58:36,041 --> 01:58:44,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And last, these boilers would also provide the heating that would be needed if the building were to lose power and not have electricity.

689
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:50,854
[SPEAKER_10]: So in case of a power outage, there is a generator to provide some standby power to the building.

690
01:58:51,335 --> 01:58:54,117
[SPEAKER_10]: The Andrews School is the city's emergency shelter.

691
01:58:54,638 --> 01:59:02,545
[SPEAKER_10]: And these boilers could continue to provide hot water to continue to heat the school if there was an outage or an emergency situation.

692
01:59:04,358 --> 01:59:11,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to just conclude by discussing the other systems in the building, those air handlers we mentioned.

693
01:59:12,188 --> 01:59:18,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, they get hot water from the boiler for heating, and then we have those cooling units up on the roof that I mentioned that do the cooling.

694
01:59:19,815 --> 01:59:26,537
[SPEAKER_10]: So our study considered replacing those cooling units on the roof with heat pump units.

695
01:59:26,618 --> 01:59:37,221
[SPEAKER_10]: So these would be variable refrigerant flow heat pumps that would be able to do heating in the winter and cooling in the summer with one heat pump device.

696
01:59:38,922 --> 01:59:44,064
[SPEAKER_10]: We are also considering, with the air handler replacements, still maintaining a hot water coil

697
01:59:44,659 --> 01:59:48,803
[SPEAKER_10]: for those backup purposes for the resiliency in case of the power outage.

698
01:59:49,264 --> 01:59:54,529
[SPEAKER_10]: So heat could be provided to areas where people may assemble like the cafeteria in the gymnasium.

699
01:59:55,591 --> 01:59:59,615
[SPEAKER_10]: So overall, this would result in about an over 50%

700
02:00:01,412 --> 02:00:16,016
[SPEAKER_10]: savings in your current natural gas use, which is right now equivalent to approximately 39% of the greenhouse gas emissions, which would increase upwards towards 58% with full renewable electricity.

701
02:00:16,816 --> 02:00:22,278
[SPEAKER_10]: And Alicia can speak to this, but solar power is being contemplated and planned for the Andrews School.

702
02:00:22,338 --> 02:00:26,039
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully those greenhouse gas emissions would go up over time.

703
02:00:32,614 --> 02:00:32,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Um.

704
02:00:35,595 --> 02:00:44,196
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we didn't mention, and I omitted from putting on the slides, but I do just want to keep putting on the table, um, is that, um.

705
02:00:45,456 --> 02:00:46,157
[SPEAKER_14]: We talked.

706
02:00:46,477 --> 02:00:50,197
[SPEAKER_14]: I talked with members of the school committee, uh, pre covid.

707
02:00:50,257 --> 02:00:54,378
[SPEAKER_14]: So I believe it was in 2019 about the roofs in the states of the roofs of the school.

708
02:00:54,958 --> 02:00:59,319
[SPEAKER_14]: At that time, we authorized and, uh,

709
02:01:00,728 --> 02:01:13,376
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to call it a repair, but it was a restoration of the roof at the Andrew school so that roof has a 20 year lifespan on it now and we I actually have in my email a con a proposed contract to put.

710
02:01:14,194 --> 02:01:16,116
[SPEAKER_14]: solar on the roof of the Andrews School.

711
02:01:16,456 --> 02:01:27,904
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually looking like our best option, given the new federal direct pay incentives, is for us to actually purchase this solar, which could also result in us saving money.

712
02:01:28,325 --> 02:01:32,928
[SPEAKER_14]: My goal is to actually move that project forward this summer, if at all possible.

713
02:01:33,609 --> 02:01:40,414
[SPEAKER_14]: But frankly, I'd like to read the contract before I commit to something, but the pricing actually is excellent.

714
02:01:40,514 --> 02:01:41,034
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thrilled.

715
02:01:42,115 --> 02:01:43,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I mentioned that because

716
02:01:44,082 --> 02:01:48,184
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to start doing our roofs, we need to start replacing our roofs.

717
02:01:48,624 --> 02:02:06,092
[SPEAKER_14]: The right thing to do is a full replacement that also includes new insulation, which would reduce the amount of energy we need for heating and cooling the schools, and could actually if we did it at the McGlynn school at the same time, could help us size down the size of the equipment we would need

718
02:02:06,505 --> 02:02:19,657
[SPEAKER_14]: at the McGlynn School, at least, because of all the insulation it would add to it, would then also allow us to pursue, and I would pursue it sort of as the roof, I think it would make sense to fold into this project, pursuing solar on that.

719
02:02:19,737 --> 02:02:26,083
[SPEAKER_14]: I would probably just do that as a separate piece to go out and procure solar for the roof of the McGlynn School.

720
02:02:26,443 --> 02:02:29,024
[SPEAKER_14]: and see if we could get some excellent pricing on that as well.

721
02:02:29,344 --> 02:02:32,085
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanna put that on the table that we're really looking at that.

722
02:02:32,645 --> 02:02:38,628
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also always the option to buy renewable credits to offset electricity usage.

723
02:02:39,288 --> 02:02:47,771
[SPEAKER_14]: So the city also had an opportunity and we employed an HVAC technician to review the equipment in all of the schools.

724
02:02:48,091 --> 02:02:54,454
[SPEAKER_14]: He produced a nine page report that said that the reports for the

725
02:02:55,626 --> 02:02:59,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrews and the McGlynn, he also agreed, were like, this is failed.

726
02:02:59,508 --> 02:03:01,949
[SPEAKER_14]: This needs new equipment.

727
02:03:01,989 --> 02:03:03,049
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not repairable.

728
02:03:03,470 --> 02:03:23,099
[SPEAKER_14]: The other three schools all seemed to be that they needed some repairs, some serious maintenance, like a little more than heavy maintenance, some retro commissioning, but that they could be kept running for several years, which would give us a chance to do this project, see how the Andrews and McGlynn go,

729
02:03:24,406 --> 02:03:34,069
[SPEAKER_14]: and then to start doing some capital planning to come back and do, because these systems won't last forever, but can we keep them another five years, possibly 10, yes.

730
02:03:35,029 --> 02:03:53,694
[SPEAKER_14]: So, however, my recommendation is that we actually have the same OPM and design teams do these projects at the same time so that the things that do need to be changed are changed inconsistent with our values and goals around renewable energy, around lowering energy usage,

731
02:03:54,701 --> 02:04:01,763
[SPEAKER_14]: and our similar equipment so that we can make it easier on our maintenance staff to maintain similar things.

732
02:04:01,823 --> 02:04:06,804
[SPEAKER_14]: It is easier for them when things are on the same control system, same kinds of stuff.

733
02:04:07,224 --> 02:04:11,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, this is what works at the Brooks, it's the same stuff at the Roberts, and it's the same stuff at the McGlynn.

734
02:04:11,526 --> 02:04:12,866
[SPEAKER_14]: It is in fact helpful for them.

735
02:04:13,379 --> 02:04:28,189
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's my recommendation is to just rather than trying to have our facilities department or someone else managing what are kind of significant repairs and in some places replacement, we just roll it in and try and move that forward quickly.

736
02:04:30,430 --> 02:04:36,694
[SPEAKER_14]: So then I just wanted to talk about the elephant in the room, which is geothermal, because we are all hearing about geothermal.

737
02:04:36,814 --> 02:04:39,696
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been on the calls with our delegation.

738
02:04:39,716 --> 02:04:41,177
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been looking at the various

739
02:04:41,604 --> 02:04:44,668
[SPEAKER_14]: opportunities, there's a lot of federal money right now.

740
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:54,582
[SPEAKER_14]: If we do solar, we can get these federal, it's not rebates, sorry, I keep forgetting the exact word for it.

741
02:04:55,410 --> 02:05:00,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Direct pay is what they're calling it, but different federal agencies are referring to the term differently, but direct pay.

742
02:05:00,413 --> 02:05:16,761
[SPEAKER_14]: But what it is, is that as a homeowner, as somebody with a tax burden, if I was to do solar or one of these renewable projects, I would get a tax credit, like not reduce my income by that amount, but actually, oh, I owe 50,000 in taxes.

743
02:05:16,781 --> 02:05:21,583
[SPEAKER_14]: You can take 30% of the cost of your project off the taxes you owe to the government.

744
02:05:22,143 --> 02:05:25,225
[SPEAKER_14]: We as a nonprofit, as a non-tax bearing entity,

745
02:05:25,598 --> 02:05:35,042
[SPEAKER_14]: we do not have the tax liability, this new system actually allows us to get a check back from the IRS for that money, which is brilliant.

746
02:05:35,458 --> 02:05:55,768
[SPEAKER_14]: So for the solar, it would be for the solar, I do think and I'm pushing on this little bit if we did a roof and solar together that we could get, we may be able to get the money for the roof, the 30%, as well as the solar, but the rules for this program, while the law was passed about 18 months ago, the rules have just started coming out in January and February.

747
02:05:56,072 --> 02:06:02,639
[SPEAKER_14]: And so then people have to sort of like understand what are these rules mean, and nobody's tested the rules because they literally just came out.

748
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:05,042
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are looking at that.

749
02:06:05,802 --> 02:06:11,829
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's also a lot of money for geothermal and if your project involves geothermal, then you can start looking at these 30% tax

750
02:06:13,484 --> 02:06:24,950
[SPEAKER_14]: incentives basically um so some of it is that there is a lot of piping in this in the classrooms and I would actually honestly need gabby and Josh to speak to specifically which piping what.

751
02:06:25,351 --> 02:06:36,817
[SPEAKER_14]: would need to be at a different sizing to be able to handle the temperature of geothermal water that would include very disruptive work in our schools would take more than we could do in a summer.

752
02:06:37,216 --> 02:06:42,923
[SPEAKER_14]: and would be disruptive in displacement of classes, perhaps the entire building in order to do that work.

753
02:06:43,323 --> 02:06:45,366
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have swing space like that.

754
02:06:45,766 --> 02:06:49,391
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's one of my concerns, although actually the swing space would be your concern.

755
02:06:50,344 --> 02:06:59,207
[SPEAKER_14]: My concern would be the work and the saying like the students couldn't, the work we're contemplating, we do believe we can do a large chunk of it over the summer.

756
02:07:00,047 --> 02:07:12,871
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get back to the schedule but a large chunk over the summer, and that we could do it without being disruptive to classes and that classes could continue, we could be there in the fall doing the work, and we would not have to displace any classes to do the work.

757
02:07:14,662 --> 02:07:22,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Other things with geothermal, though, is that, and I have a map about, maybe I'll just flip the map up and then I'll come back to the words.

758
02:07:24,104 --> 02:07:40,807
[SPEAKER_14]: So the activity use limitation means that there is known contamination under the ground and that it has been, we've had a licensed site professional, we've done studies, we have done testing, and then a limitation like this basically says

759
02:07:41,263 --> 02:07:44,604
[SPEAKER_14]: here's what's underground, here's what you may or may not do on the property.

760
02:07:45,044 --> 02:07:52,186
[SPEAKER_14]: So a lot of this, the areas in orange, you can dig down to six feet deep without having an issue.

761
02:07:52,527 --> 02:07:55,447
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't dig deeper than that because of the contamination.

762
02:07:57,008 --> 02:08:03,490
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're not concerned about in any way about students coming into contact with the clean dirt on top.

763
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:07,511
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you start digging wells, we would have to deal with that.

764
02:08:07,811 --> 02:08:09,752
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are concerns about how that happens.

765
02:08:10,265 --> 02:08:20,669
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are general knowledge that this entire area, different portions of it, have had dumping on them.

766
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:27,972
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know that the whole area used to be a salt marsh and that it was created as solid land by dumping materials from the construction of 93.

767
02:08:29,093 --> 02:08:34,055
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a lot of concern about what you are going to hit if you start digging in this area.

768
02:08:34,615 --> 02:08:50,150
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is not, again, insurmountable, but when you dig a well and you have to get rid of the dirt, hundreds of feet of the dirt, and the dirt has contamination in it, that is an order of magnitude more expensive than getting rid of dirt that's clean.

769
02:08:50,570 --> 02:08:53,973
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, hopefully you've all seen our beautiful labyrinth.

770
02:08:54,574 --> 02:08:55,715
[SPEAKER_14]: It is wonderful.

771
02:08:55,855 --> 02:08:56,255
[SPEAKER_14]: I love it.

772
02:08:57,336 --> 02:09:04,242
[SPEAKER_14]: But it is a contamination cap because the land there was so expensive, we couldn't afford to clean up the land under that.

773
02:09:04,702 --> 02:09:13,149
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we built this beautiful art piece that people love, but it's because the contamination in that corner of the property is actually that bad.

774
02:09:15,131 --> 02:09:18,914
[SPEAKER_14]: So additionally, there's a conservation restriction on the entire property.

775
02:09:18,934 --> 02:09:21,796
[SPEAKER_14]: This property was transferred to the city in 1999 from the state.

776
02:09:24,642 --> 02:09:39,931
[SPEAKER_14]: and everything inside the red, the section nearest the river has a conservation restriction on it, or the whole area has conservation restriction, and the area closest to the river actually has a conservation easement, and I meant to refresh myself on the difference between the two.

777
02:09:40,332 --> 02:09:45,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Suffice it to say, anything that we do in this area, we actually have to get permission from DCR.

778
02:09:46,415 --> 02:09:53,080
[SPEAKER_14]: We had to go to DCR for the labyrinth, for the dog park, for the McGlynn playground work, for the wind turbine,

779
02:09:54,344 --> 02:09:56,965
[SPEAKER_14]: but it's a conservation restriction.

780
02:09:57,805 --> 02:10:01,366
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the things, and then actually that includes Hormel Stadium, fascinatingly.

781
02:10:02,246 --> 02:10:08,608
[SPEAKER_14]: So one of the things that I've learned about geothermal is that it is extremely disruptive to the area.

782
02:10:08,948 --> 02:10:15,390
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to dig up, you have drilling rigs that have to go down hundreds of feet and you have to do a lot of holes.

783
02:10:15,790 --> 02:10:21,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, we did the math earlier and I have it on this screen, but we were talking about

784
02:10:27,601 --> 02:10:33,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Approximately 200 wells to support the Andrews and the McGlynn schools.

785
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:40,788
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need the area of approximately two Hormel stadiums, sort of more than the football fields that would need to be dug up.

786
02:10:41,328 --> 02:10:48,932
[SPEAKER_14]: And I understand that one rig can do about either one well or half a well a day.

787
02:10:49,553 --> 02:10:50,453
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're talking about 200,

788
02:10:52,267 --> 02:10:54,809
[SPEAKER_14]: days of rigs drilling.

789
02:10:54,829 --> 02:10:59,153
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe we can get two or three rigs, but still that's a huge amount of time.

790
02:10:59,533 --> 02:11:04,197
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be dump trucks in and out of the area for months taking this dirt out.

791
02:11:04,517 --> 02:11:20,731
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's some of our concerns about it, that it's not that you can't do it, but then also if we hit contamination above and beyond what we were expecting, it could slow the project and it could add costs that we were not even anticipating, even if we anticipate the expense of the contamination.

792
02:11:21,308 --> 02:11:37,381
[SPEAKER_14]: We have not yet determined whether if you're using direct pay and you hit contamination, you can get the 30% tax credit on the 30% of the cost of disposing that soil, because you could if you were disposing the clean fill, definitely.

793
02:11:37,921 --> 02:11:42,503
[SPEAKER_14]: But if it's dirty, we need to, I'm not sure if anybody's asked yet, frankly.

794
02:11:43,424 --> 02:11:46,865
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are some of the things that have come up around geothermal.

795
02:11:47,186 --> 02:11:51,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Now to be clear, I do think we should be seriously considering geothermal for Medford High School.

796
02:11:52,068 --> 02:11:54,509
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think about where are we looking at?

797
02:11:54,589 --> 02:11:55,730
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the location?

798
02:11:56,170 --> 02:11:57,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this possible?

799
02:11:57,290 --> 02:12:06,635
[SPEAKER_14]: But when you're doing a massive building construction, a new construction, you're already displacing students, you're putting in new HVAC equipment, you're putting in all new stuff,

800
02:12:07,148 --> 02:12:11,799
[SPEAKER_14]: I definitely think it needs to be on the table for that project.

801
02:12:12,821 --> 02:12:15,067
[SPEAKER_14]: I have significant concerns here, though.

802
02:12:16,874 --> 02:12:22,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other thing we so we talked about, could we do it like Cornell Stadium needs actually new turf in the next few years?

803
02:12:23,097 --> 02:12:26,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you dig it all up and put boring holes under the turf?

804
02:12:26,999 --> 02:12:32,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Turns out, yes, we're told that you can put boring holes and put the turf on top of it.

805
02:12:32,481 --> 02:12:35,083
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is, in fact, not out of the question.

806
02:12:35,103 --> 02:12:41,406
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have another giant turf in Medford that that is perhaps this could be on the table for.

807
02:12:42,830 --> 02:12:44,131
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're looking at these things.

808
02:12:44,871 --> 02:12:51,294
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, if you did it, you can do it under a parking lots, you can put it under parking lots and put your pavement right over it and that's fine as well.

809
02:12:52,875 --> 02:12:55,876
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, that's a lot of time for your parking lots to be disturbed.

810
02:12:56,314 --> 02:13:02,036
[SPEAKER_14]: So I feel like we I really wanted to go into that because I think a lot of people are saying, why not geothermal.

811
02:13:03,617 --> 02:13:14,801
[SPEAKER_14]: We would still also need to use a lot of electricity with geothermal geothermal does not negate the need for using electricity and your electricity use goes up because of all the pumps that are involved with it as well.

812
02:13:17,782 --> 02:13:38,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I will then just sort of, because we didn't examine geothermal for the police station and the library and the cost benefit for the energy savings, like the greenhouse gas reductions from an all electric building or an all electric with geothermal was not significant because of the amount of electricity we still needed in the building for the geothermal.

813
02:13:39,079 --> 02:13:41,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it was a real number, but it wasn't like, oh, we'll cut it by 50%.

814
02:13:42,062 --> 02:13:45,985
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like another five or 10%, if I remember correctly.

815
02:13:48,243 --> 02:13:56,849
[SPEAKER_14]: So then there are other issues with the full electrification, because in addition to geothermal, you could use electric resistive boilers.

816
02:13:57,330 --> 02:14:02,614
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just saying that those use a lot of electricity, like a lot of electricity.

817
02:14:03,094 --> 02:14:06,817
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is, would be in my opinion, very wasteful.

818
02:14:08,138 --> 02:14:13,822
[SPEAKER_14]: But regardless, if you did a lot of, if you did electrification, all electrification, even with geothermal,

819
02:14:14,363 --> 02:14:18,145
[SPEAKER_14]: we would need upgrades to the National Grid infrastructure in the area.

820
02:14:18,425 --> 02:14:33,331
[SPEAKER_14]: That was actually something that we've been butting up against for the solar battery project that we were working on, that the cost of the electrical upgrades were gonna be, at that time I was quoted around $350,000 and National Grid was putting it on us.

821
02:14:33,751 --> 02:14:35,732
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was looking at a million dollar project.

822
02:14:35,772 --> 02:14:36,912
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, this is insane.

823
02:14:38,353 --> 02:14:41,735
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is something that is a serious, a significant concern.

824
02:14:43,655 --> 02:14:50,817
[SPEAKER_14]: We would also if we went all electric, we would need a significantly larger generator than we currently have at each of the buildings.

825
02:14:51,437 --> 02:14:59,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Now if we did that a larger building a generator would not physically fit into each of those buildings, so we actually talked about could we put a.

826
02:15:00,492 --> 02:15:06,954
[SPEAKER_14]: an external generator between the two buildings in like a separate outbuilding that would serve both buildings.

827
02:15:07,894 --> 02:15:09,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it would be possible.

828
02:15:09,515 --> 02:15:13,476
[SPEAKER_14]: It might not actually be a bad idea if we needed a larger generator.

829
02:15:14,136 --> 02:15:17,477
[SPEAKER_14]: We would also need the special permits from DCR because of that.

830
02:15:18,117 --> 02:15:22,139
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's something to sort of like, so there were some, some of these were the concerns.

831
02:15:22,579 --> 02:15:29,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we were also looking at the kitchen hoods, which would need a heat recovery ventilator because the,

832
02:15:30,925 --> 02:15:33,406
[SPEAKER_14]: outdoor air hitting the coil could damage the heat pump.

833
02:15:33,466 --> 02:15:35,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm sorry.

834
02:15:36,267 --> 02:15:47,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody, one of the other experts would have to explain that at this point, because I am aware, and I believe Rhetta may be here to speak to this, that we are already upgrading a lot of our kitchen equipment to all electric.

835
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:55,112
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are in fact running into electrical problems, as I understand it, because of that, but we are trying to move forward with electric ones.

836
02:15:56,372 --> 02:15:58,713
[SPEAKER_14]: So very briefly, I'll just touch on

837
02:15:59,363 --> 02:16:03,761
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the, our team, our current team has.

838
02:16:04,454 --> 02:16:06,275
[SPEAKER_14]: the most knowledge about the Andrew School.

839
02:16:06,475 --> 02:16:20,901
[SPEAKER_14]: We believe that the McGlynn School schedule would be very similar, but we have to reserve sort of this caveat of we've done extensive reviews of all of the equipment in the Andrew School, and we have a lot of knowledge and a lot of confidence in this schedule.

840
02:16:21,281 --> 02:16:30,725
[SPEAKER_14]: The McGlynn School would probably move on the same timeline, but once they get in there digging into the details of the building, it's possible that there'll be some unexpected conditions that could

841
02:16:31,405 --> 02:16:39,515
[SPEAKER_14]: delay our off derail us a little there's actually a bunch of pre work that is needed, this is a major project looking at.

842
02:16:40,496 --> 02:16:49,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Some potentially sub metering understanding exactly the loads that are needed in this building what what do we need to put in here some conceptual design.

843
02:16:49,548 --> 02:16:55,332
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a phase where you work with the owners of the building to determine the owner's project requirements.

844
02:16:55,412 --> 02:17:04,377
[SPEAKER_14]: So this committee would be involved in determining the owner's project requirements of the project, and then the design of the project, construction documents.

845
02:17:05,138 --> 02:17:08,140
[SPEAKER_14]: We're exploring the best way to move this forward.

846
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:11,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of this equipment has extremely long lead times.

847
02:17:11,522 --> 02:17:13,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Gabby's actually been making some phone calls.

848
02:17:13,843 --> 02:17:17,244
[SPEAKER_14]: there's one piece of equipment that right now has a 32 week lead time.

849
02:17:18,004 --> 02:17:21,385
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the key, I wrote it down, which one.

850
02:17:22,565 --> 02:17:40,369
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a recommendation around what procurement process we should use and whether we should actually consider a construction manager at risk process, because that would allow us to pre-purchase a bunch of the equipment to do the design and purchase the equipment before the rest of it.

851
02:17:42,009 --> 02:17:43,630
[SPEAKER_14]: in order to hit these lead times.

852
02:17:45,311 --> 02:17:48,372
[SPEAKER_14]: And then what we're looking at here is to start the work.

853
02:17:48,412 --> 02:17:52,394
[SPEAKER_14]: We would be ready to start the work with all the procurement actually next summer.

854
02:17:52,934 --> 02:17:57,936
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'd be looking maybe at a May start, but maybe you don't want to start it during finals.

855
02:17:57,956 --> 02:18:01,058
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd have to be able to understand what exactly we're talking about.

856
02:18:01,158 --> 02:18:02,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Would there be disruption?

857
02:18:02,918 --> 02:18:07,621
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's no air conditioning, we might as well be using the space anyhow and working on the equipment.

858
02:18:08,971 --> 02:18:14,495
[SPEAKER_14]: through the summer and then into the fall with it being ready for the heating season to be up and running.

859
02:18:15,295 --> 02:18:24,541
[SPEAKER_14]: I originally had hoped that we could do it this summer, but that is not possible with a project of this scale and not with the equipment lead times that we're seeing right now.

860
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:34,075
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is a lot, but I also have, Gabby and Josh have also their electrical lead here as well.

861
02:18:34,675 --> 02:18:44,780
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've also brought, Tom is the representative from the OPM that we are recommending that we work with, who has experience with these kinds of projects.

862
02:18:45,401 --> 02:18:52,905
[SPEAKER_14]: So once we start to get into the details, frankly, I'm good at the high level, and we hit a point where I have to turn to them for the details.

863
02:18:55,555 --> 02:18:55,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

864
02:18:56,156 --> 02:18:56,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

865
02:18:56,316 --> 02:18:59,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Smith, do you wanna come up and speak on this?

866
02:19:00,562 --> 02:19:01,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, we tabled it, so.

867
02:19:01,523 --> 02:19:05,349
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all right, thanks.

868
02:19:06,355 --> 02:19:12,600
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to say with respect to the kitchens, we have a lot of equipment that needs to be replaced.

869
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:19,826
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been working on borrowed time this year, I had planned and had hoped to replace all of the gas equipment with electric.

870
02:19:20,566 --> 02:19:21,807
[SPEAKER_12]: So I started working on it.

871
02:19:22,808 --> 02:19:28,573
[SPEAKER_12]: In the beginning of October, getting electricians in saying okay can we do this what equipment what I need to purchase.

872
02:19:29,113 --> 02:19:39,285
[SPEAKER_12]: getting it ordered installed so now we're almost may I have three beautiful shiny new pieces of equipment in the Andrews and we cannot use them because we're still not.

873
02:19:41,127 --> 02:19:42,388
[SPEAKER_12]: we're not connected yet.

874
02:19:42,968 --> 02:19:46,589
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are some real challenges in making this happen.

875
02:19:47,009 --> 02:19:52,471
[SPEAKER_12]: I've also had electricians look at the McGlynn, because I have already purchased one piece of equipment that's there also.

876
02:19:53,032 --> 02:19:59,934
[SPEAKER_12]: And they've told me that the board, it was a mess from day one, like wrong sized wires, things are mislabeled.

877
02:20:00,034 --> 02:20:06,717
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a bigger task than just purchasing the equipment and getting the connections.

878
02:20:07,279 --> 02:20:20,862
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm hesitant to try to continue working towards electrical until I can really use the Andrews as a guinea pig and figuring out once we start using it, can the building actually handle the load because it draws a lot of power.

879
02:20:22,202 --> 02:20:24,503
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's just a lot of concerns.

880
02:20:24,543 --> 02:20:30,124
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the meantime, I still have all of these other schools with equipment that needs to be replaced and the clock is ticking.

881
02:20:30,624 --> 02:20:35,545
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's just what I wanted to share is my experience with trying to make this happen.

882
02:20:36,348 --> 02:20:38,690
[SPEAKER_12]: not being as easy as it seems.

883
02:20:41,371 --> 02:20:42,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, thank you, Ms.

884
02:20:43,253 --> 02:20:44,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Smith, that's relevant too.

885
02:20:44,874 --> 02:20:54,981
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had to come before us each time, you maybe couldn't do electric because of our panels or the work needs to be done on that aspect.

886
02:20:56,422 --> 02:20:56,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rousseau?

887
02:20:57,622 --> 02:20:57,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

888
02:20:58,502 --> 02:21:15,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the presentation I especially like the additions to it that were spoken because there was things sort of missing I thought from the presentation that you answered about the backup gas boiler backup is probably the wrong word since it will actually need to be in use anyways.

889
02:21:18,995 --> 02:21:22,057
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my seventh year in school committee so I'm just going to be blunt.

890
02:21:23,058 --> 02:21:25,679
[SPEAKER_02]: If a future superintendent doesn't like the electric bill.

891
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:32,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they turn off that system and just go to the gas system to save some money, because that's, that's an, that's a Medford mo.

892
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:35,421
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna cut this budget this year.

893
02:21:36,162 --> 02:21:44,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we stop using electric at the Andrews and just use the gas backup system and it costs way less money, that is a decision that won't come to the school committee.

894
02:21:44,528 --> 02:22:03,282
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just be somebody in facilities or in the superintendent's office, no offense to the superintendent, but when the pandemic began, or maybe it was just before the pandemic, Director Hunt evaluated the high school about what it would be, how we could save money by installing

895
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:07,362
[SPEAKER_02]: more efficient equipment to heat or cool the place.

896
02:22:07,782 --> 02:22:12,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out there's no such thing as more efficient because all of the equipment was turned off or dead.

897
02:22:12,244 --> 02:22:14,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't do better than zero.

898
02:22:15,686 --> 02:22:24,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just deeply concerned as this is a system that could support just in perpetuity if somebody decided the electric bill was too high.

899
02:22:28,914 --> 02:22:30,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that is a possibility.

900
02:22:31,806 --> 02:22:32,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

901
02:22:32,167 --> 02:22:37,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I assumed I just, you know, just thinking about like how we're going to figure out how to make sure that that does not happen.

902
02:22:37,794 --> 02:22:38,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not for you all.

903
02:22:41,018 --> 02:22:43,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super excited by the solar on the Andrew stuff.

904
02:22:43,281 --> 02:22:45,163
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very exciting.

905
02:22:46,605 --> 02:22:49,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question about what is construction manager at risk process.

906
02:22:59,741 --> 02:23:02,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, I'm Tom Ellis with Jones Lang LaSalle.

907
02:23:02,803 --> 02:23:20,452
[SPEAKER_15]: The construction management at risk construction delivery was part of the construction reform law of 2004, which allowed for alternative construction delivery over Chapter 149, which is a traditional design, bid, build process sequentially.

908
02:23:21,272 --> 02:23:36,820
[SPEAKER_15]: construction management risk allows qualification based selection of firms that are builders but then can get them involved earlier in the design process so that things like early procurement of long need items can be secured.

909
02:23:37,820 --> 02:23:38,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Many of the

910
02:23:39,581 --> 02:23:43,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Projects in the Commonwealth are now going at construction management risk.

911
02:23:43,542 --> 02:23:54,244
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually participated in a session on Monday where Deputy Director Jay Mitchell was really advocating for it and telling the process.

912
02:23:54,284 --> 02:24:01,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I can provide a link, which is really a good 30-minute presentation by him on the benefits of construction management risk.

913
02:24:01,986 --> 02:24:19,408
[SPEAKER_15]: But it really becomes a forming a partnership with a builder, instead of having an adversarial condition where a chapter 149 kind of creates that low bid process and then, and then it also allows the, the builder to participate in the budgeting cost estimating scheduling.

914
02:24:19,768 --> 02:24:35,360
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a, you agree upon a fee early on it's a competitive process, and the legislation requires certain attributes to happen on the selection process, so it's very clear and open about how it's done, but it's a more of a qualifications based process.

915
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:42,925
[SPEAKER_15]: But it has proven itself over, let's say, almost 20 years now of being in place that it's really beneficial.

916
02:24:43,125 --> 02:24:45,867
[SPEAKER_15]: The quality of the construction goes up substantially.

917
02:24:45,967 --> 02:24:52,651
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a lot of discussion, but I'll provide that link, and it's a really good presentation if you're interested.

918
02:24:52,872 --> 02:24:53,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

919
02:24:53,452 --> 02:24:56,434
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice to hear that it's not the

920
02:24:58,786 --> 02:25:09,370
[SPEAKER_02]: waterfall approach or whatever it was called where you have to just wait and wait and then you get the low bid and it's the lowest bid by a long shot and everybody's like uh-oh like what did we get a bid for?

921
02:25:09,390 --> 02:25:19,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure my colleagues will have other questions but I'll come back to my question because I gotta find it.

922
02:25:22,555 --> 02:25:23,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

923
02:25:24,216 --> 02:25:24,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

924
02:25:26,690 --> 02:25:27,731
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of questions.

925
02:25:28,791 --> 02:25:39,477
[SPEAKER_11]: On one of the slides, it says partial decarbonization is the practical solution for the moment, but full decarbonization could be done in the future with more time and money.

926
02:25:39,497 --> 02:25:49,363
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looks like the timeline for the Andrews is really through the summer of 2025.

927
02:25:50,704 --> 02:25:53,745
[SPEAKER_11]: So what does that mean for the McGlynn?

928
02:25:56,326 --> 02:25:59,829
[SPEAKER_11]: what would it mean if we were to pursue full decarbonization?

929
02:25:59,869 --> 02:26:06,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what is the timing differential between what you're proposing and what full decarbonization would look like?

930
02:26:11,339 --> 02:26:17,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so as it relates to the McGlynn School first, I'll do that one with the partial and then moving to the full.

931
02:26:18,525 --> 02:26:19,566
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know,

932
02:26:21,513 --> 02:26:24,336
[SPEAKER_17]: The McGlynn School and the Andrews School, like Alicia mentioned, are very similar.

933
02:26:25,017 --> 02:26:30,202
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we hope that they would follow a similar timeline with this concept that is being currently contemplated.

934
02:26:30,905 --> 02:26:42,616
[SPEAKER_17]: And not to get too technical, but in the future, additional equipment could be added to this system, which would enable it to be more electrified, more 100% electric.

935
02:26:42,676 --> 02:26:55,327
[SPEAKER_17]: However, there are certain caveats associated with that, most notably that the electric service to the school would likely need to be upgraded in order to support more electric resistive loads and other heat pumps.

936
02:26:57,051 --> 02:27:16,741
[SPEAKER_17]: So the timetable for that is really a similar project to this in terms of, you know, one to two years from conception to implementation, possibly sooner depending on the scope that's contemplated as it relates to 100% electrification through geothermal is

937
02:27:18,232 --> 02:27:19,633
[SPEAKER_17]: a longer process.

938
02:27:20,133 --> 02:27:30,900
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a process that should be looked at as taking up to three years in a facility of this size, possibly longer.

939
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:38,665
[SPEAKER_17]: I say three years, not including any potential unforeseen issues related to contamination.

940
02:27:39,165 --> 02:27:41,466
[SPEAKER_17]: So it is certainly a longer timeline.

941
02:27:41,866 --> 02:27:54,549
[SPEAKER_17]: While certain activities during design and construction could be compressed or performed in parallel, it is still going to be a notably longer timeline to implement.

942
02:27:55,489 --> 02:27:57,910
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to make sure I'm understanding.

943
02:27:57,970 --> 02:28:00,830
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's about two years per school.

944
02:28:01,871 --> 02:28:07,152
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we were pursuing geotherm, like full electrification, it would be

945
02:28:07,867 --> 02:28:20,493
[SPEAKER_11]: three minimum per school, maybe more, and obviously cost being the big variable there because of the potential contamination, which I think we all are worried about.

946
02:28:22,133 --> 02:28:28,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Dogs digging there, and my dog digging there, and my kids going to school there, none of that makes me feel super warm and fuzzy.

947
02:28:28,876 --> 02:28:33,578
[SPEAKER_11]: So I absolutely understand the contamination concerns on the property.

948
02:28:33,598 --> 02:28:34,519
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just trying to understand

949
02:28:35,532 --> 02:28:38,374
[SPEAKER_11]: scope wise, what would it what would it look like?

950
02:28:38,674 --> 02:28:46,279
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, frankly, do we have could can could we wait six years really for one of those schools to be done?

951
02:28:46,459 --> 02:28:49,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are you proposing that these two would be done sort of in parallel?

952
02:28:50,127 --> 02:29:05,834
[SPEAKER_14]: I realized that that was perhaps one of the confusions we are absolutely proposing that these two schools be done in parallel that we're doing these at the same time that we would start the Anderson the McGlynn right now, both of them and our goal is that both of them go to construction this time next year.

953
02:29:07,528 --> 02:29:13,051
[SPEAKER_14]: But we have confidence in where the Andrews is that we can move it at that timeline.

954
02:29:13,391 --> 02:29:21,755
[SPEAKER_14]: And we believe that we can make the McGlynn have that also going to construction around this time next, like, you know, May, June of next year.

955
02:29:22,556 --> 02:29:27,498
[SPEAKER_14]: But we have to just have that reservation of we really have to get in and look at all the details.

956
02:29:28,359 --> 02:29:32,281
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's some pieces that we can, things that can be doing in advance, some that can't.

957
02:29:32,521 --> 02:29:34,682
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've ever been in actually the,

958
02:29:35,930 --> 02:29:48,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the boiler rooms right the central the interior rooms, their interior to the school, and on the Andrews I know that there's these big vents that we're going to have to remove and try and get equipment in and out through these vents.

959
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:52,741
[SPEAKER_14]: And we still haven't quite figured out how that's going to happen at the McGlynn.

960
02:29:53,121 --> 02:29:58,843
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the reasons actually to do the CM at risk program is that they would be part of the design team.

961
02:29:59,303 --> 02:30:07,006
[SPEAKER_14]: So as rather than us saying, oh, we are engineers and we have figured out how you're going to get this equipment in and out.

962
02:30:07,306 --> 02:30:14,949
[SPEAKER_14]: We work with the people who will actually be responsible for getting the equipment in and out to make that decision about how it's going to work.

963
02:30:15,535 --> 02:30:18,837
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is actually one of the big reasons I'm very interested in.

964
02:30:19,198 --> 02:30:37,331
[SPEAKER_14]: We've never done CM at risk in Medford, but it seems to me that for something like this, where it's not just, well, here's a flat piece of land, build a building, this is an existing building that'll be occupied, that we need the person doing the work to be our partner in figuring out how exactly this is gonna happen.

965
02:30:37,451 --> 02:30:39,172
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some interesting spaces in there.

966
02:30:40,168 --> 02:30:42,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so just one more question.

967
02:30:43,570 --> 02:30:56,897
[SPEAKER_11]: If I am understanding correctly what your proposal is, that the chiller would be replaced with an air to water electric heat pump, and the air handling units would be replaced with heat pumps, which are also electric.

968
02:30:56,938 --> 02:31:02,301
[SPEAKER_11]: So the remaining gas component would be the condensing boilers.

969
02:31:02,481 --> 02:31:03,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that accurate?

970
02:31:05,722 --> 02:31:07,844
[SPEAKER_17]: And domestic hot water, yeah.

971
02:31:09,628 --> 02:31:16,309
[SPEAKER_17]: So the central equipment, which would be remaining gas, would be the condensing boilers.

972
02:31:16,529 --> 02:31:34,693
[SPEAKER_17]: And what they would serve would be reheat coils, which are hot water coils in the ductwork downstream of the air handlers, as well as perimeter hot water radiation, which basically heats the exterior of the building surface so that occupants do not feel cold.

973
02:31:35,753 --> 02:31:36,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.

974
02:31:36,614 --> 02:31:43,297
[SPEAKER_11]: And so are we saying that the scope of what you're proposing does include the insulation and the roof replacement?

975
02:31:46,559 --> 02:31:47,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Just trying to understand where those are at.

976
02:31:47,919 --> 02:31:51,061
[SPEAKER_18]: The scope at present does not at the Andrews.

977
02:31:51,681 --> 02:31:55,363
[SPEAKER_18]: But hopefully, the scope at the McGlynn would.

978
02:31:55,783 --> 02:32:00,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Because the Andrews had a restoration film.

979
02:32:00,726 --> 02:32:03,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone is glad to join us on the roof of the Andrews?

980
02:32:04,546 --> 02:32:10,831
[SPEAKER_18]: see this white, it's a it's a white roof film that was put in in Google View might have it by now right.

981
02:32:11,271 --> 02:32:28,827
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we also have the McGlynn roof which is significantly larger, that with a solar and with a project, there would probably be the best decision to redo that roof, and to see what costs we could recoup through those, for lack of a better word direct pay tax credits.

982
02:32:29,936 --> 02:32:43,119
[SPEAKER_18]: I do also just want to say, though, that when you mentioned scope, the scope of this project does not include the piping that runs through the building, and it does not include the unit ventilators in the classrooms, all right?

983
02:32:43,319 --> 02:32:45,340
[SPEAKER_18]: That is not contemplated in this.

984
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:47,180
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to be clear about that.

985
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:49,781
[SPEAKER_11]: And why are you being clear about that?

986
02:32:50,748 --> 02:32:59,114
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's why do I need to know that it's because if something if we come back in five years or so on and we say we now need to replace the unit ventilators.

987
02:32:59,614 --> 02:33:05,178
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I don't want you to, I don't want people to think that this is a soup to nuts replacement of systems.

988
02:33:06,418 --> 02:33:14,364
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other problem with waiting, waiting years is, in particular with these two schools, we need to act.

989
02:33:18,184 --> 02:33:26,550
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when we talk about scope so we have a pretty solid cost of what we think the Andrews project would cost that we've been basing this on.

990
02:33:26,963 --> 02:33:29,584
[SPEAKER_14]: We know that the McGlynn is about 60% bigger.

991
02:33:29,684 --> 02:33:32,805
[SPEAKER_14]: We know we have an inventory of the equipment that's in there.

992
02:33:33,126 --> 02:33:35,407
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a general cost of what this would cost.

993
02:33:35,447 --> 02:33:50,013
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've been banding some numbers about, but until they actually do design work, it would be September or October when we'll get estimates that are, this is how much we should, we actually need to pay for the whole project.

994
02:33:50,373 --> 02:33:51,593
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have that number yet.

995
02:33:52,394 --> 02:33:55,275
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have not gone out and gotten what is that number for the roof?

996
02:33:55,655 --> 02:34:07,855
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't actually have a solid construction but by the time we get that number in September, especially if we do see them at risk, it'll be a solid number, they'll be like yes this is how much we need like okay we're going to

997
02:34:08,986 --> 02:34:20,771
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not your expert on how do we pay for things, but so if I were to say, okay, it's time to go get a bond, assuming that's what we did, then we would have, we would know how big that bond should be at that window.

998
02:34:21,111 --> 02:34:29,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, we're talking in big round numbers, numbers that are big enough that legally require we must have an OPM to do the project, right?

999
02:34:29,875 --> 02:34:31,476
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's where we kind of are in budgeting.

1000
02:34:31,496 --> 02:34:33,136
[SPEAKER_11]: So can you give us an idea of that estimate?

1001
02:34:33,176 --> 02:34:34,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what is that round number?

1002
02:34:34,637 --> 02:34:41,071
[SPEAKER_14]: We, we've been looking at a number between 15 and $20 million to do both these projects at both schools.

1003
02:34:42,771 --> 02:34:44,812
[SPEAKER_14]: if we have not really costed roofs.

1004
02:34:45,092 --> 02:34:53,217
[SPEAKER_14]: When I did that back in 2019, we were looking at one to two million to do a full roof replacement.

1005
02:34:53,757 --> 02:35:02,722
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't asked for pricing since then, but that was frankly, I was looking at orders of magnitude because in my work, we go get a grant to pay for things.

1006
02:35:03,122 --> 02:35:07,125
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to know, is that grant big enough or that grant big enough?

1007
02:35:07,185 --> 02:35:09,746
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are sort of the round numbers.

1008
02:35:10,046 --> 02:35:10,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1009
02:35:12,153 --> 02:35:18,299
[SPEAKER_14]: why we actually need to hire the consultants to do the design, to do the engineering, to figure out solid numbers.

1010
02:35:18,820 --> 02:35:20,422
[SPEAKER_14]: But these are big numbers.

1011
02:35:20,722 --> 02:35:21,563
[SPEAKER_14]: These are not small.

1012
02:35:21,663 --> 02:35:22,263
[SPEAKER_14]: I realized that.

1013
02:35:22,303 --> 02:35:23,705
[SPEAKER_14]: I was on our building projects.

1014
02:35:25,046 --> 02:35:31,773
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think my other question is, when we talk about how would we pay for this, I think that's

1015
02:35:33,100 --> 02:35:35,441
[SPEAKER_11]: the school budget has like nothing in it for maintenance.

1016
02:35:35,501 --> 02:35:37,182
[SPEAKER_11]: We've started having that discussion.

1017
02:35:38,282 --> 02:35:46,105
[SPEAKER_11]: We could talk about why that is all day, but the bottom line is there's like a fraction of what is even needed to maintain the buildings in there today.

1018
02:35:46,225 --> 02:35:55,349
[SPEAKER_11]: So where does $20 million come from in terms of like what procedurally has to happen and how can we support this process?

1019
02:35:55,389 --> 02:36:00,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Because those two buildings need this work urgently and probably long ago.

1020
02:36:01,772 --> 02:36:02,912
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, you know,

1021
02:36:03,476 --> 02:36:11,038
[SPEAKER_11]: concern that we have taken so long to like get to the point of action, which is something that I think we have to just continue to work on.

1022
02:36:11,098 --> 02:36:15,899
[SPEAKER_11]: But meanwhile, like we have a project in front of us and we're going to have to figure out how to pay for it.

1023
02:36:15,959 --> 02:36:20,501
[SPEAKER_11]: So where does that where does that come from in terms of like the broader picture of the city?

1024
02:36:21,761 --> 02:36:30,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, no, I think that what you could do for the project is support this plan and let our teams move forward and get it done.

1025
02:36:31,363 --> 02:36:33,204
[SPEAKER_06]: OPM is going to be a whole cost in itself.

1026
02:36:33,772 --> 02:36:39,036
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will come out of ARPA funding, and then we will move forward with most likely a bond.

1027
02:36:40,317 --> 02:36:42,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1028
02:36:42,179 --> 02:36:43,079
[SPEAKER_06]: That's helpful, thank you.

1029
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:50,305
[SPEAKER_06]: But we can discuss it more in our financial task force meetings as we map out all the needs of the city and schools.

1030
02:36:51,026 --> 02:36:53,267
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had two questions.

1031
02:36:53,368 --> 02:36:58,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So to confirm, we're looking at this coming out of the city budget rather than the school's budget?

1032
02:36:58,552 --> 02:36:59,813
[SPEAKER_06]: This will not come out of the school budget.

1033
02:37:01,593 --> 02:37:03,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to say it.

1034
02:37:04,116 --> 02:37:15,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Then my question, Dr. Cushing, you alluded to this, what does compatibility look like for future projects in terms of what equipment we're going to need and being able to

1035
02:37:16,559 --> 02:37:25,644
[SPEAKER_08]: make the connection move transition into the next stage of renovating this what is more, and I guess maybe I'm asking what is Moore's law for HVAC equipment.

1036
02:37:25,804 --> 02:37:32,567
[SPEAKER_18]: So, so this, these are the moments where I have to admit what I do and don't know and that's why I have a team of engineers here.

1037
02:37:33,448 --> 02:37:36,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, in all honesty, provided the transition I was expecting them.

1038
02:37:36,670 --> 02:37:36,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1039
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:39,051
[SPEAKER_18]: And I will say this, like,

1040
02:37:40,734 --> 02:37:46,001
[SPEAKER_18]: Earlier this year, I presented on these systems, and I think I said, like, I dove off the deep end.

1041
02:37:46,962 --> 02:37:53,812
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, recently, I'm amazed that, you know, just the size of the pipes in the building feed in classrooms.

1042
02:37:54,568 --> 02:38:09,954
[SPEAKER_18]: would need to be different for various temperature changes that geothermal, whatever, like the minutiae of details that need to be paid attention to in these projects is why it's great to have engineers now answer that question for me.

1043
02:38:10,494 --> 02:38:11,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love that, sir.

1044
02:38:13,416 --> 02:38:14,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1045
02:38:14,776 --> 02:38:16,657
[SPEAKER_17]: So as it relates to kind of

1046
02:38:17,867 --> 02:38:22,570
[SPEAKER_17]: equipment being kind of obsolete over time and becoming obsolete over time.

1047
02:38:22,590 --> 02:38:30,155
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we are contemplating replacing is our 22, refrigerant 22 based equipment.

1048
02:38:30,355 --> 02:38:36,039
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's been installed since original construction in approximately 2001 to 2003.

1049
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:41,483
[SPEAKER_17]: It has worked for 15 to 20 years, depending on the piece of equipment you're looking at.

1050
02:38:42,504 --> 02:38:48,008
[SPEAKER_17]: Parts are, you know, for the most part still commercially available refrigerant has been phased out.

1051
02:38:48,488 --> 02:39:05,180
[SPEAKER_17]: So refrigerant is not really available or available in small quantities and so that kind of refrigerant phase out will continue as there are plans to continue, you know, lower, lowering the global warming potential of different refrigerants, and, you know, in.

1052
02:39:06,661 --> 02:39:11,345
[SPEAKER_17]: incorporating legislation that requires lower GWP refrigerants to be used.

1053
02:39:11,365 --> 02:39:18,652
[SPEAKER_17]: So in that case, proceeding today, there will be a certain refrigerant base of equipment that is available.

1054
02:39:20,234 --> 02:39:25,639
[SPEAKER_17]: And over time, the refrigerants may change, the requirements for refrigerants may change.

1055
02:39:26,099 --> 02:39:40,068
[SPEAKER_17]: So as it relates to other components of the system, there are compressors, which the technology has improved and evolved, but compressors, which were made 20 years ago are still replaceable today.

1056
02:39:41,689 --> 02:39:50,075
[SPEAKER_17]: There are control boards and other kind of micro electronics, which are integral parts of these machines.

1057
02:39:50,735 --> 02:39:52,336
[SPEAKER_17]: And these are probably the,

1058
02:39:53,900 --> 02:40:11,635
[SPEAKER_17]: most, I guess susceptible to Moore's law in the fact that technology advances related to control boards and PCBs and other types of microelectronics go much faster, other than, you know, compared to mechanical systems like compressor.

1059
02:40:14,676 --> 02:40:23,578
[SPEAKER_17]: equipment, which is reaching the near near the end of its life, which is widely considered to be 2015 to 20 years, depending on the piece of equipment.

1060
02:40:23,598 --> 02:40:34,381
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, will over its life necessitate various maintenance procedures, which would include upgrading or replacing control boards as they fail.

1061
02:40:34,901 --> 02:40:37,262
[SPEAKER_17]: So for the most part,

1062
02:40:39,022 --> 02:40:50,850
[SPEAKER_17]: control boards and other small components of these devices have been widely available for different pieces of mechanical machinery and HVAC equipment for a long time.

1063
02:40:51,430 --> 02:41:05,440
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, in other words, you can typically go out or one could typically go out and use a vendor to procure and install a replacement part through the life of the equipment, so for 15, 20 years.

1064
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:08,142
[SPEAKER_17]: And at that point, somewhere along the way,

1065
02:41:10,043 --> 02:41:21,929
[SPEAKER_17]: they will, and they being the manufacturers, will start to move on to newer generations of equipment and which they will stop making those parts and they would then be susceptible to Moore's Law.

1066
02:41:21,969 --> 02:41:25,290
[SPEAKER_17]: So somewhere in the 15 to 20 years is what I would expect.

1067
02:41:25,671 --> 02:41:31,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then will the, do you anticipate, I know nobody can see the future exactly, but do you anticipate there will be

1068
02:41:34,255 --> 02:41:37,720
[SPEAKER_08]: more climate friendly, more low carbon options.

1069
02:41:38,001 --> 02:41:38,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1070
02:41:38,662 --> 02:41:40,544
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's kind of what I want to anticipate.

1071
02:41:41,285 --> 02:41:46,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to be in a cycle of replacing things with what we have, just because it's the only thing available.

1072
02:41:46,843 --> 02:42:15,192
[SPEAKER_17]: And the manufacturers are certainly thinking about that too, because as they are kind of working towards lower GWP refrigerants and kind of continuing to manufacture their current market base or current offerings while looking at R&D and developing new offerings, they are saying, well, what happens when I have a refrigerant leak or one of my customers has a refrigerant leak on an old system or needs to repair?

1073
02:42:16,633 --> 02:42:21,517
[SPEAKER_17]: For example, R22 is not, for a number of reasons, is not desirable.

1074
02:42:22,037 --> 02:42:23,458
[SPEAKER_17]: So what would you do?

1075
02:42:23,959 --> 02:42:34,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Presently, there are options to drop in newer refrigerants into systems and they're being made in such a way that future refrigerants should be compatible.

1076
02:42:39,002 --> 02:42:39,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1077
02:42:39,342 --> 02:42:47,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you're answering my question about R22, which was that when we're done with this, there will be no more R22 in use at these two buildings.

1078
02:42:48,204 --> 02:42:48,884
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

1079
02:42:48,924 --> 02:42:49,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

1080
02:42:49,404 --> 02:42:50,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Best thing I've heard all night.

1081
02:42:51,725 --> 02:42:53,245
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true.

1082
02:42:53,305 --> 02:42:55,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Our stuff was good, but there's also more great stuff.

1083
02:42:56,306 --> 02:43:00,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to scroll up here.

1084
02:43:01,607 --> 02:43:06,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just renovated my kitchen, and I had to spend a fortune on power upgrade.

1085
02:43:07,796 --> 02:43:14,301
[SPEAKER_02]: which on scale probably is less than the $350,000 that we were talking about for a whole school.

1086
02:43:18,385 --> 02:43:25,170
[SPEAKER_02]: This is obviously a problem in probably every municipal building and school building in the country.

1087
02:43:26,751 --> 02:43:31,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything going on of interest around how this is funded?

1088
02:43:31,235 --> 02:43:34,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Because to think that every school building in the country will be able to pop

1089
02:43:36,315 --> 02:43:47,226
[SPEAKER_02]: a $350,000, right, a $350,000 check for electrical upgrades, that just doesn't seem like a scalable or, you know, we have Prop 2.5 in this state.

1090
02:43:47,326 --> 02:43:56,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no way every school building is ever going to be electric if everyone has to upgrade their, the do national grids bidding.

1091
02:43:56,134 --> 02:43:58,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we all look at our bills and

1092
02:43:59,087 --> 02:44:02,829
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we pay this much for electricity and this much for the delivery.

1093
02:44:02,869 --> 02:44:06,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's included in delivery if it doesn't include actually the infrastructure.

1094
02:44:07,351 --> 02:44:10,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this just the way it is right now?

1095
02:44:10,552 --> 02:44:13,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anybody looking at how to change that?

1096
02:44:15,314 --> 02:44:22,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this sort of like when I upgraded my panel at home, like 8,500 bucks just to install my new kitchen stove?

1097
02:44:23,718 --> 02:44:26,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what we're talking about?

1098
02:44:27,398 --> 02:44:29,822
[SPEAKER_17]: So there aren't.

1099
02:44:31,735 --> 02:44:39,680
[SPEAKER_17]: grant programs that I'm aware of right now, which are funding specifically service upgrades, unless it's rolled into a project.

1100
02:44:39,720 --> 02:44:45,364
[SPEAKER_17]: So if it's necessary for a project, presumably it could be contemplated subject to reviewing the rules.

1101
02:44:45,944 --> 02:45:00,574
[SPEAKER_17]: But for example, if a service upgrade was necessary to support a full electrification project that also qualified for the 30% direct pay payment, that it would need to be evaluated whether or not that cost could be covered by that incentive.

1102
02:45:01,889 --> 02:45:13,620
[SPEAKER_02]: When I did this upgrade at home, which nobody cares about my home projects, but one of the things I'm worried about is, in 20 years, is this going to be enough power in 20 years?

1103
02:45:14,061 --> 02:45:21,108
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we talk about these buildings and we spend $350,000 to upgrade the power, is that really enough power no matter what happens?

1104
02:45:21,818 --> 02:45:24,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are we going to potentially have to do this yet again?

1105
02:45:24,639 --> 02:45:34,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm sure that the power that's there now was big and powerful and a lot when the building was built, and far more than a building 50 years older.

1106
02:45:34,623 --> 02:45:41,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this just like we're on a treadmill of dumping tons of money to have more power come to buildings?

1107
02:45:42,166 --> 02:45:48,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does this feel like this would be an amount of power that nobody can imagine using at all kind of thing?

1108
02:45:49,870 --> 02:45:54,992
[SPEAKER_17]: It's, I think there are two elements to your question, which need to be considered.

1109
02:45:55,032 --> 02:45:55,873
[SPEAKER_17]: It's what's happening.

1110
02:45:56,293 --> 02:46:05,858
[SPEAKER_17]: If you look at it from what crosses the curb perspective, what's happening on Medford side of the curb and what's happening on the national grid or the utility side of the curb.

1111
02:46:05,938 --> 02:46:17,103
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there are costs associated with making the building capable of, I guess, accepting that level of demand or having that level of electric demand.

1112
02:46:17,824 --> 02:46:20,166
[SPEAKER_17]: So the 350,000 is for our side.

1113
02:46:20,947 --> 02:46:27,135
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure exactly where that number come came from, it might have actually been related to some grid upgrades to support the project.

1114
02:46:29,617 --> 02:46:32,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, the interconnection costs, yeah, yep.

1115
02:46:32,358 --> 02:46:35,138
[SPEAKER_17]: So related to the battery solar project, correct, yeah.

1116
02:46:35,558 --> 02:46:45,360
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's not even really the full service upgrade necessary to the building, switch gears and other electrical infrastructure in order to support a full electric.

1117
02:46:45,700 --> 02:46:47,300
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so that's not a big number.

1118
02:46:47,500 --> 02:46:48,901
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

1119
02:46:48,921 --> 02:46:56,722
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't need a lesson in electricity, because frankly, that's... And I don't have the numbers right in front of me, and Rhetta would know them right off the top of her head, because she's been

1120
02:46:58,447 --> 02:47:07,033
[SPEAKER_18]: The costs just on electrical upgrades to move for those three pieces of kitchen equipment have been extremely high.

1121
02:47:07,733 --> 02:47:07,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

1122
02:47:08,313 --> 02:47:17,359
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, but it's, it's the price we have to pay to move to a decarbonization, because we're moving to 480 volts.

1123
02:47:20,421 --> 02:47:30,707
[SPEAKER_18]: which then if that breaker trips requires a service call, because you're not supposed to just hit that because of the lethal amount of electricity moving through that breaker.

1124
02:47:32,928 --> 02:47:34,129
[SPEAKER_02]: A little flip in your kitchen.

1125
02:47:34,409 --> 02:47:36,930
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

1126
02:47:36,950 --> 02:47:37,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1127
02:47:37,290 --> 02:47:48,537
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I think I might actually just add that there we have been trying to poke at our I've been for a while we actually the mayor and I met with the Greater Boston Labor Council last summer.

1128
02:47:48,953 --> 02:47:52,194
[SPEAKER_14]: and the MAPC to start looking at grant opportunities.

1129
02:47:52,574 --> 02:47:58,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there opportunities for us to pull in federal money to help pay for some of these things?

1130
02:47:58,536 --> 02:48:06,698
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we've been trying to untangle is that the timelines for federal grants don't work for the work that we need to do in these schools right now.

1131
02:48:07,138 --> 02:48:15,540
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're continuing to try to see if we could set up some pockets of money that could really help with other projects, other big school projects.

1132
02:48:15,947 --> 02:48:25,895
[SPEAKER_14]: The difficulty is when you apply for a federal grant and a big grant, it usually opens for a window of time that's usually six weeks to 12 weeks, right?

1133
02:48:26,456 --> 02:48:37,345
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you have to get your application in, and then you often don't know that you've gotten the grant for six to eight to nine months, and then it takes four or five more months to actually access the money.

1134
02:48:37,745 --> 02:48:40,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, I am working through a Department of Energy grant.

1135
02:48:40,327 --> 02:48:42,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, Amanda Centrella in my office is.

1136
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:46,000
[SPEAKER_14]: We received an earmark a year ago.

1137
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:51,442
[SPEAKER_14]: We were told like a year ago in March that we were getting an earmark for Carr Park from the Department of Energy.

1138
02:48:52,102 --> 02:48:54,303
[SPEAKER_14]: We were offered the paperwork for it.

1139
02:48:54,343 --> 02:48:56,124
[SPEAKER_14]: So that we didn't even apply for that grant, right?

1140
02:48:56,144 --> 02:49:00,645
[SPEAKER_14]: We just asked and, you know, Representative Clark was got us the money.

1141
02:49:01,025 --> 02:49:03,126
[SPEAKER_14]: So we skipped the whole grant application portion.

1142
02:49:03,666 --> 02:49:07,768
[SPEAKER_14]: And this summer, we started working through the paperwork with them.

1143
02:49:08,268 --> 02:49:10,989
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are still working through the paperwork

1144
02:49:11,305 --> 02:49:14,726
[SPEAKER_14]: for the federal government to get approval to spend that.

1145
02:49:14,807 --> 02:49:22,210
[SPEAKER_14]: We are going to spend a full calendar year working through the paperwork to get the DOE money released so we can spend it.

1146
02:49:22,710 --> 02:49:25,631
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually there was some complications with it.

1147
02:49:25,931 --> 02:49:33,595
[SPEAKER_14]: And as a result, we're gonna flip around some of that DOE money will actually help pay for the solar array at the Andrews School and the ARPA money.

1148
02:49:33,635 --> 02:49:35,976
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought we were gonna, I was gonna ask for that.

1149
02:49:36,036 --> 02:49:40,858
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll put into the car park project because they can't pay for skate ramps.

1150
02:49:41,325 --> 02:49:46,468
[SPEAKER_14]: with DOE money, but they said, oh, you have another solar array in the city somewhere.

1151
02:49:46,928 --> 02:49:51,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes, that's part of the same project, because we don't want you to lose your federal earmark money.

1152
02:49:51,751 --> 02:49:58,356
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want you to understand, this is part of it, is the cumbersome and the long timelines.

1153
02:49:58,656 --> 02:50:02,858
[SPEAKER_14]: We need this project done now, and we can't wait for a federal grant to come in.

1154
02:50:03,239 --> 02:50:04,840
[SPEAKER_14]: That doesn't mean I'm not chasing them.

1155
02:50:05,220 --> 02:50:10,463
[SPEAKER_14]: It just means I don't think we're going to get them for this project because of the way these timelines work.

1156
02:50:10,796 --> 02:50:13,959
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted you to know that we're not not looking at them.

1157
02:50:14,299 --> 02:50:14,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1158
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:15,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

1159
02:50:16,181 --> 02:50:25,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to make a motion to approve the scope of work provided to us in this presentation and thank the team for being here.

1160
02:50:25,149 --> 02:50:28,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we had a lot of really long, painful questions.

1161
02:50:30,216 --> 02:50:44,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all for doing that, but I just wanted to formally approve from our perspective this project and ask that we get regular updates from the group as the process moves forward.

1162
02:50:44,423 --> 02:50:44,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

1163
02:50:45,043 --> 02:50:50,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Member Graham to approve the scope of this work, seconded by... He said it first.

1164
02:50:50,406 --> 02:50:50,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1165
02:50:50,606 --> 02:50:52,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

1166
02:50:52,887 --> 02:50:53,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call, please.

1167
02:50:55,728 --> 02:50:56,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1168
02:50:56,689 --> 02:50:57,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Branley.

1169
02:50:57,329 --> 02:50:57,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1170
02:50:58,589 --> 02:50:59,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

1171
02:50:59,330 --> 02:50:59,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1172
02:51:00,754 --> 02:51:01,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ntapa.

1173
02:51:02,697 --> 02:51:02,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1174
02:51:04,900 --> 02:51:05,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olapade.

1175
02:51:05,761 --> 02:51:06,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1176
02:51:06,682 --> 02:51:07,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rheinfeld.

1177
02:51:07,423 --> 02:51:07,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1178
02:51:08,084 --> 02:51:08,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Soyes.

1179
02:51:08,825 --> 02:51:09,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor Landau-Kirk.

1180
02:51:10,026 --> 02:51:10,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1181
02:51:10,847 --> 02:51:12,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1182
02:51:12,890 --> 02:51:13,912
[SPEAKER_06]: We approve the project.

1183
02:51:13,972 --> 02:51:15,714
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, thank you for all your hard work.

1184
02:51:16,089 --> 02:51:16,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1185
02:51:16,809 --> 02:51:17,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1186
02:51:17,329 --> 02:51:27,593
[SPEAKER_18]: The other last thing I'll just say as we move away from this is that we've been working to change out the lights to full LED throughout our buildings.

1187
02:51:27,653 --> 02:51:32,835
[SPEAKER_18]: We've even done some of that work, significant amount at Medford High School, because we're still running T12s there.

1188
02:51:33,896 --> 02:51:40,838
[SPEAKER_18]: And so even though that building will hopefully sunset in the future, the runway is long enough that it will pay off.

1189
02:51:40,858 --> 02:51:42,259
[SPEAKER_18]: We're using on-bill repayment.

1190
02:51:42,919 --> 02:51:47,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, the mistletoe in the Brooks of the last two schools that will get this treatment, and that will happen this summer.

1191
02:51:47,905 --> 02:51:48,706
[SPEAKER_18]: Just so that you're aware.

1192
02:51:49,166 --> 02:51:50,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr Cushing.

1193
02:51:50,348 --> 02:51:52,570
[SPEAKER_06]: We have number four suspension and discipline report.

1194
02:51:52,951 --> 02:51:54,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Dr Edward Vincent, Superintendent.

1195
02:51:58,206 --> 02:52:11,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, the report that I'm going to present right now is suspension data and discipline report, covering the dates of August 28 2023 through March 1 2024.

1196
02:52:20,959 --> 02:52:35,464
[SPEAKER_01]: In working on this project, this report, I had the opportunity to work with several district leaders, including school building leaders and staff when developing this report to have the context for its data.

1197
02:52:37,165 --> 02:52:46,008
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, we strove to ensure that the report doesn't convey identifying details about individual students.

1198
02:52:47,867 --> 02:52:58,690
[SPEAKER_01]: The disciplinary events which have been captured in this report cover a variety of incident types, student grade levels, and other relevant factors.

1199
02:53:04,031 --> 02:53:08,572
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, some of the suspensions are the result of pending felony charges.

1200
02:53:11,133 --> 02:53:16,114
[SPEAKER_01]: There are five official categories that the Medford Public Schools uses when addressing discipline.

1201
02:53:18,427 --> 02:53:26,853
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is behaviors that are violent, which could be exhibited through words or the possession of weaponry.

1202
02:53:28,314 --> 02:53:34,338
[SPEAKER_01]: The second category is behaviors or language or actions that are hostile.

1203
02:53:35,679 --> 02:53:54,472
[SPEAKER_01]: grounded in racist or discriminatory beliefs that contribute to an environment that is plagued by experiences of marginalization and equity for students based on their race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification, or other immutable characteristics.

1204
02:53:55,673 --> 02:54:11,135
[SPEAKER_01]: The third category is bullying or retaliatory conduct through words or acts that have the intent of bringing about an intimidating impact on other students.

1205
02:54:12,296 --> 02:54:22,942
[SPEAKER_01]: The fourth category is for students that have been found to be in possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia, or the intent to distribute drugs to other students.

1206
02:54:23,902 --> 02:54:40,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fifth category is repeated or pronounced disregard for the academic integrity of the school environment through tampering, cheating, plagiarism, or other misrepresentations with respect to their purported work product.

1207
02:54:42,648 --> 02:55:03,283
[SPEAKER_01]: In this report, there is also a category called other, which could include violations of social media rules, safety guidelines, such as posting photos without consent, false reporting to authority, forgery, trespassing, and again, as I mentioned earlier, felonies outside of school.

1208
02:55:09,605 --> 02:55:19,078
[SPEAKER_01]: The data that will be presented shows a variety of disciplinary actions, including suspension days taken in response to different behaviors or infractions.

1209
02:55:21,004 --> 02:55:29,548
[SPEAKER_01]: The data does reveal that students of color students with disabilities and English learners are suspended at a higher rate than their white counterparts.

1210
02:55:30,608 --> 02:55:41,153
[SPEAKER_01]: This information can help us identify patterns and how schools handle disciplinary cases and highlight areas where additional support or interventions could be beneficial.

1211
02:55:42,694 --> 02:55:57,086
[SPEAKER_01]: The data also highlights the importance and applicability of implementing effective behavior management strategies interventions and restorative justice to address and reduce the occurrence of negative behaviors in school.

1212
02:55:58,607 --> 02:56:21,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things that Medford Public Schools currently uses are detention, Saturday detention, social probation, warnings, behavioral plans, conferences with assistant principals, restorative tasks or meetings, and school recommending referrals for school and or community-based services.

1213
02:56:22,921 --> 02:56:29,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those strategies are currently deployed in the Medford public schools in lieu of suspension whenever possible.

1214
02:56:31,764 --> 02:56:44,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So overall, from the timeframe that I mentioned earlier, between the start of school and March 1, there were a total of 61 students that were suspended out of school.

1215
02:56:46,969 --> 02:56:52,575
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a total of 83 incidents, or 83 actual suspensions.

1216
02:56:53,016 --> 02:57:05,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is there are some students that were repeat offenders and we counted them more than once, but in terms of our entire student population.

1217
02:57:06,049 --> 02:57:17,035
[SPEAKER_01]: When we looked at our October Sims data, we had a total of 4,147 students district wide, and of those 4,147 students, 61 students were suspended over that timeframe, which is 1.47% of our entire population.

1218
02:57:34,975 --> 02:57:39,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I provide some historical data going back to school year 21, 22, 22, 23, and 23, 24.

1219
02:57:39,258 --> 02:57:49,446
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I will share is that of our 4,147 students total population, again, 61 students were suspended during the six and a half month timeframe, which equals 1.47.

1220
02:58:05,478 --> 02:58:07,119
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2223 school year, we had 4393 students.

1221
02:58:07,179 --> 02:58:11,123
[SPEAKER_01]: There were 89 students suspended during that time frame, which was a total of two per 2.03% of our population.

1222
02:58:23,494 --> 02:58:28,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the 21-22 school year, we had 4,353 students.

1223
02:58:29,758 --> 02:58:37,602
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 students were suspended over the course of that school year, which results in 2.07% of our population.

1224
02:58:37,622 --> 02:58:39,063
[SPEAKER_01]: In looking at the data,

1225
02:58:48,251 --> 02:59:00,322
[SPEAKER_01]: District-wide, over 50% of our behaviors fall in the category of violent or threatening behavior involving fighting.

1226
02:59:02,524 --> 02:59:08,649
[SPEAKER_01]: The second largest category at 15.7% is obscene language and profanity.

1227
02:59:15,543 --> 02:59:19,825
[SPEAKER_01]: The third category falls in what we refer to as other.

1228
02:59:20,485 --> 02:59:29,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, social media rules, violations of social media, safety guidelines, posting photos without consent, false reporting.

1229
02:59:31,014 --> 02:59:34,677
[SPEAKER_01]: forgery trespassing or felonies outside of school.

1230
02:59:36,038 --> 02:59:46,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next area that we are closely monitoring is illegal drugs and paraphernalia, which was 9.6% as a school entire school district.

1231
02:59:54,552 --> 03:00:08,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I share some data about our ethnicity, our EL suspensions, and our IEP suspensions, and it's data that we are closely monitoring.

1232
03:00:10,277 --> 03:00:22,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall district-wide, our Caucasian students, 36.1% have participated or had an out-of-school suspension.

1233
03:00:24,316 --> 03:00:34,987
[SPEAKER_01]: black African American students that's 24.6% Latino Hispanic students are 23% are Asian students are 6%, and then other which could be multi ethnic is 9.8%.

1234
03:00:48,433 --> 03:00:53,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, incident counts by grade level, as mentioned.

1235
03:00:57,160 --> 03:01:06,626
[SPEAKER_01]: At our middle schools, we had a total of 25 suspensions combined for both of our middle schools.

1236
03:01:07,367 --> 03:01:15,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Grade seven is the grade with the highest number of suspensions in both schools.

1237
03:01:16,113 --> 03:01:27,209
[SPEAKER_01]: At the high school level, there were 36 suspensions with grade nine and grade 10 students making up the bulk of those suspensions.

1238
03:01:31,773 --> 03:01:42,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the 25 middle school students, 14 students did attend the Andrews Middle School, and 11 students attended the McGlynn School.

1239
03:01:43,022 --> 03:01:57,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And due to FERPA guidelines, it dictates that we honor student confidentiality by not disclosing more information about these incidents that might make certain student populations identifiable.

1240
03:02:01,201 --> 03:02:21,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, of the 25 suspensions at the middle school level, we had approximately 976 referrals, which resulted in a total of 41 suspensions.

1241
03:02:21,748 --> 03:02:30,431
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, there were some students that have been suspended more than once because they were a repeat offender.

1242
03:02:32,071 --> 03:02:40,638
[SPEAKER_01]: At the high school level, we had 2,599 referrals that were made during the timeframe.

1243
03:02:41,899 --> 03:02:47,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Of that timeframe, there were 42 suspensions involving 36 students.

1244
03:02:49,425 --> 03:02:53,368
[SPEAKER_01]: There were eight incidents where the police were notified.

1245
03:02:54,568 --> 03:02:55,449
[SPEAKER_01]: And again,

1246
03:02:57,648 --> 03:03:11,856
[SPEAKER_01]: referring to the behaviors at the high school level, the majority of behaviors, 52% were involving violent or threatening behavior.

1247
03:03:13,803 --> 03:03:27,967
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second largest area 19% was obscene language or profanity, which was the second largest category at the high school level and other 16.7% other.

1248
03:03:35,655 --> 03:03:47,041
[SPEAKER_01]: At the elementary levels during the timeframe that we were monitoring, there was no data because there were no suspensions.

1249
03:03:49,102 --> 03:03:50,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So our key findings.

1250
03:03:51,483 --> 03:03:54,345
[SPEAKER_01]: In summary, there were 61 students out of 4,147 students that were suspended.

1251
03:04:00,071 --> 03:04:04,653
[SPEAKER_01]: which again equals 1.47% of our student population.

1252
03:04:05,333 --> 03:04:14,596
[SPEAKER_01]: We are truly committed to carefully reviewing our suspension data with the goal to continue to address discipline and employ alternatives to suspension.

1253
03:04:16,317 --> 03:04:25,180
[SPEAKER_01]: District-wide, we noticed that 50% of behaviors that result in suspensions fall under violent or threatening behavior.

1254
03:04:26,835 --> 03:04:32,256
[SPEAKER_01]: written verbal physical threats along with physical fights are included in that category.

1255
03:04:34,096 --> 03:04:45,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Nearly 16% of suspensions involve obscene language and profanity, which includes racial or discriminatory language.

1256
03:04:45,439 --> 03:04:52,280
[SPEAKER_01]: 13% falls in the other category, which includes violating social media rules and safety guidelines.

1257
03:04:54,770 --> 03:05:03,176
[SPEAKER_01]: At the high school again, in particular, 52% of behaviors that resulted in suspension fell under violent or threatening behavior.

1258
03:05:03,196 --> 03:05:10,581
[SPEAKER_01]: 19% of those suspensions fall within the obscene language and profanity category.

1259
03:05:10,601 --> 03:05:16,145
[SPEAKER_01]: And 16.7% fell in the other category.

1260
03:05:17,366 --> 03:05:18,246
[SPEAKER_01]: At the middle schools,

1261
03:05:19,941 --> 03:05:29,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Nearly 50% 48.8% of behaviors that resulted in suspensions in middle schools fall under violent or threatening behavior.

1262
03:05:31,428 --> 03:05:41,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Another concern for the district is that 17.1% of the suspensions involved at the middle school level were related to drugs and drug paraphernalia.

1263
03:05:42,214 --> 03:05:44,235
[SPEAKER_01]: This was seen across both middle schools.

1264
03:05:44,995 --> 03:05:48,858
[SPEAKER_01]: We are collaborating with our school counselors and social workers.

1265
03:05:49,958 --> 03:06:05,039
[SPEAKER_01]: In collaboration with Mr she Shulman, our director of school counseling and behavioral health to address this set of student behaviors 12% of the suspensions involved obscene language and profanity.

1266
03:06:06,129 --> 03:06:20,618
[SPEAKER_01]: In this area as well, we are working on providing students with effective tools to better express themselves without the use of obscene language or using violent or threatening behavior.

1267
03:06:22,279 --> 03:06:25,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Suspension is used as a last resort at all levels.

1268
03:06:26,321 --> 03:06:28,683
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, due to FERPA requirements,

1269
03:06:29,790 --> 03:06:40,255
[SPEAKER_01]: In the limited number of suspensions, the district did not identify any specific school due to our varied populations and their various needs.

1270
03:06:41,895 --> 03:06:42,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Actions.

1271
03:06:44,116 --> 03:06:52,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of school suspension and other ways that Medford Public Schools addresses student behavior do include Saturday detention.

1272
03:06:53,717 --> 03:06:56,419
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for the high school, at the high school level.

1273
03:06:57,200 --> 03:07:02,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Increased parental involvement, conferences, phone calls, et cetera.

1274
03:07:03,984 --> 03:07:13,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Detention, student counseling, social work support, meetings with building administrators, principals, assistant principals, et cetera.

1275
03:07:14,632 --> 03:07:22,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Referral to and coordination with community-based mental health care and substance abuse treatment.

1276
03:07:23,058 --> 03:07:38,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the things that I mentioned earlier do require significant involvement and support from our community based partners to provide our students with additional mental health care and substance abuse treatment.

1277
03:07:40,334 --> 03:07:50,199
[SPEAKER_01]: There were requests for additional follow up information and I did provide that to the committee about onboarding and training.

1278
03:07:51,440 --> 03:07:57,503
[SPEAKER_01]: The August Institute for administrators and staff are trained.

1279
03:07:58,884 --> 03:08:13,159
[SPEAKER_01]: through principal meetings ongoing throughout the year where they address at school based levels disciplinary challenges and issues that arise in each school on different levels and strategies

1280
03:08:13,659 --> 03:08:23,784
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be used to help our students on November 7, all staff participated in a bullying training, which touched upon discipline.

1281
03:08:23,804 --> 03:08:28,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the first weeks of six weeks of school our educators.

1282
03:08:29,426 --> 03:08:39,236
[SPEAKER_01]: at elementary levels and our teachers at the secondary level set rules and expectations for behaviors for the entire year.

1283
03:08:40,257 --> 03:08:52,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Students participate in morning meeting, nexus classes, and advisory classes at the secondary level to incorporate self-strategies to support our students.

1284
03:08:55,249 --> 03:09:02,335
[SPEAKER_01]: We, again for the purposes of this report suspension is referring to out of school suspensions.

1285
03:09:05,138 --> 03:09:10,122
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a request for additional data, which was provided in the three year historical data.

1286
03:09:11,603 --> 03:09:14,344
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a question about police involvement.

1287
03:09:15,424 --> 03:09:20,126
[SPEAKER_01]: The principals do collaborate with the school resource officer, SROs.

1288
03:09:21,046 --> 03:09:27,088
[SPEAKER_01]: The SROs help to determine if additional police support is needed in any given situation.

1289
03:09:27,988 --> 03:09:37,031
[SPEAKER_01]: There were eight incidents during the timeframe that was documented where the police were notified to provide additional support.

1290
03:09:38,251 --> 03:09:43,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Please note that police involvement also takes place after school hours, and on the weekends.

1291
03:09:44,776 --> 03:09:50,280
[SPEAKER_01]: In those circumstances, we do not notify the police, the police notify the district.

1292
03:09:51,798 --> 03:09:54,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Since our students are juveniles, their rights are protected.

1293
03:09:55,919 --> 03:10:05,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to ongoing investigations that may involve court matters, the school district has no further comment regarding police involvement.

1294
03:10:06,822 --> 03:10:18,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I provided some data about Saturday detentions and parent conferences, parent phone calls, detentions and conferences that are set up.

1295
03:10:19,205 --> 03:10:35,813
[SPEAKER_01]: All discipline referrals are taken seriously and investigated, while some may require a simple conversation with a student or teacher, other referrals may lead to deeper inquiry.

1296
03:10:37,274 --> 03:10:42,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And revisions were made to the charts to make sure that the colors were aligned.

1297
03:10:43,437 --> 03:10:45,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is my report for this evening.

1298
03:10:50,629 --> 03:10:52,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions member Bramley?

1299
03:10:55,270 --> 03:11:03,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have to say nothing makes me happier than to see this because I feel like there's actually accountability happening and nothing makes me happier than that.

1300
03:11:03,212 --> 03:11:06,192
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate the report.

1301
03:11:06,992 --> 03:11:12,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy that we're still using out of school suspension and I'm happy that it's a last result.

1302
03:11:13,334 --> 03:11:15,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's important that it's not off the table.

1303
03:11:18,155 --> 03:11:19,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I think overall,

1304
03:11:21,337 --> 03:11:24,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a staggering number of referrals.

1305
03:11:25,680 --> 03:11:26,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And that makes me feel sad.

1306
03:11:26,821 --> 03:11:35,168
[SPEAKER_07]: 2599 just at the high school alone, that is a significant amount of work for staff, especially teachers.

1307
03:11:37,810 --> 03:11:43,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just want to applaud them for, for their due diligence all the time.

1308
03:11:43,355 --> 03:11:44,416
[SPEAKER_07]: It's I'm always

1309
03:11:45,479 --> 03:11:46,800
[SPEAKER_07]: amazed by it.

1310
03:11:47,281 --> 03:11:57,888
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just the follow up between the houses and everybody working collaboratively to make sure that this work is getting done, I think is something that has been needed.

1311
03:11:59,049 --> 03:12:03,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm happy that it's coming to fruition here.

1312
03:12:03,252 --> 03:12:03,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

1313
03:12:05,254 --> 03:12:06,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Brindley.

1314
03:12:07,796 --> 03:12:13,400
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to move on to number five, rate card by Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent.

1315
03:12:15,708 --> 03:12:16,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Break card.

1316
03:12:17,716 --> 03:12:18,399
[SPEAKER_05]: You're up, sorry.

1317
03:12:34,644 --> 03:12:35,665
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize.

1318
03:12:36,265 --> 03:12:38,285
[SPEAKER_18]: So tonight we're presenting right card.

1319
03:12:38,705 --> 03:12:40,226
[SPEAKER_18]: It has a lot of numbers in there.

1320
03:12:40,706 --> 03:12:58,131
[SPEAKER_18]: We're asking for two specific areas of approval, and that's on the facilities rates, which have not increased since 2016 I did a comprehensive analysis, looking at a number of surrounding districts, and we're pretty much in the area that we need to be.

1321
03:12:59,691 --> 03:13:00,232
[SPEAKER_18]: I also.

1322
03:13:03,863 --> 03:13:13,707
[SPEAKER_18]: have not included the personnel costs, as we're still working through some of those things, and we'll need to come back to this body to look at those as we move forward.

1323
03:13:14,567 --> 03:13:18,069
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're also looking at increasing our pool usage fees.

1324
03:13:19,169 --> 03:13:25,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of which went up last year in a modest amount for swim lessons.

1325
03:13:26,235 --> 03:13:37,925
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've done research on that with surrounding pools, most notably the pool parties for kids birthdays, which just don't cover our costs.

1326
03:13:39,186 --> 03:13:43,188
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why there's such a substantial increase on the birthday parties.

1327
03:13:44,148 --> 03:13:54,472
[SPEAKER_18]: But when you compare it to a goldfish, I believe that their numbers are in the $600 to $700 range for the same timeframe.

1328
03:13:55,293 --> 03:14:00,335
[SPEAKER_18]: And it really doesn't include much of anything more than we're providing.

1329
03:14:01,840 --> 03:14:09,765
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy to answer any questions, but it's a 10% bump over our fees for our facilities rate card.

1330
03:14:11,046 --> 03:14:19,772
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't offhand remember the percentage for the pool, but it's to move us to a more solvent and operating in the black when it comes to the pool.

1331
03:14:26,176 --> 03:14:26,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rossell.

1332
03:14:27,197 --> 03:14:28,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1333
03:14:28,057 --> 03:14:28,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate this.

1334
03:14:30,094 --> 03:14:31,675
[SPEAKER_02]: the rate card format very much.

1335
03:14:33,256 --> 03:14:34,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did the 10% come from?

1336
03:14:34,697 --> 03:14:45,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I just threw those numbers into a couple of different intra-inflation calculators or compounding at 2.5% like we can do for increases in our property taxes here.

1337
03:14:45,603 --> 03:14:49,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And I come up to a number of much bigger than 440.

1338
03:14:49,825 --> 03:14:54,128
[SPEAKER_02]: As an example, the elementary school gyms in FY16 for

1339
03:14:57,162 --> 03:15:08,194
[SPEAKER_02]: The four category I actually don't have a category differences, the 400 would actually be $520 and you know we're not swimming in cash so.

1340
03:15:10,056 --> 03:15:10,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just pick the 10%.

1341
03:15:11,638 --> 03:15:17,921
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I looked at was over the eight years and realizing that we hadn't had one.

1342
03:15:18,001 --> 03:15:23,124
[SPEAKER_18]: So the 10% was selected in comparison looking at neighboring districts.

1343
03:15:23,745 --> 03:15:30,348
[SPEAKER_18]: I also included in your packet a facilities rental agreement that has the category spelled out.

1344
03:15:31,509 --> 03:15:34,210
[SPEAKER_18]: But trust me, I think that's like 13 pages long.

1345
03:15:34,490 --> 03:15:35,851
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can totally understand.

1346
03:15:37,672 --> 03:15:41,915
[SPEAKER_18]: The 10% was to look at we haven't increased in a number of years.

1347
03:15:42,756 --> 03:15:50,001
[SPEAKER_18]: And what number presenting this in April, late April, is going to not scare away our renters.

1348
03:15:50,962 --> 03:16:01,490
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been sensitizing our renters to increases in fees, and really trying to make sure that they understand the personnel costs

1349
03:16:02,170 --> 03:16:17,249
[SPEAKER_18]: that are separate from the facility use fees so that $200 or whatever it is for using a gym for a period of hours still carries with it a $65 per hour charge for custodial.

1350
03:16:18,015 --> 03:16:23,177
[SPEAKER_18]: and in certain instances, not all instances, a $50 fee.

1351
03:16:23,617 --> 03:16:33,241
[SPEAKER_18]: So just before you even get to the facility fee, in many instances, it'll be $115 an hour just to open the doors with a four-hour minimum.

1352
03:16:34,162 --> 03:16:35,162
[SPEAKER_18]: Wonderful, thank you.

1353
03:16:35,202 --> 03:16:37,363
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my next question, but you answered it.

1354
03:16:37,603 --> 03:16:40,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1355
03:16:40,905 --> 03:16:42,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion for approval?

1356
03:16:42,305 --> 03:16:46,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Or member, I'm sorry, this is just to approve the pool

1357
03:16:47,447 --> 03:16:48,508
[SPEAKER_18]: This is pool and facilities.

1358
03:16:48,708 --> 03:16:52,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Other members of our team, we're still doing work around these.

1359
03:16:52,349 --> 03:16:56,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some questions about the athletics and theater, but that's still under discussion.

1360
03:16:56,351 --> 03:16:57,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see that at another point.

1361
03:16:57,772 --> 03:17:00,053
[SPEAKER_18]: It is still in discussion and we'll be seeing another point.

1362
03:17:00,613 --> 03:17:00,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1363
03:17:00,813 --> 03:17:01,293
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1364
03:17:01,413 --> 03:17:02,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll motion to approve.

1365

1367
03:17:07,356 --> 03:17:13,418
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'll look to present this in the future in the February, March timeframe on an annual basis.

1368
03:17:14,119 --> 03:17:14,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1369
03:17:14,639 --> 03:17:14,999

03:20:49,738 --> 03:20:50,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1476
03:20:50,499 --> 03:21:03,768
[SPEAKER_06]: 2024-22, offered by Member Graham, be resolved that the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee will meet to discuss whether the Curtis test should be co-located with the Medford High School campus to approve educational outcomes

1477
03:21:04,258 --> 03:21:05,559
[SPEAKER_06]: for Curtis Tufts students.

1478
03:21:06,139 --> 03:21:11,041
[SPEAKER_06]: We had further resolved that the subcommittee will invite current and former students and staff to provide comment.

1479
03:21:11,621 --> 03:21:27,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It also resolved that the committee will report back to the school committee on whether the Curtis Tufts program should be co-located no later than June 3rd, 2024, because this information is critical to the progress of the Metro Comprehensive High School Building Committee as it completes the district's educational profile.

1480
03:21:28,692 --> 03:21:30,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham and then Member Bramley.

1481
03:21:30,553 --> 03:21:30,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1482
03:21:31,734 --> 03:21:46,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I put this on and would love for the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee to explore this in a little bit more detail to provide some input to the MSBA committee that gets going tomorrow evening.

1483
03:21:47,546 --> 03:21:50,668
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously the conversation around

1484
03:21:51,363 --> 03:21:54,805
[SPEAKER_11]: What the students at Curtis Tufts need is an important one.

1485
03:21:54,885 --> 03:22:01,649
[SPEAKER_11]: There's lots of things that they just simply can't participate in in the current structure because they are clear across town.

1486
03:22:02,669 --> 03:22:05,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's lots of options from a building perspective to

1487
03:22:07,065 --> 03:22:11,508
[SPEAKER_11]: bring them onto campus in a way that still works for the students in that program.

1488
03:22:11,568 --> 03:22:30,460
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, you know, for example, um, we, we have lots, we have an endless number of options because nothing has been decided yet, but what we do need to do in short order is help MSBA understand our scope intentions so that when we get to the point of talking about like, is it a separate building?

1489
03:22:30,540 --> 03:22:31,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a separate entrance?

1490
03:22:31,661 --> 03:22:32,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a,

1491
03:22:33,374 --> 03:22:36,756
[SPEAKER_11]: stacked building, you know, there's a million choices and options.

1492
03:22:36,816 --> 03:22:44,420
[SPEAKER_11]: But the first thing that we have to do is describe the educational programming that we intend to happen on the campus.

1493
03:22:45,541 --> 03:22:54,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And so when we think about the Curtis Tufts, that building obviously is its own historic dinosaur, we'll call it lovingly.

1494
03:22:55,446 --> 03:22:58,568
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is its own sort of facilities challenge.

1495
03:22:59,048 --> 03:23:00,089
[SPEAKER_11]: But more importantly,

1496
03:23:01,388 --> 03:23:22,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to hear from the teachers and the students in that program or who have graduated, you know, about their thoughts and reactions about whether this is something that we should pursue, knowing that we're five to seven years away from any of this really being able to materialize because the current building we know is not suitable for the work that happens at Curtis Tufts.

1497
03:23:22,884 --> 03:23:28,508
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're talking about the future here and we need to talk about that.

1498
03:23:29,994 --> 03:23:38,164
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, in an important way, because if we don't provide for it now it's it's off the table and can't be designed for and plan for so.

1499
03:23:39,236 --> 03:23:43,779
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping that the special education subcommittee can move quickly to sort of convene folks.

1500
03:23:44,079 --> 03:23:47,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Lori Hodgkin is obviously a non-voting member of the school building committee.

1501
03:23:48,561 --> 03:23:57,226
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working with the superintendent and Joan Bowen, and they are aware that this is coming and that this is the dialogue we're looking to have.

1502
03:23:58,307 --> 03:24:03,030
[SPEAKER_11]: But that is sort of a matter for the school committee to be thinking about as well as the building committee.

1503
03:24:03,690 --> 03:24:20,758
[SPEAKER_11]: we really just need to sort of move that ball forward so that before summer there's some clarity there because that will hold up the rest of our application and it's my goal for us to be able to move quickly enough that those pieces of the application are completed by June 30.

1504
03:24:21,658 --> 03:24:21,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1505
03:24:22,298 --> 03:24:26,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you Member Graham, Member Branley, then Member Ntapa and then Member Rousseau.

1506
03:24:27,421 --> 03:24:32,203
[SPEAKER_07]: So as someone who works in special ed in Somerville, I had spoken to our

1507
03:24:33,151 --> 03:24:36,973
[SPEAKER_07]: department head over at our alternative school in Somerville.

1508
03:24:37,414 --> 03:24:38,614
[SPEAKER_07]: He was nice enough to join us tonight.

1509
03:24:38,654 --> 03:24:42,197
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if it would be, I know it would be beneficial to hear from him.

1510
03:24:43,557 --> 03:24:51,522
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know also if it would be good for him to come to some of those other meetings, Medford resident, and I don't know how much he wants to disclose of him.

1511
03:24:51,883 --> 03:24:59,267
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll let him disclose what he'd like to about himself, but I respect his opinion and his work ethic.

1512
03:25:00,268 --> 03:25:01,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to throw that out there.

1513
03:25:03,297 --> 03:25:08,318
[SPEAKER_11]: And then subcommittee could be open to public, so definitely welcome.

1514
03:25:09,378 --> 03:25:11,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Joppa, and then if you'd like to speak.

1515
03:25:14,880 --> 03:25:15,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sorry.

1516
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:19,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick question of clarification in the motion.

1517
03:25:19,261 --> 03:25:23,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Graham, for putting this forward, for seeing this.

1518
03:25:23,962 --> 03:25:30,323
[SPEAKER_03]: So should we motion to amend to invite current and former, also parents, guardians, caregivers as well?

1519
03:25:31,325 --> 03:25:33,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be something we need to do or should?

1520
03:25:34,026 --> 03:25:43,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I feel like we should as well for students and staff, but I'm not sure if it's implied in the motion already, if that is the case, but figured I would put that out there.

1521
03:25:44,848 --> 03:25:45,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, member and topper.

1522
03:25:45,689 --> 03:25:55,671
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little difficult to hear you, but I think you mentioned inviting parents and yes, this will be an open public meeting where anybody can come and give feedback.

1523
03:25:56,371 --> 03:25:58,512
[SPEAKER_06]: So it will be open to parents, of course.

1524
03:25:59,426 --> 03:25:59,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, awesome.

1525
03:25:59,966 --> 03:26:00,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1526
03:26:00,527 --> 03:26:08,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was a it was an open meeting, but I wanted to make sure that the formal invitation was sent to them as well, along with their students, but sorry if it's hard to hear me.

1527
03:26:10,954 --> 03:26:12,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Rousseau.

1528
03:26:12,455 --> 03:26:14,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

1529
03:26:14,216 --> 03:26:18,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it's important to figure out how we invite people is is a challenge.

1530
03:26:18,419 --> 03:26:19,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And then scheduling becomes a challenge.

1531
03:26:19,960 --> 03:26:21,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So more people we add to the list.

1532
03:26:22,161 --> 03:26:25,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the past, we've said we really wanted to hear from principals on something.

1533
03:26:26,308 --> 03:26:28,329
[SPEAKER_02]: then we needed to make sure principals could be there.

1534
03:26:29,610 --> 03:26:43,359
[SPEAKER_02]: It is open so everybody can come, but I think figuring out how to tailor the people that I'm gonna try to reach out to so that it's not going to be November before we can hold the meeting, it's a battle.

1535
03:26:44,299 --> 03:26:49,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And some groups of people will be people that I will have, none of us will have any way to actually contact them.

1536
03:26:49,702 --> 03:26:52,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really hopeful somebody will be able to tell us how we can get ahold of former students.

1537
03:26:56,570 --> 03:26:57,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Joan's shaking her head.

1538
03:26:57,710 --> 03:26:59,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that means she has some way to do that.

1539
03:26:59,671 --> 03:27:01,031
[SPEAKER_02]: She does good, it makes me feel better.

1540
03:27:02,411 --> 03:27:18,476
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so I hope to hear from lots of different people who have a relationship to the Curtis Tufts past and present, because we do have a very important question to answer here and the timeline is not on our side, unfortunately.

1541
03:27:18,636 --> 03:27:23,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I'm not a fan of rushing anything, but yeah.

1542
03:27:24,631 --> 03:27:26,593
[SPEAKER_02]: would have a choice here, so thank you.

1543
03:27:27,154 --> 03:27:29,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd make a motion to approve, although I don't know.

1544
03:27:29,676 --> 03:27:32,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we have a resident that'd like to say a few words.

1545
03:27:34,541 --> 03:27:35,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the mic on?

1546
03:27:35,201 --> 03:27:35,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1547
03:27:36,943 --> 03:27:37,884
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I'm Jack Haverty.

1548
03:27:38,184 --> 03:27:39,545
[SPEAKER_16]: I live in Waterville Road.

1549
03:27:40,026 --> 03:27:42,247
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been an educator for 18 years.

1550
03:27:42,327 --> 03:27:48,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Last eight years, I've been the assistant principal at Next Wave Full Circle, which is Somerville's alternative therapeutic school.

1551
03:27:50,092 --> 03:28:04,161
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel uniquely qualified to talk about this because we just went through the process of going from the Edgeley, which was our oldest building in the district, to going into Somerville High School and being incorporated into the same community as Somerville High School.

1552
03:28:05,663 --> 03:28:09,189
[SPEAKER_16]: just happens to be kind of the same situation that is going on in Medford.

1553
03:28:10,230 --> 03:28:16,581
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would say that there are pros and cons to being in the same space but the pros vastly outweigh the cons.

1554
03:28:18,519 --> 03:28:25,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Since we have transitioned from the Edgeley to Somerville High School, we've gone from 60 students to over 90 with a wait list.

1555
03:28:26,146 --> 03:28:39,219
[SPEAKER_16]: None of those 90 students or all of those 90 students have asked to be at our program and none of them have been told to go to that program because we're able to onboard them with visits, which are much easier when you're in the same building.

1556
03:28:39,580 --> 03:28:41,581
[SPEAKER_16]: They're much easier when you know the staff, the kids.

1557
03:28:42,663 --> 03:28:52,053
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pretty much impossible to have in really really old building and a really really beautiful building and tell somebody that yeah your kids going to this building and it's the same, but it's not.

1558
03:28:53,815 --> 03:28:54,756
[SPEAKER_16]: In my opinion, if you.

1559
03:28:56,018 --> 03:29:07,627
[SPEAKER_16]: decide to redo Medford High School, which you have, and you decide not to incorporate Curtis Tufts, you are making a conscious choice not to invest in alternative therapeutic learning.

1560
03:29:09,109 --> 03:29:22,480
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would say, listening to 2,500 conduct referrals, a vast majority of those, I presume, are from cutting class, and a vast majority of those, I bet, are from a small percentage of students who are continually cutting class.

1561
03:29:23,820 --> 03:29:40,225
[SPEAKER_16]: In my experience, I've realized that between five and 10% of students that are in the same percentage of high needs that Medford has need a substantially different avenue to do school.

1562
03:29:41,366 --> 03:29:47,948
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that's where you see 2,500 referrals from probably 50 kids that continually cut.

1563
03:29:49,228 --> 03:29:50,789
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd be happy to

1564
03:29:52,130 --> 03:30:00,952
[SPEAKER_16]: go through the details, but it's late and I know you guys listened to an hour of HVAC, so happy to answer any questions too.

1565
03:30:01,012 --> 03:30:14,596
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it and maybe a list of pros even, whether that's emailed to the committee, if you can't make it another night or having that ready to speak on the record for next time, a good list of pros and cons would be helpful for us.

1566
03:30:14,756 --> 03:30:16,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

1567
03:30:16,936 --> 03:30:19,997
[SPEAKER_11]: I would definitely love for you, I'm not on this subcommittee,

1568
03:30:21,067 --> 03:30:26,829
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will be listening in, but I'm delighted to not have my calendar bottleneck you further, because it's a mess.

1569
03:30:26,889 --> 03:30:35,812
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you can plan to attend that subcommittee meeting, where the point of that subcommittee really is to dive into exactly what you said.

1570
03:30:36,532 --> 03:30:49,456
[SPEAKER_11]: We brought this forward for exactly the reason that you described, which is you can't build a beautiful new building and then ask some small number of students to go to a 100-year-old building

1571
03:30:50,708 --> 03:30:51,028
[SPEAKER_11]: floor.

1572
03:30:52,250 --> 03:30:53,391
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's real.

1573
03:30:53,612 --> 03:31:09,212
[SPEAKER_11]: So, at the same time though, the needs that we need to sort of care for for those students to thrive are uniquely different and we need to inform our application documents to make sure that we're

1574
03:31:09,927 --> 03:31:14,629
[SPEAKER_11]: accurately describing what those needs are so that we can have the best of both worlds.

1575
03:31:14,669 --> 03:31:22,013
[SPEAKER_11]: So certainly, I'm open if the committee comes back and says, no, no, no, this is absolutely a horrible, horrible idea, that's fine.

1576
03:31:22,073 --> 03:31:37,661
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think more than likely, the subcommittee is going to come back and say, this is an idea we should pursue, but it has to have these qualifiers to what we submit so that we can really meet all of those pros and cons where they're at and the students.

1577
03:31:38,573 --> 03:31:42,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love for you to be part of members of the subcommittee.

1578
03:31:47,719 --> 03:31:48,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you for being here.

1579
03:31:48,840 --> 03:31:49,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for waiting this long.

1580
03:31:50,501 --> 03:31:54,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I probably should have done baseball practice and then come, but... Sorry, Jack.

1581
03:31:55,103 --> 03:31:55,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1582
03:31:55,624 --> 03:32:06,150
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing I would say, better than answering any questions or my input would actually be if any of you want to come visit Next Wave Full Circle and see our wing.

1583
03:32:06,210 --> 03:32:09,212
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have our own entrance at the Gilman Street train.

1584
03:32:10,052 --> 03:32:10,773
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be great.

1585
03:32:11,213 --> 03:32:15,235
[SPEAKER_16]: It'd be more enlightening than asking any questions and answering them, I think.

1586
03:32:15,255 --> 03:32:16,396
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be great, yeah.

1587
03:32:17,418 --> 03:32:18,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

1588
03:32:18,118 --> 03:32:18,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1589
03:32:19,119 --> 03:32:27,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you find the students are partaking in theater and sports as well, where we don't really see that because it's so separated?

1590
03:32:28,122 --> 03:32:37,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, for the first time, we have tons of our freshmen going through exploratory, which I don't know if you call it exploratory in Medford, but the rotation.

1591
03:32:37,685 --> 03:32:39,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of our kids are captains of the sports teams now.

1592
03:32:41,166 --> 03:32:42,827
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes a massive impact.

1593
03:32:42,987 --> 03:32:44,807
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

1594
03:32:45,207 --> 03:32:45,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1595
03:32:45,988 --> 03:32:46,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being here.

1596
03:32:50,140 --> 03:32:51,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have motion to approve that.

1597
03:32:52,141 --> 03:32:54,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by second.

1598
03:32:54,981 --> 03:32:55,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1599
03:32:57,902 --> 03:32:58,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1600
03:32:58,182 --> 03:32:59,062
[SPEAKER_07]: We all want to second this.

1601
03:32:59,102 --> 03:32:59,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go.

1602
03:33:00,523 --> 03:33:02,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld said it first.

1619
03:33:22,463 --> 03:33:24,184
[SPEAKER_07]: He calls with chaos and I'm freaking out.

1620
03:33:24,384 --> 03:33:26,966
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, so I'm like, okay, check.

[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to speak, Member Reinfeld?

1629
03:34:11,974 --> 03:34:14,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to answer questions, but it's late.

1630
03:34:14,295 --> 03:34:17,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, we've had a lot of new curricula come on in the district.

1631
03:34:18,876 --> 03:34:30,919
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a pretty robust process for introducing the curricula and also our top goal or the number one on our strategic plan is to develop this cycle, so I'd like to get that process moving.

1632
03:34:31,299 --> 03:34:31,640

03:35:28,102 --> 03:35:30,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 70 affirmatives are in the negative motion passes.

1670
03:35:33,547 --> 03:35:34,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve 2024 dash 24.

1671
03:35:37,334 --> 03:36:02,575
[SPEAKER_06]: May I, before we move approval, motion for approval by Member Graham, before we move approval, is there, I know John McLaughlin isn't here tonight, but somebody from the administration, just say if this is feasible, how many things would be coming before us, or even maybe if any of the three that have the resolution before us, is this gonna be, I'm just trying to conceptualize how many,

1672
03:36:03,885 --> 03:36:04,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure how that's going to be managed.

1673
03:36:04,966 --> 03:36:09,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that purchases or updates or upgrades would be coming before us each meeting and how that's going to be manageable.

1674
03:36:10,529 --> 03:36:11,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

1675
03:36:11,489 --> 03:36:23,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly I did try to think about that in the wording because, uh, we don't want to have like 15 emergency meetings a year just to approve the purchase of something I did not include, um.

1676
03:36:31,755 --> 03:36:38,145
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if we replace any of our equipment that way so I mean, this is really aimed at big equipment.

1677
03:36:38,506 --> 03:36:40,229
[SPEAKER_02]: This, I mean, I don't know.

1678
03:36:41,210 --> 03:36:42,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Smith is not here anymore.

1679
03:36:43,514 --> 03:36:43,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky her.

1680
03:36:46,872 --> 03:36:50,334
[SPEAKER_02]: this equipment that is not actually functional at this point.

1681
03:36:50,514 --> 03:36:53,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think she ordered it and it was there a week later.

1682
03:36:54,577 --> 03:37:00,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of this HVAC equipment, I mean, we heard, what was that, 32 weeks or something crazy for the lead time.

1683
03:37:00,781 --> 03:37:06,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't envision this as something that is going to actually gum up the works at all.

1684
03:37:06,124 --> 03:37:08,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a FYI.

1685
03:37:08,406 --> 03:37:12,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's only FYI if it needs to be a fossil fuel-based equipment.

1686
03:37:12,809 --> 03:37:16,311
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not, then spend all the money,

1687
03:37:17,754 --> 03:37:18,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I can.

1688
03:37:21,137 --> 03:37:45,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair then could it be somewhere where things are located under the consent agenda, for example, and any explanations, like say there's 10 things that week, the explanation could come to us by email so that we would only be, we could approve it all, but obviously ask the questions or disapprove certain pieces that we think

1689
03:37:46,854 --> 03:37:47,655
[SPEAKER_06]: we're not comfortable with?

1690
03:37:47,955 --> 03:37:56,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, and if I may, I certainly, first of all, I mean, the kind of equipment that we're talking about is not normally purchased stuff.

1691
03:37:56,419 --> 03:38:01,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're not, fossil fuel stuff is stuff that has to be installed, and like, it's a big effort.

1692
03:38:02,761 --> 03:38:09,644
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was another, earlier in our consent agenda, we had a couple items that actually shouldn't have been in the consent agenda because of the policy.

1693
03:38:10,065 --> 03:38:12,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went, for the next meeting, I was gonna actually make a

1694
03:38:13,274 --> 03:38:20,504
[SPEAKER_02]: policy change to our consent agenda to include things like field trips and donations so that we can include those.

1695
03:38:21,045 --> 03:38:24,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to include this as well because why not?

1696
03:38:25,371 --> 03:38:27,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So sure.

1697
03:38:28,384 --> 03:38:45,797
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can't, yeah, the one thing I'll say is I think as we start the Capital Improvement Planning Committee, and once we start that work, I think a lot of these items will move through that process as they should, and any issues will be addressed.

1698
03:38:46,217 --> 03:38:46,538
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all.

1699
03:38:46,998 --> 03:38:47,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

1700
03:38:47,879 --> 03:38:48,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that sounds great.

1701
03:38:48,879 --> 03:38:49,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

03:39:01,902 --> 03:39:02,302
[SPEAKER_20]: I love it.

1709
03:39:02,842 --> 03:39:06,905
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very not everybody on the audience can see it, but it's enjoyable.

1710
03:39:07,325 --> 03:39:08,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways, remember, we're hungry.
