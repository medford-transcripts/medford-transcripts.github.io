1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:00,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

2
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:01,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Or refer.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:02,991
[SPEAKER_04]: This.

4
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,592
[SPEAKER_04]: To, um.

5
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:08,473
[SPEAKER_04]: To Medford's Office of Sustainable Sustainability.

6
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:10,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I know our climate action plan.

7
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:16,097
[SPEAKER_04]: References lead only, um, but either or invite.

8
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:22,261
[SPEAKER_04]: The sustainable someone from the sustainability office at the city to comment on that as a

9
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:33,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I certainly, I would be happy with an and.

10
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:36,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the chips.

11
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:39,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the word chips, all uppercase, is the S?

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,359
[SPEAKER_04]: It's CHPS.

13
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:45,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I can put that in the document, I think, if that's useful.

14
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:47,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.

15
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:59,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't have time to do the research, but from what I've seen, it seems like there are some really important milestones for schools that we should be thinking about as people using the building.

16
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:00,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

17
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:10,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I don't particularly, not that I don't find the city's Office of Sustainability to be,

18
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:13,052
[SPEAKER_07]: love them at all.

19
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:18,594
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't particularly want their input here, because they work for the mayor.

20
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:23,035
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor is the person who will be funding this project, while the residents will.

21
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:29,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just don't feel that they're going to be able to offer an opinion that's based purely on our goals.

22
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:33,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, they're going to offer an opinion based on what's financially reasonable.

23
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:36,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're just going to be chopping down

24
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,213
[SPEAKER_07]: potential before we've even started.

25
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:49,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if somebody comes in and says LEED 5 is going to cost us a billion dollars for a high school, well, then we can sit and decide that's not a thing we can do.

26
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,127
[SPEAKER_07]: But

27
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:59,471
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and other times when that office has spoken about issues, there's always the start with whether we can afford it.

28
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that's a conversation for afterwards, not before.

29
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:05,514
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fair.

30
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:15,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's perhaps then included in one of the consultancies that the next section is gonna refer to to make sure that we have that consultancy in submitting our application.

31
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:18,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

32
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:19,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Olapade.

33
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:25,791
[SPEAKER_01]: The question about the, I guess, overarching overview or like the accountability.

34
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:36,785
[SPEAKER_01]: So because we're, we're doing this, this committee, I think with the overall voting power of the building creation, when it comes to actually like hitting these public input and stakeholder feedback.

35
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,807
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say like thresholds of actual input.

36
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:44,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there ways for us to actually make sure that's happening?

37
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:58,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to suggest that like the building committee wouldn't be doing that, but more specifically making sure that we're garnering as much input as possible, just because that's a lengthy process that some parents, some community members might not be as able to respond when, you know, let's say a survey goes out immediately.

38
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:04,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there ways for us to, I think, try to keep us as honest as possible by trying to get as much input as possible?

39
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:05,858
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just something that I've noticed.

40
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:08,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

41
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there are lots of ways to do that.

42
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:20,394
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that we will ask of the committee first is to prepare a report to the school committee.

43
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the items for consideration is

44
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:41,561
[SPEAKER_05]: What, even in this like first early stage is the plan for community input so I think that's a good mechanism to sort of include in like the monthly reporting in terms of like what is stakeholder engagement look like because it will change over the course of the project, I think it's.

45
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:49,649
[SPEAKER_05]: much less exciting in the first eligibility phase than it will be when you get to things like feasibility and schematic design.

46
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:56,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's when, you know, there's lots of planned input that the folks that we hire to do that work will come in and do.

47
00:03:56,596 --> 00:04:05,204
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it will change over time, but I think it's a good, to me, it's a good call out to think about in terms of like the monthly reporting.

48
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,326
[SPEAKER_05]: of what has happened, what's coming up.

49
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:12,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And that might be a good way to make sure that we as a committee are keeping tabs on that.

50
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:16,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

51
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Bowen.

52
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:23,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, just one quick revision on the title of Curtis Tufts High School.

53
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:25,575
[SPEAKER_03]: It should not have the word alternative.

54
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:26,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

55
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:28,697
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can just change that, that would be appreciated.

56
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:29,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

57
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:32,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Apologies for that.

58
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau.

59
00:04:33,558 --> 00:04:56,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, yes, on the issue of community engagement that member Olapade just brought up, I believe the MS, I mean, their process is quite lengthy and I won't pretend to be an expert on it yet, but there are mandatory community engagement activities we must perform, round tables, all those other focus groups, those are not optional.

60
00:04:58,114 --> 00:05:01,397
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure that what they actually look like

61
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:12,640
[SPEAKER_07]: is probably like much of the MSBA recommendations is kind of vague because a little tiny community somewhere out West in Massachusetts is different than the city of Boston.

62
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:19,523
[SPEAKER_07]: But we cannot get out of community input, which obviously we want.

63
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:24,604
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think including it is fine and great.

64
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:30,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think people should be comfortable with the fact that we absolutely will have to do that.

65
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:33,046
[SPEAKER_07]: regardless of whether we want it, which we do want.

66
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:34,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

67
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:36,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

68
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:48,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I just offered a suggestion which essentially builds out number three and says that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the Medford School Committee.

69
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:57,484
[SPEAKER_05]: So just sort of sets up that requirement for us to be having that dialogue with the school committee and the building committee together on an ongoing basis.

70
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:02,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions about goals?

71
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Never so.

72
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

73
00:06:05,261 --> 00:06:10,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Could we put the New England chips before the word lead?

74
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:17,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because the climate goal stuff is specific to the lead stuff.

75
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you.

76
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:23,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would prefer definitely an and, not an or.

77
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,917
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those is definitely going to be far more

78
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Strict than the other.

79
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,951
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they weren't written by the same people at the same time with the same data.

80
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:41,212
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I don't know how Member Reinfeld feels about that, but I'm a big fan of and, because if it's or, it's going to end up being whichever is weakest.

81
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:50,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the or was simply because I haven't, I didn't have the time to do the research, but I'm going to trust the experts in the inboxes.

82
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:52,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

83
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:58,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I accept your revision to my amendment.

84
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:00,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

85
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other questions or comments about this section?

86
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:12,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to approve the changes that we've outlined in this section?

87
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:15,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve.

88
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:20,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve the changes outlined in the goal section by member Olapade.

89
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:22,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I second it?

90
00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:23,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great.

91
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:24,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by member Branley.

92
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:26,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

93
00:07:27,837 --> 00:07:28,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Branley.

94
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:32,215
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, member Graham.

95
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:32,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

96
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:34,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember all about it.

97
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:35,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

98
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:38,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a clock with absent member.

99
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:38,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

100
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, members.

101
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,360
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, Maryland.

102
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Go turn absent.

103
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:50,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, five affirmative zero negative two absent motion passes.

104
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:53,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, moving on.

105
00:07:55,066 --> 00:08:07,018
[SPEAKER_05]: The next section, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee, let's do the first five of these and then we'll carry on.

106
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:13,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, establishes the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee, said committee may be referred to as the School Building Committee.

107
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:40,361
[SPEAKER_05]: acknowledges that the significant investment members of the committee are making in the future of the city of Medford and Medford Public Schools, and regrets that the positions cannot be compensated in compliance with MSBA rules and regulations, grants the authority of the School Building Committee Chair to recommend extensions of member terms subject to approval by the Medford School Committee, recommend replacement of non-participatory members subject to approval by the Medford School Committee,

108
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:57,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Work with the appointed committee to maintain various subcommittees, including, but not limited to, communication and community engagement, sustainability, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing, finance, and other committees as established by the chair.

109
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:04,419
[SPEAKER_05]: D, work with the appointed committee to convene external advisory committees and consultancy on an as-needed basis.

110
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:14,849
[SPEAKER_05]: E, provide monthly updates to the Medford School Committee, and F, act in accordance with MSBA established rules, regulations, and requirements on behalf of the School Building Committee.

111
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:27,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four, requires a report to be presented to the Medford School Committee regarding the School Building Committee's governing structure, scope, resources, community engagement plans, website, and document management plans.

112
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,561
[SPEAKER_05]: and training no later than May 20, 2024.

113
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:42,049
[SPEAKER_05]: And number five establishes the initial term of members beginning April 15, 2024, which is the start of Medford's eligibility phase is May 1 and ending

114
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:55,459
[SPEAKER_05]: January 25th, 26th, sorry, 2025, which is 270 days from the start of our eligibility phase, or the successful completion of the eligibility phase, whichever is sooner.

115
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:05,507
[SPEAKER_05]: The school committee desires stability in the committee and will extend member terms throughout each phase of the process at the recommendation of the chair.

116
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:09,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is numbers one through five.

117
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:11,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions.

118
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:13,559
[SPEAKER_05]: comments, thoughts.

119
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:28,086
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm going to move on and we are going to keep making progress.

120
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:36,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just clean up number six and then we'll talk about the membership as one fell swoop.

121
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:51,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So number six requires the school building committee to comply with MSBA guidelines and align with, but it's not bound by the Medford school committee policy BDF, which is our process to appoint advisory committees to the school committee.

122
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:54,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So any questions about number six?

123
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:00,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, seeing and hearing none.

124
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:14,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Number seven, appoints, defines the membership of the school building committee as A, no more than 15 voting members, B, appoints the following members of the committee.

125
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:19,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So voting members are myself, Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn,

126
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:25,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Maurice Edward Benson, Suzanne Galussi, Peter Cushing, and Marta Cabral.

127
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:38,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And in parentheses, what you see there are the like requirements from MSBA that the various individuals fill, just to show sort of a tie between like what we have to do and what we are doing.

128
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:47,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And then non-voting members, Bob Dickinson, who's the local budget official, to be determined the MCPPO, Chad Fallon,

129
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:52,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Joan Bowen, John McLaughlin, and Thomas Dalton as non-voting members.

130
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:54,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll stop there.

131
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions about the appointed members of the committee?

132
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:01,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Olapade.

133
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:05,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a quick question when it comes to the non-voting members.

134
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,857
[SPEAKER_01]: For number three, Chad Fallon is the director of the vocational program.

135
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:23,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it not make sense to have him be involved as a voting member as if we believe that the building is going to stay in the same place and be the same composition, but the vocational program is equally involved in that process of what the needs are for that student body?

136
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I actually, that's actually really good question.

137
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:41,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a conversation with Chad, the other day we actually have started working through some of the requirements that the vocational school will have to pull together as part of the eligibility phase, and we were meeting and we did talk about that.

138
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:52,575
[SPEAKER_05]: He reports, I believe, to Dr. Edouard-Vincent directly and Dr. Cushing is responsible for overseeing vocational education as well.

139
00:12:52,735 --> 00:13:05,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So he felt comfortable that the vocational school is adequately represented from a voting perspective and was absolutely okay with and fine with being a non-voting member of the committee.

140
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:06,579
[SPEAKER_05]: He's really excited about the work.

141
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:16,467
[SPEAKER_05]: He is already planning a presentation that will come to the school committee about sort of what he sees as the future and the opportunity and the possibility.

142
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:17,868
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

143
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,449
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of exciting stuff to come.

144
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:29,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So certainly from my seat as the chair, I will be looking for Chad's input often as we will all the non-voting members.

145
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And he felt comfortable that his voice was well-represented from a vote, if that helps.

146
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions about the appointed members?

147
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:52,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing and hearing none.

148
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let's move on.

149
00:13:56,683 --> 00:14:22,096
[SPEAKER_05]: We are then talking about applications for interested members who include one additional city school committee member, one city Councilor, and applications for seven additional open positions from the community as voting members, Medford public school teachers and staff who are Medford residents are welcome to apply.

150
00:14:24,424 --> 00:14:30,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be those nine positions I referenced earlier and they are at present all voting members.

151
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:42,759
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanna circle back to Dr. Edouard-Vincent's question about alternates and whether we wanna consider adding some non-voting community members.

152
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,443
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to like bring that back up because I think this would be the place for us to discuss that.

153
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

154
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:49,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

155
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:54,525
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when I think about like a jury, you know, you have the alternates that are there, they have to be there.

156
00:14:54,545 --> 00:15:00,089
[SPEAKER_07]: So if somebody has to leave for whatever reason, things can just carry on.

157
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:03,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, I think it's a very interesting idea.

158
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:07,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess what I'm wondering about is the,

159
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,566
[SPEAKER_07]: the pseudo-appointed alternates or whatever, the appointed alternates.

160
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:32,422
[SPEAKER_07]: The expectation, if I was to imagine how that would work, is that they would be expected to show up, that they would be participating in the conversations, they wouldn't have voting rights, and then should a voting member need to leave or drop out or whatever,

161
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:40,298
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be just a seamless process to move them into the voting seat, which is definitely better than

162
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:51,706
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody, we go to the list again, we pick somebody else, they come in, and they do not know what's been going on in the conversations we've been having for weeks or months or, frankly, years at this point.

163
00:15:53,126 --> 00:16:05,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would put them at a disadvantage, and it would kind of slow down the entire committee, because you should bring your new people up to speed, which means repetition of things everybody else already knows.

164
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,289
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do like that idea.

165
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:10,070
[SPEAKER_07]: The only concern I have is

166
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:18,964
[SPEAKER_07]: managing, I mean, we would have the 15 voting, wait, is it 15 voting members?

167
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:20,585
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 voting members, yes.

168
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:26,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And then six additional members, so 21 members who will probably always be there.

169
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:34,999
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, if we added two more members who are alternates, I do see the value.

170
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:36,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the commitment is so

171
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:38,937
[SPEAKER_07]: significant.

172
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know whether or not folks

173
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:47,691
[SPEAKER_07]: added as an alternate would in any way feel OK about that.

174
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:58,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that when we make the decision as to who those people are, we would, I guess, prioritize the list of people we want to make the voting members from the community.

175
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,178
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we would have to sort.

176
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:06,861
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got this teacher who's also a building trades person and lives in Medford.

177
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:09,182
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a person that should percolate to the top.

178
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:10,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And then where do we?

179
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:15,693
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we sort?

180
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:17,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Becomes a little uncomfortable.

181
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:28,714
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think if we're open about it and say, look, we want you on the committee, but we want you to be an alternate, and they can accept or not, like anybody else we offer the positions to.

182
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:32,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's some value there.

183
00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:35,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is just not a minor commitment.

184
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:41,199
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think two people as alternates is something I think would be interesting.

185
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:44,000
[SPEAKER_07]: It just makes the meetings a little more unwieldy.

186
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,081
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's my thoughts.

187
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:48,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld.

188
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:52,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I support the idea of alternates.

189
00:17:53,026 --> 00:18:02,274
[SPEAKER_04]: My big question on that is, if we lose committee members, we're going to need to, for the most part, replace that particular expertise.

190
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a little bit what Member Ruseau was referring to.

191
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:10,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And so being really thoughtful about what that means.

192
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:21,713
[SPEAKER_04]: because the building committee is we're choosing this not by lottery not we're choosing it very much based on expertise and I but I think it could certainly be added.

193
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:29,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my question to the superintendent is this for specifically for the members of the public or are we thinking about

194
00:18:30,603 --> 00:18:42,116
[SPEAKER_04]: the designated voting members who are actively fulfilling particular roles because I think if it's for the public, we can add a question to the application saying, would you be willing to serve as an alternate.

195
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:49,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we would need to specify that the alternates are essentially a non, are they a non participatory but non voting member during the meeting.

196
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:56,668
[SPEAKER_04]: and they move into a voting role, or is it they're observers for the whole process?

197
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:58,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does it mean to be an alternate?

198
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that question.

199
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:10,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking about where the 15 voting members, and again, right now it would be about 21, 22 potential

200
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:15,956
[SPEAKER_02]: participants, it ends up getting pretty large.

201
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:20,498
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, I like the number 15, but you do want to have options.

202
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:30,122
[SPEAKER_02]: But where member Rousseau just commented about meeting during the summer and really spelling out what the time requirements are going to be,

203
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:41,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that the people who sign up will really be able to make that commitment and stay for the duration of the process.

204
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:55,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Because to your point, Member Reinfeld, if we have a person with a specific expertise and due to, you know, an unforeseen circumstance, they have to step down and we replace

205
00:19:57,312 --> 00:20:03,218
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a body, but they don't have the expertise, then that's a gap, once again, for the committee.

206
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:20,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So initially, I just was thinking if the idea was to always maintain 15 people or an odd number of people voting so that if you needed to have a tiebreaker, you know, you wouldn't have to worry about that being an issue.

207
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:42,741
[SPEAKER_02]: but also while we are here and talking about it, one of the participants on this call is one of our other administrators, Dr. Lori Hodgdon, who is the principal at the Curtis Tufts, and she also had just expressed, you know, she would be very happy to be involved in

208
00:20:44,241 --> 00:21:00,289
[SPEAKER_02]: this process similar to Chad Fallon as a non-voting member, but being able to weigh in on this new school that we're going to be designing and bringing her expertise

209
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:04,592
[SPEAKER_02]: to the conversation as well.

210
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:13,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that's an additional district-based administrator, but she does have a wide breadth of experience.

211
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:17,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think she could be a very valuable contributing member to the team.

212
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:26,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And she would be happy to be part of that team in a non-voting capacity, but participate and be

213
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,412
[SPEAKER_02]: involved.

214
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:40,400
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just, again, thinking about the total number, the larger the group gets, the more difficult it becomes to manage.

215
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:56,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And trying to find what is that actual ideal number, I'm thinking, actually, we probably would prefer to definitely not go

216
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,317
[SPEAKER_02]: up, up, up over 25.

217
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:21,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we could probably stay under 20, that would have been even more ideal because once it gets very, very large, you have a lot of wonderful opinions and perspectives, but then at the same time, it's so many opinions and perspectives that it makes the work take significantly longer.

218
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:21,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

219
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:33,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I, when I originally suggested to have one or two alternates, I hadn't thought about your point member, Reinfeld, about the specific expertise.

220
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:54,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we have an engineer, we don't want to replace an engineer with, you know, someone who has another expertise, but for the purposes of the building, we would really need to have the expertise of an engineer or, you know, someone else with a specific skillset that's being called out.

221
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:57,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

222
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:58,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

223
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:10,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny, like, the more we talk about it, now I'm backed around to maybe no alternates, because I think what we would want to do is when we look at the list, you know, we don't know what the list is going to look like.

224
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:17,561
[SPEAKER_07]: We could have 35 people with all this technical expertise apply, and then boo for us because we got to figure out

225
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:28,153
[SPEAKER_07]: But when people apply initially, their own circumstances could change.

226
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:37,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because we could be talking about five, six months from now, and then you might not have wanted to apply five or six months from now.

227
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:43,602
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't really have a process in here for what to do when we need to add members.

228
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we just go back to the well?

229
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:48,365
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the list that we had from the first time we did this.

230
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:51,086
[SPEAKER_07]: My preference would be that we go to this list.

231
00:23:51,226 --> 00:24:00,109
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if we cannot be successful with this list, then we put another thing to the public and be like, we need more people with these specific skills if you would apply.

232
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:08,371
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think just going back to the list is probably the approach I would recommend.

233
00:24:09,412 --> 00:24:15,714
[SPEAKER_07]: As for alternates, if we end up with alternates, I would definitely think an alternate has a voice at the table.

234
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,316
[SPEAKER_07]: they just don't get to vote.

235
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:27,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I would not, personally, I can't imagine volunteering to sit silently with my expertise on a topic that- Five to seven years.

236
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:32,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Five to seven years, with something I'm interested in and I wanna say something and being told, no, I'm sorry, you can't speak.

237
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:34,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, these are open meetings.

238
00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:42,185
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think we actually, I mean, I guess this committee will have to design its own rules on how it wants to operate around public input and all that stuff.

239
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:45,406
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know,

240
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:55,230
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I like about the more that we talk about this, the thing I most like about having alternates now that we say you're going to be an alternate is that if they actually show up.

241
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,522
[SPEAKER_07]: that when we need them, there will be a lot less effort involved with bringing them up to speed.

242
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:07,345
[SPEAKER_07]: That said, the tasks that we have to accomplish, it's not like we have a task that will take six months.

243
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,447
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tasks, tasks, tasks, tasks, tasks, tasks.

244
00:25:10,587 --> 00:25:15,370
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not going to be bringing them up to speed on decisions and things we've already done and are completed.

245
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,591
[SPEAKER_07]: from nine months or three years ago.

246
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:23,612
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna be bringing them up to speed on the things that are being worked on at the moment.

247
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,833
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that isn't as big of a lift actually.

248
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm kind of wishy-washy.

249
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:31,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I could go either way on this.

250
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:38,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions, comments, thoughts?

251
00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:42,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I just was gonna comment.

252
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I think based on the

253
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:50,116
[SPEAKER_02]: new rationales that were presented, I would withdraw my recommendation.

254
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:53,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually feel like

255
00:25:57,815 --> 00:26:00,756
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the reverse is true.

256
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:12,543
[SPEAKER_02]: We could have one alternate engineer and one alternate environmentalist expert, and those positions never have a vacancy, and then another area has a vacancy.

257
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:21,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost like a moving target, and it's gonna be very difficult to predict that.

258
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:46,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think as the application goes forward to really ask the members of the community that are interested if they could really do a due diligence and just say they really want to commit to this process so that we have a real working group that is going to be able to contribute for the duration of the project.

259
00:26:49,882 --> 00:26:50,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

260
00:26:51,562 --> 00:26:55,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we need to put into this document the procedure for filling

261
00:26:57,173 --> 00:27:05,980
[SPEAKER_04]: vacancies that arise, or is that something that the committee, the original appointed committee will say, if we lose members, this is our replacement plan?

262
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:20,272
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a section that talks about the chair to recommend extensions, recommend replacement of non-participatory members.

263
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:25,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we could

264
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:37,917
[SPEAKER_05]: just simply add here based on the initial application pool where possible.

265
00:27:37,937 --> 00:27:44,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I think at some point that pool becomes really stale, right?

266
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:51,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So that it may not last forever, but maybe if we do that, that sort of describes what our intentions are there.

267
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:56,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I because I agree with the process that member Ruseau out.

268
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:07,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was member Ruseau outlined if we go back if that expertise is there we take it there or give that first refusal, and then put out a call for specific expertise if needed.

269
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

270
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:25,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, my gut, of course, this is not based on anything, is that once people sort of reach this threshold of being committed for a year, two years, they're gonna be like, no way am I stopping now.

271
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:36,512
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like this is going to be an earlier, I mean, with the exception of people who have all the usual things that happen in life that can make that determination for someone.

272
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:46,142
[SPEAKER_07]: But the people initially who get selected, who are participating, they'll know quickly whether or not they've bitten off more than they can chew in their own personal lives.

273
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:50,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that list probably won't be terribly stale early.

274
00:28:52,085 --> 00:29:04,661
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think going back for another round of applicants is something I think we should just think about in the future if it comes up as necessary.

275
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:08,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld, did I see your hand?

276
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:13,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we did not address the question of Ms.

277
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:13,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Hodgkin.

278
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:15,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

279
00:29:16,615 --> 00:29:24,943
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would certainly support putting her as a non-voting member in the same capacity as Principal Fallon.

280
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:29,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It does bring us to an even number, which

281
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:37,083
[SPEAKER_04]: may or may not, although not voting, not on the voting, just in the room, I guess it's just pushing the numbers up.

282
00:29:38,184 --> 00:29:44,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we like, and I was also looking back, is MEEP represented in Medford Family Network?

283
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:49,671
[SPEAKER_04]: How are those, when we're talking about all the programs in the building, how are those represented here?

284
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:56,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, so I'm just gonna add this so I can finish my thought.

285
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:04,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for being here, how you come in.

286
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:11,534
[SPEAKER_05]: So Joan has responsibility over MEEP and reports to the superintendent, of course.

287
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:18,997
[SPEAKER_05]: The MFN, am I correct that the MFN reports to Ms.

288
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:19,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Galussi?

289
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:20,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?

290
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:21,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

291
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that is correct.

292
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:30,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so they are sort of covered by extension through both voting and non-voting members.

293
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic, thank you.

294
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:45,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to approve the two changes, one to 3B and to seven?

295
00:30:47,273 --> 00:30:47,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve.

296
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:48,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye, aye.

297
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:50,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve by member Rousseau.

298
00:30:52,657 --> 00:30:53,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

299
00:30:53,878 --> 00:30:55,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by member Olapade.

300
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:55,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

301
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Bramlin.

302
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you give us a thumbs up or a thumbs down?

303
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,631
[SPEAKER_05]: You can all hate me for this.

304
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:09,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry.

305
00:31:09,913 --> 00:31:10,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

306
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:13,256
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good now.

307
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:14,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

308
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:15,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

309
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:17,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Olapade.

310
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:17,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

311
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:20,896
[SPEAKER_07]: member of McLaughlin's absent.

312
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:21,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Reinfeld?

313
00:31:21,997 --> 00:31:22,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

314
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:23,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Reverso, yes.

315
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:24,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Langenfeld is absent.

316
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent, motion passes.

317
00:31:31,244 --> 00:31:43,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, next section, directs the superintendent to create an application form for membership in the building committee by five o'clock Friday, March 8th.

318
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:46,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a week from Friday to go out in the weekly newsletter.

319
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:56,685
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a series of questions being asked that we reviewed earlier, but full name, full address, contact information.

320
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:58,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you want to be on the building committee?

321
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:00,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you related to a current school committee member?

322
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:01,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, how?

323
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:03,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you require an interpreter?

324
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have access to a computer and an internet connection to participate in Zoom meetings?

325
00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:11,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a teacher or staff member at Medford High School?

326
00:32:11,877 --> 00:32:14,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have experience in school building projects?

327
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,400
[SPEAKER_05]: If so, please explain.

328
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have experience in large program communications and or management?

329
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:21,743
[SPEAKER_05]: If so, please explain, not complain.

330
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:28,955
[SPEAKER_05]: What other relevant expertise or unique perspective do you bring to the process?

331
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:30,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a Medford public school student?

332
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:34,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a caregiver of a Medford public school student?

333
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:35,978
[SPEAKER_05]: If so, please list grade in schools.

334
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:43,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you commit to a minimum of twice monthly committee subcommittee meetings held on Monday evenings for approximately two hours beginning at 6 p.m.

335
00:32:43,841 --> 00:32:44,762
[SPEAKER_05]: and held in person?

336
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:52,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you commit to participation through the entire eligibility phase of the project, which may extend through January 26, 2025?

337
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:59,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you willing and able to commit to this appointment through the entire life of the project, which may last up to seven years?

338
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:10,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you actively support and participate in a public campaign to secure funding from Medford's taxpayers to pay for aspects of the project not directly supported by MSBA?

339
00:33:10,352 --> 00:33:25,202
[SPEAKER_05]: A series of demographic questions including age, gender identity, sexual orientation, household income, educational attainment, what language you mainly speak at home, racial and ethnic identity, and disability status.

340
00:33:26,262 --> 00:33:27,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, are you a registered voter?

341
00:33:27,782 --> 00:33:30,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And if yes, please indicate your ward and precinct.

342
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:45,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just a little bit further on the application, the form will be posted to the website and communicated through the usual mechanisms the district uses, including translations to predominant languages on Friday, March 8th.

343
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:49,388
[SPEAKER_05]: The form will open on Friday, March 8th and close on Tuesday, March 26th.

344
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:55,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Valid applications must meet all requirements submitted within the application period.

345
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:58,414
[SPEAKER_05]: The applicant must be a current resident of Medford, Massachusetts.

346
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:03,198
[SPEAKER_05]: The applicant cannot be a close relative of a Medford school committee member, i.e.

347
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:07,882
[SPEAKER_05]: children, parents, siblings, or spouses of children's parents or siblings.

348
00:34:08,743 --> 00:34:11,325
[SPEAKER_05]: All the required elements of the application have been completed.

349
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions about this section?

350
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:15,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make it a little bit smaller.

351
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can get it all in one place.

352
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:19,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not.

353
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:23,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions, comments?

354
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:25,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld?

355
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:28,148
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to add email address or phone number.

356
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,351
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we contact these people?

357
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:31,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.

358
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:39,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

359
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:45,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

360
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:52,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And then do we want to know if they are a teacher or staff at a different school in Medford?

361
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:55,206
[SPEAKER_04]: We have high school.

362
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:04,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I was torn on this, and so I... I guess that's a good question.

363
00:35:04,397 --> 00:35:04,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Thoughts?

364
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:05,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

365
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:07,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

366
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:08,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if they are, that's fine.

367
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:10,869
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just applying as a member of the community.

368
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:19,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I think when we think about selection, which not all of these questions are about selection, but this one certainly seems like it is.

369
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:29,644
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we may, I certainly would want to include a Medford High teacher who is applying.

370
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:41,497
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they're not a teacher at Medford High and they're at a middle school or elementary school, you know, that doesn't seem,

371
00:35:42,492 --> 00:35:43,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not that it's not relevant.

372
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:55,543
[SPEAKER_07]: They may have all these other skills and we're going to pick them anyways, but the fact that they're at the Missittook, in my mind, doesn't really provide the focus of what we're looking for in the people who will be on the committee.

373
00:35:56,164 --> 00:35:59,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I just envision we're going to have plenty of people applying.

374
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:04,992
[SPEAKER_04]: If it were me, I'd be putting it in other relevant or

375
00:36:05,669 --> 00:36:07,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I want to be there.

376
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:25,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to make sure, just to confirm that Medford High School encompasses vocational actually, and I suppose Curtis Tufts as well, because we are looking at whether or not this becomes one facility.

377
00:36:34,827 --> 00:36:35,687
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a good catch.

378
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:36,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

379
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other, um.

380
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:49,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions about This list.

381
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:53,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Um I actually did get a note.

382
00:36:53,654 --> 00:36:54,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Um also

383
00:37:05,643 --> 00:37:10,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to put that on the table for consideration as well in this section.

384
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:19,369
[SPEAKER_05]: We could add it here if there is agreement on that.

385
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:20,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

386
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

387
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:25,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I understand why.

388
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:28,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just wonder about

389
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:40,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first of all, if we're going to do this, then it really needs to end up being a policy that all of our requests to the community of this nature go through the DEI office.

390
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:47,068
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, there's nothing particularly special about this part on this particular thing.

391
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:51,632
[SPEAKER_07]: We have done this at least three other times or four other times since I've been on the committee.

392
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:55,254
[SPEAKER_07]: and we've not done that, although there hasn't always been a DEI office.

393
00:37:56,214 --> 00:38:03,116
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I think I would be okay with it if we thought about it in the context of all community surveys we're doing.

394
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:08,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do worry that the DEI office doesn't work for us.

395
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:09,738
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no authority there.

396
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:10,958
[SPEAKER_07]: They have no authority here.

397
00:38:11,478 --> 00:38:18,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we send it over and they don't get around to it, which I mean, I don't doubt for a second they'll take it seriously and quickly work it, but

398
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:26,203
[SPEAKER_07]: we're putting somebody in the critical path who has no authority over us and we have no authority over them.

399
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:34,204
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel a little uncomfortable with it from a simple process perspective in doing that.

400
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:46,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Not at all concerned about the content of the response, but also if we do send it there, we do have to have, the assumption is we're gonna have to have another meeting to do this, to deal with the response.

401
00:38:47,062 --> 00:39:09,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the DEI office says, I would change the wording on this and I would change the wording on that, and we've just approved this wording, then we're having another meeting to approve the recommendations or not approve the recommendations of DEI office, which by the way, might also be an uncomfortable situation where we're like, we like this wording, we use this in education, and the DEI office says we should use this wording.

402
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:14,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't particularly have an interest in that kind of like, well, who's right?

403
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:15,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Which way should we go?

404
00:39:16,613 --> 00:39:20,634
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't call the DEI office to come to our meeting and provide input.

405
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:24,315
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't, they're completely separate part of the government.

406
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:34,478
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's sort of my concern, not at all with what the content of a DEI office reviewing it would be.

407
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:37,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Lopate.

408
00:39:39,386 --> 00:39:40,927
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't so much a part of that.

409
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:44,311
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good point, or I see the suggestion from members.

410
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:51,258
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing I'm noticing with this section, section, you know, 0.8, you know, subsection was at six.

411
00:39:51,739 --> 00:40:00,127
[SPEAKER_01]: The point about requiring an interpreter, I think that we should also be considerate of the fact that this application, is it going to be in other languages or is it only going to be English?

412
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that that will then

413
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:16,039
[SPEAKER_01]: restricts or limit the amount of people who are going to actually be able to be involved, even at the application phase, because if they may need to require an interpreter, I'm going to wager that their ability to actually read the English language might be limited as well, potentially.

414
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:20,682
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we should consider, do we want to try to have this translated

415
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:26,894
[SPEAKER_01]: to the most immediate next spoken languages in the community.

416
00:40:26,914 --> 00:40:27,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that matter to us?

417
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:28,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.

418
00:40:29,316 --> 00:40:35,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because, you know, if we're gonna have an interpreter and we say we wanna do that, I think that it also should happen, you know.

419
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:43,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And member Olapade, we do provide for that in this language here and translations into the predominant languages.

420
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:44,345
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's about the application form.

421
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:45,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're good.

422
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:51,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

423
00:40:52,725 --> 00:41:10,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I mean, there's also this very uncomfortable thing that we aren't talking about that I think happens in circles in government when we're having these conversations where we're like, we want to include people whose primary language may not be English or they may not speak English at all.

424
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:14,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we kind of have to come up with reality.

425
00:41:15,294 --> 00:41:17,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hate to use the word reality because it sounds like

426
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

427
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:29,068
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very awkward conversation, because if everything had to be, if they had to have an interpreter at every one of these meetings, we have 270 days.

428
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:32,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It does not have any exception for whether or not everything is interpreted.

429
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:41,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we couldn't conclude this process in 270 days because we were translating on the fly in every meeting the entire conversation going on,

430
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,456
[SPEAKER_07]: would we be able to finish this process?

431
00:41:46,576 --> 00:41:49,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's an important question.

432
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:55,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So it really gets to the root of the fact that government isn't designed for inclusion, 100%.

433
00:41:58,402 --> 00:42:02,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It's designed around an assumption that everybody's speaking English.

434
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:06,065
[SPEAKER_07]: how we would want to handle that.

435
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:21,389
[SPEAKER_07]: If we have an applicant who is an expert in all these things and we want this person to be on there, we're going to have to have a conversation around funding because we're going to have to fund an interpreter for all these meetings and all these documents.

436
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:33,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we're going to have to sit down and have a hard look about how much additional time would we be required to complete the process if we were on the fly

437
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:43,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't think we run any zoom meetings that I'm aware of in the city where every single thing is being interpreted for a participant of a board into another language.

438
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:49,487
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would all have to be interpreted for them to be a proper participant in the board.

439
00:42:50,007 --> 00:42:54,188
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a very challenging.

440
00:42:55,506 --> 00:43:02,848
[SPEAKER_07]: thing that I think, I wish there was an easier answer, but I think that's sort of the elephant in the room on this issue.

441
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:09,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we, of course, should cross that bridge when we get there.

442
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:22,512
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's something that I think about and I worry about because I would want to be able to include people who are not speaking English or, you know, using sign language.

443
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:29,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I just worry about how we would actually accomplish that.

444
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,420
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's a different story.

445
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:46,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other questions, comments, or changes to this section?

446
00:43:48,970 --> 00:44:00,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to the application, I just want to make sure that the application is posted with the necessary context of the goals of the committee that I think is outlined early on, right?

447
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It can't just be a form.

448
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:08,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps it's a resolution and that explains what our goals are and who they're joining.

449
00:44:08,794 --> 00:44:16,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I will work with Thomas to make sure that the form includes all of that.

450
00:44:19,564 --> 00:44:25,866
[SPEAKER_04]: before I think I think the goals that we outlined are really helpful to say this is this is what this committee is looking to achieve.

451
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,286
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I agree.

452
00:44:28,926 --> 00:44:29,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

453
00:44:30,026 --> 00:44:32,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to approve the changes that we have made?

454
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:39,489
[SPEAKER_05]: There's changes to 8A3 and 8A8.

455
00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:44,750
[SPEAKER_04]: And the shifting of the numbers with the addition.

456
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:46,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

457
00:44:46,755 --> 00:44:47,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

458
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:49,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion approved by Member Reinfeld.

459
00:44:52,299 --> 00:44:52,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

460
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Second by Member Olapade.

461
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:56,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

462
00:44:57,323 --> 00:44:57,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Bramley.

463
00:44:58,544 --> 00:44:58,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

464
00:45:00,025 --> 00:45:00,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

465
00:45:00,986 --> 00:45:01,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

466
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:02,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Olapade.

467
00:45:03,148 --> 00:45:03,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

468
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:05,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin is absent.

469
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:06,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Reinfeld.

470
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:07,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

471
00:45:07,631 --> 00:45:08,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

472
00:45:08,132 --> 00:45:08,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

473
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:09,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Lungokirn is absent.

474
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:16,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent, motion passes.

475
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:25,313
[SPEAKER_05]: It is 6.14, but we are in the home stretch, so hopefully we can make our way through these last four things pretty quickly.

476
00:45:26,293 --> 00:45:34,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Number nine, directs the school building committee chair, mayor, and superintendent to review the applications and provide a recommendation to the Medbridge School Committee for

477
00:45:35,396 --> 00:45:41,120
[SPEAKER_05]: The appointment of one Medford City Councilor, one school committee member, and seven community members no later than April 8th, 2024.

478
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:47,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Further directs that the superintendent will provide all valid applications to members of the Medford School Committee upon request.

479
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:56,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 10, directs the school building committee chair, mayor, and superintendent to recommend the vice chair of the school building committee no later than April 8th, 2024.

480
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:12,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 11, directs the superintendent to announce the school building committee on the district and project website no later than one week following the approval of the school building committee membership by the Medford School Committee.

481
00:46:12,265 --> 00:46:19,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And number 12, directs the school building committee to hold its first meeting no later than May 1st, 2024.

482
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:25,613
[SPEAKER_05]: All meetings are public meetings and will be conducted in accordance with the open meeting law using Robert's Rules of Order.

483
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:28,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions, comments, thoughts?

484
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:43,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I worry a little bit about getting all community members up to speed on Robert's rules of order, but if that's how open meeting has to be, that's how it has to be.

485
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:52,891
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor has been able to secure training for other commissions.

486
00:46:53,071 --> 00:47:03,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the Charter Study Committee went through a similar process, so we'll bring in somebody to help accelerate that process, I believe.

487
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:04,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

488
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:12,838
[SPEAKER_05]: The other request that the mayor had was to potentially move the April 8th date.

489
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,781
[SPEAKER_05]: April 8th is a committee meeting.

490
00:47:17,283 --> 00:47:21,468
[SPEAKER_05]: The next committee meeting is not until the 29th of April.

491
00:47:26,954 --> 00:47:38,844
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we would, if we did move that, we would also have to move our, we would have to sort of slide our May 1st date and our report to the school committee on May 20th.

492
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:44,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the other question she asked us to consider in this meeting.

493
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:46,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will open that to the floor.

494
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

495
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:53,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly appreciate that the mayor wants that this is,

496
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:55,007
[SPEAKER_07]: recommendation.

497
00:47:55,267 --> 00:48:01,353
[SPEAKER_07]: My concern is just that our eligibility opens on May 1st, and that is not something that we can slide or change.

498
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:05,336
[SPEAKER_07]: The state has determined that, and it happens whether we're ready or not.

499
00:48:06,978 --> 00:48:20,250
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we do move it later than April 8th, then we will certainly not be having our first building committee meeting on the 1st, and people will still not have had a chance to be trained in open meeting law.

500
00:48:20,874 --> 00:48:21,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And Robert's rules.

501
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:26,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like we're going to be moving into the middle of may before the first meeting happens.

502
00:48:27,018 --> 00:48:33,403
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, that whole, what's that process they have in meetings if the forming and norming that has to happen.

503
00:48:33,683 --> 00:48:37,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to be in June before this committee is doing any real work.

504
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I just very much.

505
00:48:42,173 --> 00:48:46,635
[SPEAKER_07]: understand that April 8th feels like it's around the corner because my Lord, it really is.

506
00:48:47,936 --> 00:48:56,720
[SPEAKER_07]: But because of April vacation, I would not be in favor of that move because it really just kind of hoses us on the May 1st start date.

507
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:02,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I think everybody here knows, we do not want to be dilly-dallying.

508
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:05,543
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the technical term.

509
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:09,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely agree.

510
00:49:11,806 --> 00:49:12,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely agree with that.

511
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:13,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, we cannot wait.

512
00:49:14,307 --> 00:49:17,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

513
00:49:18,029 --> 00:49:23,531
[SPEAKER_05]: So superintendent, maybe what we can do is set a meeting.

514
00:49:23,551 --> 00:49:35,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the mayor's calendar is challenging, so maybe we can set a meeting now in anticipation of when we can begin that work to put the recommendation together for the committee so that we are ready for you.

515
00:49:37,437 --> 00:49:42,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to actually offer a friendly amendment because of the April vacation week.

516
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:56,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Since April 8th is a scheduled regular meeting, is it possible that the committee would be open to just doing an additional special meeting on a different date other than the 8th?

517
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:04,344
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do that.

518
00:50:04,624 --> 00:50:10,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I wondered though, if we, I think we will also have budget meetings scheduled during that time.

519
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:12,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I?

520
00:50:13,566 --> 00:50:14,147
[SPEAKER_05]: That is true.

521
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:14,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

522
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:17,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So how about this?

523
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we leave it as it stands.

524
00:50:19,828 --> 00:50:27,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we have to make some movement of the timeline, we can come back to the committee and let them know.

525
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:29,712
[SPEAKER_05]: member.

526
00:50:29,752 --> 00:50:42,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, I you started to say something and that reminded me also that like open meeting law does allow scheduling related changes to happen without formal meetings or any postings of any sort.

527
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:45,135
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is actually part of the resolution for which we can just

528
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:48,792
[SPEAKER_07]: have a group email and that is acceptable.

529
00:50:49,912 --> 00:51:02,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So I like the dates being written down so that we have a plan, but if they need to move for whatever reason, we can move them without scheduling a meeting to do all this work again, so.

530
00:51:02,056 --> 00:51:04,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

531
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:08,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions or comments?

532
00:51:11,055 --> 00:51:11,315
[SPEAKER_05]: member.

533
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:12,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt yes.

534
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:15,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for Dr. Dr Edouard-Vincent.

535
00:51:15,477 --> 00:51:18,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering what the status of the project website is.

536
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:22,280
[SPEAKER_04]: As per the last resolution to set that up.

537
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:26,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I will definitely be able to.

538
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a direct a formal answer right now.

539
00:51:29,743 --> 00:51:37,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I will speak with Thomas and see if I'm able to get more information on that Thomas.

540
00:51:39,352 --> 00:51:45,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we're just working on pinning down a domain, a URL.

541
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:49,849
[SPEAKER_00]: The URL from the resolution was already taken, unfortunately.

542
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:52,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just looked.

543
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:53,495
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't when we wrote it.

544
00:51:54,079 --> 00:52:01,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Dr. Cushing's been working on getting a different suitable URL.

545
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll probably have that done very soon.

546
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:15,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just a matter of Lisa Miller, our website architect, and I will put together a kind of preliminary page and we'll get it published.

547
00:52:16,387 --> 00:52:23,130
