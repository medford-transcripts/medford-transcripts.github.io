1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:00,089
Um.

2
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:01,290
Or refer.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:02,991
This.

4
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,592
To, um.

5
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:08,473
To Medford's Office of Sustainable Sustainability.

6
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:10,114
I know our climate action plan.

7
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:16,097
References lead only, um, but either or invite.

8
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:22,261
The sustainable someone from the sustainability office at the city to comment on that as a

9
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:33,432
I mean, I certainly, I would be happy with an and.

10
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:36,675
I don't know the chips.

11
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:39,798
Is it the word chips, all uppercase, is the S?

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,359
It's CHPS.

13
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:45,923
I can put that in the document, I think, if that's useful.

14
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:47,374
I got it.

15
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:59,278
Yeah, I didn't have time to do the research, but from what I've seen, it seems like there are some really important milestones for schools that we should be thinking about as people using the building.

16
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:00,878
Thank you.

17
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:10,862
I actually, I don't particularly, not that I don't find the city's Office of Sustainability to be,

18
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:13,052
love them at all.

19
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:18,594
But I don't particularly want their input here, because they work for the mayor.

20
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:23,035
The mayor is the person who will be funding this project, while the residents will.

21
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:29,056
And I just don't feel that they're going to be able to offer an opinion that's based purely on our goals.

22
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:33,437
Instead, they're going to offer an opinion based on what's financially reasonable.

23
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:36,078
And so we're just going to be chopping down

24
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,213
potential before we've even started.

25
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:49,047
I mean, if somebody comes in and says LEED 5 is going to cost us a billion dollars for a high school, well, then we can sit and decide that's not a thing we can do.

26
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,127
But

27
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:59,471
you know, and other times when that office has spoken about issues, there's always the start with whether we can afford it.

28
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,653
And I think that that's a conversation for afterwards, not before.

29
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:05,514
That's fair.

30
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:15,557
I think that's perhaps then included in one of the consultancies that the next section is gonna refer to to make sure that we have that consultancy in submitting our application.

31
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:18,298
Okay.

32
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:19,239
Member Olopade.

33
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:25,791
The question about the, I guess, overarching overview or like the accountability.

34
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:36,785
So because we're, we're doing this, this committee, I think with the overall voting power of the building creation, when it comes to actually like hitting these public input and stakeholder feedback.

35
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,807
let's say like thresholds of actual input.

36
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:44,348
Are there ways for us to actually make sure that's happening?

37
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:58,695
Not to suggest that like the building committee wouldn't be doing that, but more specifically making sure that we're garnering as much input as possible, just because that's a lengthy process that some parents, some community members might not be as able to respond when, you know, let's say a survey goes out immediately.

38
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:04,177
So are there ways for us to, I think, try to keep us as honest as possible by trying to get as much input as possible?

39
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:05,858
That's just something that I've noticed.

40
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:08,883
Sure.

41
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,545
So I think there are lots of ways to do that.

42
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:20,394
One of the things that we will ask of the committee first is to prepare a report to the school committee.

43
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,398
And one of the items for consideration is

44
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:41,561
What, even in this like first early stage is the plan for community input so I think that's a good mechanism to sort of include in like the monthly reporting in terms of like what is stakeholder engagement look like because it will change over the course of the project, I think it's.

45
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:49,649
much less exciting in the first eligibility phase than it will be when you get to things like feasibility and schematic design.

46
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:56,556
Like that's when, you know, there's lots of planned input that the folks that we hire to do that work will come in and do.

47
00:03:56,596 --> 00:04:05,204
So I think it will change over time, but I think it's a good, to me, it's a good call out to think about in terms of like the monthly reporting.

48
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,326
of what has happened, what's coming up.

49
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:12,628
And that might be a good way to make sure that we as a committee are keeping tabs on that.

50
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:16,370
Ms.

51
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,730
Bowen.

52
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:23,274
Hi, just one quick revision on the title of Curtis Tufts High School.

53
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:25,575
It should not have the word alternative.

54
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:26,295
Okay.

55
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:28,697
If you can just change that, that would be appreciated.

56
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:29,477
Thank you.

57
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:32,258
Apologies for that.

58
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,019
Member Rousseau.

59
00:04:33,558 --> 00:04:56,914
Thank you, yes, on the issue of community engagement that member Olopade just brought up, I believe the MS, I mean, their process is quite lengthy and I won't pretend to be an expert on it yet, but there are mandatory community engagement activities we must perform, round tables, all those other focus groups, those are not optional.

60
00:04:58,114 --> 00:05:01,397
So I'm sure that what they actually look like

61
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:12,640
is probably like much of the MSBA recommendations is kind of vague because a little tiny community somewhere out West in Massachusetts is different than the city of Boston.

62
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:19,523
But we cannot get out of community input, which obviously we want.

63
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:24,604
But I think including it is fine and great.

64
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:30,026
I just think people should be comfortable with the fact that we absolutely will have to do that.

65
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:33,046
regardless of whether we want it, which we do want.

66
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:34,767
So.

67
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:36,388
Thank you.

68
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:48,297
I just offered a suggestion which essentially builds out number three and says that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the Medford School Committee.

69
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:57,484
So just sort of sets up that requirement for us to be having that dialogue with the school committee and the building committee together on an ongoing basis.

70
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:02,318
Other questions about goals?

71
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,460
Never so.

72
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,201
Thank you.

73
00:06:05,261 --> 00:06:10,465
Could we put the New England chips before the word lead?

74
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:17,430
Just because the climate goal stuff is specific to the lead stuff.

75
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,212
And thank you.

76
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:23,335
And I would prefer definitely an and, not an or.

77
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,917
One of those is definitely going to be far more

78
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,530
Strict than the other.

79
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,951
I mean, they weren't written by the same people at the same time with the same data.

80
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:41,212
So, I mean, I don't know how Member Reinfeld feels about that, but I'm a big fan of and, because if it's or, it's going to end up being whichever is weakest.

81
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:50,534
Yeah, the or was simply because I haven't, I didn't have the time to do the research, but I'm going to trust the experts in the inboxes.

82
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:52,114
Thank you.

83
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:58,535
Or I accept your revision to my amendment.

84
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:00,371
Okay.

85
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,552
Are there any other questions or comments about this section?

86
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:12,013
Is there a motion to approve the changes that we've outlined in this section?

87
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:15,674
Motion to approve.

88
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:20,895
Motion to approve the changes outlined in the goal section by member Olopade.

89
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:22,676
Can I second it?

90
00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:23,316
Oh, great.

91
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:24,456
Seconded by member Brandley.

92
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:26,936
Roll call.

93
00:07:27,837 --> 00:07:28,557
Member Brandley.

94
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:32,215
uh, member Graham.

95
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:32,935
Yes.

96
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:34,356
Remember all about it.

97
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:35,216
Yes.

98
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:38,158
I'm a clock with absent member.

99
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:38,458
Right?

100
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,720
So yes, members.

101
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,360
So yes, Maryland.

102
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,900
Go turn absent.

103
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:50,986
Um, five affirmative zero negative two absent motion passes.

104
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:53,784
Okay, moving on.

105
00:07:55,066 --> 00:08:07,018
The next section, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee, let's do the first five of these and then we'll carry on.

106
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:13,605
Number one, establishes the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee, said committee may be referred to as the School Building Committee.

107
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:40,361
acknowledges that the significant investment members of the committee are making in the future of the city of Medford and Medford Public Schools, and regrets that the positions cannot be compensated in compliance with MSBA rules and regulations, grants the authority of the School Building Committee Chair to recommend extensions of member terms subject to approval by the Medford School Committee, recommend replacement of non-participatory members subject to approval by the Medford School Committee,

108
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:57,154
Work with the appointed committee to maintain various subcommittees, including, but not limited to, communication and community engagement, sustainability, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing, finance, and other committees as established by the chair.

109
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:04,419
D, work with the appointed committee to convene external advisory committees and consultancy on an as-needed basis.

110
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:14,849
E, provide monthly updates to the Medford School Committee, and F, act in accordance with MSBA established rules, regulations, and requirements on behalf of the School Building Committee.

111
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:27,060
Number four, requires a report to be presented to the Medford School Committee regarding the School Building Committee's governing structure, scope, resources, community engagement plans, website, and document management plans.

112
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,561
and training no later than May 20, 2024.

113
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:42,049
And number five establishes the initial term of members beginning April 15, 2024, which is the start of Medford's eligibility phase is May 1 and ending

114
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:55,459
January 25th, 26th, sorry, 2025, which is 270 days from the start of our eligibility phase, or the successful completion of the eligibility phase, whichever is sooner.

115
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:05,507
The school committee desires stability in the committee and will extend member terms throughout each phase of the process at the recommendation of the chair.

116
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:09,470
So that is numbers one through five.

117
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:11,211
Questions.

118
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:13,559
comments, thoughts.

119
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:28,086
All right, I'm going to move on and we are going to keep making progress.

120
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:36,662
Let's just clean up number six and then we'll talk about the membership as one fell swoop.

121
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:51,612
So number six requires the school building committee to comply with MSBA guidelines and align with, but it's not bound by the Medford school committee policy BDF, which is our process to appoint advisory committees to the school committee.

122
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:54,154
So any questions about number six?

123
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:00,855
Okay, seeing and hearing none.

124
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:14,063
Number seven, appoints, defines the membership of the school building committee as A, no more than 15 voting members, B, appoints the following members of the committee.

125
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:19,547
So voting members are myself, Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern,

126
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:25,903
Maurice Edward Benson, Suzanne Galussi, Peter Cushing, and Marta Cabral.

127
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:38,254
And in parentheses, what you see there are the like requirements from MSBA that the various individuals fill, just to show sort of a tie between like what we have to do and what we are doing.

128
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:47,882
And then non-voting members, Bob Dickinson, who's the local budget official, to be determined the MCPPO, Chad Fallon,

129
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:52,990
Joan Bowen, John McLaughlin, and Thomas Dalton as non-voting members.

130
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:54,934
So I'll stop there.

131
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,720
Questions about the appointed members of the committee?

132
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:01,265
Member Olopade.

133
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:05,715
Yeah, a quick question when it comes to the non-voting members.

134
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,857
For number three, Chad Fallon is the director of the vocational program.

135
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:23,923
Does it not make sense to have him be involved as a voting member as if we believe that the building is going to stay in the same place and be the same composition, but the vocational program is equally involved in that process of what the needs are for that student body?

136
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,374
Yeah, I actually, that's actually really good question.

137
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:41,951
I had a conversation with Chad, the other day we actually have started working through some of the requirements that the vocational school will have to pull together as part of the eligibility phase, and we were meeting and we did talk about that.

138
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:52,575
He reports, I believe, to Dr. Edward Vincent directly and Dr. Cushing is responsible for overseeing vocational education as well.

139
00:12:52,735 --> 00:13:05,018
So he felt comfortable that the vocational school is adequately represented from a voting perspective and was absolutely okay with and fine with being a non-voting member of the committee.

140
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:06,579
He's really excited about the work.

141
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:16,467
He is already planning a presentation that will come to the school committee about sort of what he sees as the future and the opportunity and the possibility.

142
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:17,868
It's awesome.

143
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,449
There's lots of exciting stuff to come.

144
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:29,858
So certainly from my seat as the chair, I will be looking for Chad's input often as we will all the non-voting members.

145
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,443
And he felt comfortable that his voice was well-represented from a vote, if that helps.

146
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,140
Any other questions about the appointed members?

147
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:52,670
Seeing and hearing none.

148
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,002
Okay, so let's move on.

149
00:13:56,683 --> 00:14:22,096
We are then talking about applications for interested members who include one additional city school committee member, one city counselor, and applications for seven additional open positions from the community as voting members, Medford public school teachers and staff who are Medford residents are welcome to apply.

150
00:14:24,424 --> 00:14:30,889
So that would be those nine positions I referenced earlier and they are at present all voting members.

151
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:42,759
So I wanna circle back to Dr. Edward Vincent's question about alternates and whether we wanna consider adding some non-voting community members.

152
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,443
So I just wanted to like bring that back up because I think this would be the place for us to discuss that.

153
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,204
Member Rousseau.

154
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:49,721
Thank you.

155
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:54,525
You know, when I think about like a jury, you know, you have the alternates that are there, they have to be there.

156
00:14:54,545 --> 00:15:00,089
So if somebody has to leave for whatever reason, things can just carry on.

157
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:03,751
I think that, I think it's a very interesting idea.

158
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:07,634
And I guess what I'm wondering about is the,

159
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,566
the pseudo-appointed alternates or whatever, the appointed alternates.

160
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:32,422
The expectation, if I was to imagine how that would work, is that they would be expected to show up, that they would be participating in the conversations, they wouldn't have voting rights, and then should a voting member need to leave or drop out or whatever,

161
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:40,298
It would be just a seamless process to move them into the voting seat, which is definitely better than

162
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:51,706
somebody, we go to the list again, we pick somebody else, they come in, and they do not know what's been going on in the conversations we've been having for weeks or months or, frankly, years at this point.

163
00:15:53,126 --> 00:16:05,029
And that would put them at a disadvantage, and it would kind of slow down the entire committee, because you should bring your new people up to speed, which means repetition of things everybody else already knows.

164
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,289
So I do like that idea.

165
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:10,070
The only concern I have is

166
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:18,964
managing, I mean, we would have the 15 voting, wait, is it 15 voting members?

167
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:20,585
15 voting members, yes.

168
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:26,751
And then six additional members, so 21 members who will probably always be there.

169
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:34,999
So, I mean, if we added two more members who are alternates, I do see the value.

170
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:36,780
I mean, the commitment is so

171
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:38,937
significant.

172
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,012
And I don't know whether or not folks

173
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:47,691
added as an alternate would in any way feel OK about that.

174
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:58,977
I think that when we make the decision as to who those people are, we would, I guess, prioritize the list of people we want to make the voting members from the community.

175
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,178
And then we would have to sort.

176
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:06,861
We've got this teacher who's also a building trades person and lives in Medford.

177
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:09,182
This is a person that should percolate to the top.

178
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:10,823
And then where do we?

179
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:15,693
How do we sort?

180
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:17,196
Becomes a little uncomfortable.

181
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:28,714
But I think if we're open about it and say, look, we want you on the committee, but we want you to be an alternate, and they can accept or not, like anybody else we offer the positions to.

182
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:32,217
I think there's some value there.

183
00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:35,017
I mean, this is just not a minor commitment.

184
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:41,199
So I think two people as alternates is something I think would be interesting.

185
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:44,000
It just makes the meetings a little more unwieldy.

186
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,081
But that's my thoughts.

187
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:48,782
Member Reinfeldt.

188
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:52,445
Yeah, I support the idea of alternates.

189
00:17:53,026 --> 00:18:02,274
My big question on that is, if we lose committee members, we're going to need to, for the most part, replace that particular expertise.

190
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,836
I think this is a little bit what Member Russo was referring to.

191
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:10,581
And so being really thoughtful about what that means.

192
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:21,713
because the building committee is we're choosing this not by lottery not we're choosing it very much based on expertise and I but I think it could certainly be added.

193
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:29,942
I guess my question to the superintendent is this for specifically for the members of the public or are we thinking about

194
00:18:30,603 --> 00:18:42,116
the designated voting members who are actively fulfilling particular roles because I think if it's for the public, we can add a question to the application saying, would you be willing to serve as an alternate.

195
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:49,825
And then we would need to specify that the alternates are essentially a non, are they a non participatory but non voting member during the meeting.

196
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:56,668
and they move into a voting role, or is it they're observers for the whole process?

197
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:58,249
So what does it mean to be an alternate?

198
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,150
Thank you for that question.

199
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:10,534
I was just thinking about where the 15 voting members, and again, right now it would be about 21, 22 potential

200
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:15,956
participants, it ends up getting pretty large.

201
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:20,498
In my mind, I like the number 15, but you do want to have options.

202
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:30,122
But where member Rousseau just commented about meeting during the summer and really spelling out what the time requirements are going to be,

203
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:41,368
I'm hoping that the people who sign up will really be able to make that commitment and stay for the duration of the process.

204
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:55,496
Because to your point, Member Reinfeldt, if we have a person with a specific expertise and due to, you know, an unforeseen circumstance, they have to step down and we replace

205
00:19:57,312 --> 00:20:03,218
you know, a body, but they don't have the expertise, then that's a gap, once again, for the committee.

206
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:20,155
So initially, I just was thinking if the idea was to always maintain 15 people or an odd number of people voting so that if you needed to have a tiebreaker, you know, you wouldn't have to worry about that being an issue.

207
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:42,741
but also while we are here and talking about it, one of the participants on this call is one of our other administrators, Dr. Lori Hodgdon, who is the principal at the Curtis Tufts, and she also had just expressed, you know, she would be very happy to be involved in

208
00:20:44,241 --> 00:21:00,289
this process similar to Chad Fallon as a non-voting member, but being able to weigh in on this new school that we're going to be designing and bringing her expertise

209
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:04,592
to the conversation as well.

210
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:13,078
And I know that's an additional district-based administrator, but she does have a wide breadth of experience.

211
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:17,222
And I think she could be a very valuable contributing member to the team.

212
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:26,709
And she would be happy to be part of that team in a non-voting capacity, but participate and be

213
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,412
involved.

214
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:40,400
But I just, again, thinking about the total number, the larger the group gets, the more difficult it becomes to manage.

215
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:56,093
And trying to find what is that actual ideal number, I'm thinking, actually, we probably would prefer to definitely not go

216
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,317
up, up, up over 25.

217
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:21,489
I mean, if we could probably stay under 20, that would have been even more ideal because once it gets very, very large, you have a lot of wonderful opinions and perspectives, but then at the same time, it's so many opinions and perspectives that it makes the work take significantly longer.

218
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:21,549
So,

219
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:33,453
I, when I originally suggested to have one or two alternates, I hadn't thought about your point member, Reinfeldt, about the specific expertise.

220
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:54,066
So if we have an engineer, we don't want to replace an engineer with, you know, someone who has another expertise, but for the purposes of the building, we would really need to have the expertise of an engineer or, you know, someone else with a specific skillset that's being called out.

221
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:57,071
Member Rousseau?

222
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:58,332
Yes, thank you.

223
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:10,578
It's funny, like, the more we talk about it, now I'm backed around to maybe no alternates, because I think what we would want to do is when we look at the list, you know, we don't know what the list is going to look like.

224
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:17,561
We could have 35 people with all this technical expertise apply, and then boo for us because we got to figure out

225
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:28,153
But when people apply initially, their own circumstances could change.

226
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:37,058
I mean, because we could be talking about five, six months from now, and then you might not have wanted to apply five or six months from now.

227
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:43,602
So we don't really have a process in here for what to do when we need to add members.

228
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,363
Do we just go back to the well?

229
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:48,365
We have the list that we had from the first time we did this.

230
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:51,086
My preference would be that we go to this list.

231
00:23:51,226 --> 00:24:00,109
And then if we cannot be successful with this list, then we put another thing to the public and be like, we need more people with these specific skills if you would apply.

232
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:08,371
But I think just going back to the list is probably the approach I would recommend.

233
00:24:09,412 --> 00:24:15,714
As for alternates, if we end up with alternates, I would definitely think an alternate has a voice at the table.

234
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,316
they just don't get to vote.

235
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:27,019
I mean, I would not, personally, I can't imagine volunteering to sit silently with my expertise on a topic that- Five to seven years.

236
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:32,701
Five to seven years, with something I'm interested in and I wanna say something and being told, no, I'm sorry, you can't speak.

237
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:34,622
Also, these are open meetings.

238
00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:42,185
So I don't think we actually, I mean, I guess this committee will have to design its own rules on how it wants to operate around public input and all that stuff.

239
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:45,406
But, you know,

240
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:55,230
The only thing I like about the more that we talk about this, the thing I most like about having alternates now that we say you're going to be an alternate is that if they actually show up.

241
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,522
that when we need them, there will be a lot less effort involved with bringing them up to speed.

242
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:07,345
That said, the tasks that we have to accomplish, it's not like we have a task that will take six months.

243
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,447
It's tasks, tasks, tasks, tasks, tasks, tasks.

244
00:25:10,587 --> 00:25:15,370
So we're not going to be bringing them up to speed on decisions and things we've already done and are completed.

245
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,591
from nine months or three years ago.

246
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:23,612
We're gonna be bringing them up to speed on the things that are being worked on at the moment.

247
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,833
So maybe that isn't as big of a lift actually.

248
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,494
So I'm kind of wishy-washy.

249
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:31,154
I feel like I could go either way on this.

250
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:38,136
Other questions, comments, thoughts?

251
00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:42,437
I just was gonna comment.

252
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,598
I think based on the

253
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:50,116
new rationales that were presented, I would withdraw my recommendation.

254
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:53,704
I actually feel like

255
00:25:57,815 --> 00:26:00,756
you know, the reverse is true.

256
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:12,543
We could have one alternate engineer and one alternate environmentalist expert, and those positions never have a vacancy, and then another area has a vacancy.

257
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:21,548
So it's almost like a moving target, and it's gonna be very difficult to predict that.

258
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:46,240
So I think as the application goes forward to really ask the members of the community that are interested if they could really do a due diligence and just say they really want to commit to this process so that we have a real working group that is going to be able to contribute for the duration of the project.

259
00:26:49,882 --> 00:26:50,162
Thank you.

260
00:26:51,562 --> 00:26:55,508
Do we need to put into this document the procedure for filling

261
00:26:57,173 --> 00:27:05,980
vacancies that arise, or is that something that the committee, the original appointed committee will say, if we lose members, this is our replacement plan?

262
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:20,272
We have a section that talks about the chair to recommend extensions, recommend replacement of non-participatory members.

263
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:25,516
And so we could

264
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:37,917
just simply add here based on the initial application pool where possible.

265
00:27:37,937 --> 00:27:44,282
I think at some point that pool becomes really stale, right?

266
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:51,028
So that it may not last forever, but maybe if we do that, that sort of describes what our intentions are there.

267
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:56,641
Yeah, and I because I agree with the process that member Russo out.

268
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:07,569
I think it was member Russo outlined if we go back if that expertise is there we take it there or give that first refusal, and then put out a call for specific expertise if needed.

269
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,170
Yeah.

270
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:25,485
Yeah, no, my gut, of course, this is not based on anything, is that once people sort of reach this threshold of being committed for a year, two years, they're gonna be like, no way am I stopping now.

271
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:36,512
So I feel like this is going to be an earlier, I mean, with the exception of people who have all the usual things that happen in life that can make that determination for someone.

272
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:46,142
But the people initially who get selected, who are participating, they'll know quickly whether or not they've bitten off more than they can chew in their own personal lives.

273
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:50,406
And so that list probably won't be terribly stale early.

274
00:28:52,085 --> 00:29:04,661
So I think going back for another round of applicants is something I think we should just think about in the future if it comes up as necessary.

275
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:08,046
Member Reinfeldt, did I see your hand?

276
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:13,292
Yes, we did not address the question of Ms.

277
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:13,712
Hodgkin.

278
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:15,454
Yes.

279
00:29:16,615 --> 00:29:24,943
So I would certainly support putting her as a non-voting member in the same capacity as Principal Fallon.

280
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:29,708
It does bring us to an even number, which

281
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:37,083
may or may not, although not voting, not on the voting, just in the room, I guess it's just pushing the numbers up.

282
00:29:38,184 --> 00:29:44,227
Are we like, and I was also looking back, is MEEP represented in Medford Family Network?

283
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:49,671
How are those, when we're talking about all the programs in the building, how are those represented here?

284
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:56,875
Sure, so I'm just gonna add this so I can finish my thought.

285
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:04,251
And thank you for being here, how you come in.

286
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:11,534
So Joan has responsibility over MEEP and reports to the superintendent, of course.

287
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:18,997
The MFN, am I correct that the MFN reports to Ms.

288
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:19,877
Galussi?

289
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:20,937
Is that correct?

290
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:21,258
Okay.

291
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,078
Yes, that is correct.

292
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:30,085
Okay, so they are sort of covered by extension through both voting and non-voting members.

293
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,586
Fantastic, thank you.

294
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:45,952
Is there a motion to approve the two changes, one to 3B and to seven?

295
00:30:47,273 --> 00:30:47,813
Motion to approve.

296
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:48,614
Aye, aye.

297
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:50,795
Motion to approve by member Rousseau.

298
00:30:52,657 --> 00:30:53,017
Second.

299
00:30:53,878 --> 00:30:55,019
Seconded by member Olopade.

300
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:55,460
Roll call.

301
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,841
Member Bramlin.

302
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,510
Can you give us a thumbs up or a thumbs down?

303
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,631
You can all hate me for this.

304
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:09,632
I'm so sorry.

305
00:31:09,913 --> 00:31:10,173
Yes.

306
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:13,256
It's all good now.

307
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:14,977
Member Graham.

308
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:15,658
Yes.

309
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:17,199
Member Olopade.

310
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:17,279
Yes.

311
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:20,896
member of McLaughlin's absent.

312
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:21,536
Member Rheinfeld?

313
00:31:21,997 --> 00:31:22,237
Yes.

314
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:23,398
Reverso, yes.

315
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:24,599
Mayor Langenfeld is absent.

316
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,243
Five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent, motion passes.

317
00:31:31,244 --> 00:31:43,093
Okay, next section, directs the superintendent to create an application form for membership in the building committee by five o'clock Friday, March 8th.

318
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:46,937
So that is a week from Friday to go out in the weekly newsletter.

319
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:56,685
And there's a series of questions being asked that we reviewed earlier, but full name, full address, contact information.

320
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:58,526
Why do you want to be on the building committee?

321
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:00,668
Are you related to a current school committee member?

322
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:01,549
And if so, how?

323
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:03,550
Will you require an interpreter?

324
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,574
Do you have access to a computer and an internet connection to participate in Zoom meetings?

325
00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:11,857
Are you a teacher or staff member at Medford High School?

326
00:32:11,877 --> 00:32:14,598
Do you have experience in school building projects?

327
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,400
If so, please explain.

328
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,882
Do you have experience in large program communications and or management?

329
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:21,743
If so, please explain, not complain.

330
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:28,955
What other relevant expertise or unique perspective do you bring to the process?

331
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:30,675
Are you a Medford public school student?

332
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:34,337
Are you a caregiver of a Medford public school student?

333
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:35,978
If so, please list grade in schools.

334
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:43,801
Can you commit to a minimum of twice monthly committee subcommittee meetings held on Monday evenings for approximately two hours beginning at 6 p.m.

335
00:32:43,841 --> 00:32:44,762
and held in person?

336
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:52,574
Can you commit to participation through the entire eligibility phase of the project, which may extend through January 26, 2025?

337
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:59,765
Are you willing and able to commit to this appointment through the entire life of the project, which may last up to seven years?

338
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:10,332
Will you actively support and participate in a public campaign to secure funding from Medford's taxpayers to pay for aspects of the project not directly supported by MSBA?

339
00:33:10,352 --> 00:33:25,202
A series of demographic questions including age, gender identity, sexual orientation, household income, educational attainment, what language you mainly speak at home, racial and ethnic identity, and disability status.

340
00:33:26,262 --> 00:33:27,762
And finally, are you a registered voter?

341
00:33:27,782 --> 00:33:30,783
And if yes, please indicate your ward and precinct.

342
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:45,087
And then just a little bit further on the application, the form will be posted to the website and communicated through the usual mechanisms the district uses, including translations to predominant languages on Friday, March 8th.

343
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:49,388
The form will open on Friday, March 8th and close on Tuesday, March 26th.

344
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:55,572
Valid applications must meet all requirements submitted within the application period.

345
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:58,414
The applicant must be a current resident of Medford, Massachusetts.

346
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:03,198
The applicant cannot be a close relative of a Medford school committee member, i.e.

347
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:07,882
children, parents, siblings, or spouses of children's parents or siblings.

348
00:34:08,743 --> 00:34:11,325
All the required elements of the application have been completed.

349
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,828
Questions about this section?

350
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:15,949
I'll make it a little bit smaller.

351
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,130
Maybe we can get it all in one place.

352
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:19,852
Maybe not.

353
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:23,863
Any questions, comments?

354
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:25,365
Member Reinfeld?

355
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:28,148
We need to add email address or phone number.

356
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,351
How do we contact these people?

357
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:31,152
Whoops.

358
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:39,362
Okay.

359
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:45,855
Thank you.

360
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:52,683
And then do we want to know if they are a teacher or staff at a different school in Medford?

361
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:55,206
We have high school.

362
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:04,377
I was torn on this, and so I... I guess that's a good question.

363
00:35:04,397 --> 00:35:04,657
Thoughts?

364
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:05,298
Member Roussell?

365
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:07,143
I don't think so.

366
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:08,805
I mean, if they are, that's fine.

367
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:10,869
They're just applying as a member of the community.

368
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:19,583
I think when we think about selection, which not all of these questions are about selection, but this one certainly seems like it is.

369
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:29,644
You know, we may, I certainly would want to include a Medford High teacher who is applying.

370
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:41,497
So if they're not a teacher at Medford High and they're at a middle school or elementary school, you know, that doesn't seem,

371
00:35:42,492 --> 00:35:43,713
I mean, it's not that it's not relevant.

372
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:55,543
They may have all these other skills and we're going to pick them anyways, but the fact that they're at the Missittook, in my mind, doesn't really provide the focus of what we're looking for in the people who will be on the committee.

373
00:35:56,164 --> 00:35:59,847
I just envision we're going to have plenty of people applying.

374
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:04,992
If it were me, I'd be putting it in other relevant or

375
00:36:05,669 --> 00:36:07,050
Yeah, I want to be there.

376
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:25,224
And just to make sure, just to confirm that Medford High School encompasses vocational actually, and I suppose Curtis Tufts as well, because we are looking at whether or not this becomes one facility.

377
00:36:34,827 --> 00:36:35,687
That is a good catch.

378
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:36,788
Thank you.

379
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,931
Any other, um.

380
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:49,132
Questions about This list.

381
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:53,133
Um I actually did get a note.

382
00:36:53,654 --> 00:36:54,914
Um also

383
00:37:05,643 --> 00:37:10,085
So I wanted to put that on the table for consideration as well in this section.

384
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:19,369
We could add it here if there is agreement on that.

385
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:20,570
Member Rousseau.

386
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,091
Yes.

387
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:25,092
I mean, I understand why.

388
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:28,354
I would just wonder about

389
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:40,844
Well, first of all, if we're going to do this, then it really needs to end up being a policy that all of our requests to the community of this nature go through the DEI office.

390
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:47,068
And, you know, there's nothing particularly special about this part on this particular thing.

391
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:51,632
We have done this at least three other times or four other times since I've been on the committee.

392
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:55,254
and we've not done that, although there hasn't always been a DEI office.

393
00:37:56,214 --> 00:38:03,116
So, I mean, I think I would be okay with it if we thought about it in the context of all community surveys we're doing.

394
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:08,577
And I do worry that the DEI office doesn't work for us.

395
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:09,738
We have no authority there.

396
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:10,958
They have no authority here.

397
00:38:11,478 --> 00:38:18,280
So if we send it over and they don't get around to it, which I mean, I don't doubt for a second they'll take it seriously and quickly work it, but

398
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:26,203
we're putting somebody in the critical path who has no authority over us and we have no authority over them.

399
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:34,204
And I feel a little uncomfortable with it from a simple process perspective in doing that.

400
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:46,147
Not at all concerned about the content of the response, but also if we do send it there, we do have to have, the assumption is we're gonna have to have another meeting to do this, to deal with the response.

401
00:38:47,062 --> 00:39:09,515
So if the DEI office says, I would change the wording on this and I would change the wording on that, and we've just approved this wording, then we're having another meeting to approve the recommendations or not approve the recommendations of DEI office, which by the way, might also be an uncomfortable situation where we're like, we like this wording, we use this in education, and the DEI office says we should use this wording.

402
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:14,052
I don't particularly have an interest in that kind of like, well, who's right?

403
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:15,472
Which way should we go?

404
00:39:16,613 --> 00:39:20,634
We can't call the DEI office to come to our meeting and provide input.

405
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:24,315
They don't, they're completely separate part of the government.

406
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:34,478
So that's sort of my concern, not at all with what the content of a DEI office reviewing it would be.

407
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:37,359
Member Lopate.

408
00:39:39,386 --> 00:39:40,927
This isn't so much a part of that.

409
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:44,311
That is a good point, or I see the suggestion from members.

410
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:51,258
So another thing I'm noticing with this section, section, you know, 0.8, you know, subsection was at six.

411
00:39:51,739 --> 00:40:00,127
The point about requiring an interpreter, I think that we should also be considerate of the fact that this application, is it going to be in other languages or is it only going to be English?

412
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,088
Because I think that that will then

413
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:16,039
restricts or limit the amount of people who are going to actually be able to be involved, even at the application phase, because if they may need to require an interpreter, I'm going to wager that their ability to actually read the English language might be limited as well, potentially.

414
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:20,682
So I think that we should consider, do we want to try to have this translated

415
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:26,894
to the most immediate next spoken languages in the community.

416
00:40:26,914 --> 00:40:27,895
Does that matter to us?

417
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:28,595
Things like that.

418
00:40:29,316 --> 00:40:35,240
Just because, you know, if we're gonna have an interpreter and we say we wanna do that, I think that it also should happen, you know.

419
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:43,004
And member Olopade, we do provide for that in this language here and translations into the predominant languages.

420
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:44,345
So that's about the application form.

421
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:45,686
So we're good.

422
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:51,970
Member Rousseau?

423
00:40:52,725 --> 00:41:10,392
Yes, I mean, there's also this very uncomfortable thing that we aren't talking about that I think happens in circles in government when we're having these conversations where we're like, we want to include people whose primary language may not be English or they may not speak English at all.

424
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:14,894
And then we kind of have to come up with reality.

425
00:41:15,294 --> 00:41:17,615
And I hate to use the word reality because it sounds like

426
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,841
I don't know.

427
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:29,068
It's a very awkward conversation, because if everything had to be, if they had to have an interpreter at every one of these meetings, we have 270 days.

428
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:32,691
It does not have any exception for whether or not everything is interpreted.

429
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:41,918
So if we couldn't conclude this process in 270 days because we were translating on the fly in every meeting the entire conversation going on,

430
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,456
would we be able to finish this process?

431
00:41:46,576 --> 00:41:49,118
And that's an important question.

432
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:55,361
So it really gets to the root of the fact that government isn't designed for inclusion, 100%.

433
00:41:58,402 --> 00:42:02,304
It's designed around an assumption that everybody's speaking English.

434
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:06,065
how we would want to handle that.

435
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:21,389
If we have an applicant who is an expert in all these things and we want this person to be on there, we're going to have to have a conversation around funding because we're going to have to fund an interpreter for all these meetings and all these documents.

436
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:33,332
Then we're going to have to sit down and have a hard look about how much additional time would we be required to complete the process if we were on the fly

437
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:43,705
I mean, I don't think we run any zoom meetings that I'm aware of in the city where every single thing is being interpreted for a participant of a board into another language.

438
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:49,487
And it would all have to be interpreted for them to be a proper participant in the board.

439
00:42:50,007 --> 00:42:54,188
So it's a very challenging.

440
00:42:55,506 --> 00:43:02,848
thing that I think, I wish there was an easier answer, but I think that's sort of the elephant in the room on this issue.

441
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:09,129
And I think we, of course, should cross that bridge when we get there.

442
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:22,512
But it's something that I think about and I worry about because I would want to be able to include people who are not speaking English or, you know, using sign language.

443
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:29,078
I just worry about how we would actually accomplish that.

444
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,420
But that's a different story.

445
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:46,065
Are there any other questions, comments, or changes to this section?

446
00:43:48,970 --> 00:44:00,313
Not to the application, I just want to make sure that the application is posted with the necessary context of the goals of the committee that I think is outlined early on, right?

447
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,393
It can't just be a form.

448
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:08,134
Perhaps it's a resolution and that explains what our goals are and who they're joining.

449
00:44:08,794 --> 00:44:16,416
I will work with Thomas to make sure that the form includes all of that.

450
00:44:19,564 --> 00:44:25,866
before I think I think the goals that we outlined are really helpful to say this is this is what this committee is looking to achieve.

451
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,286
And yeah, I agree.

452
00:44:28,926 --> 00:44:29,246
I agree.

453
00:44:30,026 --> 00:44:32,147
Is there a motion to approve the changes that we have made?

454
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:39,489
There's changes to 8A3 and 8A8.

455
00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:44,750
And the shifting of the numbers with the addition.

456
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:46,054
Yes.

457
00:44:46,755 --> 00:44:47,535
Motion to approve.

458
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:49,457
Motion approved by Member Reinfeldt.

459
00:44:52,299 --> 00:44:52,780
Second.

460
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,422
Second by Member Olopade.

461
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:56,002
Roll call.

462
00:44:57,323 --> 00:44:57,924
Member Bramley.

463
00:44:58,544 --> 00:44:58,844
Yes.

464
00:45:00,025 --> 00:45:00,486
Member Graham.

465
00:45:00,986 --> 00:45:01,206
Yes.

466
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:02,647
Member Olopade.

467
00:45:03,148 --> 00:45:03,408
Yes.

468
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:05,169
Member McLaughlin is absent.

469
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:06,551
Member Reinfeldt.

470
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:07,011
Yes.

471
00:45:07,631 --> 00:45:08,112
Member Russo.

472
00:45:08,132 --> 00:45:08,352
Yes.

473
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:09,553
Mayor Lungokirn is absent.

474
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:16,410
Five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent, motion passes.

475
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:25,313
It is 6.14, but we are in the home stretch, so hopefully we can make our way through these last four things pretty quickly.

476
00:45:26,293 --> 00:45:34,696
Number nine, directs the school building committee chair, mayor, and superintendent to review the applications and provide a recommendation to the Medbridge School Committee for

477
00:45:35,396 --> 00:45:41,120
The appointment of one Medford City Councilor, one school committee member, and seven community members no later than April 8th, 2024.

478
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:47,844
Further directs that the superintendent will provide all valid applications to members of the Medford School Committee upon request.

479
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:56,230
Number 10, directs the school building committee chair, mayor, and superintendent to recommend the vice chair of the school building committee no later than April 8th, 2024.

480
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:12,245
Number 11, directs the superintendent to announce the school building committee on the district and project website no later than one week following the approval of the school building committee membership by the Medford School Committee.

481
00:46:12,265 --> 00:46:19,229
And number 12, directs the school building committee to hold its first meeting no later than May 1st, 2024.

482
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:25,613
All meetings are public meetings and will be conducted in accordance with the open meeting law using Robert's Rules of Order.

483
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:28,855
Questions, comments, thoughts?

484
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:43,368
I worry a little bit about getting all community members up to speed on Robert's rules of order, but if that's how open meeting has to be, that's how it has to be.

485
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:52,891
The mayor has been able to secure training for other commissions.

486
00:46:53,071 --> 00:47:03,680
I believe the Charter Study Committee went through a similar process, so we'll bring in somebody to help accelerate that process, I believe.

487
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:04,721
Great.

488
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:12,838
The other request that the mayor had was to potentially move the April 8th date.

489
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,781
April 8th is a committee meeting.

490
00:47:17,283 --> 00:47:21,468
The next committee meeting is not until the 29th of April.

491
00:47:26,954 --> 00:47:38,844
And so we would, if we did move that, we would also have to move our, we would have to sort of slide our May 1st date and our report to the school committee on May 20th.

492
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:44,708
So that was the other question she asked us to consider in this meeting.

493
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:46,410
So I will open that to the floor.

494
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,752
Member Rousseau.

495
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:53,155
I certainly appreciate that the mayor wants that this is,

496
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:55,007
recommendation.

497
00:47:55,267 --> 00:48:01,353
My concern is just that our eligibility opens on May 1st, and that is not something that we can slide or change.

498
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:05,336
The state has determined that, and it happens whether we're ready or not.

499
00:48:06,978 --> 00:48:20,250
And if we do move it later than April 8th, then we will certainly not be having our first building committee meeting on the 1st, and people will still not have had a chance to be trained in open meeting law.

500
00:48:20,874 --> 00:48:21,735
And Robert's rules.

501
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:26,138
And I feel like we're going to be moving into the middle of may before the first meeting happens.

502
00:48:27,018 --> 00:48:33,403
And, you know, that whole, what's that process they have in meetings if the forming and norming that has to happen.

503
00:48:33,683 --> 00:48:37,046
So we're going to be in June before this committee is doing any real work.

504
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,347
I just very much.

505
00:48:42,173 --> 00:48:46,635
understand that April 8th feels like it's around the corner because my Lord, it really is.

506
00:48:47,936 --> 00:48:56,720
But because of April vacation, I would not be in favor of that move because it really just kind of hoses us on the May 1st start date.

507
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:02,742
And as I think everybody here knows, we do not want to be dilly-dallying.

508
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:05,543
That's the technical term.

509
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:09,225
I completely agree.

510
00:49:11,806 --> 00:49:12,566
I completely agree with that.

511
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:13,907
Absolutely, we cannot wait.

512
00:49:14,307 --> 00:49:17,228
Okay.

513
00:49:18,029 --> 00:49:23,531
So superintendent, maybe what we can do is set a meeting.

514
00:49:23,551 --> 00:49:35,897
I know the mayor's calendar is challenging, so maybe we can set a meeting now in anticipation of when we can begin that work to put the recommendation together for the committee so that we are ready for you.

515
00:49:37,437 --> 00:49:42,059
I was going to actually offer a friendly amendment because of the April vacation week.

516
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:56,423
Since April 8th is a scheduled regular meeting, is it possible that the committee would be open to just doing an additional special meeting on a different date other than the 8th?

517
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:04,344
We could do that.

518
00:50:04,624 --> 00:50:10,886
I wondered though, if we, I think we will also have budget meetings scheduled during that time.

519
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:12,506
Am I?

520
00:50:13,566 --> 00:50:14,147
That is true.

521
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:14,827
Yeah.

522
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:17,807
So how about this?

523
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,608
Maybe we leave it as it stands.

524
00:50:19,828 --> 00:50:27,650
And if we have to make some movement of the timeline, we can come back to the committee and let them know.

525
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:29,712
member.

526
00:50:29,752 --> 00:50:42,330
So yes, I you started to say something and that reminded me also that like open meeting law does allow scheduling related changes to happen without formal meetings or any postings of any sort.

527
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:45,135
So this is actually part of the resolution for which we can just

528
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:48,792
have a group email and that is acceptable.

529
00:50:49,912 --> 00:51:02,036
So I like the dates being written down so that we have a plan, but if they need to move for whatever reason, we can move them without scheduling a meeting to do all this work again, so.

530
00:51:02,056 --> 00:51:04,797
Okay.

531
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:08,858
Any other questions or comments?

532
00:51:11,055 --> 00:51:11,315
member.

533
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:12,276
I felt yes.

534
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:15,337
I have a question for Dr. Dr Edward Vincent.

535
00:51:15,477 --> 00:51:18,718
I'm wondering what the status of the project website is.

536
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:22,280
As per the last resolution to set that up.

537
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:26,642
I will definitely be able to.

538
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,543
I don't have a direct a formal answer right now.

539
00:51:29,743 --> 00:51:37,086
I will speak with Thomas and see if I'm able to get more information on that Thomas.

540
00:51:39,352 --> 00:51:45,682
Yeah, so we're just working on pinning down a domain, a URL.

541
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:49,849
The URL from the resolution was already taken, unfortunately.

542
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:52,454
Yeah, I just looked.

543
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:53,495
It wasn't when we wrote it.

544
00:51:54,079 --> 00:52:01,542
Yeah, so Dr. Cushing's been working on getting a different suitable URL.

545
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,583
I think we'll probably have that done very soon.

546
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:15,587
And then it's just a matter of Lisa Miller, our website architect, and I will put together a kind of preliminary page and we'll get it published.

547
00:52:16,387 --> 00:52:23,130
We're just basically waiting to pin down a URL and then obviously to do the necessary work to pull one together.

548
00:52:25,131 --> 00:52:25,491
Thank you.

549
00:52:26,452 --> 00:52:27,593
Member Rousseau, did you have your hand in the air?

550
00:52:28,093 --> 00:52:28,494
I did.

551
00:52:28,514 --> 00:52:33,758
I feel like you said that I was gonna start singing a song about that.

552
00:52:34,258 --> 00:52:37,621
I'd like to make a motion to approve the resolution as amended.

553
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,925
Motion to approve the resolution as amended by Member Rousseau.

554
00:52:41,945 --> 00:52:48,510
