[SPEAKER_22]: 23-076 offered by Vice President Bears and Councilor Tseng.

[SPEAKER_22]: A resolution to extend best wishes to Muslims in Medford, Massachusetts.

6
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:55,494
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, vice president bears on the motion of ice is embarrassed to suspend the rules to take public participation seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

7
00:00:55,915 --> 00:00:56,656
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor.

8
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:02,802
[SPEAKER_22]: I always oppose motion passes, I know we have some folks from Winthrop street that wanted to speak.

9
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:09,410
[SPEAKER_22]: If anyone wants to speak and come up and name and address for the record.

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:25,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, my name is Mark chubs 356 went up street 40 year resident lifetime resident West Method, my family's been in West Med for 150 years, retired as a union construction worker, I'm disabled.

11
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:28,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I have three grandchildren, I live on one step street.

12
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a very debilitating situation for us to lose our parking spaces.

13
00:01:34,949 --> 00:01:37,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about safety, but I'm concerned about safety issues.

14
00:01:38,635 --> 00:01:43,002
[SPEAKER_04]: My grandchildren happen across the street, me crossing the street, parking on side streets.

15
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,005
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have shared driveways.

16
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:52,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a visiting visiting nurse my mother's 90 years old she comes to my house I don't even know how I can get her out of my house.

17
00:01:52,868 --> 00:02:14,866
[SPEAKER_17]: I can, I can just interject just so I know that sure it's, you're a little fired up I just want to make sure that I know we get the opportunity to talk I think what Mr. Chubbs is talking about is the traffic commission meeting that was held last week, that there was some sort of approval or process that they're looking to take both sides of Winthrop Street, I believe, from

18
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:35,122
[SPEAKER_17]: the park, all the way to South Street to implement bike lane safe bike lanes but would put in bollards along both sides of the street, and we've got many phone calls from residents that were concerned that it's going going to directly affect their life, their quality of life, the safety and well being to the families and

19
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:44,767
[SPEAKER_17]: businesses like the American Legion that is located right on that street that that need those parking spaces for their survival.

20
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:48,249
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, I think I just want to clear just so you're all right.

21
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:48,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

22
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, you have another neighbor.

23
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:52,572
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd like to speak.

24
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:53,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your time.

25
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:54,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

26
00:02:55,368 --> 00:03:01,092
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and just to add to Councilor Scarpelli, that issue was tabled at the Traffic Commission, so it's something they'll take up at their next meeting.

27
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:13,499
[SPEAKER_22]: And I did talk to Director Blake, and because it hasn't been accepted yet, I think there is, you know, there is the ability to go back and forth and hear from more residents on it, so I just want to make that clear that it's not set in stone yet.

28
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,822
[SPEAKER_22]: They do have this plan, it's a plan they've worked on, but they tabled it for a reason, so.

29
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:36,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, if we could just ask that the city clerk reach out to our friends at the American Legion to see what impact this will have on our election day operations as well, whether or not if those pocket spots are gone, the American Legion will still be able to continue to serve as a polling location during those days because they have operational needs to meet as well.

30
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:42,135
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they don't have those pocket spots, they might have to pull out of their agreement with the city to be used as a polling place.

31
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,036
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's something that I think we need to look into because we have an election coming up very shortly.

32
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:45,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Great, thank you.

33
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:46,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, do you have that?

34
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:49,157
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address for the record, please.

35
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:51,726
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is George Lane.

36
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:59,728
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at 352 Winthrop Street, and I'm here to talk about the elimination of parking Winthrop Street for this specific area from Lawrence Road to Winthrop Circle.

37
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,449
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand the council does not vote on this decision.

38
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,229
[SPEAKER_11]: The vote is taken by the Traffic Commission.

39
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,870
[SPEAKER_11]: I stand before you today to request that the council ensure safety is fairly applied to everyone using Winthrop Street.

40
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:11,911
[SPEAKER_11]: This includes cyclists and homeowners.

41
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Winthrop Street is dangerous.

42
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:14,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I live on it.

43
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:20,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Bike lanes are being recommended to make it safe for cyclists, but Winthrop Street is also very dangerous for me and my neighbors.

44
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:24,496
[SPEAKER_11]: We currently enjoy the right to safely park in front of our homes.

45
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:30,060
[SPEAKER_11]: If parking is eliminated, we'll have to park across the street on the side streets of Badger and Burbank roads.

46
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,125
[SPEAKER_11]: This means unlike cyclists who move the flow of traffic, residents will need to cut directly across the street every time we need to access our vehicles.

47
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,247
[SPEAKER_11]: I currently don't park on those side streets.

48
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:39,987
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too dangerous.

49
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:42,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm healthy and I can easily run across the street.

50
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,913
[SPEAKER_11]: If Winthrop was a sleepy side street, I have no problem eliminating parking, but it's not.

51
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:48,754
[SPEAKER_11]: It's busy and dangerous to cross.

52
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:55,317
[SPEAKER_11]: At the last traffic commission meeting, the first order of business was approving a handicapped space for a woman with mobility limitations.

53
00:04:55,898 --> 00:05:03,106
[SPEAKER_11]: She requested a dedicated handicapped space in front of her home because it was difficult for her to walk and she needed to park sometimes far away.

54
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:04,929
[SPEAKER_11]: The commission approved the request.

55
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:09,314
[SPEAKER_11]: The commission approved the request to ensure her safety due to mobility limitations.

56
00:05:10,638 --> 00:05:17,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked the council to work with the Traffic Commission so they fully understand that the residents of Winthrop Street need to continue to have safe parking in front of their homes.

57
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:24,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Elimination of parking will force residents with mobility issues to park across the street, a heavily trafficked street.

58
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:31,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Our request to continue to have access to safe parking for older residents is the same philosophy they used in approving the handicap request.

59
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:38,860
[SPEAKER_11]: I've lived in my home for 35 years and I have enjoyed the right to safely park in front of my house.

60
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,041
[SPEAKER_11]: I plan to live in my home as long as I can.

61
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:45,383
[SPEAKER_11]: This goal can only be achieved if I continue to have access to safe, close parking.

62
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:54,309
[SPEAKER_11]: It worries me when I get older and develop mobility limitations, I might have to consider moving as there's no way I can easily cross the street multiple times a day.

63
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:56,650
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not safe now, let alone if I had a cane.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard that I've heard that the elimination of parking is a done deal the traffic commission has already decided.

65
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:06,429
[SPEAKER_11]: I was devastated when I heard this, where did democracy go in Medford.

66
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Proper notification was never given to me and my neighbors.

67
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:13,212
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked the Council to ensure that the democratic process is preserved.

68
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:20,155
[SPEAKER_11]: The residents of Winthrop Street received proper notification of parking changes that will affect their access to safe parking.

69
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:31,900
[SPEAKER_11]: With proper notification, residents will be able to take part in a debate and discussion at the next Traffic Commission meeting and have time to bring up their concerns to both the Traffic Commission and members of City Council as I am doing today.

70
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:36,504
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm drafting a letter to the Traffic Commission that recommends a compromise be discussed.

71
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:47,790
[SPEAKER_11]: This compromise will preserve resident parking on the even side of the street with the current share of the lane markings, and that parking be removed on the odd side of the street so a dedicated bike lane can be added.

72
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Residents on the odd side of the street are few in numbers, and they have access to Badger and Burbank Road without having to cross Winthrop Street.

73
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I plan to reach out to all the neighbors and ask them to sign this compromise letter.

74
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:01,814
[SPEAKER_11]: I will submit the letter to the Traffic Commission in advance of the April 11th meeting.

75
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:05,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, this is only from the section from Lawrence Road to Winthrop Circle.

76
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:07,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to be up here today talking in front of you.

77
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:10,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Public speaking makes me uncomfortable, but I got no choice.

78
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:16,824
[SPEAKER_11]: I love my home, I love where I live, and I need to ensure continued access to safe parking.

79
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:24,069
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here to represent all my neighbors of the neighborhood and keep them to keep access to safe parking we enjoy today.

80
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:36,505
[SPEAKER_11]: In closing, I ask the council to ensure that the concept of safety is applied to all citizens, both cyclists and homeowners, and that the democratic process of notification debate and reaching a compromise be considered.

81
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your time, and I appreciate your consideration in this matter.

82
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:41,509
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very important to me and my neighborhood.

83
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

84
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:56,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President, President, I received several phone calls from residents of winter street, along with members of the Legion over the weekend.

85
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:07,708
[SPEAKER_19]: We got to this, you know, not too long ago, the traffic commission took away all the spots, most of the spots on high street for all those residents who now only can park on

86
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:10,625
[SPEAKER_19]: one side of the street and in certain sections of High Street.

87
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:21,828
[SPEAKER_19]: And to do that on Winter Street, like Councilor Scott probably said, and Councilor Knight said, you've got the legion, which depends on those parking spaces for their existence.

88
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,329
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, on voting day, are we gonna be able to vote there?

89
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,090
[SPEAKER_19]: Because most people park there.

90
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:33,572
[SPEAKER_19]: But these people who live in those streets, those are private ways that come up at Winter Street.

91
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:36,033
[SPEAKER_19]: So technically, they don't have the right to park there.

92
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:38,952
[SPEAKER_19]: because those are for the residents that live there.

93
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:41,694
[SPEAKER_19]: If those residents want to have those cars towed, they could.

94
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:46,156
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think they would do that, but their options are thin.

95
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:51,399
[SPEAKER_19]: The holidays come up, where do their friends park if you don't have a big enough driveway?

96
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,563
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just not fair to just wipe our parking spots without having alternatives for these people to park.

97
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,168
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

98
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:16,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I appreciate the residents that came up to speak but I think that it'd be something that possibly we asked the traffic, make a motion that we asked the traffic engineer to come to the city council next city council meeting because I think that compromise sounds great but.

99
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:22,883
[SPEAKER_17]: It's great if you live on the side of the road that still has parking.

100
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:37,792
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that the phone calls we received, and I think the biggest one is the American Legion and the fact that they're a veteran service function hall that survives on rentals and having those spaces.

101
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:47,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if you talk about competition and they don't have those parking spots, they're just gonna leave to Arlington or other communities and they lose their business.

102
00:09:47,898 --> 00:09:48,619
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's something that

103
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:50,039
[SPEAKER_17]: this community needs.

104
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
[SPEAKER_17]: And they've been very good to this community.

105
00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:04,063
[SPEAKER_17]: So the other piece of this is unlike high street, when I've talked to some of the residents, Madam President, the discussion was most of those side, most of those driveways are shared driveways.

106
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:12,325
[SPEAKER_17]: So to access your parking area in your property, you have to go through a shared driveway.

107
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:17,186
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's beneficial or it's necessary to have

108
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:23,268
[SPEAKER_17]: the parking on the street so neighbors can easily park in their driveways and then put their cars away at night.

109
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:26,710
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a different dimension that we never had to look at with High Street.

110
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:35,853
[SPEAKER_17]: So I appreciate you hearing, allowing us to present to our neighbors and I just move on that.

111
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:36,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

112
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:37,194
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

113
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:42,436
[SPEAKER_22]: Any other members of the public wish to speak on Winthrop Street specifically?

114
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:45,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, on this issue,

115
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:48,795
[SPEAKER_10]: If we look at the agenda, I believe we do have some representatives from Eversource that are here.

116
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:52,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And the construction schedule is going to be something we're talking about.

117
00:10:52,077 --> 00:11:02,342
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I'm looking at the handout that they gave us, it looks like they're going to be doing about 3,000 linear feet of milling and paving from Winthrop Street to Mystic Valley Parkway in the near future.

118
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:06,104
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe we could hold the discussion on this topic until that comes up.

119
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:09,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's brought under public participation, we can't make any motions.

120
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:13,307
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we bring it up underneath the Eversource paper, we'll be able to make some motions and have some action on it now.

121
00:11:13,727 --> 00:11:13,887
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

122
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:14,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

123
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:28,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone here or anyone on Zoom if you want to speak on Winthrop Street, if you want to raise your hand on Zoom, if it's something you want to speak on.

124
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,712
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see any anyone.

125
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:35,393
[SPEAKER_22]: Not seeing anyone else.

126
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:41,154
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, yeah, we'll revisit during the...

127
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:52,508
[SPEAKER_17]: want to speak during community participation, if we allow them to join us.

128
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:53,269
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

129
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:54,410
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address for the record, please.

130
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:58,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Stephen South 106 Damon Road Medford.

131
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the secretary treasurer of Teamsters local 25.

132
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:05,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having us tonight.

133
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:17,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam President members of the council appreciate all you do just wanted to give you your monthly update from me regarding all of the contract negotiations and other issues going on within the city of Medford.

134
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:29,842
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've stated before, Teamsters Local 25 represents eight bargaining units in the city of Medford, both on the school and the city side, over 200 members.

135
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:32,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to update you on the agreements.

136
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:41,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I last reported to you a little over a month ago, or a month and a half ago, we've continued negotiations with multiple units.

137
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of the units, the DPW,

138
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:53,708
[SPEAKER_00]: the inspectors, recreation department and DPW superintendents, which is the other agreement.

139
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:56,109
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third one is the Medford clerical.

140
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,030
[SPEAKER_00]: We had come to impasse with the city.

141
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:04,632
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a last and final, which was obviously unacceptable.

142
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:11,315
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought it back to our members and all three bargaining units voted down the contracts unanimously.

143
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:13,217
[SPEAKER_00]: all three units.

144
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So we filed to mediation.

145
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:22,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three units we are set to meet with the state mediator on April 13 right here in City Hall at 10 a.m.

146
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:32,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to invite all seven of you, Councilors, I'd love for any or all of you to attend negotiations I'd love to see the city.

147
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:41,517
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't even say the city they don't have anyone speak it at any of our meetings it's KP law, I'd love for the KP law lawyer to

148
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:46,143
[SPEAKER_00]: put his positions out there on behalf of the city in front of all of you.

149
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:58,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd be very surprised by the positions that they're taking with regards to taking concessions from these hardworking workers, many of which that are behind me and giving only 2% raises.

150
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:04,651
[SPEAKER_00]: when all of the other communities that we're bargaining with are giving much more.

151
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:17,777
[SPEAKER_00]: On the city side also, the parking department and the department heads and assistant department heads, we'll have one more session, then we'll be at impasse.

152
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,857
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll file for mediation with those as well.

153
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:26,900
[SPEAKER_00]: On the city side, we met last Friday with the superintendent and the city's attorney.

154
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:34,752
[SPEAKER_00]: We came to impasse on two of the groups, that's the school security and the school custodians.

155
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:39,957
[SPEAKER_00]: That's being filed the mediation this week and I'll let you know when those dates are coming up.

156
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:53,009
[SPEAKER_00]: And the school administrators, which include the coordinators, department heads, directors, and assistant principals, we'll be at impasse with them as well.

157
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:53,910
[SPEAKER_00]: They're offering less,

158
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:57,998
[SPEAKER_00]: to them than they are to the teachers who they supervise.

159
00:14:58,058 --> 00:14:59,759
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously that's not going to happen.

160
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:09,921
[SPEAKER_00]: We've asked the city in all of these groups if they'd be willing to give our units what they gave the 500 teachers who we love, by the way.

161
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:14,263
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, they deserve even more than they got.

162
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:14,943
[SPEAKER_00]: But the city

163
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:20,949
[SPEAKER_00]: When they promised us previous whatever the teachers got would get, now they've reneged on that.

164
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,615
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an email to that effect that we'd be getting what the teachers got.

165
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:32,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Assistant Superintendent David Murphy, who we bargained with, was the city's chief negotiator all through negotiations.

166
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:35,627
[SPEAKER_00]: He's since quit and went to work for Cambridge.

167
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:42,833
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the city's not honoring, I should say the school committee's not honoring what we previously agreed to.

168
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:48,477
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe we'll be at impasse with all eight groups that we represent.

169
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:59,525
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of things, since my last report, we've also filed a whole bunch of labor charges for all various issues, for all the various groups.

170
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,287
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you the updated labor charges tomorrow.

171
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:05,566
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize, I wasn't able to prepare those for today.

172
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:17,658
[SPEAKER_00]: The termination update, obviously you know that the HR director has resigned effective Friday, but also we had another termination since I last left, last report to you.

173
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:21,522
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the senior sanitarians, been here over 20 years.

174
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:26,266
[SPEAKER_00]: She was terminated on Friday, which was two business days ago.

175
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:31,108
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to just refresh your memory from my last report.

176
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:38,015
[SPEAKER_00]: All the groups behind me representatives from all the groups from the bargaining units.

177
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:48,205
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't had a raise no one's had a raise in over a year, up to four and a half years for the clerical, the city hall clerical right in this building

178
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:52,146
[SPEAKER_00]: have not had a raise in just shy of four and a half years.

179
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:59,509
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the reasons that's problematic is like I said, the surrounding communities were settling contracts.

180
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:06,471
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been for the last year plus for anywhere to three to 7% wage increases each year.

181
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:10,753
[SPEAKER_00]: The city's offering all of these groups 2% raises.

182
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:13,354
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very, very disheartened.

183
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:16,696
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't able to make last Tuesday's meeting.

184
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,516
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out of town.

185
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:26,040
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that was an add on meeting so I wasn't able to change my schedule but it was brought to my attention that.

186
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:33,542
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor put a paper on the table to give everybody, all the non-union in the city raises, including herself.

187
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:42,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you that that's a slap in the face to the many people that are standing behind me and the hundreds of people that I represent.

188
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:48,032
[SPEAKER_00]: And then many of the groups that I don't represent, I know police and fire still don't have contracts.

189
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:52,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for the mayor to ask to give herself a raise and retro pay,

190
00:17:53,016 --> 00:18:02,722
[SPEAKER_00]: when a majority of the bargaining units in the city of Medford have been without a contract for and haven't had a raise for up to four and a half years.

191
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:05,803
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a disgrace and the mayor should be ashamed of herself.

192
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:16,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Also last week I'm sure many of you saw on Facebook, but if you don't, if you didn't I can send it to you after the meeting that the mayor was bragging on Facebook

193
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:30,443
[SPEAKER_00]: about how the city has doubled its free cash since she took office and that now you have $25 million in certified free cash.

194
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:50,064
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we're bragging online to every for everybody to see in the community about how much free money the city has sitting out there when we're being told the opposite of contract negotiations, and we're being told to get 2% wage increases that we have to give concessions give back

195
00:18:51,551 --> 00:19:04,945
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits and different things that the employees behind me already enjoy so I think somebody from the administration should get their story straight, is the city broke, or is the city swimming and free certified cash.

196
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:08,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to know I'm sure you are as well.

197
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:16,914
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that that's really all I have and I'll just leave you with this, you know, we, we have hundreds of members that work for the city.

198
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:34,203
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another three or 400 members that live in the city that don't work for the city, and we're going to be out here we're going to be out here this month, we're going to be out here next month we're going to be out here through the summer, straight into election season if we need to be, we are the the workers behind me and the hundreds that

199
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:43,610
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't here tonight, they are not going to accept a contract that is substandard and subpar, 2% raises with a bunch of concessions.

200
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,351
[SPEAKER_00]: That will never happen.

201
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:48,513
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be here next year, the year after, and the year after that.

202
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,575
[SPEAKER_00]: That will never, ever happen.

203
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:57,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Local 25 will never agree to that the workers in the city will never agree to that, and I hope none of you will stand for that.

204
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:13,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for many months that you've been talking and I believe you that you support the workers in the city that are behind me, and all the city's workers I appreciate that but I would call on all seven of you to please use the power that you have send letters

205
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:14,686
[SPEAKER_00]: take a stand.

206
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:18,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Let this administration know that this is unacceptable.

207
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:20,689
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't happening in any of the other communities.

208
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:26,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we getting strong contracts and fair contracts in all of the surrounding communities?

209
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,915
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the communities that border the city of Medford are able to give

210
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:35,877
[SPEAKER_00]: fair contracts and fair wages and benefits to their employees.

211
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:44,000
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I can't figure out why Medford's the only city that cannot provide a living wage to its workers.

212
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:50,804
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it if any or all of you could attend the April 13 meeting right here at 10 a.m.

213
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:51,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.

214
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:56,326
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have another meeting on the school side at the end of April.

215
00:20:56,406 --> 00:20:57,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you the dates.

216
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:07,891
[SPEAKER_00]: I would respectfully ask and request that all of you utilize the power that you have, utilize the resources that you have, and support these workers.

217
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:08,491
[SPEAKER_00]: They need it.

218
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:09,671
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a raise.

219
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:11,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are starving.

220
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:20,415
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about all of you and your real jobs, your regular day jobs, but I know I couldn't go four or five years without a wage increase.

221
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:21,476
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous.

222
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:24,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And any support that you can provide to the

223
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:27,759
[SPEAKER_00]: workers that are here and the ones that aren't here.

224
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,401
[SPEAKER_00]: We really appreciate it.

225
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:33,444
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always, I thank you for your service to the city of Medford.

226
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:33,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

227
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,272
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish people wouldn't use the word free cash.

228
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,735
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not free, it's taxpayer money.

229
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:59,182
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't want people to think that it's money that we just came about for free.

230
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:02,325
[SPEAKER_19]: It's money that belongs to the taxpayers of Medford.

231
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:06,690
[SPEAKER_19]: The word free should be taken out of that text there.

232
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:07,832
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

233
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:08,713
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight.

234
00:22:09,134 --> 00:22:13,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, thank you very much, and Mr. so thank you for a presentation once again this month.

235
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:22,285
[SPEAKER_10]: So you talked about some of the surrounding towns and I just want to get a good visual Can you explain, can you name some of the surrounding towns like Everett Malden.

236
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Knight I'm glad that you asked because I actually came prepared.

237
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:50,775
[SPEAKER_00]: what an administrative administration official said last week we are prepared and I have some facts for you in the city of Everett, little over a year ago we signed a four year deal 3% 3% 3% 3% and many other improvements no concessions in the city of Malden.

238
00:22:51,835 --> 00:23:08,883
[SPEAKER_00]: several months ago, I believe it was November, we signed a three-year contract, 3%, 3%, 3%, as well as market rate adjustments, meaning additional raises to bring them up to other communities surrounding, as well as many other improvements, no concessions.

239
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,423
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Malden.

240
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:14,965
[SPEAKER_00]: City of Chelsea, three-year deal, 4%, 3.5%, 3.5%, as well as market rate adjustment raises, other improvements, no concessions.

241
00:23:21,228 --> 00:23:22,628
[SPEAKER_00]: City of Newton four year deal.

242
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:47,835
[SPEAKER_00]: This was last year, 3% 3% 3% 3% as well as market rate adjustment raises many other improvements no concessions in the city of Waltham this was I believe, December, January, couple months ago, three year deal 3.25 3.25 3.25, as well as market rate adjustment raises many other improvements no concessions.

243
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:49,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Town of North Reading.

244
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,953
[SPEAKER_00]: This was about three months ago, three-year deal, 3%, 3%, 3%, many other improvements.

245
00:23:56,553 --> 00:24:12,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And another smaller community, but the town of Stowe, this was about six months ago, did a three-year deal, 15 to 21% over the three years, depending on what classification, many other improvements, no concessions.

246
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:19,066
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's seven communities we've done in the last year or so right here, besides Stowe, all the other ones border.

247
00:24:19,506 --> 00:24:19,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford.

248
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:24,687
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Mr. Salt is important to point out the demographic differences of all these communities, right?

249
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:26,647
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have, we have more than ever, Chelsea, right?

250
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:28,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we have Newton, we have North Reading, right?

251
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we have Waltham, which is one of our number one comps.

252
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:35,829
[SPEAKER_10]: When we talk about what my community is doing, Waltham and Braintree are two that we always talk about.

253
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Waltham and Braintree do we always compare ourselves to.

254
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,831
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we look at what's going on, we're seeing that every other community can do it no matter what their demographic, right?

255
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:43,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

256
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:45,071
[SPEAKER_10]: No matter what their makeup or where failing.

257
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:46,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

258
00:24:46,271 --> 00:24:48,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you tell me what the cost of a mediation would be?

259
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:54,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think for both sides, the cost is the legal fees.

260
00:24:55,059 --> 00:25:01,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and clearly the city of Medford is no stranger to legal fees because you don't have a city solicitor.

261
00:25:01,442 --> 00:25:03,543
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have an assistant city solicitor.

262
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,244
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost is astronomical.

263
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:11,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, KP law is negotiating all, um, all five of the city side agreements.

264
00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:14,729
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's, uh, attorney Greenspan is on the city side.

265
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:15,369
[SPEAKER_00]: That's separate.

266
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:16,350
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um,

267
00:25:17,488 --> 00:25:19,409
[SPEAKER_00]: KP Law is doing all the labor charges.

268
00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:21,450
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 50 open labor charges.

269
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:26,153
[SPEAKER_00]: KP Law is handling our six wage and hour lawsuits that we have against the city.

270
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:30,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually five, one's settled, one's about to settle.

271
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:35,019
[SPEAKER_00]: KP Law is handling the complaints we have at the Secretary of State's office.

272
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:36,680
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hilarious.

273
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:48,125
[SPEAKER_00]: KP law is handling the complaint at the Secretary Secretary of State's office and the complaint is the city's refusing to provide local 25 with the legal bills for KP law and KP law is defending it.

274
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:48,965
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

275
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:50,245
[SPEAKER_00]: But the irony there.

276
00:25:50,986 --> 00:25:53,247
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, the legal fees are astronomical.

277
00:25:54,147 --> 00:26:03,171
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have five agreements in the city that are going to be going to mediation legal fees that are going to be paid privately because we don't have a city solicitor 50 labor charges five wage lawsuits and then

278
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:06,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Complaints to the Secretary of State's office as well.

279
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:10,120
[SPEAKER_10]: And then a number of freedom of information requests that have gone unanswered.

280
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,821
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're at the Secretary of State's fighting for that.

281
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:13,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have labor charges on those as well.

282
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:20,524
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of the stuff that you request, I believe is necessary for you to have the proper information and tools to represent your membership effectively.

283
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:20,524
100%.

284
00:26:21,284 --> 00:26:31,568
[SPEAKER_10]: So the way I'm looking at this, Madam President, what I'm seeing here is that this has become a situation where it's a refusal to provide information because they don't want you to be a strong advocate for your membership.

285
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:45,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, well not just that I believe that the city may have things to hide they don't want us to see the KP law legal bills for reasons that I won't get into here but I think that there's this, it's problematic for the city.

286
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:50,691
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do get those unredacted, they did provide me with the legal bills they were 100% redacted.

287
00:26:56,193 --> 00:26:58,674
[SPEAKER_17]: say redacted, could you explain what it looked like?

288
00:26:58,734 --> 00:26:58,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

289
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,574
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever hear of Area 51?

290
00:27:00,894 --> 00:27:01,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

291
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:07,915
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you request any info on Area 51, the government will give it to you, but everything's blacked out.

292
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:17,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it must be very secretive, like the military base in Nevada here in Medford, because they gave me the documents, but everything's 100% blacked out.

293
00:27:17,877 --> 00:27:18,818
[SPEAKER_00]: There's aliens in the vault.

294
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:19,958
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be aliens.

295
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,921
[SPEAKER_10]: really in some way.

296
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:30,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Madam President, I thank Mr. South once again for coming up here and the advocacy that he's doing for his membership.

297
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:34,702
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not often, you know, I've been on the council for a number of years now, and it's not often to see this many people in the chamber.

298
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:41,223
[SPEAKER_10]: week in and week out, week in and week out, right, the issue needs to be addressed.

299
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:53,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I as one Councilor proposed it in the past and I still believe that this council should not approve any new positions in any reclassifications of existing positions until such time as the existing employees that we have in City Hall taken care of.

300
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:56,009
[SPEAKER_10]: That means that these contracts should be settled.

301
00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:03,715
[SPEAKER_10]: We shouldn't be given any new, creating new positions or reclassifying existing positions until these people right here are taken care of.

302
00:28:03,896 --> 00:28:09,600
[SPEAKER_10]: The five groups that are going to be going to mediation reach some sort of satisfactory conclusion that we can all live with.

303
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:16,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Because ultimately it's bringing the morale down in the city to the point where I wonder how these people get up every day and go to work because they're not feeling respected.

304
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:17,887
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not feeling valued.

305
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:20,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not the values that we share.

306
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:23,946
[SPEAKER_10]: So I agree with the speaker.

307
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:30,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if it weren't for him coming up here every week and keeping the full court press on, I think this would be an easy walk for the administration.

308
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:37,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Steve's doing his job and he's really making us aware of a lot of things that are going on behind closed doors, things that we don't get to see.

309
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:41,557
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that this is the transparency administration, but it's not very transparent sometimes.

310
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:46,600
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank him for taking the time, energy and effort to come up here week in and week out.

311
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,142
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the gentleman represents many, many, many, many units, not just Medford.

312
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:54,322
[SPEAKER_10]: But every time there's a meeting, he's here, he gives this time to come here and do this.

313
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:57,325
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's not wrong on top of it.

314
00:28:57,606 --> 00:28:58,246
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not wrong.

315
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:05,574
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, you know, I'm of the firm belief that no new positions, no reclassifications until these contracts get taken care of.

316
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:07,076
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to take care of our existing employees.

317
00:29:07,096 --> 00:29:08,618
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to show them that they're valued and respected.

318
00:29:08,918 --> 00:29:10,860
[SPEAKER_10]: If the administration isn't going to do it, then we need to do it.

319
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

320
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,601
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in prison.

321
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:19,182
[SPEAKER_19]: Did we not get an email last week, saying that our legal fees last year were $450,000?

322
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:20,542
[SPEAKER_19]: We did.

323
00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:22,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we got that.

324
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:25,644
[SPEAKER_19]: So the gentleman's talking about exorbitant legal fees.

325
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:35,027
[SPEAKER_19]: How are all these, how was the city providing, KP Laws providing legal for the whole city of Medford in fighting these lawsuits all for $450,000?

326
00:29:38,138 --> 00:29:43,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the administration and KP law have been very clear that they don't represent the whole entire city they represent the mayor's office.

327
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:53,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Well they seem to be working for every department but they're only representing the mayor's, the mayor's interests, because they're the mayor's private lawyer, that's who their client is what so no one's representing the taxpayer.

328
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:57,263
[SPEAKER_19]: Every, every department in the city is using KP law.

329
00:29:59,055 --> 00:30:00,816
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're also fighting all these lawsuits.

330
00:30:00,836 --> 00:30:04,998
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't understand how all these are getting done, how everyone's using them.

331
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:12,782
[SPEAKER_19]: We're fighting lawsuits for 450,000 and we only agreed to $6,000 a month on our budget.

332
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:21,566
[SPEAKER_19]: So when you say exorbitant law, what would you be saying for exorbitant law?

333
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,488
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, to fight all these cases that we're fighting.

334
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:39,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I have the, the municipal experience that all of you do behind the rail but I can tell you that out of all the communities that I just named, including dozens of other ones that local 25 represents bargaining units and

335
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:46,681
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Medford is the only community that does not have a city solicitor and assistant city solicitor.

336
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:54,985
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason being, and as a taxpayer it's, it's worrisome for me is, you know, you can pay a city solicitor 130 150,000 a year.

337
00:30:58,466 --> 00:31:07,536
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a finite cost, but the legal bills for a law firm like KP Law, the possibilities are endless.

338
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:13,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Everett and Malden and Chelsea and Newton and Waltham, they have city solicitors.

339
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:20,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these communities have three, four, five, six solicitors, but no one has zero, nobody.

340
00:31:21,117 --> 00:31:21,778
[SPEAKER_00]: only Medford.

341
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:31,411
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe if I remember correctly, you know better than me, but I believe we haven't had a city solicitor or assistant solicitor, I think, since October of 2022, if I remember correctly.

342
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an assistant since January 2020 I mean one or one of the end I know but nobody.

343
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:39,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's bad.

344
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:46,284
[SPEAKER_00]: So now instead of paying 130, whatever you were paying the previous 130 a year or whatever.

345
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:52,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know it's whatever hundreds of dollars per hour instead of a finite salary.

346
00:31:53,147 --> 00:32:01,790
[SPEAKER_10]: On that point though Madam President, the council passed an ordinance, probably 60 years ago, and the ordinance says there shall be a city solicitor.

347
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:09,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And the legislative intent is that for my research, behind that ordinance was to control legal costs so that we don't end up in a situation like this.

348
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:13,864
[SPEAKER_10]: So ultimately we have an administration that's working outside the scope of the existing ordinances.

349
00:32:14,564 --> 00:32:21,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And she did take an oath to say that she would, to the best of her ability, uphold the ordinances of this community when she got elected to office.

350
00:32:22,325 --> 00:32:22,686
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

351
00:32:22,706 --> 00:32:23,846
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

352
00:32:23,946 --> 00:32:24,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

353
00:32:24,886 --> 00:32:28,447
[SPEAKER_17]: And to that point, I have a resolution that will be up later that

354
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:33,199
[SPEAKER_17]: that will speak specifically to that and I'll make some recommendations with that.

355
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:36,968
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I wanted to do is really just thank you, Mr. South.

356
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:37,389
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that...

357
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:42,364
[SPEAKER_17]: The common cry from this council is a lack of communication.

358
00:32:42,844 --> 00:32:44,565
[SPEAKER_17]: And last week was a great example.

359
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:56,933
[SPEAKER_17]: When we're sitting here and we're asked to provide votes for raises for non union employees and then when Councilor Knight asked, but it's funny because it's not the name it's not the position.

360
00:32:57,313 --> 00:33:02,957
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the calf so what Council night recommended or asked, could you please give us the name of the position for those caps.

361
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:13,706
[SPEAKER_17]: And what the chief of staff did say first was the mayor and the city council to us as a you know forget about the mayor that's whatever decision but it's a council.

362
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:19,291
[SPEAKER_17]: We were never even talked about because we would have not even entertained just even bring that up.

363
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:26,057
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I find it hard to believe that, again, is there a representative from the city.

364
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:30,000
[SPEAKER_22]: Tonight, there is not the administration told me they would not be sending him on tonight.

365
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:32,148
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so that just tells you.

366
00:33:32,228 --> 00:33:48,284
[SPEAKER_17]: So last week, I believe it was comments were made that, you know, the facts sometimes that you are presenting aren't true, but for one person, I appreciate the facts you are sharing, and it's easy to find out if your facts are true or not.

367
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:54,249
[SPEAKER_17]: with one phone call or one Google of what you're saying and they come to fruition.

368
00:33:54,289 --> 00:34:14,485
[SPEAKER_17]: So not like I had to, but I wanted to make sure because it's easy to come to that podium as administration and defend themselves because it's all they seem to be doing and look at this council and call us bullies because we're asking questions that pertain to serious matters of all of our constituents, all of our city members.

369
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:17,207
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're in a spot right now that

370
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:29,716
[SPEAKER_17]: What you're hearing with our union situation, I think, is just a smaller piece of where we are in this community.

371
00:34:30,758 --> 00:34:31,719
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in a sinking ship.

372
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:34,849
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in a tailspin.

373
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,134
[SPEAKER_17]: And as a resident and a homeowner.

374
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:50,871
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm petrified, but I do want to thank you and your members again, I, I have not will not vote for money paper until I've been very clear, I will not vote for any money paper until

375
00:34:51,828 --> 00:35:03,601
[SPEAKER_17]: We see financial paperwork that's showing us our direction, and that our union members are taking care of, because this has gone long enough four and a half years.

376
00:35:03,962 --> 00:35:04,702
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a disgrace.

377
00:35:05,363 --> 00:35:05,563
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.

378
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,527
[SPEAKER_17]: So we talked about cost of living just last year went up seven and a half percent.

379
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:11,543
[SPEAKER_00]: and their healthcare goes up every year.

380
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:20,311
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're getting another, we're getting another kick now with healthcare, with the elimination of Tufts, I believe, GAC now is now moving to Harvard.

381
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,572
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to see a bigger kick now.

382
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:29,338
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, thank you, Madam President, allow me to speak, but thank you, Mr. South for sharing that information.

383
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:32,000
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor, Scarpelli.

384
00:35:32,441 --> 00:35:33,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

385
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:38,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. South for your presentation and for the information that you're giving us.

386
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:56,501
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, much respect to everyone who's here tonight but this clerical thing I mean I had people calling me or messaging me communicating with me last week and it's, you know, four and a half years a lot four and a half years for some of the lowest paid workers in the city is a lot more.

387
00:35:58,062 --> 00:36:08,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's just, it's just, it's a shame we can use all the words that we want to use but you know, everyone deserves better than what they're getting in these long delays.

388
00:36:09,872 --> 00:36:13,465
[SPEAKER_03]: put it in my calendar for the 13th and I'm gonna be there and I'm gonna appreciate that.

389
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:15,703
[SPEAKER_03]: the notice on that.

390
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:19,946
[SPEAKER_03]: The other pieces I wanna say is, and I respect my colleagues, their approach, right?

391
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:22,208
[SPEAKER_03]: We may not always agree on exactly the approach.

392
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:24,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite frankly, I don't think this administration cares what we do.

393
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:26,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they cared more.

394
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:29,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you on using our power in the best ways that we can.

395
00:36:29,894 --> 00:36:32,836
[SPEAKER_03]: We've tried to use our power a lot and it doesn't seem to be making a lot of difference.

396
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:41,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure actually, probably you and your members sometimes feel a similar way that you've said your piece many, many, many times and it doesn't seem to be getting through their head, right?

397
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:49,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so, you know, the piece of this discussion for me and I think the piece that all seven of us and you and I hope everyone in this room do do agree on is.

398
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:56,516
[SPEAKER_03]: know, this question around the finances, you know, if every other community can provide this, why can't we?

399
00:36:56,877 --> 00:36:58,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not getting a straight answer on that.

400
00:36:58,998 --> 00:37:09,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And my response is, once we get a straight answer on that, if their answer, if we get a straight answer, we see the numbers, the math laid out before us, and the answer is no, then we have to say, okay, then how do we get the money to give a fair contract, right?

401
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:12,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And until we have that information, we can't even engage in that discussion.

402
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:14,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the place that we want to be.

403
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:22,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all seven of us behind this council is to say, what is it going to take for us to be able to give a fair contract.

404
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:28,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the answer we're not getting at all on any front and I'm sure you're not getting it and you're getting stonewalled as well.

405
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:40,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we, you know, I can give you an easy fix is to hire a city solicitor, and you save three 400,000 a year or more right off the bat.

406
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:53,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and I just want to clarify one thing when I mentioned earlier about the money paper from last week, I do want to clarify that everyone we believe everybody deserves a raise non union,

407
00:37:55,206 --> 00:38:12,589
[SPEAKER_00]: the city council management, even the mayor, but you know what, you can't have the whole city without contracts and then put in for yourselves to get, you know, a huge retro and several years of raises while half the city starving.

408
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:23,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have people in the clerical unit, literally have called me crying, saying we can't pay our bills, crying, like hysterical and how are we gonna do this?

409
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:26,323
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one seems to care.

410
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:32,466
[SPEAKER_00]: They hear it right from their mouths at negotiations and no one seems to care.

411
00:38:32,486 --> 00:38:38,390
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing when we're talking about facts, again, I like dealing in facts.

412
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:44,453
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomorrow on top of all the updated labor charges and litigations, I'm also gonna provide you with

413
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:48,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's too much for you, just hit delete.

414
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:53,845
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to send you all of these recent contracts, just so that you can see it for yourselves.

415
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:57,487
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you the MOAs, which are the outlines of the new contracts.

416
00:38:57,847 --> 00:39:04,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see for yourself that all of the surrounding communities are able to afford fair contracts.

417
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:06,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know why I meant for Kent as well.

418
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:06,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

419
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:08,859
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and that's much appreciated.

420
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:09,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hear you too.

421
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:14,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the minute that we saw that we were on the list and the mayor was on the list, I think all of us said, absolutely not.

422
00:39:14,762 --> 00:39:16,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And we moved up, removed that immediately from the paper.

423
00:39:17,223 --> 00:39:21,326
[SPEAKER_00]: So- Once everyone in this room gets a raise, God bless you guys.

424
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:26,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Take us whatever you need to do and the mayor and our whole staff and everybody.

425
00:39:26,608 --> 00:39:31,311
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say the camera guy.

426
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,092
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs it more than anybody.

427
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:33,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

428
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,251
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we just want what's fair, nothing more, nothing less.

429
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:43,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the line that, you know, we're not gonna do that when there's all these contracts out, it's not fair.

430
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:44,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

431
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:45,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

432
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:47,453
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, and I do see a few councilors wanna speak again.

433
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:51,613
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanna note, we do have some extensive presentations on the agenda, so I just wanna note that.

434
00:39:52,274 --> 00:39:52,934
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caraviello.

435
00:39:53,554 --> 00:39:54,334
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

436
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:58,855
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanna thank all the workers who show up to work every day.

437
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:01,315
[SPEAKER_19]: I thank the teachers who showed up to work every day.

438
00:40:01,756 --> 00:40:03,596
[SPEAKER_19]: No one has gone on strike in the city,

439
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,382
[SPEAKER_19]: And I applaud everybody for not doing that.

440
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:10,965
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care whether you're in the union or a non-union person.

441
00:40:11,446 --> 00:40:12,566
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone deserves a raise.

442
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:16,569
[SPEAKER_19]: Cost of living has gone up through the roof this year.

443
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,511
[SPEAKER_19]: What's inflation at, like eight or 9% this year?

444
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:21,493
[SPEAKER_19]: It was up to 8.3, I believe, last year.

445
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:21,493
8%.

446
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:23,595
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're offering two.

447
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:27,878
[SPEAKER_19]: Even three is really slim.

448
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:30,020
[SPEAKER_19]: It's still not cutting what

449
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Inflation goes with it, sensei.

450
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:34,083
[SPEAKER_19]: And I stand with my other colleagues.

451
00:40:34,123 --> 00:40:42,368
[SPEAKER_19]: I will not support any department head or any boss or anybody getting a raise for the working people of the city get a raise.

452
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:48,072
[SPEAKER_19]: I come from a family who operated a union factory for 40 years.

453
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:56,457
[SPEAKER_19]: And we always make sure the workers are taken care of first because they're the ones who are the lifeblood of either the company or the city.

454
00:40:57,338 --> 00:40:58,559
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's how it always should be.

455
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:00,200
[SPEAKER_19]: And it should never be any other way.

456
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:01,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

457
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:04,205

[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good evening, president and council members.

496
00:44:31,911 --> 00:44:34,913
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Bin Zhu, project manager from Capital Delivery.

497
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:42,739
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we are very happy to be here to introduce a patty project that we plan to do in Medford for bus stop improvement.

498
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:53,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, John, our team is from our design consultant HDR teams and our MBTA sponsor department, service planning and bus transformation.

499
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,712
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a slide, the second slide,

500
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:02,913
[SPEAKER_01]: will be show the MBTA bus project overview.

501
00:45:02,973 --> 00:45:12,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So this as a part of around 10 billion multiple years capital investment plans, we are improving the bus service with a better bus program.

502
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:16,557
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are multiple projects under the bus transformation.

503
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:20,958
[SPEAKER_01]: So Petty project in the yellow highlight box is one of the bus transformation.

504
00:45:21,498 --> 00:45:31,613
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are working in the partnership with the state of Medford and different other municipality and agency to improve the bus stop for safe and accessible.

505
00:45:32,234 --> 00:45:32,955
[SPEAKER_01]: So next slide.

506
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:38,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So next slide, I want to talk about more details about the PETI project.

507
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:49,921
[SPEAKER_01]: PETI project is to create the ADA compliant bus stop in system wide for our customers and community members.

508
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:54,723
[SPEAKER_01]: So who have a different mobility needs and improve the customer safeties.

509
00:45:55,223 --> 00:45:58,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the 1990s, all municipality and agency required to

510
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:04,859
[SPEAKER_01]: upgrade their pedestrian infrastructures to meet ADA requirements.

511
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:12,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Disability advocate brought a lawsuit against MBTA to provide the ADA compliant to mass transit for our systems.

512
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:17,430
[SPEAKER_01]: So improve the bus stop system-wide is a part of a settlement agreement.

513
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,089
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bus stop in St.

514
00:46:20,129 --> 00:46:26,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Alfred, Medford had been prioritized for design this year due to the one or more excessive barriers.

515
00:46:26,955 --> 00:46:33,961
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some also bus stops need to consolidate or improvement to make assessment and the safety enhancement.

516
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:45,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bus stop scope work increase improvement to the sidewalks, creation of the crosswalk, ADA compliant curb ramps and bus stop signs.

517
00:46:46,164 --> 00:46:54,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So MBTA signs all the progress of plans to the City of Medford for review during the design process.

518
00:46:54,349 --> 00:47:00,253
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have got the proof, we will be have on-call contractor to build all the bus stop as soon as possible.

519
00:47:00,853 --> 00:47:06,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So we estimate invested $2 million in design construction in City of Medford.

520
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:14,341
[SPEAKER_01]: So the MBTA was found by the federal revenues, state bond, and FTA fundings to perform this work.

521
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:15,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So next slide.

00:47:38,207 --> 00:47:38,768
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, sure.

526
00:47:38,828 --> 00:47:43,530
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess just to go back to the first slide, I'll introduce Justin, just to give an overview

527
00:47:44,453 --> 00:47:48,236
[SPEAKER_21]: the better bus project because there are multiple MBTA projects.

528
00:47:48,276 --> 00:47:53,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure thing.

529
00:47:54,081 --> 00:48:03,729
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought I'd just level set with everyone before we launch into the details of the specific stops that Ben brings before you this evening.

530
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,543
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Justin Antos.

531
00:48:05,623 --> 00:48:15,968
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the Senior Director of Bus Transformation at the T. And I oversee the portfolio of activities that the T is undertaking called the Better Bus Project.

532
00:48:16,908 --> 00:48:20,750
[SPEAKER_15]: When you email betterbusproject at mbta.com, that's me.

533
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:23,992
[SPEAKER_15]: I see all those emails and I have someone managing that inbox.

534
00:48:26,726 --> 00:48:34,188
[SPEAKER_15]: So there are a number of initiatives at the MBTA all trying, seeking to make the bus better.

535
00:48:34,529 --> 00:48:39,771
[SPEAKER_15]: As you can see on this slide, one of them is the network redesign.

536
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:51,495
[SPEAKER_15]: And before I leave the network redesign, I want to acknowledge a miscommunication between this body and the MBTA that occurred last fall as the, I'm sorry,

537
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:58,347
[SPEAKER_15]: He said when we needed something as the project was transitioning from.

538
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:58,989
[SPEAKER_15]: I know this is.

539
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:07,009
[SPEAKER_15]: inside baseball for state administration, but as the project was transferring from the Mass.

540
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:22,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Department of Transportation's Office of Transportation Planning to the bus transformation team at the MBTA, we had a communications breakdown and we understood that you all sent a message to our general manager's office that did not make it to the project office requesting a briefing on the network redesign.

541
00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:26,795
[SPEAKER_15]: So I apologize on behalf of the MBTA and my team for missing that communication.

542
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:42,318
[SPEAKER_22]: just if I could briefly just knowing you're the person who gets the emails at that email address, I'm sure you have very many unhappy Medford residents because through the bus network redesign, we've lost a number of routes that are really going to deeply impact our community in a negative way.

543
00:49:42,778 --> 00:49:45,760
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just want to say that before we go, I know that's not what you're presenting on tonight.

544
00:49:46,341 --> 00:49:47,762
[SPEAKER_22]: But that is that is a fact.

545
00:49:48,242 --> 00:49:49,263
[SPEAKER_22]: So I want to make sure that's clear.

546
00:49:49,764 --> 00:50:00,135
[SPEAKER_15]: We definitely heard a lot, a lot of comments from Medford residents that think the project received over 20,000 individual comments, a lot of them from Medford, absolutely.

547
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:07,803
[SPEAKER_15]: But I show you this slide just to show how the various activities that the MBTA underway for better bus.

548
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:21,824
[SPEAKER_15]: My colleagues here from the PADI project are aiming to make our bus stops more accessible, and that is aligned with, but not actually the exact same teams within the MBTA as the network redesign.

549
00:50:24,425 --> 00:50:25,145
[SPEAKER_22]: President Bears.

550
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:26,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

551
00:50:26,225 --> 00:50:27,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.

552
00:50:27,286 --> 00:50:28,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for acknowledging.

553
00:50:29,846 --> 00:50:30,587
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.

554
00:50:31,187 --> 00:50:34,168
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely had several meetings over the course of the first

555
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:50,065
[SPEAKER_03]: First issuance comment period the re issuance of the of the network redesign, you know, some of our comments we felt were really heard around the 80 bus, but we didn't know that, that those comments would be then trading out the 94 I believe or is it the 96 I can't quite 94 to 94.

556
00:50:50,105 --> 00:50:51,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know I think you know I spoke at the.

557
00:50:56,824 --> 00:50:58,265
[SPEAKER_03]: the last public hearing as well.

558
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:08,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did hear that there may be room for some slight minor adjustments going forward, but that basically after the process was concluded, it felt like, you know, this is this is the network that you're going with.

559
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:09,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate that.

560
00:51:09,758 --> 00:51:13,682
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also, you know, definitely want to share that there's definitely still a lot of concerns.

561
00:51:13,763 --> 00:51:14,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I live

562
00:51:14,483 --> 00:51:32,965
[SPEAKER_03]: in a place where you know I used to take the 710 from my house when I was in high school down to the mall, and over to the hospital you know and then that was a bus we use and I understand where you're going with all of this but but that love that loss and moving from the express buses we have to now attach the Burlington Express bus route and you know there's there's just there's

563
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:48,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Some serious loss of service for folks, and the reason I just bring that all up is just my only question before we get into the Patty project details are any of these requests for elimination related to the bus network redesign of eliminating stops right now or is that all about the Patty project.

564
00:51:49,722 --> 00:51:56,704
[SPEAKER_15]: This is all for the PADI project and we've aligned our projects except for one stop, which I believe these two are going to get into.

565
00:51:56,945 --> 00:52:02,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but I guess more than that, and then we can talk about the specific details on the improvements.

566
00:52:02,867 --> 00:52:12,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess just my question is, if we move forward on these eliminations of stops, is that because of PADI or because of bus network redesign?

567
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you saying it's a bit of both because you're merging your work?

568
00:52:15,998 --> 00:52:18,259
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly Patty, but I'll let these folks.

569
00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:19,820
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be introduced for details.

570
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:20,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

571
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:20,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

572
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:20,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

573
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make sure while we, while we have you and, and again, appreciate you being here.

574
00:52:25,002 --> 00:52:31,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, I think there's one, one piece, you know, if it's the Patty project, which I know has been a long ongoing effort, that's one thing.

575
00:52:32,105 --> 00:52:40,148
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's partially bus network redesign, you know, there may be more questions and engagement with the public that we need to make around the removal of stops.

576
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:43,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we'll have as much problem with the improvements on these specific locations.

577
00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:45,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously improvements are great.

578
00:52:45,821 --> 00:53:02,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the removals where there may need to be a little bit more public engagement, especially given that kind of we were on our, you know, and again I appreciate the acknowledgement but we were kind of out on our own a little bit last fall and it was hard for us without having you here to give a presentation and then have members of the public be here for it and then maybe even ask us questions or.

579
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:11,800
[SPEAKER_03]: or provide some comment that we could then question, provide, ask questions on, you know, that was just a little bit of a breakdown where we have a lot of people who still have kind of outstanding concerns and questions.

580
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think moving forward with removal of stops at this time, if they're part of the network redesign, may just need a little bit more care in terms of the process.

581
00:53:21,205 --> 00:53:25,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to ask that clarifying question before we got into the details, which I'm also very excited.

582
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:35,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, all of the stops that we're going to talk about, that this team is going to talk about, will still be served in the future under the network redesign as well, with the exception of one.

583
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:37,489
[SPEAKER_15]: And you'll see a note on that in their first slide.

584
00:53:37,709 --> 00:53:38,950
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.

585
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's just because I see these here that make sense.

586
00:53:41,772 --> 00:53:46,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have, A, I'll say there's two of these stops around Winchester that you're asking for removal, so we can't help you.

587
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:49,697
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I thought I was like, do I really want to know those?

588
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:52,338
[SPEAKER_22]: It's right on the line.

589
00:53:52,378 --> 00:53:53,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it crossing?

590
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:54,800
[SPEAKER_21]: It's right on the line.

591
00:53:57,793 --> 00:54:01,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's for our notification because maybe we have residents walking across the line.

592
00:54:01,778 --> 00:54:02,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

593
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,343
[SPEAKER_22]: The town is what tipped me off.

594
00:54:05,904 --> 00:54:06,365
[SPEAKER_03]: City way.

595
00:54:06,885 --> 00:54:10,430
[SPEAKER_03]: But I appreciate the answer to the question and I look forward to the discussion.

596
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:10,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

597
00:54:12,092 --> 00:54:12,553
[SPEAKER_22]: Please continue.

598
00:54:14,766 --> 00:54:23,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we start the detail, I want to just quickly let all the councilmembers present know, PADI projects focus on the bus stop safety and ADA compliance.

599
00:54:23,857 --> 00:54:28,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Bus network redesign focus improve the operation and the customer experience.

600
00:54:29,284 --> 00:54:31,607
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the difference of two projects.

601
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:32,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

602
00:54:32,488 --> 00:54:32,809
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

603
00:54:36,082 --> 00:54:38,444
[SPEAKER_21]: So good evening, my name's Jackie Davis.

604
00:54:38,684 --> 00:54:42,906
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm here on behalf of the MBTA, but I work for HDR Engineering.

605
00:54:43,427 --> 00:54:54,094
[SPEAKER_21]: So before coming here tonight, I just wanna acknowledge that we've spent probably the last two years working with Todd Blake, the Director of Traffic and Transportation.

606
00:54:54,454 --> 00:54:57,576
[SPEAKER_21]: So we've reviewed all these plans and the elimination stops.

607
00:54:57,996 --> 00:55:05,481
[SPEAKER_21]: We previously had additional, so right now I'll show you 10 stops for, or 10 locations where we have improvements.

608
00:55:06,005 --> 00:55:08,506
[SPEAKER_21]: and then 17 stops that we have for eliminations.

609
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:17,651
[SPEAKER_21]: We did originally have more, but after hearing Todd's concerns, we have kept a few in the slide, so I can go over that later.

610
00:55:18,651 --> 00:55:31,158
[SPEAKER_21]: But so the first four stops here, Withrop Street at Robinson Street, we are relocating where the bus stop is, adding new curb ramps and adding crosswalks.

611
00:55:32,778 --> 00:55:42,804
[SPEAKER_21]: As what was mentioned, part of the bus network redesign placed at road at Cooley Road will be removed, but we are showing you the stop just for reference.

612
00:55:44,525 --> 00:56:00,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Boston Ave at High Street, where we're proposing new curb ramps, a crosswalk, and improved pedestrian refuge to a traffic island that will safely allow, I think it's eight feet wide, that will safely allow pedestrians to wait to cross the street.

613
00:56:01,824 --> 00:56:06,827
[SPEAKER_21]: And then Boston Ave at Arlington Street, where it's new crosswalks or new curb ramps.

614
00:56:08,508 --> 00:56:13,912
[SPEAKER_21]: Canal at High, where it's new crosswalks and markings.

615
00:56:14,452 --> 00:56:15,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just stop you for a second.

616
00:56:15,553 --> 00:56:17,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we just talk about Boston Ave and High Street real quick?

617
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:18,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

618
00:56:18,114 --> 00:56:19,795
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go into all of those.

619
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:23,798
[SPEAKER_21]: So I can go through it in more detail when we get there.

620
00:56:27,227 --> 00:56:40,473
[SPEAKER_21]: sorry, Salem Street at Allen Court, crosswalks, pedestrian ramps, and then bus paint markings.

621
00:56:41,094 --> 00:56:43,955
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the last three we're showing you are just for reference.

622
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:50,899
[SPEAKER_21]: One stop is on DOT jurisdiction, and the other two are DCR jurisdiction.

623
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:53,480
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's Highland Ave at Middlesex's MassDOT,

624
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:59,382
[SPEAKER_21]: Highland at Waddell Street is DCR and then Fells Way West at Foss is DCR.

625
00:57:01,163 --> 00:57:15,769
[SPEAKER_21]: So the first up here, Winchester at Robinson, you can see the dashed blue line shows the existing stop on the north side and where that's being proposed, where it's proposed to be moved to.

626
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:23,092
[SPEAKER_21]: In the photos on the right, the middle photo shows the existing stop location and then the proposed stop

627
00:57:23,947 --> 00:57:24,787
[SPEAKER_21]: shows where it would be.

628
00:57:24,827 --> 00:57:32,931
[SPEAKER_21]: So right where that post with the bike shared the space sign is.

629
00:57:33,872 --> 00:57:39,574
[SPEAKER_21]: So on these plans you'll see consistently throughout a box that says LA.

630
00:57:40,055 --> 00:57:42,136
[SPEAKER_21]: That LA is a landing area.

631
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:50,159
[SPEAKER_21]: Landing areas vary between 10 feet wide by 10 feet wide or 8 feet wide by 8 feet wide.

632
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,480
[SPEAKER_21]: You'll also see

633
00:57:52,058 --> 00:58:01,024
[SPEAKER_21]: a small, sometimes it's light gray, CZ, which is called the clear zone, that is eight feet wide by four feet wide.

634
00:58:01,465 --> 00:58:15,455
[SPEAKER_21]: So the landing area is the area where the front entrance of the bus allows the front doors to open and the ramp to fully deploy to allow someone in a wheelchair to enter or exit the bus.

635
00:58:15,695 --> 00:58:19,618
[SPEAKER_21]: The clear zone is the zone needed for those back doors on the bus to open.

636
00:58:21,423 --> 00:58:26,804
[SPEAKER_22]: On that one specifically, I live right over there and I walk that delay so I'm intimately familiar.

637
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:37,827
[SPEAKER_22]: The proposed stop, isn't there some significant trees there and some like, there's some like the sidewalks a little raised there, like not intentionally?

638
00:58:38,747 --> 00:58:45,489
[SPEAKER_21]: So there are trees, there's a few panels where we will have to raise the curb in these areas.

639
00:58:46,372 --> 00:58:54,634
[SPEAKER_21]: I should also mention at the landing areas and the clear zone areas, the curve needs to be six inches to eight inches high to allow the bus to fully deploy.

640
00:58:54,714 --> 00:58:57,734
[SPEAKER_21]: So there will be some work in those areas too.

641
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:01,895
[SPEAKER_21]: You'll basically see a leveling that will occur.

642
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:09,857
[SPEAKER_21]: So right now you have like a sloped area where this tree pit is, or a really warped or destroyed sidewalk panel.

643
00:59:09,937 --> 00:59:13,558
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll be fixing those sidewalk panels and then fixing that

644
00:59:14,577 --> 00:59:16,597
[SPEAKER_21]: where it's kind of like a grass strip area.

645
00:59:17,218 --> 00:59:25,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, and then just because this just made me think of it, are any of these proposals, will there be removal of trees to make these accommodations?

646
00:59:25,759 --> 00:59:27,119
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

647
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:29,620
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Tseng, sorry.

648
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:39,401
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just gonna say there are parking space removals, and we do understand that we will have to go in front of the parking council.

649
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:40,422
[SPEAKER_18]: Traffic commission.

650
00:59:40,462 --> 00:59:42,102
[SPEAKER_21]: Traffic commission for the approval of that.

651
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:51,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Something that I had heard was a concern with this stop is, so you're moving it from the south side to the north side of Robinson?

652
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:52,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

653
00:59:53,017 --> 00:59:59,421
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of the residents who might use that stop live on Winford Way and in that neighborhood over there.

654
00:59:59,461 --> 01:00:03,184
[SPEAKER_18]: And in order to access the new stop, they would have to pass by the old stop.

655
01:00:03,704 --> 01:00:10,148
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that doesn't seem to me to be super accessible because then they'd have to walk an extra distance there.

656
01:00:11,617 --> 01:00:12,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, do you want to finish?

657
01:00:13,038 --> 01:00:15,999
[SPEAKER_21]: But that gets into the elimination stop.

658
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:26,303
[SPEAKER_21]: So as part of this process, we did go through and do what's called the cluster analysis where we reviewed all the stops in Medford and the distance between each stop.

659
01:00:26,783 --> 01:00:33,166
[SPEAKER_21]: So currently, the MBTA bus systems laid out that you have approximately seven to 10 stops every mile.

660
01:00:34,086 --> 01:00:38,928
[SPEAKER_21]: So ideally, you would have four to seven stops per mile to

661
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,702
[SPEAKER_21]: improve the operations of the bus.

662
01:00:42,302 --> 01:00:46,907
[SPEAKER_21]: So there are the first few stops that we show as an elimination is that other stop.

663
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:51,991
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's because we understand that it does access that community.

664
01:00:52,492 --> 01:01:06,224
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you look at that area, there is a large stone retaining wall, there's a few driveways, and there's not really space for us to make a fully compliant bus landing area and clear zone on both sides of the street.

665
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:14,418
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's just something that what we have to keep in consideration is that I, I assume maybe.

666
01:01:15,319 --> 01:01:27,933
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition to that maybe part of the reason is the frequency of ridership at that stop as well, and I'm a little skeptical that moving it to the north side would necessarily meet the ridership figures that you'd want.

667
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:32,456
[SPEAKER_18]: because it becomes farther for a lot for most folks who would use that stop.

668
01:01:33,017 --> 01:01:36,279
[SPEAKER_18]: And I totally get that aerially it makes sense.

669
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,201
[SPEAKER_18]: When you look at the map that way.

670
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:46,447
[SPEAKER_18]: But then we're placing the stop basically on a very long stretch where there aren't many houses and like, and there isn't a neighborhood.

671
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:50,190
[SPEAKER_18]: And that doesn't seem to me to be maybe the most effective.

672
01:01:52,223 --> 01:02:15,917
[SPEAKER_18]: location for a bus stop, at least for me, I don't know if my other colleagues would agree, and I know there's the crosswalk idea to put it in with the improvement sounds great, but perhaps it might be more efficient to use that funding for maybe an RFB to cross Winthrop.

673
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:30,307
[SPEAKER_18]: given that it's a big road with a lot of traffic, perhaps moving, investing in an RFB at the southern entrance of Robinson might be a better investment of funds there.

674
01:02:31,276 --> 01:02:31,476
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

675
01:02:31,516 --> 01:02:34,578
[SPEAKER_22]: And I do want to jump in again again because I live right there.

676
01:02:34,898 --> 01:02:36,959
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand a little bit better now because Robinson is a you.

677
01:02:37,339 --> 01:02:53,488
[SPEAKER_22]: So now I realize we're talking about a different talking about a different part of the street than I thought so I have a better understanding of what we're looking at so there's not sure there's more warp sidewalk but the one I was talking about is not in that position, and to counter sense point, I think it's great adding the crosswalk there, there's probably a little bit more we could do again living right over there.

678
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:56,450
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a really treacherous spot to cross so I wanted

679
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:59,437
[SPEAKER_22]: whatever can be done to make that as safe as possible.

680
01:02:59,497 --> 01:03:02,781
[SPEAKER_21]: So RFPs can be added as a part of this project.

681
01:03:03,542 --> 01:03:05,725
[SPEAKER_21]: The MBTA will pay and install them.

682
01:03:06,246 --> 01:03:16,238
[SPEAKER_21]: The city of Medford will have to sign a MOU memorandum of understanding that all future maintenance would be on the city to repair and upkeep.

683
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:17,740
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

684
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,861
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Bears, did you have something to that point?

685
01:03:20,121 --> 01:03:25,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so when we pick up the locations, we talk about the clerks.

686
01:03:25,484 --> 01:03:29,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will be choosing location based on also nearby infrastructures.

687
01:03:29,727 --> 01:03:35,770
[SPEAKER_01]: So some nearby infrastructure is not feasible, maybe we cannot choose this location.

688
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,891
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like different factors.

689
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:44,135
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand the councilor's points, but we will be definitely to look through and then back to the councilors.

690
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:45,123
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

691
01:03:45,263 --> 01:03:46,084
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice president bears.

692
01:03:46,144 --> 01:03:46,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

693
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:54,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just going to move that for the record that we request an RFP at Winthrop and Clewley or the Winthrop and Robinson intersection.

694
01:03:54,068 --> 01:03:54,448
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

695
01:03:54,488 --> 01:03:54,628
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

696
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:56,569
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you have Mr. Clark?

697
01:03:59,470 --> 01:03:59,811
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

698
01:04:00,151 --> 01:04:02,872
[SPEAKER_22]: And just to affirm what you're seeking from the council.

699
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,754
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, obviously we have our feedback and things we would want.

700
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:12,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this something you need a vote of like affirmation on or is this something that is meant to be

701
01:04:12,772 --> 01:04:13,933
[SPEAKER_22]: a back and forth dialogue?

702
01:04:14,293 --> 01:04:17,095
[SPEAKER_21]: So it can be a back and forth dialogue.

703
01:04:17,596 --> 01:04:30,085
[SPEAKER_21]: Ideally, we would like a vote on if there are stops that you unanimously unanimously approve that we can work with Todd and move forward to so that we can get these stops into construction as soon as possible.

704
01:04:30,185 --> 01:04:33,067
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be our preference so that there is another step.

705
01:04:33,127 --> 01:04:37,871
[SPEAKER_21]: So once this is our preliminary 30% design, once we're done with the 30% design, we move to 100% design.

706
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:51,993
[SPEAKER_21]: where in between 30 and 100%, there are areas here that we need to work with the butters because we are using small pieces of their property to tie in to fix the grading at the back of the sidewalk.

707
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:56,436
[SPEAKER_21]: So to start that process, that's the lengthier process.

708
01:04:56,476 --> 01:05:01,980
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have notified all these butters twice and we have only heard feedback from one.

709
01:05:02,621 --> 01:05:07,805
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, and to clarify on that, so suggestions like adding the RFBs

710
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:11,132
[SPEAKER_22]: that would be considered as part of the affirmative vote?

711
01:05:11,552 --> 01:05:14,437
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

712
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:15,840
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Collins.

713
01:05:16,907 --> 01:05:17,687
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell.

714
01:05:17,707 --> 01:05:19,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much for the presentation so far.

715
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:23,190
[SPEAKER_20]: It's good to get into the details on some of these plan changes that we've been hearing about for a little while.

716
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:29,693
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll just say this at the top because it's gonna go for a lot of the other planned intersections.

717
01:05:29,733 --> 01:05:33,534
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that the RFP here is really important on Winthrop Street.

718
01:05:33,854 --> 01:05:35,515
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a busy street, it's a popular street.

719
01:05:35,655 --> 01:05:38,757
[SPEAKER_20]: It's well-traveled even in this kind of tucked away corner.

720
01:05:40,757 --> 01:05:46,420
[SPEAKER_20]: I think as one councilor, I'd very much like for that to be a part of our affirmative vote and for other, just so I don't say it,

721
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:47,500
[SPEAKER_20]: six more times.

722
01:05:47,841 --> 01:06:00,209
[SPEAKER_20]: I think for any of these streets that are being considered, you know, Boston Avenue, Salem Street, you know, Highland Ave at Middlesex, like a lot of these are very busy, very commercial, you know, well traveled by vehicles as well as pedestrians.

723
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:05,913
[SPEAKER_20]: As long as we're doing the crosswalk improvements, I think that we really have to see those flashing signs for pedestrian safety.

724
01:06:06,878 --> 01:06:07,899
[SPEAKER_20]: So just say that at the top.

725
01:06:07,919 --> 01:06:11,820
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I think for this crosswalk in particular, I'd love to have the director of traffic.

726
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:21,863
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that you've been liaising very closely with our draft director of traffic and transportation, but just to make sure that, you know, his local expertise is considered on this intersection in particular, before we go forward.

727
01:06:22,524 --> 01:06:22,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

728
01:06:23,044 --> 01:06:24,144
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

729
01:06:24,304 --> 01:06:24,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, ma'am.

730
01:06:25,225 --> 01:06:30,847
[SPEAKER_19]: It's always been common practice for the city to have to maintain the property after you do work on it.

731
01:06:35,805 --> 01:06:36,445
[SPEAKER_22]: Just one second.

732
01:06:36,465 --> 01:06:36,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

733
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:37,406
[SPEAKER_22]: Your mic's not on.

734
01:06:37,486 --> 01:06:38,406
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not your fault.

735
01:06:43,447 --> 01:06:45,188
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a little face talking.

736
01:06:45,228 --> 01:06:46,228
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

737
01:06:46,968 --> 01:06:47,188
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

738
01:06:47,308 --> 01:06:52,450
[SPEAKER_21]: So the MBTA, none of this infrastructure is the MBTA's infrastructure.

739
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:59,192
[SPEAKER_21]: So all of this infrastructure that we're showing you tonight and that we need your approval on is owned and maintained by the city of Medford.

740
01:06:59,612 --> 01:07:04,073
[SPEAKER_21]: So any, once the sidewalk is the same, so if,

741
01:07:04,923 --> 01:07:11,288
[SPEAKER_21]: in five years, something happens to the sidewalk, it would be on the city of Medford to maintain the sidewalk, not on the MBTA.

742
01:07:11,629 --> 01:07:12,389
[SPEAKER_19]: So what about the street?

743
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:13,550
[SPEAKER_19]: The street is ours too?

744
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:14,831
[SPEAKER_21]: The street is ours as well.

745
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:19,575
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

746
01:07:20,216 --> 01:07:25,260
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we can move on to the next one.

747
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,141
[SPEAKER_22]: I do, yeah.

748
01:07:33,972 --> 01:07:35,894
[SPEAKER_22]: I do see him on the call.

749
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:40,797
[SPEAKER_22]: Director Blake, are you available just to speak on this specific stop?

750
01:07:42,238 --> 01:07:43,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, I'm here.

751
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, everyone.

752
01:07:45,601 --> 01:07:45,921
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

753
01:07:48,743 --> 01:07:54,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Collins, you had a specific question or just deferring what the expert... Deferring.

754
01:07:54,868 --> 01:07:58,270
[SPEAKER_22]: Deferring your expertise stop, Director Blake.

755
01:08:03,483 --> 01:08:13,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, as some of you have mentioned, we appreciate the team's time and effort in trying to improve accessibility for the residents of Medford that use transit.

756
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:18,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of these we want to make sure it's best for the community.

757
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:31,836
[SPEAKER_12]: And some of these make sense and some of this one was a little peculiar because it seems like the stop at Winford Way in Robinson was more likely to be used by the neighborhood versus this particular stop.

758
01:08:32,548 --> 01:08:43,150
[SPEAKER_12]: So whichever stop remains and doesn't get eliminated, then it should be improved as others are asking for with an RFP and things of that nature.

759
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:56,852
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, it was, again, looking from the 30,000 foot, like an airplane level looking down, it makes sense that he's approached to space everything out somewhat evenly along the Winthrop Street corridor.

760
01:08:57,312 --> 01:09:01,353
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you look at actually where the users are coming from to the side streets,

761
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:12,348
[SPEAKER_12]: this particular stop didn't seem to make as much sense as the Winford Way and Robinson stop just down the street, which is being proposed to be eliminated.

762
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:17,812
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, we just had some question about that.

763
01:09:18,473 --> 01:09:24,837
[SPEAKER_12]: And I get the AT's approach, but again, sometimes the spacing is more of a guideline, a starting point.

764
01:09:25,498 --> 01:09:29,421
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe that stop at Winford is pretty close to place that road stop.

765
01:09:30,523 --> 01:09:35,445
[SPEAKER_12]: So from an overall perspective, it looks too close, and then it may be a wider gap.

766
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:42,869
[SPEAKER_12]: But it doesn't have to be exactly evenly spaced at quarter mile intervals if it doesn't serve the population that it's trying to serve.

767
01:09:43,709 --> 01:09:44,770
[SPEAKER_12]: So just to keep that in mind.

768
01:09:46,591 --> 01:09:47,371
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Director Blake.

769
01:09:47,431 --> 01:09:52,133
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, I guess a comment is, there does start to be an incline on that street.

770
01:09:52,774 --> 01:09:58,116
[SPEAKER_22]: As you move further up, further towards Winchester, I think if we're talking about accessibility, that's something that I'm sure you've considered it.

771
01:09:58,136 --> 01:09:59,697
[SPEAKER_22]: But I just want to put another plug for that.

772
01:10:00,332 --> 01:10:03,713
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so the crosswalk there does meet the stopping site distance over that part.

773
01:10:04,053 --> 01:10:09,755
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, but I think just also just getting to, you know, getting up that hill, I think is something that perhaps should be considered.

774
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:13,596
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

775
01:10:14,717 --> 01:10:15,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, if I may.

776
01:10:15,717 --> 01:10:16,277
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Neill.

777
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:20,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it really make sense for us to even debate every single position?

778
01:10:20,218 --> 01:10:28,941
[SPEAKER_10]: If we look at the report that the presenters have prepared for us, they tell us what the average weekday ridership is for each one of these stops.

779
01:10:29,482 --> 01:10:35,465
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, if there's less than 25 people a day, I have no problem eliminating those stops.

780
01:10:36,586 --> 01:10:37,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that, you know what I mean?

781
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:41,209
[SPEAKER_10]: If we really want to get this done, we're going to sit here and we're going to go over every single one of these things.

782
01:10:41,249 --> 01:10:48,533
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to talk about the one elderly person that lives up on Winford Way that takes the bus obviously on an average 0.1 times a month, right?

783
01:10:48,933 --> 01:10:54,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't we just look at it from a ridership standpoint and say, if the stops aren't being used effectively or efficiently, right?

784
01:10:54,956 --> 01:10:55,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Then just get rid of them.

785
01:10:56,357 --> 01:10:56,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

786
01:10:56,537 --> 01:11:02,860
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when I think that, yeah, there's two conversations, there's the elimination and then there's the right, right, I think you get the eliminations for the easy, easy discussion.

787
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,261
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, first, right, you're saying you want to take the elimination.

788
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:10,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think, I mean, that would be my suggestion right now be anything with less than 25 per day, just get rid of.

789
01:11:11,024 --> 01:11:13,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I certainly have no problem eliminating those.

790
01:11:13,705 --> 01:11:14,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, anything less than 25.

791
01:11:14,746 --> 01:11:16,106
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we can continue to go through the

792
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:21,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we don't have to do anything.

793
01:11:21,985 --> 01:11:23,265
[SPEAKER_10]: All they're doing is giving us a presentation.

794
01:11:23,285 --> 01:11:24,366
[SPEAKER_10]: They'd like us to do something.

795
01:11:24,406 --> 01:11:25,246
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have to do anything.

796
01:11:25,326 --> 01:11:26,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, what I'd like to see.

797
01:11:26,406 --> 01:11:27,386
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you may have seen that.

798
01:11:27,606 --> 01:11:30,427
[SPEAKER_22]: There are some, there are some strong feelings about this.

799
01:11:30,547 --> 01:11:46,190
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, what I'd like to see is that we do like a robocall like the mayor does for everything in the city when she has an opponent and says anybody that's in a bottle within what's the distance that she wants, 800 feet or something like that, that she proposed when she was on the council, anybody that's in that distance, we'll get a robocall and we'll discuss it.

800
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:48,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll get invited to a meeting and discuss that location.

801
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:52,134
[SPEAKER_10]: let the people in the neighborhood decide how it's going to affect them and the actual riders that are down there.

802
01:11:52,454 --> 01:11:52,995
[SPEAKER_22]: And I hear that.

803
01:11:53,015 --> 01:12:01,624
[SPEAKER_22]: I think what we're talking about now is the fact that there's an opportunity for improvements at the cost of the MBTA and making sure that we get all the improvements we can.

804
01:12:01,644 --> 01:12:07,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't think anybody behind the rails opposed to the MBTA doing accessibility

805
01:12:07,752 --> 01:12:08,253
[SPEAKER_10]: improvements.

806
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:09,614
[SPEAKER_10]: The gentleman explained it right.

807
01:12:09,634 --> 01:12:10,135
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

808
01:12:10,175 --> 01:12:15,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he said that the PADI program is for the MBTA to provide accessible ridership.

809
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,583
[SPEAKER_10]: The bus network redesign project is a totally different thing.

810
01:12:18,603 --> 01:12:20,145
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an operations thing, right?

811
01:12:20,165 --> 01:12:26,091
[SPEAKER_10]: So the redesigns operations, this is to improve the network's safety infrastructure for accessibility.

812
01:12:27,393 --> 01:12:29,816
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I don't think we should get too crazy about it.

813
01:12:29,836 --> 01:12:31,658
[SPEAKER_10]: They're willing to invest a lot of money in our community.

814
01:12:31,939 --> 01:12:34,562
[SPEAKER_10]: They have engineers, they have the tools and the requirements to do it.

815
01:12:35,543 --> 01:12:38,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So when it comes to that stuff, you know, I really don't have an issue with it.

816
01:12:38,888 --> 01:12:41,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that, you know, the T has to comply, right?

817
01:12:41,912 --> 01:12:43,033
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the subject of a lawsuit.

818
01:12:43,053 --> 01:12:44,495
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we say no, what are you going to do?

819
01:12:45,805 --> 01:13:07,030
[SPEAKER_01]: We do it anyway right, if you say no we we work with the judge or federal judge King we every, every month we need to report the federal judge king to Patty progress, right, so we need to, you know, all the municipality and the agency need to require to cooperate with MBTA, if I may, I respect Councilor point which is to let's move a little faster so maybe, maybe what we should just do is go through.

820
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:12,080
[SPEAKER_03]: let's go to, it seems like there's objections on G1, so we're gonna have to come back and revisit that.

821
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,361
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, and to be fair, I live right near G1, so I, you know.

822
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, both stops near, is that a disclosure or is that a review?

823
01:13:18,642 --> 01:13:20,143
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's a disclosure on the website.

824
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:22,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Both stops on either side of my block are on this list, so.

825
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:28,466
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I'm just saying, we may, there's some spots some of us are intimately familiar with, and perhaps we might have a little bit more insight, so.

826
01:13:28,506 --> 01:13:34,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if we, but could we, if we could go through and just say, let's say G2, and if any council raised an objection, we could put our thing out there,

827
01:13:34,829 --> 01:13:37,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that could go on a list for us to maybe come back and look at it.

828
01:13:37,672 --> 01:13:38,373
[SPEAKER_20]: Does anyone have.

829
01:13:40,535 --> 01:13:40,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

830
01:13:40,815 --> 01:13:55,150
[SPEAKER_20]: And just for clarity, in terms of procedurally, it seems to me that this is also an opportunity to start making that shortlist of additional improvements that we'd like to see at specific sites so just be able to log those for the record even if we're revisiting them chance to get more out of this opportunity.

831
01:13:55,594 --> 01:13:56,074
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Tseng.

832
01:13:56,234 --> 01:13:57,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah, that covers it.

833
01:13:57,375 --> 01:14:05,038
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's just about getting the best deal that we can as a city and then making sure that there's small, the details make logical sense from a on the ground lived perspective.

834
01:14:06,638 --> 01:14:06,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

835
01:14:06,838 --> 01:14:07,558
[SPEAKER_22]: Is everyone good on G1?

836
01:14:08,099 --> 01:14:09,599
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a macro guy, yes.

837
01:14:09,639 --> 01:14:15,661
[SPEAKER_22]: Going to G2, any comments on G2 and if there's anything you wanna?

838
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:21,704
[SPEAKER_21]: G2 is one of the locations that will be removed by the bus network redesign, but we didn't wanna leave it out.

839
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:24,965
[SPEAKER_21]: We wanted to show you that we had worked with Todd on this location

840
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:31,251
[SPEAKER_21]: And this was the one about her that we had heard concerns about that was opposed to this stop.

841
01:14:31,891 --> 01:14:33,512
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so the plan is so we're not getting that.

842
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:34,553
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so we're not doing this.

843
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:35,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so we're not getting that crosswalk.

844
01:14:35,974 --> 01:14:36,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Bummer.

845
01:14:37,074 --> 01:14:37,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

846
01:14:37,374 --> 01:14:39,536
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a super dangerous intersection that needs help.

847
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:43,819
[SPEAKER_21]: So so next is G3 Boston at High Street.

848
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:45,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one on this.

849
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,601
[SPEAKER_22]: I think everyone probably does.

850
01:14:48,582 --> 01:14:49,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Bears.

851
01:14:49,502 --> 01:14:50,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

852
01:14:52,077 --> 01:14:57,279
[SPEAKER_03]: In the 30% design thing here, are these bump outs, these gray areas?

853
01:14:57,839 --> 01:15:04,601
[SPEAKER_21]: So those gray areas, about two years ago when I was out on site, it was painted with flex posts.

854
01:15:05,121 --> 01:15:09,583
[SPEAKER_21]: So to help delineate the lane and slow down drivers in this area.

855
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:11,663
[SPEAKER_21]: So we are just restoring that.

856
01:15:12,303 --> 01:15:17,105
[SPEAKER_21]: We're fixing the paint, reinstalling the flex posts and

857
01:15:17,808 --> 01:15:19,249
[SPEAKER_21]: extending that median island.

858
01:15:19,309 --> 01:15:26,835
[SPEAKER_21]: So as I mentioned earlier, you'll have a refuge for pedestrians to walk halfway across the street, wait before they continue crossing the street.

859
01:15:27,035 --> 01:15:27,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Could we do bump outs?

860
01:15:28,756 --> 01:15:30,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna say, can we not do bump outs?

861
01:15:30,197 --> 01:15:31,198
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my position on this.

862
01:15:31,398 --> 01:15:39,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Like every person that lives in that neighborhood's complaining about those lollipop sticks they put up there and the amount of traffic that it creates down there during rush hours.

863
01:15:39,804 --> 01:15:45,008
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like... It's impassable in the morning.

864
01:15:45,395 --> 01:15:47,837
[SPEAKER_10]: impassable the way that it's designed right now with those lollipop sticks.

865
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,579
[SPEAKER_22]: It's also incredibly dangerous for pedestrians, so.

866
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:51,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Collins.

867
01:15:52,861 --> 01:16:02,248
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, yeah, this is another one where I was going to, you know, again, request for an RRFP at this intersection as well.

868
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:14,197
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm in the pro bump out camp, you know, I cycle through this intersection as well as drive and walk through it, and I think that's a, there's a real visceral need for those permanent structures.

869
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:26,485
[SPEAKER_21]: So this intersection, I do agree, does need a full redesign, but as part of this program, we're only allowed to improve the sidewalks that connect the bus stops.

870
01:16:27,085 --> 01:16:33,349
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're improving, we'll improve the sidewalks on both sides of the road and the crosswalks connecting from one stop to another.

871
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:39,553
[SPEAKER_21]: But we can't redesign the whole intersection.

872
01:16:39,934 --> 01:16:42,956
[SPEAKER_21]: So that would have to be another, I guess, conversation.

873
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:46,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just move to Oh, sorry, go ahead.

874
01:16:47,172 --> 01:16:51,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just gonna move to could we put in our RFP on the high street facing side.

875
01:16:51,959 --> 01:16:57,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that possible even if we're not adjusting the crosswalk or the or the intersection design.

876
01:16:58,151 --> 01:17:02,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think this stop, we talked with Todd, our director of engineer.

877
01:17:02,334 --> 01:17:12,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So this stop design based on Todd's comments, definitely we will be definitely consider the RFP if we come back, but I will give you a back specific later.

878
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:13,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

879
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:13,982
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

880
01:17:16,864 --> 01:17:21,727
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else on G3?

881
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:22,048
[SPEAKER_21]: G4?

882
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,969
[SPEAKER_21]: G4 is Boston at Arlington.

883
01:17:24,563 --> 01:17:28,245
[SPEAKER_21]: We are maintaining where the stops are today.

884
01:17:28,605 --> 01:17:45,632
[SPEAKER_21]: We do just need to lower the stop to allow space for the buses to fully come into the sidewalk and deploy for folks that are in wheelchairs to get in and out of that front door.

885
01:17:46,132 --> 01:17:51,655
[SPEAKER_21]: So today, being out there, it's jam-packed with cars.

886
01:17:52,457 --> 01:17:57,141
[SPEAKER_21]: and the bus is left in the travel lane and not able to get to the sidewalk.

887
01:18:00,464 --> 01:18:05,328
[SPEAKER_19]: We're good with G4.

888
01:18:06,109 --> 01:18:08,390
[SPEAKER_19]: On this side of Arlington Street, there is no sidewalk.

889
01:18:10,432 --> 01:18:12,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Similar to the other side of Boston Ave.

890
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:17,558
[SPEAKER_19]: On the Arlington Street side, there is no sidewalk on that side there.

891
01:18:17,598 --> 01:18:20,040
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just dirt.

892
01:18:22,671 --> 01:18:24,191
[SPEAKER_19]: So are you going to put a sidewalk there?

893
01:18:24,892 --> 01:18:30,513
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're not, we will, there will be a portion of cement concrete sidewalk there just to tie in.

894
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,033
[SPEAKER_19]: Will it come around the corner?

895
01:18:32,393 --> 01:18:33,053
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, it will.

896
01:18:33,373 --> 01:18:43,395
[SPEAKER_21]: As I say, there is no, there is a little bit off here because of the aerial, but it will come in probably about six or eight feet down on that street.

897
01:18:44,336 --> 01:18:46,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

898
01:18:46,336 --> 01:18:50,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So how far is your obligation of accessibility?

899
01:18:51,445 --> 01:18:53,266
[SPEAKER_07]: on city roadway when it comes to this project, right?

900
01:18:53,306 --> 01:18:54,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So the bus pulls up, the bus stop, right?

901
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:58,428
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gonna go, it looks like everything's about eight feet in each direction, right?

902
01:18:58,448 --> 01:18:59,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that about as far as you guys go?

903
01:18:59,688 --> 01:19:04,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what I'd hate to see, right, is like you guys do the beautiful corner, right?

904
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:12,893
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it comes and it stops and it turns into a gravel pit all the way down the street, which is gonna be the city's problem or the city's responsibility, right?

905
01:19:12,933 --> 01:19:14,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we've seen it in other places.

906
01:19:14,514 --> 01:19:16,695
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look in front of Paul Revere's, they did the whole entire,

907
01:19:18,109 --> 01:19:20,110
[SPEAKER_10]: over a couple of years ago, then they stopped.

908
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:25,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they stopped, it was like asphalt, potholes, tree branches all ripped up and everything else.

909
01:19:25,512 --> 01:19:29,093
[SPEAKER_10]: And it really didn't meet the goal of what we're really trying to do.

910
01:19:29,133 --> 01:19:34,615
[SPEAKER_10]: So when it comes to like the intersection improvements, like here, it looks like you go out a lot further here than you do over here.

911
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:37,716
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like you're not going too far over here, over there, over here, over there.

912
01:19:38,176 --> 01:19:43,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Which area, your scope of work, your work area scope, I guess, I don't know what you want to call it.

913
01:19:45,277 --> 01:19:56,043
[SPEAKER_21]: So the limits are defined by where, so on the southwest side, it's where the bus actually needs to deploy and open both doors.

914
01:19:56,163 --> 01:20:04,267
[SPEAKER_21]: So the back door through, so it's about 40 feet there, the back door through the curb ramp.

915
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:07,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so 40 feet is about that.

916
01:20:07,272 --> 01:20:09,855
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just where the bus right is.

917
01:20:10,235 --> 01:20:15,099
[SPEAKER_21]: So on you can see on the northeast side, that is all sidewalk it's in.

918
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:20,784
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just talking in general, not just this particular site, but so it's 40 feet for where the bus stop is.

919
01:20:20,825 --> 01:20:24,448
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if it was going, that seems like you're moving all the bus stops up to the corners.

920
01:20:25,148 --> 01:20:31,294
[SPEAKER_21]: So we are leaving these stops in the current location, but right, but in a lot of the other ones, it seems like you're moving up to the corners that you're doing.

921
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,191
[SPEAKER_07]: sidewalk repairs on the corners as well.

922
01:20:33,491 --> 01:20:35,872
[SPEAKER_07]: How far down on the corner are you gonna go?

923
01:20:35,892 --> 01:20:41,835
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the offside, it's however far we need to tie into the grading.

924
01:20:41,915 --> 01:20:43,076
[SPEAKER_21]: So it could vary.

925
01:20:43,136 --> 01:20:46,478
[SPEAKER_21]: So like the flare of the ramp can vary between.

926
01:20:46,678 --> 01:20:48,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's the gradient?

927
01:20:48,899 --> 01:20:51,600
[SPEAKER_07]: The appropriate gradient.

928
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,801
[SPEAKER_21]: So the ramp has to be compliant.

929
01:20:53,862 --> 01:20:58,324
[SPEAKER_21]: So with the place where it ramps down, that's a max seven and a half percent.

930
01:21:01,432 --> 01:21:01,672
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

931
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,972
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else on G4?

932
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving forward.

933
01:21:09,373 --> 01:21:12,334
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is High Street at Canal.

934
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:16,054
[SPEAKER_21]: So we are keeping the stops at their existing locations.

935
01:21:16,094 --> 01:21:23,996
[SPEAKER_21]: We're just improving the pavement markings in the area at the crosswalks and then to delineate the bus lanes.

936
01:21:24,516 --> 01:21:31,237
[SPEAKER_21]: You'll see on the south side, that stop is a little bit longer because of the parking in the area to allow for the bus to come into the sidewalk.

937
01:21:34,157 --> 01:21:34,997
[SPEAKER_22]: Getting on G5.

938
01:21:40,878 --> 01:21:46,219
[SPEAKER_21]: So G6 was recently reconstructed this last year by MassDOT.

939
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:49,620
[SPEAKER_21]: They have old bus signage out there.

940
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:54,961
[SPEAKER_21]: So this project, we are just moving the bus signage and replacing that.

941
01:21:56,081 --> 01:22:00,302
[SPEAKER_21]: So the stop on the south side would just be moved back a little further.

942
01:22:02,397 --> 01:22:02,657
[SPEAKER_22]: there in G6.

943
01:22:02,677 --> 01:22:03,437
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Tseng.

944
01:22:03,477 --> 01:22:05,558
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if this is a question for you guys.

945
01:22:05,578 --> 01:22:13,422
[SPEAKER_18]: It might be a question for Todd, for Director Blake, but is there parking going in where it's existing right now?

946
01:22:16,883 --> 01:22:21,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, is it?

947
01:22:21,445 --> 01:22:21,645
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

948
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:34,860
[SPEAKER_18]: This is because I know generally like if there's parking going in there that might block those lights, the line of sight, but I think, okay, got it.

949
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:35,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

950
01:22:38,302 --> 01:22:38,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

951
01:22:39,002 --> 01:22:41,104
[SPEAKER_10]: On this location and on the Hastings lane location.

952
01:22:43,575 --> 01:22:44,255
[SPEAKER_10]: across the street.

953
01:22:45,356 --> 01:22:47,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Hastings Lane is a very difficult road to get out of.

954
01:22:49,157 --> 01:22:50,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I grew up across the street.

955
01:22:50,117 --> 01:22:52,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I grew up on Whitman Road, so I could see Hastings Lane from my house.

956
01:22:52,998 --> 01:22:53,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I live on Whitman Street now.

957
01:22:54,818 --> 01:22:56,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I drive through this intersection every day.

958
01:22:56,658 --> 01:22:58,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Cars cannot get out of Hastings Lane as it is.

959
01:22:58,519 --> 01:23:01,100
[SPEAKER_10]: The closer you move that bus to the corner, the hotter it's going to be.

960
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,900
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're looking at where you're putting these two buses,

961
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:07,882
[SPEAKER_10]: You're moving one back closer to Woodman Street, one closer to Hastings Lane, so you're actually closing that side.

962
01:23:07,902 --> 01:23:08,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Other way around.

963
01:23:09,203 --> 01:23:09,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Other way around.

964
01:23:09,744 --> 01:23:11,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I looking at this thing upside down?

965
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,147
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're moving them farther away.

966
01:23:14,088 --> 01:23:14,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Farther away.

967
01:23:14,809 --> 01:23:15,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

968
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:16,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

969
01:23:16,671 --> 01:23:17,812
[SPEAKER_08]: To the dark blue circles.

970
01:23:18,132 --> 01:23:18,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

971
01:23:18,532 --> 01:23:19,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking at it the other way.

972
01:23:19,673 --> 01:23:20,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

973
01:23:21,095 --> 01:23:21,535
[SPEAKER_22]: It's hard.

974
01:23:22,176 --> 01:23:22,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

975
01:23:22,816 --> 01:23:24,278
[SPEAKER_08]: These are complicated directions.

976
01:23:24,358 --> 01:23:24,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah.

977
01:23:24,998 --> 01:23:25,399
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot.

978
01:23:25,539 --> 01:23:27,541
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of lines in this thing.

979
01:23:28,746 --> 01:23:30,447
[SPEAKER_21]: I had to go back and add in the boxes.

980
01:23:30,747 --> 01:23:32,387
[SPEAKER_21]: It was just a blank plan.

981
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:32,927
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

982
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:33,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Anything else on G6?

983
01:23:34,008 --> 01:23:36,489
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, moving forward.

984
01:23:37,889 --> 01:23:41,490
[SPEAKER_21]: So Salem Street at Allen Court.

985
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:43,831
[SPEAKER_21]: So this stop here.

986
01:23:45,308 --> 01:23:51,291
[SPEAKER_21]: we're moving the, on the north side, the existing stop stops within the crosswalk.

987
01:23:51,311 --> 01:23:54,872
[SPEAKER_21]: We are just moving that behind and improving the sidewalk in that area.

988
01:23:54,912 --> 01:24:00,234
[SPEAKER_21]: And then on the south side, keeping the stop where it is, but just lengthening that bus stop.

989
01:24:00,775 --> 01:24:09,238
[SPEAKER_21]: And per discussions with Todd, we're adding a bump out and extending the crosswalk on the Hadley Place side to reduce the crossing distance.

990
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:13,660
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Bears and then Councilor Svend.

991
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:14,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

992
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:17,786
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually, sorry, I raised my hand before you finished what you were saying and you answered my question.

993
01:24:17,806 --> 01:24:19,427
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a bump out on the, yeah.

994
01:24:19,607 --> 01:24:30,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is another one of those super dangerous intersections in the city and here, especially because you have a high speed, you know, coming off of the highway and, you know, people are coming off, pulling off to the right.

995
01:24:30,676 --> 01:24:36,320
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you end up with two lanes of traffic trying to come out of Hadley Place, one go left, one go right.

996
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:41,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, pedestrians and vehicles both are in a pretty tough situation there.

997
01:24:41,184 --> 01:24:43,286
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate these improvements.

998
01:24:43,346 --> 01:24:43,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

999
01:24:43,915 --> 01:24:44,656
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1000
01:24:46,217 --> 01:24:48,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm glad to see that there's a bump out there.

1001
01:24:48,198 --> 01:24:54,102
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Councilor Behr is very well articulated why we see the need for one.

1002
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:59,505
[SPEAKER_18]: I know the city has been, would want another bump out on the other side of Hadley.

1003
01:25:01,047 --> 01:25:02,247
[SPEAKER_18]: Has that been considered?

1004
01:25:03,508 --> 01:25:10,253
[SPEAKER_21]: So we did look at that with Todd, but the guidelines that we use were to accommodate WD-67.

1005
01:25:13,059 --> 01:25:16,260
[SPEAKER_21]: to make that turn, we decided to leave.

1006
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:20,020
[SPEAKER_21]: It wasn't, it was about a two foot bump out, so it wasn't worth.

1007
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:27,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, the heating just turned on, so it's suddenly become harder to hear you.

1008
01:25:27,342 --> 01:25:39,704
[SPEAKER_21]: So because of the truck that we used to make this turn, the bump out was only about a foot or two, so it wasn't, the improvement was like, it wasn't really an improvement.

1009
01:25:39,984 --> 01:25:41,504
[SPEAKER_21]: Didn't do anything to the crossing distance.

1010
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:42,701
[SPEAKER_18]: I see, okay.

1011
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:49,185
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is another RFB suggestion, but I think- There's one already there.

1012
01:25:49,265 --> 01:25:50,906
[SPEAKER_18]: At Crossing Salem?

1013
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:52,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Crossing Salem, yes.

1014
01:25:52,907 --> 01:25:53,568
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, got it.

1015
01:25:56,369 --> 01:25:56,670
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

1016
01:25:56,870 --> 01:26:02,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I guess it was noted to me that the sign already there is a 24-7 LED border sign and not an RFB.

1017
01:26:05,295 --> 01:26:07,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay, I thought it was, but okay.

1018
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:10,796
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I guess that was noted, yeah, for me.

1019
01:26:11,076 --> 01:26:15,097
[SPEAKER_18]: But I would suggest that we ask for an RFP there.

1020
01:26:16,197 --> 01:26:16,837
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1021
01:26:16,857 --> 01:26:17,557
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caraviello.

1022
01:26:18,277 --> 01:26:21,678
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

1023
01:26:21,778 --> 01:26:27,699
[SPEAKER_19]: On the Salem Street side, it looks like we're getting kind of close to that driveway where the Chippy Lou comes out.

1024
01:26:29,459 --> 01:26:31,059
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like you moved it back from where it was.

1025
01:26:31,099 --> 01:26:31,279
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

1026
01:26:35,633 --> 01:26:39,575
[SPEAKER_21]: So we removed the stop back so it was out of the crosswalk.

1027
01:26:39,935 --> 01:26:43,657
[SPEAKER_21]: So the back end of the bus won't block the Jiffy Lube driveway.

1028
01:26:43,677 --> 01:26:47,239
[SPEAKER_19]: No, but it looks like it's like right on the edge of their property.

1029
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:53,183
[SPEAKER_19]: So when you're gonna, you might interfere with cars coming out of the Jiffy Lube there.

1030
01:26:55,344 --> 01:27:01,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that's a tough turn because the cars are more wide there because there's a curb there.

1031
01:27:01,527 --> 01:27:02,708
[SPEAKER_19]: If you haven't gone to Jiffy Lube.

1032
01:27:03,842 --> 01:27:07,745
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a crib there, so the car's gonna kinda come out and go around.

1033
01:27:08,205 --> 01:27:08,445
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1034
01:27:09,666 --> 01:27:13,648
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so I mean, we can look at moving- You may wanna consider moving that back up a little speck.

1035
01:27:14,389 --> 01:27:16,750
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have the driveway in front to compete with?

1036
01:27:18,592 --> 01:27:21,934
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I don't know.

1037
01:27:21,974 --> 01:27:23,335
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, we can look at it again.

1038
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:40,638
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, like I said, it would just interfere with the business there, because like I said, their driveway kind of narrows out when it comes out, and if you ever have gone in, they kind of make you drive out and around when you come out of there, so you may want to take that into consideration.

1039
01:27:42,679 --> 01:27:42,919
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1040
01:27:44,539 --> 01:27:45,400
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else on G7?

1041
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,941
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, going forward.

1042
01:27:51,043 --> 01:27:51,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone's favorite.

1043
01:27:52,286 --> 01:27:58,450
[SPEAKER_21]: So this location is within DOT's jurisdiction, so we are just showing it today for reference.

1044
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:08,655
[SPEAKER_21]: But we are moving the stop on the north side to the far side of the driveway and just moving the stop on the south side just back slightly.

1045
01:28:13,598 --> 01:28:16,300
[SPEAKER_03]: But just really quickly, is there going to be an RFP there?

1046
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,302
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a pedestrian fatality, I think about 500 feet from this location pretty recently.

1047
01:28:20,703 --> 01:28:24,426
[SPEAKER_21]: So all of these stops will go through the MBTA permit process.

1048
01:28:24,446 --> 01:28:28,890
[SPEAKER_21]: So this will go to the MBTA permits engineer, they'll review it.

1049
01:28:29,490 --> 01:28:33,333
[SPEAKER_21]: And if they would like to add one there, then we can add one.

1050
01:28:33,593 --> 01:28:34,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you could just relay.

1051
01:28:35,315 --> 01:28:38,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we are working with the MassDOT permit engineer right now.

1052
01:28:38,357 --> 01:28:41,900
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will be having a meeting with them to review all the plans.

1053
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,442
[SPEAKER_01]: If they agree with the RFP, definitely we will be needed.

1054
01:28:45,098 --> 01:28:57,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've had a again we had a pedestrian fatality there recently there's a lot of accidents you have multiple pull outs from the, from the plazas and BJ's is now going to be doing some work on their property a little bit down the street as well and I know that there's a mass focus on this area.

1055
01:28:58,463 --> 01:29:02,226
[SPEAKER_03]: to improve the safety of it, so I just think whatever you can do there would be much appreciated.

1056
01:29:02,506 --> 01:29:09,932
[SPEAKER_21]: And if that is your recommendation, if we could just ask to put it in your meeting notes and we can forward those along with our permit to DOT.

1057
01:29:09,972 --> 01:29:18,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to make a formal motion that requesting additional pedestrian safety, including a RRFB at this location.

1058
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:19,259
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1059
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:21,681
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Collins.

1060
01:29:23,022 --> 01:29:24,042
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Berloz.

1061
01:29:24,163 --> 01:29:27,285
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just gonna make a similar comment about an RRFB.

1062
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:38,116
[SPEAKER_20]: at this location, and actually just for my understanding, sorry if you just said this, but just to make sure getting the, I wanna make sure my web of jurisdictions is accurate.

1063
01:29:38,636 --> 01:29:45,840
[SPEAKER_20]: So in this case, with this being a DOT jurisdiction crosswalk, we can pass the recommendations along to you.

1064
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:52,304
[SPEAKER_20]: You are liaising with them to get all the permits, but these improvements will be implemented by the DOT.

1065
01:29:53,204 --> 01:29:56,186
[SPEAKER_21]: They'll be implemented by the MBTA.

1066
01:29:57,362 --> 01:29:59,684
[SPEAKER_21]: Once the MBTA grants us a permit to do so.

1067
01:30:00,204 --> 01:30:02,505
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1068
01:30:02,525 --> 01:30:03,365
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1069
01:30:03,486 --> 01:30:03,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1070
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:08,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I, again, this is, this is totally here for it.

1071
01:30:08,668 --> 01:30:21,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, it looks like from the map that the crosswalk crossing Highland and Middlesex is on the north side of that intersection, and I know that they're actually new apartment complexes that have been built and that are going in.

1072
01:30:23,617 --> 01:30:24,617
[SPEAKER_18]: on the south side.

1073
01:30:24,977 --> 01:30:35,219
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I was wondering if there was a reason why the crosswalk is on the north side of the Wendy's driveway and not the south side of the Wendy's driveway, where there might be more pedestrian traffic.

1074
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:42,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure, so on the north side, ideally you'd have someone exiting the bus and crossing behind the bus.

1075
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:50,642
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we were to add the crosswalk on the south side, we wouldn't be able to have that far side bus stop location.

1076
01:30:51,543 --> 01:30:51,863
[SPEAKER_18]: I see.

1077
01:30:53,204 --> 01:31:02,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Where would it be possible to move the bus stop to the other side of the driveway and then to have the pedestrian crosswalk be behind that bus stop?

1078
01:31:04,172 --> 01:31:10,657
[SPEAKER_21]: We can go back and look at it, but ideally we would like the crosswalk on the far side of the intersection.

1079
01:31:11,287 --> 01:31:21,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I mean, I guess what I'm saying is it would, if you move the bus stop in front of the crosswalk, it would still be the far side, it would just be moved down a few yards.

1080
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:24,850
[SPEAKER_21]: So not for the stop on the south?

1081
01:31:26,811 --> 01:31:29,131
[SPEAKER_18]: For traffic going towards Wellington or?

1082
01:31:29,672 --> 01:31:36,173
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess for the stop on the bottom, if we move, that's what you're asking, you want the crosswalk on that side, where that stop is?

1083
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:39,134
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it would just make sense for our residents since we have more residents there.

1084
01:31:39,845 --> 01:31:42,227
[SPEAKER_18]: and there are more apartments there.

1085
01:31:44,228 --> 01:31:44,428
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1086
01:31:46,369 --> 01:31:48,951
[SPEAKER_21]: We can take it back and look at it.

1087
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:49,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much, yeah.

1088
01:31:50,092 --> 01:32:00,038
[SPEAKER_18]: And I really appreciate you presenting on these projects that we technically don't need to confirm, but you guys are still presenting to us anyways.

1089
01:32:00,338 --> 01:32:00,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1090
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:01,959
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caraviello.

1091
01:32:02,019 --> 01:32:03,440
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

1092
01:32:03,581 --> 01:32:05,662
[SPEAKER_19]: For this particular spot, this is,

1093
01:32:08,129 --> 01:32:11,290
[SPEAKER_19]: a very heavily traveled trafficked area.

1094
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:22,414
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got, I don't know if you know, but we've just approved a BJ's gas station there, which does, you know, if you've been to other BJ's gas stations, they're pretty busy.

1095
01:32:22,754 --> 01:32:26,435
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got that car wash across the street, which is packed all the time.

1096
01:32:27,255 --> 01:32:34,758
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know if you know, but there's a major supermarket going into that plaza also, along with the housing that's there.

1097
01:32:36,769 --> 01:32:41,911
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a, there's a lot of stuff happening in a few hundred yards of everything there.

1098
01:32:42,471 --> 01:32:45,833
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe you may want to take some time and re-look at this.

1099
01:32:45,853 --> 01:32:50,255
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you, if you knew about the supermarket going in there or the BJ's gas station going in there.

1100
01:32:50,975 --> 01:32:54,737
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe you may want to rethink some of the stuff there.

1101
01:32:54,817 --> 01:33:02,260
[SPEAKER_19]: As I say, there's just a lot of stuff happening in probably a 20 or 30 yard span of a thing there.

1102
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,741
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe you might want to maybe go closer to the supermarket,

1103
01:33:07,223 --> 01:33:10,306
[SPEAKER_19]: Before this one gets etched in stone, you should take another look at it.

1104
01:33:11,087 --> 01:33:13,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Take into consideration the things you learned tonight.

1105
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely, Councilor.

1106
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:19,175
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be taking notes to the MassDOT and then to take your advice.

1107
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:19,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1108
01:33:20,536 --> 01:33:20,797
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1109
01:33:20,817 --> 01:33:22,018
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else on G8?

1110
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,561
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving to G9.

1111
01:33:27,905 --> 01:33:31,727
[SPEAKER_21]: This location is under DCR's jurisdiction.

1112
01:33:32,967 --> 01:33:46,332
[SPEAKER_21]: So on the north side, we're keeping the stop where it is today, just lengthening the area for the bus and on the south side, we're moving it back behind the intersection closer to Benmore Street.

1113
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:48,668
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Tseng.

1114
01:33:49,308 --> 01:33:52,610
[SPEAKER_18]: This looks again, not our jurisdiction, right?

1115
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:54,590
[SPEAKER_18]: But it looks good to me.

1116
01:33:55,371 --> 01:34:00,813
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just wondering if we could ask for an RRFB crossing Highland since it's such a busy street.

1117
01:34:03,334 --> 01:34:14,298
[SPEAKER_21]: We can go back and work with DCR to have that.

1118
01:34:28,234 --> 01:34:35,078
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so the the stops currently at Waddle, but as you can see in the top photo, you're coming down that hill.

1119
01:34:35,118 --> 01:34:37,119
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a giant retaining wall there.

1120
01:34:37,859 --> 01:34:42,541
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no space for us to put a compliant ramp or stop there.

1121
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:50,345
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's why the bus was or bus stop.

1122
01:34:50,405 --> 01:34:52,186
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else on G9?

1123
01:34:53,767 --> 01:34:54,267
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to

1124
01:34:55,038 --> 01:34:59,200
[SPEAKER_22]: G10, which I believe Councilor Knight is our final one.

1125
01:35:02,001 --> 01:35:06,003
[SPEAKER_21]: So Fellsway West at Fox, we're keeping the bus stop where it is today.

1126
01:35:06,383 --> 01:35:07,964
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll just be in the photo.

1127
01:35:07,984 --> 01:35:11,386
[SPEAKER_21]: You can see there's kind of a dirt and gravel area there.

1128
01:35:11,406 --> 01:35:17,689
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be filling that in and formalizing the bus stop and adding two compliant ramps at the intersection.

1129
01:35:18,869 --> 01:35:19,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1130
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:20,130
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything on G10?

1131
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:22,351
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1132
01:35:22,451 --> 01:35:23,632
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we just have the

1133
01:35:24,789 --> 01:35:25,689
[SPEAKER_22]: stop eliminations.

1134
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:27,550
[SPEAKER_22]: I already read through them.

1135
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:33,493
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there any councilors wanting to speak additionally on these proposed eliminations?

1136
01:35:33,513 --> 01:35:34,493
[SPEAKER_22]: I have specific questions.

1137
01:35:37,414 --> 01:35:41,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going through them because I hadn't seen what councilor put out about the weekday ridership.

1138
01:35:41,696 --> 01:35:51,640
[SPEAKER_03]: The only one I have really any concern about is the two that I have any concern about are Bellsway at Central and Main Street at Windsor Road.

1139
01:35:52,387 --> 01:35:53,687
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if you could talk.

1140
01:35:53,707 --> 01:35:55,548
[SPEAKER_22]: What numbers are those?

1141
01:35:55,688 --> 01:35:56,568
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have numbers.

1142
01:35:56,728 --> 01:35:57,168
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1143
01:35:57,929 --> 01:35:59,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Or sorry, there's a number.

1144
01:36:01,110 --> 01:36:05,811
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be number three and number 16.

1145
01:36:07,832 --> 01:36:11,633
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

1146
01:36:16,282 --> 01:36:18,083
[SPEAKER_22]: So do you want me to go through each stop?

1147
01:36:18,363 --> 01:36:24,466
[SPEAKER_22]: No, if you just, if you want to speak to Main Street at Windsor and then Fells Way at Central, I know Vice President Bears has some concerns.

1148
01:36:25,507 --> 01:36:31,110
[SPEAKER_21]: So Main Street at Windsor was removed because the closest stop was 420 feet away.

1149
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:33,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is where, if you have that?

1150
01:36:34,532 --> 01:36:36,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have it further down the PowerPoint?

1151
01:36:36,193 --> 01:36:37,373
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have my hand up in front of me.

1152
01:36:38,174 --> 01:36:38,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1153
01:36:47,357 --> 01:36:49,218
[SPEAKER_21]: I will come back to you with where exactly that is.

1154
01:36:49,238 --> 01:36:49,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1155
01:36:51,279 --> 01:36:53,881
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the other was the last slide.

1156
01:36:57,203 --> 01:36:58,244
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right at Central.

1157
01:36:58,744 --> 01:37:07,050
[SPEAKER_21]: Here in this, the closest stop was 690 feet with the ridership on the bus route 100 being 52.

1158
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:07,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1159
01:37:13,214 --> 01:37:17,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you just let me know which, like, are they going to have to cross central, you know, are they going to have to cross the Felsworth?

1160
01:37:17,115 --> 01:37:19,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to have to cross central?

1161
01:37:19,056 --> 01:37:21,276
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also kind of a dangerous intersection.

1162
01:37:21,296 --> 01:37:27,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it, you know, some of these, the 0.1 rider per day, and I'm not quite to the 0.1 rider a day.

1163
01:37:27,058 --> 01:37:36,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even, you know, who is it, you know, one person every 10 days or something, but like, you know, 50 people a day, it's not, that's pretty, you know, it's not nothing.

1164
01:37:37,381 --> 01:37:40,542
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably marginal when your guys are looking at numbers that are much higher than that.

1165
01:37:40,662 --> 01:37:42,803
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, especially at a dangerous intersection on a,

1166
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:45,751
[SPEAKER_03]: road where people speed where they shouldn't.

1167
01:37:47,071 --> 01:37:52,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure there's not any weird crossings that we're adding to people to walk another quarter mile or so, or a little less than that, but.

1168
01:37:53,253 --> 01:37:56,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure, yeah, I can let you know where those are and get you the cluster map.

1169
01:37:57,014 --> 01:37:57,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

1170
01:37:57,714 --> 01:38:00,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, I'm sorry.

1171
01:38:01,035 --> 01:38:01,375
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

1172
01:38:01,395 --> 01:38:02,876
[SPEAKER_03]: The only other one is Hyatt Hillside.

1173
01:38:02,896 --> 01:38:05,757
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like right near the Medford Public Library, our new library.

1174
01:38:05,777 --> 01:38:10,118
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just remembered, sorry, I just remembered that, sorry to jump in, but

1175
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:23,574
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is one that we did talk about with Todd, because the city had just done the pedestrian ramps at this location.

1176
01:38:24,354 --> 01:38:36,218
[SPEAKER_21]: And the two stops, it says it's 670, or the closest stop is 670 feet away, but it was just up the hill is that next stop.

1177
01:38:37,699 --> 01:38:41,040
[SPEAKER_21]: So I know this is one that we did discuss.

1178
01:38:42,453 --> 01:38:45,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the next stop is up the hill at like Powder House or something?

1179
01:38:47,335 --> 01:38:47,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1180
01:38:51,017 --> 01:38:51,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1181
01:38:52,578 --> 01:38:55,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, you know, a lot of people take the bus to the library.

1182
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,521
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe it's only 50 people a day.

1183
01:38:57,561 --> 01:39:00,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what it is in here, something like that.

1184
01:39:00,402 --> 01:39:03,984
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's just one I'll, I'd like to hold over if possible.

1185
01:39:09,186 --> 01:39:09,787
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, Councilor Tseng.

1186
01:39:22,205 --> 01:39:24,747
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's just the opposite of the central one, right?

1187
01:39:25,027 --> 01:39:27,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the other side of the street, yeah.

1188
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:32,851
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Collins.

1189
01:39:33,752 --> 01:39:34,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1190
01:39:39,435 --> 01:39:51,603
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess just I wanted to add my, I think this has been expressed, but I think obviously talking about different scopes, guys think in terms of the entire transit system, for us, we're representing people, you know,

1191
01:39:52,077 --> 01:39:54,278
[SPEAKER_20]: get around the city of Medford, get it to adjoining communities.

1192
01:39:55,719 --> 01:40:10,287
[SPEAKER_20]: In terms of the average weekly riders, I'm sure that 50 per day is kind of a drop in the bucket in terms of your scope, but in terms of this community and our size, especially thinking about how for a lot of people, if they're taking the bus, it's because they don't have any other option.

1193
01:40:10,667 --> 01:40:20,072
[SPEAKER_20]: So just another voice in the chorus for these bus stops that are in the ballpark of 40 to 50 or more weekday riders, I think that I just wanna take another

1194
01:40:21,212 --> 01:40:26,333
[SPEAKER_20]: moment or two week period to make sure that you know, effective butters people who for whom this is an important part of their commute.

1195
01:40:27,934 --> 01:40:30,014
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a small number but it's also a fairly significant number.

1196
01:40:30,034 --> 01:40:30,855
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1197
01:40:33,775 --> 01:40:35,256
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Dr. Collins.

1198
01:40:36,716 --> 01:40:42,958
[SPEAKER_22]: Any further discussion at this time we have a number of motions regarding cancer night, as the

1199
01:40:43,754 --> 01:40:48,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Director of Transportation, done any community outreach to any of the neighborhoods about this?

1200
01:40:48,317 --> 01:40:52,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Or has this all been done through the MBTA's public participation process?

1201
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:56,963
[SPEAKER_22]: Director Blake, is this something that's also coming out of City Hall?

1202
01:40:57,003 --> 01:40:58,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me just make sure you're still on the call.

1203
01:40:58,324 --> 01:40:58,785
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, there, sorry.

1204
01:40:59,405 --> 01:41:00,486
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry if your hand has been up for a while.

1205
01:41:00,886 --> 01:41:07,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this something that's also coming out from City Hall, or is this just coming from MBTA as far as reaching out to folks about these changes?

1206
01:41:09,036 --> 01:41:23,265
[SPEAKER_12]: So usually if it's a project generated by a third party, such as the T or private entity, as with Eversource later in the evening, it's on that project to do outreach and then whatever we recommend to them to do outreach.

1207
01:41:23,325 --> 01:41:28,728
[SPEAKER_12]: So in this case, we recommended a robocall for them to go through Steve Smarty, send out the call.

1208
01:41:29,529 --> 01:41:34,292
[SPEAKER_12]: We recommend language, things like that, but it's usually driven by whoever's proposing the project.

1209
01:41:35,312 --> 01:41:37,994
[SPEAKER_12]: My hand was also up because for the SOP elimination,

1210
01:41:38,871 --> 01:41:58,283
[SPEAKER_12]: discussion, I, you know, it seems to me that there may be a error on Main Street because it looks like Stearns, Windsor, and Wellesley, it looks like three stops in a row may be supposed to be eliminated, so that may be too much for that section of Selzmanford, so maybe they should reconsider that one.

1211
01:42:03,587 --> 01:42:10,373
[SPEAKER_10]: My suggestion, Madam President, before we even take a position on this, that as a city, we do outreach to the residents that are going to be most affected by it.

1212
01:42:11,009 --> 01:42:16,611
[SPEAKER_10]: We've made preliminary recommendations that you can come back to us with their responses to those preliminary recommendations in the interim.

1213
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:17,452
[SPEAKER_10]: We can do some outreach.

1214
01:42:17,872 --> 01:42:22,474
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems to me like the city's done no outreach to any of the residents in the neighborhood, so this is going to factor impact.

1215
01:42:23,794 --> 01:42:31,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Regardless of whether or not it's a third-party project or not, I think if we're using Eversource as the baseline or the example, we better do it different than we did it with Eversource.

1216
01:42:31,577 --> 01:42:35,018
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we've gotten a lot of pushback and a lot of calls.

1217
01:42:35,139 --> 01:42:35,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1218
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,880
[SPEAKER_10]: The Safer School Project from a lot of us that were in there,

1219
01:42:43,937 --> 01:42:48,260
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think if we're going to do this, Madam President, we should do our own due diligence as well.

1220
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:53,104
[SPEAKER_10]: We will buy in a house, we wouldn't just take what the real estate agent was telling us, we'd do our own due diligence.

1221
01:42:53,485 --> 01:42:56,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that that's something that we need to do before we as a council take a position on it.

1222
01:42:57,485 --> 01:43:01,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly don't have any opposition to many of the proposals that are before us.

1223
01:43:01,168 --> 01:43:02,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's something that needs to be done.

1224
01:43:03,009 --> 01:43:07,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong, but I also don't want to be the one that says, I can't believe you put that bus in front of my house.

1225
01:43:07,273 --> 01:43:07,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I didn't.

1226
01:43:07,673 --> 01:43:09,334
[SPEAKER_10]: You had an opportunity to come to 100 meetings.

1227
01:43:09,354 --> 01:43:09,915
[SPEAKER_10]: You knew about it.

1228
01:43:10,495 --> 01:43:11,015
[SPEAKER_10]: We reached out.

1229
01:43:11,035 --> 01:43:12,036
[SPEAKER_10]: We did our due diligence.

1230
01:43:12,056 --> 01:43:18,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's important, especially with the lack of communication that we've been receiving from the coroner office for the past three years.

1231
01:43:19,642 --> 01:43:19,862
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1232
01:43:20,062 --> 01:43:21,163
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Tseng.

1233
01:43:21,383 --> 01:43:23,325
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually wholeheartedly agree with Councilor Knight.

1234
01:43:24,938 --> 01:43:26,859
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the great project.

1235
01:43:27,479 --> 01:43:31,600
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you've heard a lot of agreements on a lot of a lot of this stops some suggestions.

1236
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:43,044
[SPEAKER_18]: We saw, there's some information that you guys have said that you'll get back to us, we should I think I would like to motion to table, just until we get that information until we are able to reach out to the public.

1237
01:43:44,205 --> 01:43:49,328
[SPEAKER_18]: and especially about the bus stop eliminations that have more ridership as well.

1238
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:55,873
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important to put that out into the community and get feedback and to make sure that everyone has a chance to give some feedback.

1239
01:43:55,993 --> 01:44:02,998
[SPEAKER_18]: And there might be people who don't wanna see changes whether they're at places too or they wanna see changes in front of their places.

1240
01:44:03,038 --> 01:44:04,379
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think this is a good chance to.

1241
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:10,484
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and we do have a number of just motions as far as the recommendations or changes we wanna see.

1242
01:44:10,504 --> 01:44:12,405
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanna make sure we address those before

1243
01:44:13,172 --> 01:44:14,652
[SPEAKER_22]: a voted table.

1244
01:44:17,393 --> 01:44:17,653
[SPEAKER_22]: Less than 25.

1245
01:44:20,694 --> 01:44:21,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

1246
01:44:21,794 --> 01:44:21,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1247
01:44:22,834 --> 01:44:23,414
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice and bears.

1248
01:44:23,714 --> 01:44:39,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just gonna see if you know if you guys so we have some of the requests for information, and it sounds like the council's an agreement that we want to kind of table this to a date certain so that we can do a little bit more outreach and residents can come to the meeting and if they like it they can say they like it if they don't they can say they don't we can kind of have that consideration.

1249
01:44:41,495 --> 01:44:47,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure for your guys purposes, it probably makes more sense to leave everything together rather than get on two different tracks here.

1250
01:44:47,817 --> 01:44:49,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's some, we don't have questions about some that we do.

1251
01:44:50,318 --> 01:44:56,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it okay if we just take the whole bulk and say table until that's Councilor Tseng his motion, but maybe to April 25th.

1252
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:04,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's a date when you could have the information back to us by on the requests that we've made, and then that gives us enough time to have communication with the public.

1253
01:45:04,982 --> 01:45:05,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that work?

1254
01:45:06,107 --> 01:45:08,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Councilor, two things I want to point out.

1255
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:09,790
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing is the public outreach.

1256
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:15,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we do the 30% design concept plan, we will be send all the letters to the voters.

1257
01:45:15,915 --> 01:45:18,497
[SPEAKER_01]: So we already do the public outreach.

1258
01:45:18,657 --> 01:45:23,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Second things, today we show your guys at 10 locations and the elimination plans.

1259
01:45:23,681 --> 01:45:29,326
[SPEAKER_01]: So we only need your guys approve the seven locations in the bus stop improvement.

1260
01:45:29,706 --> 01:45:34,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So elimination plans, the other three jurisdictions belong to MassDOT and DCR.

1261
01:45:34,650 --> 01:45:38,398
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need it we just say information only courtesy for your guys to review.

1262
01:45:38,518 --> 01:45:40,242
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a, I want to point out.

1263
01:45:41,003 --> 01:45:41,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1264
01:45:42,226 --> 01:45:44,090
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Collins and then counter saying.

1265
01:45:45,808 --> 01:45:46,249
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor say.

1266
01:45:46,469 --> 01:45:46,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1267
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:49,731
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I think for the public outreach part.

1268
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:51,071
[SPEAKER_18]: We know that you guys have done your part.

1269
01:45:51,151 --> 01:45:53,533
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about us doing argued diligence as well.

1270
01:45:53,573 --> 01:45:56,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to point out that, you know, no, no, I appreciate that.

1271
01:45:56,374 --> 01:45:58,716
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate you putting that, um, stating that record.

1272
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:11,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we've I think, as Councilor Mike reference, we're just other projects that we've done as the city before that we should have solicited solicited more people before we move forward before we agree to anything, even though

1273
01:46:11,643 --> 01:46:13,123
[SPEAKER_18]: as a council we might agree tonight to it.

1274
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:16,524
[SPEAKER_18]: We just want to give people the chance to give some feedback.

1275
01:46:17,124 --> 01:46:23,826
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know that there are projects like this with buses in the past the Medford that haven't been approved before.

1276
01:46:23,846 --> 01:46:33,848
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think this is a situation like that I think we're already making progress, but I think it's important to see, you know, to make sure that that BT is making commitments to

1277
01:46:35,878 --> 01:46:40,282
[SPEAKER_18]: that I think we all seem to agree on tonight, just to package it all together.

1278
01:46:40,302 --> 01:46:43,245
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I feel more comfortable with that.

1279
01:46:43,265 --> 01:46:44,286
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1280
01:46:44,306 --> 01:46:46,047
[SPEAKER_22]: So we have a number of motions.

1281
01:46:46,248 --> 01:46:51,272
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you want to combine them to focus on every single one right back to make sure we have them?

1282
01:46:54,936 --> 01:46:56,978
[SPEAKER_22]: Could you read them back, Mr. Clerk, just to make sure we have them all?

1283
01:46:57,758 --> 01:46:59,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I'd like them to have them all as well.

1284
01:47:01,541 --> 01:47:06,144
[SPEAKER_13]: On G1, Vice President Bears requested an RFP for Winthrop and Robinson Road.

1285
01:47:07,445 --> 01:47:11,748
[SPEAKER_13]: On G3, Councilor Collins requested an RFP for Boston Avenue and High Street.

1286
01:47:11,968 --> 01:47:17,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Bears requested an RFP for the High Street facing side.

1287
01:47:19,234 --> 01:47:23,317
[SPEAKER_13]: For G7, Councilor Tseng requested an RFP for Salem Street and Allen Court.

1288
01:47:23,877 --> 01:47:27,720
[SPEAKER_13]: For G8, I believe that was also Councilor Tseng,

1289
01:47:28,937 --> 01:47:36,922
[SPEAKER_13]: requesting an additional pedestrian safety and RFP at Highland at Middlesex.

1290
01:47:39,764 --> 01:47:45,388
[SPEAKER_13]: G9, Councilor Tseng requested an RFP crossing Highland at Waddell.

1291
01:47:47,063 --> 01:47:57,106
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I'm a little unclear because vice-president says vice-president said something about holding high at Highland and Councilor Tseng said Felsway and Medford.

1292
01:47:57,487 --> 01:47:58,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like we're holding all of it.

1293
01:47:58,607 --> 01:47:59,407
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can ignore that.

1294
01:47:59,447 --> 01:48:00,468
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought that was part of it.

1295
01:48:01,268 --> 01:48:02,528
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, yeah.

1296
01:48:02,808 --> 01:48:04,769
[SPEAKER_13]: But those are the, those are the RFP motions I have.

1297
01:48:05,089 --> 01:48:05,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's RFB.

1298
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:06,850
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

1299
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:08,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's B, RFB.

1300
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:09,811
[SPEAKER_21]: Rectangular RFP.

1301
01:48:09,851 --> 01:48:10,231
[SPEAKER_21]: RFP.

1302
01:48:10,311 --> 01:48:10,591
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1303
01:48:14,647 --> 01:48:26,414
[SPEAKER_21]: So do I have, do I have, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, just to, so it's rectangular rapid flashing beacon, but at G9, it's RR.

1304
01:48:27,535 --> 01:48:35,240
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's just going to, at Waddle, so the beacon would be closer to the Benmore side, not closer to Waddle.

1305
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:35,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1306
01:48:38,723 --> 01:48:42,105
[SPEAKER_22]: Great drive a motion to combine and approve.

1307
01:48:42,145 --> 01:48:42,345
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1308
01:48:42,665 --> 01:48:45,066
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion by Susan bears to combine all the motions and approve.

1309
01:48:45,106 --> 01:48:46,627
[SPEAKER_22]: Second, my Councilor Tseng all those in favor.

1310
01:48:47,188 --> 01:48:48,408
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed motion passes.

1311
01:48:48,448 --> 01:48:53,511
[SPEAKER_22]: And we have a motion from Councilor Tseng to table until a date certain and we'll get you all the meeting minutes.

1312
01:48:53,531 --> 01:48:54,511
[SPEAKER_22]: So you have all this as well.

1313
01:48:55,492 --> 01:48:59,754
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion Councilor Tseng to table to a date certain that date certain being April 25th could be amenable to that.

1314
01:49:00,234 --> 01:49:00,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1315
01:49:00,854 --> 01:49:01,755
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1316
01:49:01,795 --> 01:49:04,296
[SPEAKER_22]: Second by second by Susan bears.

1317
01:49:04,336 --> 01:49:05,037
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor.

1318
01:49:05,057 --> 01:49:07,598
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed motion passes.

1319
01:49:08,361 --> 01:49:09,082
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you all so much.

1320
01:49:09,422 --> 01:49:10,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all council members.

1321
01:49:19,169 --> 01:49:19,849
[SPEAKER_22]: Next, we have 23.

1322
01:49:20,069 --> 01:49:20,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, 28.

1323
01:49:20,169 --> 01:49:26,454
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1324
01:49:26,514 --> 01:49:30,737
[SPEAKER_22]: Offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1325
01:49:31,077 --> 01:49:36,081
[SPEAKER_22]: Be it resolved that Eversource provide an update to the Medford City Council, DPW, and Engineering Departments.

1326
01:49:36,922 --> 01:49:37,442
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caraviello?

1327
01:49:40,913 --> 01:49:49,158
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President, something I put on before, and I'm glad to hear tonight to give us an update on this ever going project.

1328
01:49:51,339 --> 01:49:51,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1329
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:52,840
[SPEAKER_22]: Please name and address, Dr. Please.

1330
01:49:52,940 --> 01:50:04,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good evening, Bob Coats, Eversource Energy, Vice President of Capital Construction, out of the South Borough of Mass office or Dorchester office or any of the offices.

1331
01:50:05,856 --> 01:50:11,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe you have the package, and I know we have a slide deck to present, and one of my colleagues who's presenting is a co-presenter.

1332
01:50:12,761 --> 01:50:14,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll go to slide one.

1333
01:50:14,442 --> 01:50:17,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to wait until it comes up on the screen?

1334
01:50:20,687 --> 01:50:29,093
[SPEAKER_05]: You all have a paper copy, but we did prepare it for the public viewing.

1335
01:50:29,293 --> 01:50:32,075
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if... Sujata should be a co-presenter.

1336
01:50:32,095 --> 01:50:32,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you...

1337
01:50:33,784 --> 01:50:34,425
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think I have it.

1338
01:50:34,665 --> 01:50:36,968
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to run downstairs and do it, but I can do it.

1339
01:50:37,388 --> 01:50:39,771
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, we can we can start without it.

1340
01:50:39,811 --> 01:50:40,912
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we have that's fine.

1341
01:50:41,013 --> 01:50:41,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1342
01:50:42,443 --> 01:50:42,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

1343
01:50:42,823 --> 01:50:48,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to give you a brief update on the project, the status of the project and our plans.

1344
01:50:49,007 --> 01:50:56,151
[SPEAKER_05]: When you look at page two, cable pulling conduit system vacuum testing, we've completed the entire conduit system at year end of 2022.

1345
01:50:56,451 --> 01:51:02,774
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's from the Winchester line to the Somerville line and beyond into those towns.

1346
01:51:03,375 --> 01:51:07,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Vacuum testing for that conduit system was completed successfully on January 15th, 2023.

1347
01:51:10,248 --> 01:51:11,828
[SPEAKER_05]: and cable pulling is almost complete.

1348
01:51:11,888 --> 01:51:18,670
[SPEAKER_05]: The last section from manual 14 to 15 is being pulled tomorrow, Thursday, and then we'll clean and test that on Friday.

1349
01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:22,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll, the cable will be all in the ground through the city of Medford by the end of the week.

1350
01:51:24,731 --> 01:51:28,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently on slide three, 41 sidewalk ramps are completed in 2022.

1351
01:51:29,332 --> 01:51:32,952
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 59 ramps to complete by the end of May in 2023.

1352
01:51:32,992 --> 01:51:33,732
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 15 in Medford,

1353
01:51:37,786 --> 01:51:44,431
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the jurisdictional lines are different for ownership, but three in Medford DCR and six in Medford DOT jurisdiction.

1354
01:51:45,052 --> 01:51:47,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Those will be done during daytime hours between 9 a.m.

1355
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:48,194
[SPEAKER_05]: and 3 p.m.

1356
01:51:49,175 --> 01:51:53,458
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be done multiple locations, work with the city departments.

1357
01:51:53,938 --> 01:52:06,128
[SPEAKER_05]: We've collaborated with the city engineer, traffic, police, TPW, and the mayor's office, and have a plan to work that off, and I'll show you the schedule down by section a little further on in the deck.

1358
01:52:07,630 --> 01:52:15,656
[SPEAKER_05]: On slide four, milling and paving, the remaining 8,800 linear feet are scheduled to be done this spring in the early summer.

1359
01:52:16,497 --> 01:52:32,148
[SPEAKER_05]: We've completed 4,300 feet in 2022, but you'll see the three sections that we're talking about from Winthrop Street, Victory Park on the Mystic Valley, South Street to Main Street, South Street to Union Street, and then down Mystic Ave to the MassDOT jurisdiction.

1360
01:52:32,886 --> 01:52:45,011
[SPEAKER_05]: We did do an outreach on Winthrop around the milling activity, held a Zoom call with the city and the butters to ask inquiring about that they want us to mill during the daytime or the nighttime.

1361
01:52:45,051 --> 01:52:54,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, the milling operations and the other two sections are nighttime operations, but we understand milling's a very noisy activity and we're worried about impact to the city residents.

1362
01:52:54,894 --> 01:52:55,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had a Zoom call.

1363
01:52:56,815 --> 01:53:01,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Only a few people were on that Zoom call and they highlighted the fact that, you know,

1364
01:53:02,165 --> 01:53:07,808
[SPEAKER_05]: In a nighttime operations, we can get more done, more hours, more passes, and don't have the traffic implications.

1365
01:53:07,848 --> 01:53:11,669
[SPEAKER_05]: We get that done in about five days on a daytime operations about 11 days.

1366
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:18,592
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're deferring to the city, city engineer for further discussion about whether that'll be permitted daytime or nighttime.

1367
01:53:19,013 --> 01:53:21,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We recognize that there's.

1368
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:21,574
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1369
01:53:26,687 --> 01:53:31,910
[SPEAKER_19]: that we repaid that from, from, from what the street down the victory Park, it's a pretty substandard job.

1370
01:53:32,311 --> 01:53:32,991
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know it's not.

1371
01:53:33,551 --> 01:53:38,414
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you guys blame the police department because you couldn't do it during the day.

1372
01:53:38,434 --> 01:53:39,775
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean during during the night.

1373
01:53:40,215 --> 01:53:41,396
[SPEAKER_19]: So you did it in piecemeal.

1374
01:53:42,237 --> 01:53:43,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Please don't do that and the rest of the project.

1375
01:53:44,498 --> 01:53:46,519
[SPEAKER_05]: So the rest of the paving is nighttime operation.

1376
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:52,383
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, because I say, and all due respect I wish you'd remill and do from Winthrop Street.

1377
01:53:53,282 --> 01:53:55,924
[SPEAKER_19]: part you already paved is the seams are coming apart.

1378
01:53:55,944 --> 01:53:59,968
[SPEAKER_19]: And like I said, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have accepted that job in my driveway at my house.

1379
01:54:00,689 --> 01:54:04,372
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you can look into repaving that again, just drive by there.

1380
01:54:04,812 --> 01:54:05,873
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll see what it looks like.

1381
01:54:06,093 --> 01:54:08,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll defer to the city engineer the direction city and they don't

1382
01:54:11,939 --> 01:54:17,384
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm telling you from what I see what I hear from people, and the President lives there we drive by it every day.

1383
01:54:18,145 --> 01:54:22,130
[SPEAKER_19]: We see the road coming apart already point of information.

1384
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:23,251
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that concert.

1385
01:54:23,791 --> 01:54:26,534
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that what was clear with us wasn't ever source.

1386
01:54:26,634 --> 01:54:28,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1387
01:54:28,416 --> 01:54:29,357
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the police.

1388
01:54:29,878 --> 01:54:32,200
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the city administration that

1389
01:54:32,981 --> 01:54:51,168
[SPEAKER_17]: didn't inform the neighbors that would have had the option that would have wanted what we see in Winchester and I believe Winchester, they gave you the approval to do one pass and that's the difference between the Winchester side and that side from the line to the high school to the satellites at Lawrence, as far as you're going, I'm sorry.

1390
01:54:52,702 --> 01:54:53,683
[SPEAKER_17]: the Victory Park side.

1391
01:54:54,003 --> 01:54:54,663
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

1392
01:54:54,683 --> 01:54:58,386
[SPEAKER_05]: The best practice is to pave without traffic and get it done in one shot.

1393
01:54:58,406 --> 01:55:01,908
[SPEAKER_19]: That was a very easy fix to get the traffic around that at night time.

1394
01:55:01,988 --> 01:55:13,915
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad to see that we're doing that, but I just want to be clear because I was going to apologize for that because I was one of the people that was really critical of coming to find out there was a lack of communication again.

1395
01:55:13,955 --> 01:55:15,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Possibly you paved in Mr. Gabb.

1396
01:55:16,357 --> 01:55:17,137
[SPEAKER_19]: It's starting to sink.

1397
01:55:17,958 --> 01:55:19,138
[SPEAKER_19]: They're puddling.

1398
01:55:19,759 --> 01:55:21,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, we're

1399
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:33,590
[SPEAKER_19]: City engineer city traffic they're giving us feedback we fixed a few locations already but it's still puddling and you're seeing some of the some of the whole sinking and South Street is really starting to come apart too.

1400
01:55:34,030 --> 01:55:40,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll be doing those as we pay them repay them so yeah you know the South Street will be repaid again, we have to mill and repay those sections.

1401
01:55:40,696 --> 01:55:42,077
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1402
01:55:42,117 --> 01:55:46,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to go from what you said is now it's been worked out to do the nighttime so you can do the one pass on the rest of this.

1403
01:55:46,982 --> 01:55:54,309
[SPEAKER_05]: We've worked with the city talked about the proposal and the city department city engineer, who's our chief facilitators doing a great job.

1404
01:55:54,749 --> 01:56:03,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. would tell us has worked through with the effort of the DPW the police and everybody and we're going to be able to do these paving sections at night.

1405
01:56:04,098 --> 01:56:04,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1406
01:56:04,939 --> 01:56:05,239
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1407
01:56:07,381 --> 01:56:24,436
[SPEAKER_17]: A few neighbors did reach out to me, and what's alarming is that there was an option for National Grid customers to add gas lines to their homes down Winthrop Street.

1408
01:56:25,296 --> 01:56:30,101
[SPEAKER_17]: What's bothersome to me, and I know that, I don't know if there's communications between two entities, but

1409
01:56:31,012 --> 01:56:42,736
[SPEAKER_17]: They were, they were just I was just informed that they were told that they plan to do the connections may 1, and we are looking to plan to hot top that area.

1410
01:56:43,477 --> 01:56:43,697
[SPEAKER_17]: April 15.

1411
01:56:44,957 --> 01:56:51,039
[SPEAKER_17]: So do you know if it's maybe it's not even with the ever so I speak but with Todd of Todd's on.

1412
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:54,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you shed some light on that because if that's the case.

1413
01:56:56,372 --> 01:57:05,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Does he know about this project that, it was a petition by neighbors on Winthrop Street to add gas lines, so.

1414
01:57:06,597 --> 01:57:11,400
[SPEAKER_22]: Director Blake, are you able to speak to that, or would that be something that Owen can only speak to?

1415
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:20,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe he doesn't, so I know the engineer, he's not on, right?

1416
01:57:20,505 --> 01:57:21,325
[SPEAKER_22]: I do not see him, no.

1417
01:57:23,477 --> 01:57:27,919
[SPEAKER_12]: If the question was about gas lines, that's not in my purview.

1418
01:57:27,939 --> 01:57:29,320
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know anything about that.

1419
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:31,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

1420
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:32,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1421
01:57:33,101 --> 01:57:46,726
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know that if this will reach out to the engineer, but is that that's a date already certain that something's already been to the to our schedule that we've already issued to the city and they agreed to.

1422
01:57:50,461 --> 01:57:58,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're still trying to work our way through and I know city engineers talking about whether there's a potential to mill Winthrop at night.

1423
01:57:59,828 --> 01:58:03,391
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're concerned that we only got two butters on the call that's not a consensus.

1424
01:58:03,831 --> 01:58:06,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to work that through and determine what the best approaches.

1425
01:58:06,533 --> 01:58:09,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now it's listed for the day we'll see where see where it goes.

1426
01:58:09,635 --> 01:58:11,537
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an opportunity there, potentially.

1427
01:58:12,397 --> 01:58:15,520
[SPEAKER_17]: So we make a decision as a community that this is what

1428
01:58:16,785 --> 01:58:32,698
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we're asking the but butters but if they're not getting back to us this is exactly why we are, we're getting the phone calls and what we are in the negative feedback on ever saw us because of the choppy work that was done because of the timeline that was presented by the city administration so

1429
01:58:35,230 --> 01:58:40,393
[SPEAKER_17]: this is where you have to take a stand as a city administration and say, hey, you know, this is what's best for the whole community.

1430
01:58:40,413 --> 01:58:43,495
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that it's five days rather than 11.

1431
01:58:44,055 --> 01:58:45,576
[SPEAKER_17]: It's no seams.

1432
01:58:45,936 --> 01:58:47,697
[SPEAKER_17]: It's one task.

1433
01:58:47,857 --> 01:58:48,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, interrupt.

1434
01:58:48,498 --> 01:58:49,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just this is just a milling.

1435
01:58:49,979 --> 01:58:51,840
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the paving the paving is right.

1436
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:52,440
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I'm right.

1437
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:53,221
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what I'm saying.

1438
01:58:53,361 --> 01:58:59,684
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the milling and the paving I think that so I think that's important that I think that all plays into one as what we're asking.

1439
01:58:59,864 --> 01:59:02,706
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

1440
01:59:03,512 --> 01:59:13,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Slide five shows you kind of the 2023 mitigation sections, and it's broken down by sections in the city, ramps, milling, casting, paving, and striping left to right on the schedule.

1441
01:59:14,677 --> 01:59:23,342
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can see that our plan right now is to have frankly everything, the ramps, the milling, castings, paving, all, and the striping done by the middle of July.

1442
01:59:25,002 --> 01:59:26,243
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our plan at this point in time.

1443
01:59:28,014 --> 01:59:33,798
[SPEAKER_05]: And these have to go sequentially, obviously, because you've got to mill, then you raise the castings, then you do the paving.

1444
01:59:33,918 --> 01:59:37,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to be clear, striping, there will be phased approach striping.

1445
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:38,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk about that in a few minutes.

1446
01:59:39,371 --> 01:59:42,133
[SPEAKER_05]: That would lead us then into July where we start cable slicing.

1447
01:59:43,154 --> 01:59:47,897
[SPEAKER_05]: In accordance with the MOU, we cannot slice cable until all the mitigations are done in the community.

1448
01:59:48,578 --> 01:59:54,562
[SPEAKER_05]: So starting in July, we'll work our way starting from the Winchester Street side down and start splicing the cable.

1449
01:59:55,083 --> 02:00:00,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Understand the splicing the cables, it's a truck, a crew around a manhole in the city street.

1450
02:00:01,587 --> 02:00:03,308
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe a small generator running, but that's it.

1451
02:00:04,369 --> 02:00:06,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And that'll be done sequentially down there.

1452
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:09,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will get us away from the school before the start of the school year.

1453
02:00:10,213 --> 02:00:16,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll be done with this cable slicing by mid-September, according to the schedule.

1454
02:00:16,316 --> 02:00:24,542
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's adjustments to the schedule, we post the schedule, we announce the schedule changes to the city through the city engineer's office, and then we post them on our website.

1455
02:00:25,302 --> 02:00:29,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And we still make the butter notifications in advance of these activities.

1456
02:00:31,807 --> 02:00:38,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, just and I apologize if I am doubling back, but just to confirm.

1457
02:00:38,194 --> 02:00:43,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say we mill Winthrop Street on the 418 to 420 timeline.

1458
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:46,944
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to castings or paving, you know, castings next thing going to paving.

1459
02:00:47,859 --> 02:00:56,406
[SPEAKER_03]: If NatGrid starts installing gas lines on May 1, do you have to remill the road at that point before you pave it, or is it going to be not a huge disruption?

1460
02:00:57,367 --> 02:01:02,611
[SPEAKER_05]: If the road is still milled, it's probably not a typical obstruction, unless it delays our paving.

1461
02:01:02,931 --> 02:01:03,051
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1462
02:01:04,198 --> 02:01:04,478
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1463
02:01:04,678 --> 02:01:07,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, I mean, I know, I know you're in close communication with Owen.

1464
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:11,623
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe just, you know, maybe he didn't know about the National Grid thing either.

1465
02:01:11,743 --> 02:01:15,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they were, you know, it's not, it's, it's home gas lines, right?

1466
02:01:15,285 --> 02:01:16,025
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a gas line.

1467
02:01:16,045 --> 02:01:16,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1468
02:01:16,165 --> 02:01:16,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1469
02:01:16,306 --> 02:01:16,546
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um,

1470
02:01:28,603 --> 02:01:30,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just just I just wanted to I hear you.

1471
02:01:30,924 --> 02:01:31,484
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.

1472
02:01:31,504 --> 02:01:38,887
[SPEAKER_03]: What you said makes perfect sense to me that obviously, you don't want to pave the road while they're cutting it up the same day or you know, you're gonna have to coordinate around that.

1473
02:01:38,927 --> 02:01:49,951
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just think that's the one the one outstanding piece here that I've heard so far that just hopefully the coordination can go back and make sure that everyone that national grid has informed the city so that the city can coordinate with you.

1474
02:01:50,543 --> 02:01:54,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and as part of our weekly project meetings with Mr. Bartella, we'll bring that up as well.

1475
02:01:55,167 --> 02:01:57,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

1476
02:01:57,869 --> 02:02:01,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I mean, ultimately the moratorium would come into effect right for the street opening moratorium.

1477
02:02:01,912 --> 02:02:05,074
[SPEAKER_10]: So these people wouldn't be able to get the street gets closed.

1478
02:02:05,114 --> 02:02:08,197
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not gonna be able to open the street for five years to get gas into the house.

1479
02:02:08,617 --> 02:02:09,958
[SPEAKER_10]: We gotta address this before this happens.

1480
02:02:12,278 --> 02:02:34,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the slide seven just kind of assumptions that are built into the schedule, you know we continue to work with the police department traffic DPW traffic city engineer on the plan to achieve the, the 2023 cable splicing completion by the end of September, middle of September at Medford will have a dedicated engineer to oversee the operations, we fund that engineer but they'll, they'll have an engineer.

1481
02:02:35,969 --> 02:02:46,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we share the weekly schedules with the police dpw city engineer and the like, and we make any updates and adjustments that to assure the public safety wheelchair ramp

1482
02:02:47,769 --> 02:02:54,671
[SPEAKER_05]: In safety activities, we submit traffic management plans and pedestrian management plans with Mr. Wattel and Director Blake.

1483
02:02:54,931 --> 02:03:02,533
[SPEAKER_05]: We go over those and make sure that everything's clear and concise with the police department and public safety's paramount and our concern as well to make sure it's done, number one.

1484
02:03:03,013 --> 02:03:11,995
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be in multiple locations on some of the sidewalk ramps, but we try to commit to be on one side of the street, not two sides of the street, to have approachments on both sides of the street.

1485
02:03:14,528 --> 02:03:21,109
[SPEAKER_05]: The bike lanes will be available and the casting adjustments will be sequenced so that there's two way traffic we can maintain two way traffic.

1486
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:37,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned that we've been going out to the butters we continue to notify two weeks out one week out 24 hours before around front of folks door hangers emails website activities construction schedules updated weekly on the project website and the city with the city's communication team.

1487
02:03:39,173 --> 02:03:41,494
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the biggest impact is Winthrop.

1488
02:03:41,534 --> 02:03:42,054
[SPEAKER_05]: It's noisy.

1489
02:03:42,174 --> 02:03:42,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

1490
02:03:43,434 --> 02:03:43,834
[SPEAKER_05]: We get it.

1491
02:03:43,994 --> 02:03:46,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're just looking to see if there's opportunity to accelerate that.

1492
02:03:47,955 --> 02:03:58,218
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, as the decision is from the current from the traffic engineer and the city engineer and the police department is to mill during the daytime, it does reduce work time.

1493
02:03:58,258 --> 02:04:04,159
[SPEAKER_05]: But I understand it's at the discretion of the city officials to determine public safety and the best operations.

1494
02:04:05,406 --> 02:04:06,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Roadway engineering.

1495
02:04:06,227 --> 02:04:17,094
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to pay both sides as I said during the, during the shift nighttime shift to avoid the cold joints that we've experienced the cold joint up and Winthrop Street will be repaired.

1496
02:04:17,855 --> 02:04:22,278
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some infrared technologies coming in the striping is going to be temporary striping.

1497
02:04:23,411 --> 02:04:36,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after the milling is done, we put temporary marking tapes down the double yellow line that we have to let the pavement cure before we do the permanent epoxy coated inlay marking.

1498
02:04:36,974 --> 02:04:40,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll occur sometime after that and of course with the schedule.

1499
02:04:40,835 --> 02:04:43,536
[SPEAKER_22]: What's the time between that temporary striping and the more permanent?

1500
02:04:43,856 --> 02:04:44,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry?

1501
02:04:44,636 --> 02:04:46,897
[SPEAKER_22]: What's the time between that temporary striping and the more permanent?

1502
02:04:46,937 --> 02:04:49,337
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we really had some issues with that earlier in the year.

1503
02:04:49,377 --> 02:04:51,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a couple of weeks.

1504
02:04:53,341 --> 02:04:55,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a couple of weeks for the curing to take place.

1505
02:04:55,823 --> 02:04:56,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1506
02:04:56,563 --> 02:04:59,826
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's about a couple of weeks for each section of curing to take place.

1507
02:05:00,246 --> 02:05:00,907
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

1508
02:05:02,068 --> 02:05:07,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're trying to do is, you know, get the striping vendor in and work their way down as we're doing the paving activities as well.

1509
02:05:10,728 --> 02:05:16,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, as I said, we really appreciate the collaboration with the city engineer, the city departments, the city council.

1510
02:05:17,690 --> 02:05:19,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that this has been a long journey.

1511
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:20,171
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a long journey for us too.

1512
02:05:20,631 --> 02:05:26,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I also wanna highlight for you that when we say the cable work is done in September, we still doesn't mean the cable's energized.

1513
02:05:26,833 --> 02:05:38,136
[SPEAKER_05]: We still need to do testing in the cable, energization of the cable before the project's completely in service to meet its core objective of providing more transmission support

1514
02:05:39,057 --> 02:05:54,710
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of load is rising as communities embark on green energy technologies, electrification, transportation and the like, and we need this to help the regional regional load capacities across the Boston area as well as Massachusetts and beyond.

1515
02:05:54,810 --> 02:05:59,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So we appreciate the continued cooperation of the City Council and the city departments.

1516
02:06:00,035 --> 02:06:00,275
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1517
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:02,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1518
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:24,428
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could just reintroduce my motion that was made earlier in the evening during the public participation portion, that we reach out to the lead traffic engineer and to our representatives at EPSOS to see if the bike lanes that are taken with parking spots in front of those homes between Lawrence Road and High Street would be as a result of the mitigation package that was negotiated between the administration and the provider.

1519
02:06:24,928 --> 02:06:25,228
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1520
02:06:25,349 --> 02:06:28,730
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by...

1521
02:06:29,782 --> 02:06:31,023

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1526
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:39,528
[SPEAKER_22]: Seeing none, thank you so much.

[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1537
02:06:53,477 --> 02:06:54,157

[SPEAKER_22]: Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records.

1542
02:07:04,844 --> 02:07:17,432
[SPEAKER_22]: 23-076 offered by Vice President Bears and Councilor Tseng, a resolution to extend best wishes to Muslims in Medford, Massachusetts, the United States, and worldwide for a joyous, meaningful observance of Ramadan, a holy month of prayer, fasting, charity, and reflection.

1543
02:07:17,812 --> 02:07:26,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Whereas Islam is one of the world's major religions and part of our shared faith tradition, and whereas Muslims have been a part of the fabric of America for over 400 years,

1544
02:07:27,112 --> 02:07:29,913
[SPEAKER_22]: since the first Muslims in America arrived as enslaved people.

1545
02:07:30,113 --> 02:07:36,836
[SPEAKER_22]: And whereas the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is home to 131,000 Muslims and their Muslim faith is welcome here.

1546
02:07:37,136 --> 02:07:43,539
[SPEAKER_22]: And whereas the Muslim community is one of the most racially diverse faith groups in the United States and has enriched the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1547
02:07:43,659 --> 02:07:50,862
[SPEAKER_22]: And whereas Ramadan is a holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal for Muslims worldwide and the ninth month of the Muslim calendar year.

1548
02:07:50,882 --> 02:07:51,802
[SPEAKER_22]: And whereas Ramadan

1549
02:07:53,575 --> 02:07:58,039
[SPEAKER_22]: is a time to reflect spiritually, build community, give to charity, and a reason to celebrate and express gratitude.

1550
02:07:58,219 --> 02:08:06,185
[SPEAKER_22]: And whereas Ramadan began at dusk on March 23rd, 2023, and lasts for one lunar month, with the first and last dates determined by the lunar Islamic calendar.

1551
02:08:06,385 --> 02:08:22,278
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council goes on record to recognize the commencement of Ramadan, a holy month of prayer, fasting, charity, reflection, and be it further resolved that the council extends best wishes to Muslims in Medford, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the United States, and worldwide, a joyous and meaningful observance of Ramadan

1552
02:08:23,134 --> 02:08:31,429
[SPEAKER_22]: Be it further resolved, the city clerk is hereby requested to ensure that the Islamic Cultural Center of Medford and Jetpack Resource Center receive a copy of this resolution.

1553
02:08:32,070 --> 02:08:32,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice and bears.

1554
02:08:34,153 --> 02:08:35,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

1555
02:08:35,854 --> 02:08:48,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Much appreciated for your reading of this paper, for my colleagues' consideration, for the co-sponsorship of Councilor Tseng, and for our ICCM and JETPAC for working on this.

1556
02:08:49,002 --> 02:08:53,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I also know a similar resolution and commemoration.

1557
02:08:53,565 --> 02:08:58,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the first potentially in state history, although I'm not 100% sure on that, was requested

1558
02:08:59,644 --> 02:09:04,045
[SPEAKER_03]: of the governor and the governor did issue one as well, a proclamation recognizing Ramadan.

1559
02:09:04,586 --> 02:09:09,147
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an incredibly important month for Muslims in Medford across the world.

1560
02:09:09,747 --> 02:09:20,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, we have been recognizing the multi-faith, multicultural, you know, fabric of our community.

1561
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:23,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a role in that, plays a role in that.

1562
02:09:23,871 --> 02:09:25,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I think as we all know and have seen,

1563
02:09:26,448 --> 02:09:47,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Islamic Cultural Center of Medford has fast is fast becoming and has fast become, you know, you know, a key member of our key part of our community since it's moved into the square restoring the Isaac Hall house working with the city to gain CPA grants, you know, and I just think it's putting this resolution forward it's a it's a moment as it says in here, you know,

1564
02:09:48,427 --> 02:09:58,718
[SPEAKER_03]: joyous and meaningful observance and a month of prayer, fasting, charity, and reflection, I think, regardless of your faith tradition, or if you don't have a faith tradition, those are values that you can respect and hold.

1565
02:09:58,798 --> 02:10:06,946
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, thank you again for hearing me out, considering this, and we all support it tonight.

1566
02:10:06,986 --> 02:10:07,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1567
02:10:09,106 --> 02:10:32,683
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'm Councilor Paris put it so eloquently, but the Muslim community in Medford is a very budding part of the fabric of our city, and the ICCM as Councilor bears is referred has reference have been really critical in terms of our communities efforts to preserve our history to restore buildings, and to contribute to our municipal events, and to.

1568
02:10:35,381 --> 02:10:39,730
[SPEAKER_18]: really do charity in the community, which I think we should definitely recognize.

1569
02:10:40,431 --> 02:10:41,393
[SPEAKER_18]: Ramadan is...

1570
02:10:43,223 --> 02:10:47,565
[SPEAKER_18]: It is one of the most important months in the Islamic calendar, if not the most important month.

1571
02:10:47,905 --> 02:10:48,766
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's a month of joy.

1572
02:10:48,786 --> 02:10:58,832
[SPEAKER_18]: I think a lot of people know it for the fasting aspect of it, but Ramadan is about connecting to your community and connecting to yourself spiritually.

1573
02:10:59,273 --> 02:11:07,718
[SPEAKER_18]: All things, as Councilor Beres mentioned, all things I think we can get behind, even if we are not part of a faith tradition.

1574
02:11:08,418 --> 02:11:11,940
[SPEAKER_18]: And these are all values that I think build a healthy community.

1575
02:11:13,020 --> 02:11:18,623
[SPEAKER_18]: And so to all the Muslims in Medford celebrating the holy month of Ramadan, I just want to say Ramadan Kareem.

1576
02:11:19,704 --> 02:11:20,024
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1577
02:11:20,484 --> 02:11:21,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Any further discussion?

1578
02:11:22,645 --> 02:11:25,847
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice-President Bears.

1579
02:11:25,907 --> 02:11:26,587

1584
02:11:37,317 --> 02:11:39,780

1585
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:41,822
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much, President Morell.

1586
02:11:42,342 --> 02:11:45,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Margaret Akito was a longtime Medford resident.

1587
02:11:45,105 --> 02:11:46,126
[SPEAKER_20]: She lived on Manning Street.

1588
02:11:46,166 --> 02:11:52,492
[SPEAKER_20]: She lived on Luther Road for decades, and her family was and remains deeply connected to this community.

1589
02:11:52,512 --> 02:12:00,180
[SPEAKER_20]: I also understand that Margaret was a very faithful and dedicated watcher of our Tuesday night City Council meetings, and so I hope that my fellow

1590
02:12:01,037 --> 02:12:07,840
[SPEAKER_20]: colleagues will join me in letting her family know that we are thinking of them during this difficult time and holding a moment of silence in her honor.

1591
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:09,820
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1592
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:16,383
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor, all those opposed, please rise for a moment of silence.

1593
02:12:28,411 --> 02:12:31,513
[SPEAKER_22]: 23 to 078 offered by Councilor Collins and vice president bears.

1594
02:12:32,274 --> 02:12:43,863
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a result of the Metro City Council recognize walk, bike and roll to school day on April 4 supported by the safe routes to school program and walk Medford students and community members will be celebrating the day with bike trains to and from school Councilor Collins.

1595
02:12:45,085 --> 02:12:46,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell.

1596
02:12:46,186 --> 02:12:51,890
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's that time of year again almost for the biannual Walk, Bike and Roll to School Day.

1597
02:12:51,910 --> 02:13:02,878
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this is a great way to get young riders out on the streets with the safe chaperoning of adult riders that accompany them along their routes to school.

1598
02:13:03,499 --> 02:13:03,959
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that

1599
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:09,421
[SPEAKER_20]: many in the bicycling community in Medford are organizing these bike trains on April 4th.

1600
02:13:09,461 --> 02:13:17,883
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would, you know, issue a heads up to everybody who's commuting or out on the roads that day to make sure to take extra care for additional cyclists out on the road that day.

1601
02:13:18,563 --> 02:13:29,765
[SPEAKER_20]: And as you know, as always much appreciation for much appreciation for the Safe Routes to School program and all of the cycling activists and volunteers that make this celebration possible.

1602
02:13:30,025 --> 02:13:30,265
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1603
02:13:30,850 --> 02:13:32,031
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

1604
02:13:32,091 --> 02:13:33,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

1605
02:13:33,452 --> 02:13:36,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And first, just apologies, I didn't catch this, I think it's actually May 4th.

1606
02:13:36,714 --> 02:13:38,294
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought that seemed, yes.

1607
02:13:38,555 --> 02:13:40,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so yeah, that may just- I had that in my head.

1608
02:13:40,876 --> 02:13:42,137
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my mistake, sorry about that.

1609
02:13:42,197 --> 02:13:43,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't catch it either.

1610
02:13:43,257 --> 02:13:43,418
[SPEAKER_03]: May 4th.

1611
02:13:44,471 --> 02:13:44,751
[SPEAKER_20]: Really?

1612
02:13:45,071 --> 02:13:45,611
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

1613
02:13:45,631 --> 02:13:47,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that date didn't seem, yep, it's May 4th.

1614
02:13:47,612 --> 02:13:50,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And I only know that because I was looking through my email and I saw an email that said May 4th today.

1615
02:13:50,453 --> 02:13:51,614
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're super prepared.

1616
02:13:53,554 --> 02:13:54,435
[SPEAKER_20]: Advance warning.

1617
02:13:55,275 --> 02:14:11,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but yeah, but everything that Councilor Collins said I think stands strongly and this gives people even more time to plan and consider taking this on if you're watching this and you can make that day work for you and your family to participate in this.

1618
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:11,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really,

1619
02:14:13,393 --> 02:14:21,274
[SPEAKER_03]: An important event and really shows, you know, we have in this community, especially you know I know it's at all levels but the high school level.

1620
02:14:22,079 --> 02:14:25,001
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't offer a universal busing at the high school.

1621
02:14:25,021 --> 02:14:34,389
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have folks on the MBTA, we have folks walking, we have folks driving, we have folks getting rides, you know, you have folks biking, you have a lot of different modes of travel going to the high school.

1622
02:14:35,330 --> 02:14:47,199
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the reasons this resource project is so important is because it's fixing the, you know, the gateway to the high school where you have, you know, our most precious resource and group of folks in the city, our young people.

1623
02:14:48,962 --> 02:14:50,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want them to be safe.

1624
02:14:50,743 --> 02:14:52,845
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we all want that in all of the different contexts.

1625
02:14:52,885 --> 02:14:56,447
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about that many times in many different contexts, and this is one of them.

1626
02:14:57,348 --> 02:15:02,011
[SPEAKER_03]: This issue, we had a memorial outside of City Hall.

1627
02:15:02,111 --> 02:15:03,732
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just very personal to me.

1628
02:15:04,472 --> 02:15:11,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost a friend 10 years ago to a car accident.

1629
02:15:12,317 --> 02:15:15,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I could do this without breaking down, but I still can't.

1630
02:15:18,836 --> 02:15:22,619
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to keep young people safe, so thank you.

1631
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:24,821
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

1632
02:15:25,681 --> 02:15:26,422
[SPEAKER_22]: Any further discussion?

1633
02:15:27,763 --> 02:15:31,726
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Vice President Bears.

1634
02:15:31,906 --> 02:15:32,586
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor?

1635
02:15:33,467 --> 02:15:34,108
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed?

1636
02:15:34,128 --> 02:15:34,928
[SPEAKER_22]: The motion passes.

1637
02:15:34,948 --> 02:15:44,255
[SPEAKER_22]: 23-079, offered by President Morell, Councilor Tseng, and Councilor Collins, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council honor and celebrate Women's History Month.

1638
02:15:44,515 --> 02:15:45,957
[SPEAKER_22]: I will go to Councilor Collins.

1639
02:15:45,977 --> 02:15:46,697
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna cherry pick.

1640
02:15:48,583 --> 02:15:49,523
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell.

1641
02:15:49,703 --> 02:15:54,344
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that, well, it's always a good time to celebrate women's history.

1642
02:15:54,384 --> 02:16:01,206
[SPEAKER_20]: It's always a good time to reflect on the contributions of women to society, our community in particular.

1643
02:16:01,226 --> 02:16:06,827
[SPEAKER_20]: We have so many pillars of our local Medford community who happen to be women.

1644
02:16:06,847 --> 02:16:14,369
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it's always the right time to reflect on members of marginalized communities that have made outsized contributions to the community that we enjoy today.

1645
02:16:14,589 --> 02:16:14,869
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1646
02:16:15,589 --> 02:16:16,330
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1647
02:16:16,350 --> 02:16:16,830
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Tseng.

1648
02:16:17,290 --> 02:16:17,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1649
02:16:18,334 --> 02:16:27,178
[SPEAKER_18]: President Morell, I don't think it needs to be said that celebrating Women's History Month is valuable.

1650
02:16:28,739 --> 02:16:32,981
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to bring up a few examples of Medford women who have made history.

1651
02:16:34,242 --> 02:16:38,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Many that I think people in the city know, some that people might not.

1652
02:16:39,504 --> 02:16:44,947
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Amelia Earhart is a name that a lot of people know about for her achievements in aviation.

1653
02:16:46,448 --> 02:16:52,975
[SPEAKER_18]: And she is a part of Medford history, if you know it.

1654
02:16:54,216 --> 02:17:01,223
[SPEAKER_18]: There is Belinda Sutton, who I think we had a huge acknowledgement of her

1655
02:17:01,878 --> 02:17:06,100
[SPEAKER_18]: work in terms of reparations last year or two years ago.

1656
02:17:07,641 --> 02:17:22,429
[SPEAKER_18]: She was a black woman who fought hard to make sure that she received reparations after she was freed from slavery from her slave owners, the royal family, and she won her case and made legal history with that effort.

1657
02:17:23,310 --> 02:17:37,047
[SPEAKER_18]: There are everyday heroes, another name that we learned about a few years ago, that many of us learned about, many of us knew personally, Jean Barrett Sutherland as well, who, her work for her students should go

1658
02:17:38,168 --> 02:17:40,410
[SPEAKER_18]: acknowledged and remembered as well.

1659
02:17:40,770 --> 02:17:55,559
[SPEAKER_18]: And so these are just a few examples in a very, very long list of Medford figures who we should be celebrating every day, but especially during the month of March, we should pay our respects to.

1660
02:17:56,720 --> 02:18:03,265
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would go remiss if I didn't mention our city's suffragette movement, which was

1661
02:18:04,483 --> 02:18:10,368
[SPEAKER_18]: fed intellectually, a lot of the ideas that became successful nationally in politics.

1662
02:18:11,368 --> 02:18:15,291
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng, and thank you for doing the labor of doing the research and sharing that.

1663
02:18:15,311 --> 02:18:20,735
[SPEAKER_22]: Much appreciated by Councilor Collins and I. And I just want to add, I mean, there's much to be reflected upon this month.

1664
02:18:20,796 --> 02:18:23,898
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to add the quote from Abigail Adams to remember the ladies.

1665
02:18:24,198 --> 02:18:26,580
[SPEAKER_22]: I still don't think we've made true on that request.

1666
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:29,222
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got a long way to go, but remember the ladies.

1667
02:18:30,403 --> 02:18:31,203
[SPEAKER_22]: Any further discussion?

1668
02:18:32,317 --> 02:18:32,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Bears.

1669
02:18:32,897 --> 02:18:34,358
[SPEAKER_08]: You're here to the Council President as well.

1670
02:18:34,918 --> 02:18:35,219
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1671
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:43,323
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor?

1672
02:18:44,083 --> 02:18:44,924
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed?

1673
02:18:45,024 --> 02:18:45,684
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion passes.

1674
02:18:46,705 --> 02:18:50,287
[SPEAKER_22]: Records, the records of March 21st, 2023 were passed to Councilor Caraviello.

1675
02:18:50,327 --> 02:18:51,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caraviello, how did you find them?

1676
02:18:52,168 --> 02:18:55,890
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam President, I had the opportunity to review the records and I found them in order.

1677
02:18:57,170 --> 02:19:00,232
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1678
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:12,991
[SPEAKER_22]: all those opposed motion passes courts of committees 22-494 march 21st 2023 subcommand ordinances and rules vice president bears thank you madam president we met to discuss a proposed budget ordinance

1679
02:19:14,267 --> 02:19:16,870
[SPEAKER_03]: to outline in ordinance the budget process.

1680
02:19:17,771 --> 02:19:28,742
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have probably another discussion in subcommittee bring it to committee the whole move it forward it's, we're not going to be able to, I would assume implemented this year because it would have started three months ago already if we if we had.

1681
02:19:29,924 --> 02:19:33,567
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we've had some great work we had director Dickinson with us.

1682
02:19:34,526 --> 02:19:48,238
[SPEAKER_03]: at the last meeting, and actually he was very, very supportive of the ideas and concepts behind it, you know, kind of saying, hey, you know, this is what we should be doing anyway, and I really think that was a great response, and really we were getting a lot of collaboration from him on it.

1683
02:19:48,618 --> 02:19:55,864
[SPEAKER_03]: The other piece of this ordinance, and I know this is a little bit long for some committee reports, so thanks everyone for bearing with me, but it's just so important, this budget process.

1684
02:19:56,064 --> 02:19:58,326
[SPEAKER_03]: The other piece of it is this needs assessment.

1685
02:19:58,366 --> 02:19:59,728
[SPEAKER_03]: That may take a little bit more time.

1686
02:19:59,768 --> 02:20:02,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we split it off, because it's just kind of a harder question,

1687
02:20:02,999 --> 02:20:25,614
[SPEAKER_03]: can we get something like what we now have for roads and sidewalks for buildings for departments for everything how can we start to quantify this question of code enforcement what would in-house dpw crews look like how can we build a process where we you know that's a big project to do once but once you've done it once and you figured out how to do it updating it annually is not as big a process and then we have a document that we can go on not just to say hey

1688
02:20:26,818 --> 02:20:34,381
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Todd throws up his hand and says, we need this engineer this year, but what is our plan over the next two, three, five, 10 years to get to where we need to be?

1689
02:20:34,521 --> 02:20:37,902
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for indulging me and I move approval on the subcommittee report.

1690
02:20:39,423 --> 02:20:42,424
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion of Vice Mayor seconded by Councilor Collins, all those in favor.

02:20:42,444 --> 02:20:44,505
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed, motion passes.

1692
02:20:44,525 --> 02:20:46,446
[SPEAKER_22]: 22-321, March 22nd, 2023 Subcommittee on Zoning Planning and Development.

1693
02:20:50,226 --> 02:20:50,787
[SPEAKER_22]: and bears.

1694
02:20:50,847 --> 02:20:53,729
[SPEAKER_03]: This was on looking at a proposed condo conversion ordinance.

1695
02:20:54,209 --> 02:21:00,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, we had a lot of initial discussions, uh, and, you know, we're planning to have further subcommittee meetings to really flush that out.

1696
02:21:01,695 --> 02:21:05,318
[SPEAKER_22]: Move approval on the motion of vice and bears, seconded by Councilor Collins.

[SPEAKER_22]: All right, I suppose passes.

[SPEAKER_22]: That is the end of Councilor Collins.

1700
02:21:15,946 --> 02:21:17,528
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1701
02:21:17,588 --> 02:21:19,089
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, we'll take suspension first and our

1702
02:21:19,572 --> 02:21:21,713
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, yeah, one paper.

1703
02:21:22,593 --> 02:21:27,594
[SPEAKER_22]: One paper under suspension, 23-082 from.

1704
02:21:27,674 --> 02:21:28,154
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

1705
02:21:28,234 --> 02:21:34,096
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to suspend the rules.

1706
02:21:34,276 --> 02:21:37,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to suspend the rules to take paper 23-082.

1707
02:21:37,417 --> 02:21:41,778
[SPEAKER_22]: The motion of vices and affairs to suspend the rules to take 23-082 seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1708
02:21:41,798 --> 02:21:42,418
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor?

1709
02:21:42,578 --> 02:21:43,018
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1710
02:21:43,078 --> 02:21:43,378
[SPEAKER_22]: Opposed?

1711
02:21:43,418 --> 02:21:44,038
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion passes.

1712
02:21:44,058 --> 02:21:46,419
[SPEAKER_22]: 23-082 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1713
02:21:47,113 --> 02:21:56,385
[SPEAKER_22]: be it so resolved that the city administration update the city council with where in the process are all of the ordinances that this council has worked on since the vacancies in this solicitor's office Councilor Scarpelli.

1714
02:21:56,745 --> 02:22:05,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President, I appreciate all the hard work that a city clerk has has done for us, and I know that this council has worked

1715
02:22:05,979 --> 02:22:10,862
[SPEAKER_17]: very, very hard on putting through some initiatives that this community needs.

1716
02:22:10,942 --> 02:22:29,334
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I was referring to is the understanding of what the role in KP law has with our ordinances, whether they're legal, whether they are being able to move forward these ordinances.

1717
02:22:30,034 --> 02:22:34,157
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've, like I said, I've had the,

1718
02:22:35,808 --> 02:22:42,391
[SPEAKER_17]: The opportunity that work with many, many different city solicitors, and one.

1719
02:22:43,732 --> 02:22:47,954
[SPEAKER_17]: One ordinance rule 30 ordinance and bonds orders referred to the city solicitor.

1720
02:22:49,409 --> 02:22:50,429
[SPEAKER_17]: This is in our charter.

1721
02:22:51,750 --> 02:23:05,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Every ordinance and every order for bond issue shall before its passage be referred to the city solicitor, who shall for with examine the same as to its legalities and notify the council in writing of their findings.

1722
02:23:06,414 --> 02:23:14,497
[SPEAKER_17]: It shall be standing rule of the city council that no final or definitive action shall be passed by this council in the matter of abatement

1723
02:23:15,237 --> 02:23:23,120
[SPEAKER_17]: of betterment assessments until such time as the legalities of a proposed abatement shall be approved by the city solicitor.

1724
02:23:23,660 --> 02:23:26,801
[SPEAKER_17]: So what's that saying is that it's simple.

1725
02:23:27,962 --> 02:23:38,946
[SPEAKER_17]: We could do the exercise moving forward with the ordinances and what we're trying to do as a council, but in essence, having KP law review them

1726
02:23:39,979 --> 02:23:40,719
[SPEAKER_17]: is often not.

1727
02:23:41,139 --> 02:24:06,269
[SPEAKER_17]: From what I gather, and I'll ask with a motion that we ask the city administration to forward to us any signed ordinances by KP law, I'm gonna guarantee you that it probably isn't because they know it's against the law because they're not acting city solicitors, because they know this rule in our charter, so in our ordinances.

1728
02:24:09,481 --> 02:24:10,682
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is what I was afraid of.

1729
02:24:12,402 --> 02:24:15,524
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm hoping I'm wrong, because it is a lot of money we've spent with KP Law.

1730
02:24:15,984 --> 02:24:27,869
[SPEAKER_17]: But moving forward, I want to just, again, just stress to my fellow Councilors that the understanding, the idea of what we're doing is I completely understand.

1731
02:24:28,389 --> 02:24:30,430
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to do our job the best we can.

1732
02:24:31,130 --> 02:24:36,153
[SPEAKER_17]: But when we don't have the tools in place to succeed, and we,

1733
02:24:38,212 --> 02:24:41,455
[SPEAKER_17]: keep asking for KP Law's opinions on things.

1734
02:24:41,916 --> 02:24:42,956
[SPEAKER_17]: It comes back to this.

1735
02:24:43,717 --> 02:24:47,040
[SPEAKER_17]: This ordinance is very, this resolution is very simple.

1736
02:24:47,521 --> 02:24:49,122
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's an eye-opening resolution.

1737
02:24:49,603 --> 02:24:59,172
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it'll be interesting on my motion to see what we get back in two weeks with the city administration, where the signed ordinances are that will put so much hard work into passing.

1738
02:24:59,972 --> 02:25:02,174
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's,

1739
02:25:03,318 --> 02:25:08,280
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, I think that's going to be a telling sign of where we are.

1740
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:21,606
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that I'm going to make a second motion that's Council fears thinking about it since he brought it up and asking that the council asked for city administration for funding.

1741
02:25:24,029 --> 02:25:38,965
[SPEAKER_17]: to reach out to former city solicitors, preferably Romley or Scanlon, that everybody else's work in per diem, that we asked them to come in and work on a stipend program where, or

1742
02:25:40,278 --> 02:25:50,226
[SPEAKER_17]: a retainer that they can assist us with the city solicitors or get sworn as acting city solicitors so we could pass these passages forward.

1743
02:25:50,266 --> 02:26:06,038
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are two motions I'm gonna ask because of this news that was shared with me that we need the update from the city administration with the signed ordinances to see if they are signed or they're not left to be signed.

1744
02:26:06,078 --> 02:26:07,979
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that there were questions that

1745
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:13,119
[SPEAKER_17]: As long as the mayor signs off that they are acceptable, no, it's not.

1746
02:26:14,438 --> 02:26:25,826
[SPEAKER_17]: the legal opinions that I received and what our ordinance says in rule 30, it clearly states that we can't do anything until the city solicitor signs off on this.

1747
02:26:25,846 --> 02:26:43,178
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we can do that and ask for the administration to allow us to bring in and swear in a city solicitor per diem or on a retainer to help us finalize some of these ordinances and other motions that we have

1748
02:26:44,599 --> 02:26:52,044
[SPEAKER_17]: that right now are being left off to KP Law and their infinite wisdom for the mayor, not for this council.

1749
02:26:52,084 --> 02:26:52,625
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

1750
02:26:52,785 --> 02:26:53,626
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1751
02:26:53,666 --> 02:26:55,427
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just realized, so I got a response.

1752
02:26:56,168 --> 02:26:59,310
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a response that came through to myself and Vice President Bears today.

1753
02:26:59,330 --> 02:27:06,896
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually didn't realize I didn't get sent to the whole council from the mayor with copied and pasted from Janelle, Attorney Austin, saying that just for background.

1754
02:27:06,936 --> 02:27:10,919
[SPEAKER_22]: In my opinion, KP Law can sign off on the ordinances as set forth by council rules

1755
02:27:11,470 --> 02:27:18,695
[SPEAKER_22]: Since in my opinion, the mayor is authorized to appoint council as necessary to advise the city, including pursuant to rule 24 or rule 30.

1756
02:27:18,755 --> 02:27:26,621
[SPEAKER_22]: And then she says, if the city clerk wants to afford any ordinances of supporting city council minutes, we can certainly review as to the sufficiency of those for passage.

1757
02:27:26,661 --> 02:27:28,503
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll make sure the clerk sends that to the whole council.

1758
02:27:28,523 --> 02:27:29,724
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't realize it didn't go to everyone.

1759
02:27:29,964 --> 02:27:30,824
[SPEAKER_22]: So I apologize for that.

1760
02:27:31,525 --> 02:27:37,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I think this is where, again, this council is being bypassed without any legal support.

1761
02:27:40,698 --> 02:27:41,779
[SPEAKER_17]: So why do we need a council?

1762
02:27:41,819 --> 02:27:53,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Why do we have our ordinances and laws that the mayor put her hand on the Bible and or about to follow the bylaws and the ordinances of this community?

1763
02:27:53,366 --> 02:27:56,048
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we all did when we had the inauguration.

1764
02:27:56,388 --> 02:27:58,229
[SPEAKER_17]: When we were sworn in, that's what we're sworn in to do.

1765
02:27:58,950 --> 02:28:04,013
[SPEAKER_17]: This is rule 30 of our ordinances, the city councils for our city solicitor.

1766
02:28:04,833 --> 02:28:07,435
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, I would like to see those signed documents.

1767
02:28:08,752 --> 02:28:11,114
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Bears and then Councilor Knight.

1768
02:28:11,274 --> 02:28:12,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

1769
02:28:12,335 --> 02:28:13,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just two more things on that one.

1770
02:28:14,236 --> 02:28:19,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I replied to that email and said, you know, that's that's I'm glad we have a response on this question.

1771
02:28:19,621 --> 02:28:24,745
[SPEAKER_03]: But I added the question of is, you know, it's not just City Council rules, it's Massachusetts General Law.

1772
02:28:24,785 --> 02:28:28,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would just like a little bit more detail on on what we got back from, from them.

1773
02:28:28,908 --> 02:28:32,551
[SPEAKER_03]: The other piece of this and it goes back to your point is, you know,

1774
02:28:33,885 --> 02:28:38,052
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I guess maybe I'm just gonna bring this up at every meeting till the end of time at this point, or at least to the end of the year.

1775
02:28:39,555 --> 02:28:42,059
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at this at this point, I think that I'm hoping that we

1776
02:28:43,917 --> 02:28:50,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciated our conversation last week about the idea of moving forward and making sure that we have the power on our own to bring people on board where we don't have to ask.

1777
02:28:51,341 --> 02:29:01,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Because making that small change along with a couple other small changes to allow us to appropriate the money and improve boards and commissions would go a long way to making this council significantly more forceful in our ability to hold the administration accountable.

1778
02:29:02,006 --> 02:29:03,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really looking forward to those discussions.

1779
02:29:03,666 --> 02:29:03,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1780
02:29:05,573 --> 02:29:06,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1781
02:29:07,034 --> 02:29:13,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very thankful that Attorney Austin has finally given us a legal opinion, because every time we ask her for something, she scratches her head and says, that's council prerogative.

1782
02:29:13,678 --> 02:29:14,038
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1783
02:29:14,058 --> 02:29:14,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll look into it.

1784
02:29:14,658 --> 02:29:15,439
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll check it out later.

1785
02:29:15,839 --> 02:29:18,000
[SPEAKER_10]: But finally, she gave us a legal opinion.

1786
02:29:18,481 --> 02:29:22,003
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't answer the question that we asked, because we didn't ask her to look at the council rules.

1787
02:29:22,903 --> 02:29:25,925
[SPEAKER_10]: We asked her to look at the city ordinances, and we asked her to look at the general laws.

1788
02:29:26,926 --> 02:29:30,067
[SPEAKER_10]: And this opinion is very, very narrow.

1789
02:29:30,648 --> 02:29:33,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a reason it's very narrow, because it's not worth the paper it's written on.

1790
02:29:34,975 --> 02:29:46,063
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, these ordinances that this council puts in place to ensure that there's a city solicitor put in place with the legislative intent to provide a check and balance on the administration.

1791
02:29:47,204 --> 02:29:48,565
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a transparency issue.

1792
02:29:49,185 --> 02:29:51,867
[SPEAKER_10]: First and foremost, a transparency issue.

1793
02:29:53,388 --> 02:29:55,350
[SPEAKER_10]: So the mayor has the power to appoint somebody.

1794
02:29:56,775 --> 02:29:58,236
[SPEAKER_10]: She hasn't appointed a city solicitor.

1795
02:29:58,856 --> 02:30:00,237
[SPEAKER_10]: She's hired a private law firm.

1796
02:30:01,197 --> 02:30:06,300
[SPEAKER_10]: She said that her private law firm, the city ordinance say there shall be a solicitor.

1797
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:11,102
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't say the mayor shall privately contract a firm.

1798
02:30:12,283 --> 02:30:18,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It says there shall be a solicitor and the solicitor will be compensated within the compensation schedule.

1799
02:30:18,806 --> 02:30:23,148
[SPEAKER_06]: The same schedule that she brought to us this evening to create another pet job for one of her friends.

1800
02:30:24,602 --> 02:30:31,104
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I sit here and I look at this, Madam President, it makes my brains boil because she sat up here and she promised.

1801
02:30:31,724 --> 02:30:33,025
[SPEAKER_06]: She made a promise to us.

1802
02:30:33,745 --> 02:30:35,705
[SPEAKER_06]: She promised us something.

1803
02:30:36,346 --> 02:30:40,027
[SPEAKER_06]: She cut a deal and the deal was that we'd have an assistant city solicitor.

1804
02:30:40,507 --> 02:30:47,129
[SPEAKER_09]: So whether her word isn't worth anything or just as much as the paper that Ms.

1805
02:30:47,209 --> 02:30:48,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Austin wrote her opinion on.

1806
02:30:49,430 --> 02:30:51,370
[SPEAKER_09]: But it certainly doesn't carry any weight in this room.

1807
02:30:52,611 --> 02:30:53,931
[SPEAKER_09]: When the mayor gives their word,

1808
02:30:55,638 --> 02:30:56,119
[SPEAKER_06]: in June.

1809
02:30:57,160 --> 02:31:00,002
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we are nine months later, and it still hasn't been carried out.

1810
02:31:00,663 --> 02:31:07,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven elected fish, seven of seven of the what 14 elected officials in this community at the local level.

1811
02:31:07,790 --> 02:31:09,292
[SPEAKER_06]: She gives seven of us her word.

1812
02:31:10,533 --> 02:31:11,054
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lie.

1813
02:31:11,814 --> 02:31:12,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lie.

1814
02:31:13,436 --> 02:31:14,077
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lie.

1815
02:31:14,577 --> 02:31:14,818
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1816
02:31:14,838 --> 02:31:16,559
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't it's hot hiring people.

1817
02:31:16,860 --> 02:31:17,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never met a lawyer

1818
02:31:19,034 --> 02:31:28,822
[SPEAKER_10]: that went to law school, that had their own firm and they practiced law, that doesn't know another lawyer, that wants a part-time job making $125,000 a year with health insurance.

1819
02:31:28,842 --> 02:31:36,469
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know a lawyer in the world that wouldn't accept that job that's out in private practice, that's out working on their own, that's out and hung their own shingle.

1820
02:31:36,829 --> 02:31:38,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know a lawyer in the world that wouldn't do it.

1821
02:31:40,973 --> 02:31:41,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe she doesn't know any lawyers.

1822
02:31:42,434 --> 02:31:43,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought she went to law school.

1823
02:31:44,336 --> 02:31:45,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought she practiced law.

1824
02:31:46,518 --> 02:31:50,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand how all of a sudden there's a shortage of lawyers in Medford, but not anywhere else.

1825
02:31:51,144 --> 02:31:57,591
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do the math, there's one lawyer for every 1,200 people in the state of Massachusetts.

1826
02:31:58,252 --> 02:31:59,213
[SPEAKER_10]: We have 6 million people.

1827
02:31:59,373 --> 02:31:59,873
[SPEAKER_10]: You do the math.

1828
02:32:00,414 --> 02:32:01,455
[SPEAKER_10]: You do the math, all right?

1829
02:32:01,495 --> 02:32:05,059
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nonsensical for us to sit here week in and week out and go through this.

1830
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:15,267
[SPEAKER_10]: She's treating us the same way she's treating the workers in this community, the same way she's treating the representative from local 25, the same way she's treating the representatives from Massachusetts Teachers Association.

1831
02:32:15,948 --> 02:32:18,810
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, she's going to keep us in the dark and she's going to try to control the narrative.

1832
02:32:19,611 --> 02:32:21,152
[SPEAKER_10]: And that doesn't mean telling the truth.

1833
02:32:21,732 --> 02:32:22,033
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1834
02:32:22,133 --> 02:32:23,534
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't mean being transparent.

1835
02:32:24,833 --> 02:32:25,693
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't mean any of that.

1836
02:32:26,614 --> 02:32:34,879
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can keep sitting here week in and week out and wasting our time, really wasting our time, because we don't have the tools to build the house.

1837
02:32:35,719 --> 02:32:36,560
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have the tools.

1838
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:39,161
[SPEAKER_06]: She promised us the tools.

1839
02:32:39,381 --> 02:32:40,182
[SPEAKER_06]: She agreed with us.

1840
02:32:40,602 --> 02:32:42,423
[SPEAKER_06]: She sat here for 20 years and cried.

1841
02:32:43,063 --> 02:32:43,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything was awful.

1842
02:32:43,944 --> 02:32:44,964
[SPEAKER_06]: The city was falling apart.

1843
02:32:45,024 --> 02:32:46,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike McGlynn's the demon.

1844
02:32:46,645 --> 02:32:47,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike McGlynn's the devil.

1845
02:32:47,826 --> 02:32:49,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Roy Belson's hell incarnated himself.

1846
02:32:51,445 --> 02:32:55,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I never met two hard-working public servants that weren't afraid to be held accountable.

1847
02:32:55,328 --> 02:33:05,297
[SPEAKER_06]: They would come up here to this podium and answer the questions and give us the answers that we may not want to hear, but at least they showed up and they were present and they kept their word and they kept their promises.

1848
02:33:06,767 --> 02:33:08,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And enough's enough with this city solicitor nonsense.

1849
02:33:09,349 --> 02:33:11,831
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have one, we need one, the ordinance say it's required.

1850
02:33:12,211 --> 02:33:12,651
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1851
02:33:13,112 --> 02:33:13,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Mayor, do it.

1852
02:33:14,413 --> 02:33:17,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Who can we even go to and say, what's our alternative?

1853
02:33:17,695 --> 02:33:20,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to speak to a lawyer to tell me what my alternative is.

1854
02:33:20,857 --> 02:33:21,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I have Ms.

1855
02:33:21,518 --> 02:33:22,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Austin's number?

1856
02:33:22,058 --> 02:33:22,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Ms.

1857
02:33:22,398 --> 02:33:26,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Austin, how do I get rid of you so that we can have a real city solicitor in this community?

1858
02:33:27,602 --> 02:33:29,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on, give me a break here.

1859
02:33:29,223 --> 02:33:30,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough's enough with this nonsense.

1860
02:33:31,405 --> 02:33:32,245
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nonsense.

1861
02:33:32,746 --> 02:33:33,366
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nonsense.

1862
02:33:34,207 --> 02:33:35,508
[SPEAKER_06]: That door has not been opened.

1863
02:33:36,484 --> 02:33:38,446
[SPEAKER_10]: They said it's an open door, you can always walk in.

1864
02:33:38,486 --> 02:33:40,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can't walk in, it's not really open.

1865
02:33:40,427 --> 02:33:41,908
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta call me and we gotta make an appointment.

1866
02:33:42,148 --> 02:33:44,650
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, we have an open door policy, but the door's not open.

1867
02:33:45,331 --> 02:33:46,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know what that means when she said it.

1868
02:33:46,952 --> 02:33:49,434
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a scratch on my head going, what's going on here?

1869
02:33:49,914 --> 02:33:54,398
[SPEAKER_06]: It's become so personal, so personal and so not about the city of Medford.

1870
02:33:55,398 --> 02:34:08,005
[SPEAKER_10]: When it comes to the workers in this community and Steve South, when it comes to people getting taken out of here by the police, people getting followed around with GPS trackers on their vehicles, people being required to undergo psychiatric evaluations.

1871
02:34:08,526 --> 02:34:09,947
[SPEAKER_10]: It's personal, Madam President.

1872
02:34:09,987 --> 02:34:11,027
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not government.

1873
02:34:11,207 --> 02:34:12,228
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not governing.

1874
02:34:12,588 --> 02:34:14,769
[SPEAKER_10]: That's politics and it's bad politics.

1875
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:16,751
[SPEAKER_10]: And it translates into bad government.

1876
02:34:16,771 --> 02:34:18,432
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what we have here in this community now.

1877
02:34:19,292 --> 02:34:20,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know why we have it?

1878
02:34:20,173 --> 02:34:25,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we accept the chief administrative officer of this community.

1879
02:34:25,297 --> 02:34:28,119
[SPEAKER_06]: We accept the fact that she came up here and lied, right?

1880
02:34:28,199 --> 02:34:29,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Threw her teeth to us.

1881
02:34:29,880 --> 02:34:31,081
[SPEAKER_06]: We're accepting that fact.

1882
02:34:31,621 --> 02:34:32,902
[SPEAKER_06]: We're saying, OK, it is what it is.

1883
02:34:32,942 --> 02:34:33,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

1884
02:34:34,123 --> 02:34:34,864
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we going to do?

1885
02:34:35,745 --> 02:34:36,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's ask her.

1886
02:34:36,685 --> 02:34:38,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, she'll just lie again, right?

1887
02:34:38,327 --> 02:34:39,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, enough's enough.

1888
02:34:39,708 --> 02:34:40,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough's enough.

1889
02:34:41,129 --> 02:34:41,949
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we going to do?

1890
02:34:42,310 --> 02:34:43,451
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the recourse?

1891
02:34:43,491 --> 02:34:44,031
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the game?

1892
02:34:44,111 --> 02:34:44,932
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the end game here?

1893
02:34:45,652 --> 02:34:46,393
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the end game?

1894
02:34:46,973 --> 02:34:47,714
[SPEAKER_10]: She ain't going to do it.

1895
02:34:48,996 --> 02:34:49,936
[SPEAKER_10]: We know she's not going to do it.

1896
02:34:51,277 --> 02:34:53,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Because her track record has proven that she will not.

1897
02:34:53,618 --> 02:35:00,741
[SPEAKER_10]: She refuses to communicate openly and transparently with this council about legal issues and financial issues.

1898
02:35:03,022 --> 02:35:09,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else is important to us, but we control the zoning, which is a legal issue, and we control the budget, which is a financial issue.

1899
02:35:09,205 --> 02:35:11,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, all we are is a bunch of cheerleaders.

1900
02:35:12,686 --> 02:35:13,907
[SPEAKER_06]: All we are is the rah-rah squad.

1901
02:35:15,020 --> 02:35:18,162
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm at a loss at this point in time.

1902
02:35:18,562 --> 02:35:22,945
[SPEAKER_10]: The lack of leadership that's come out of the corner office, the chief of staff doesn't come in to give us answers.

1903
02:35:24,086 --> 02:35:25,967
[SPEAKER_10]: When's the chief of staff have decided to give us an answer?

1904
02:35:25,987 --> 02:35:27,708
[SPEAKER_10]: She comes down to fight with us and yell and scream at us.

1905
02:35:28,549 --> 02:35:29,669
[SPEAKER_10]: She doesn't come down to give us answers.

1906
02:35:29,689 --> 02:35:32,391
[SPEAKER_10]: She comes down here to control narrative, control spin and not tell the truth.

1907
02:35:32,892 --> 02:35:34,673
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've caught them so many times lying.

1908
02:35:34,953 --> 02:35:37,334
[SPEAKER_06]: How do they expect us to have a relationship of trust with them?

1909
02:35:38,055 --> 02:35:38,315
[SPEAKER_06]: How?

1910
02:35:39,316 --> 02:35:40,176
[SPEAKER_06]: How is it possible?

1911
02:35:40,476 --> 02:35:41,097
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I ask.

1912
02:35:41,973 --> 02:35:47,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I think back to four years ago and how much better off this city was every single day.

1913
02:35:48,034 --> 02:35:53,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Every single, when I drive over that same pothole that's been on my street that I put through see click fix 27 times, right?

1914
02:35:53,936 --> 02:35:56,156
[SPEAKER_10]: I think about how much better the city was four years ago.

1915
02:35:56,716 --> 02:35:57,476
[SPEAKER_10]: And it makes me sad.

1916
02:35:57,936 --> 02:36:09,419
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me sad to see how terrible the city looks, lack of curb appeal, lack of commitment or investment to deliver in public service, to deliver in simple basic public services.

1917
02:36:10,185 --> 02:36:17,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Like fixing a sidewalk, taking down a tree, fixing a pothole, striping a crosswalk.

1918
02:36:19,190 --> 02:36:19,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Enough's enough.

1919
02:36:20,111 --> 02:36:22,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, when are we gonna wake up and realize that we're failing the people in this community?

1920
02:36:23,713 --> 02:36:24,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we are.

1921
02:36:24,514 --> 02:36:26,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when we go outside and we look around, it looks horrible.

1922
02:36:27,395 --> 02:36:28,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks horrible.

1923
02:36:28,196 --> 02:36:36,301
[SPEAKER_06]: We sat there and we listened to Mr. South tell us how Everett, Chelsea, Malden have passed us, how North Wedding, how Newton, how Waltham have passed us.

1924
02:36:37,241 --> 02:36:37,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's not wrong.

1925
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:42,983
[SPEAKER_06]: And Stowe, Stowe, I know where it is.

1926
02:36:43,724 --> 02:36:44,584
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a golf course there.

1927
02:36:46,346 --> 02:36:51,590
[SPEAKER_10]: So at the end of the day, Madam President, we need to shed some light on some of the issues that are going on in this community.

1928
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:56,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And the biggest failure that we have in Medford right now is the fact that we don't have a local newspaper to report on these issues.

1929
02:36:57,254 --> 02:36:59,516
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a communications director that gets paid $125,000 a year.

1930
02:37:02,818 --> 02:37:11,354
[SPEAKER_10]: to create new stories and to create spin and put spin on them however they want, and to go on every single social media platform in the world and run a campaign.

1931
02:37:12,957 --> 02:37:14,418
[SPEAKER_10]: and run a campaign, right?

1932
02:37:14,478 --> 02:37:15,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's what it's all about.

1933
02:37:15,498 --> 02:37:17,379
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the big hunt going on, right?

1934
02:37:17,399 --> 02:37:18,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking for Easter eggs up.

1935
02:37:18,280 --> 02:37:19,741
[SPEAKER_10]: It's spawned in a couple of weeks now, right?

1936
02:37:20,041 --> 02:37:20,881
[SPEAKER_10]: The bunny's going to be there.

1937
02:37:21,742 --> 02:37:23,162
[SPEAKER_10]: The bunny's going to be, how are people going to get there?

1938
02:37:23,362 --> 02:37:26,064
[SPEAKER_22]: I've let you go pretty freewheeling, but I'm here on the line at Easter bunny.

1939
02:37:26,104 --> 02:37:27,064
[SPEAKER_22]: If you could bring it back.

1940
02:37:27,084 --> 02:37:28,085
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1941
02:37:28,165 --> 02:37:29,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it a recreation bunny?

1942
02:37:30,086 --> 02:37:31,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the recreation bunny.

1943
02:37:31,186 --> 02:37:31,587
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1944
02:37:31,787 --> 02:37:32,627
[SPEAKER_10]: The recreated bunny.

1945
02:37:34,328 --> 02:37:44,655
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, Madam President, as I've said, right, what's the end game here, we're going to keep talking about this and talking about this and talking about this, they're going to keep asking for money we're going to keep giving them.

1946
02:37:45,396 --> 02:37:47,637
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to keep asking for reclassifications we're going to keep giving them.

1947
02:37:48,158 --> 02:37:54,462
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to stop, we're going to shut the water off at some point, it's at some point we got to turn the faucet off, and we got to say, come to the table and be serious with us.

1948
02:37:55,987 --> 02:37:59,408
[SPEAKER_10]: And quite frankly, unless we do that, they're not gonna be serious with us.

1949
02:37:59,848 --> 02:38:03,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Because every single group in this community that's organized, right?

1950
02:38:03,488 --> 02:38:05,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I look at us as like a bargaining unit, right?

1951
02:38:05,289 --> 02:38:06,709
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the Medford City Council bargaining unit.

1952
02:38:07,809 --> 02:38:12,490
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting treated worse than every other unit in the city, just about.

1953
02:38:13,470 --> 02:38:17,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Every other one, because all those units are coming to us and asking us for leadership.

1954
02:38:18,311 --> 02:38:19,711
[SPEAKER_10]: And asking us to say, what do we do?

1955
02:38:19,771 --> 02:38:20,511
[SPEAKER_10]: What can we do?

1956
02:38:20,611 --> 02:38:20,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Help.

1957
02:38:21,471 --> 02:38:25,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And we look at them and we say, we don't have the tools to help you because the mayor led us to.

1958
02:38:27,541 --> 02:38:28,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where we are.

1959
02:38:28,502 --> 02:38:34,367
[SPEAKER_10]: So we come down and we have two and three hour meetings and they give us a talk about what great crosswalks they're gonna paint on the NBA TA's dime.

1960
02:38:34,807 --> 02:38:35,468
[SPEAKER_10]: None's getting done.

1961
02:38:36,569 --> 02:38:37,750
[SPEAKER_10]: None's getting done.

1962
02:38:37,770 --> 02:38:38,590
[SPEAKER_10]: 30% design, remember that.

1963
02:38:38,891 --> 02:38:40,392
[SPEAKER_10]: That was 30% design.

1964
02:38:40,532 --> 02:38:42,274
[SPEAKER_10]: All that is is an idea right now.

1965
02:38:42,874 --> 02:38:44,916
[SPEAKER_10]: That's years from coming to fruition.

1966
02:38:46,137 --> 02:38:47,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So Madam President, I rest with this.

1967
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:51,481
[SPEAKER_10]: The city ordinances say we need a city solicitor.

1968
02:38:52,102 --> 02:38:53,143
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have a city solicitor.

1969
02:38:55,067 --> 02:39:03,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is the mayor found it okay to be a non-compliance with the ordinances of this community that are designed to be a check and balance against abuses of power?

1970
02:39:05,210 --> 02:39:06,430
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I want people to think about.

1971
02:39:07,850 --> 02:39:08,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

1972
02:39:09,171 --> 02:39:11,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1973
02:39:12,411 --> 02:39:13,212
[SPEAKER_22]: You want to turn your light off?

1974
02:39:16,688 --> 02:39:19,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor is right, 100%.

1975
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:22,651
[SPEAKER_19]: People in the community are coming to us asking us for leadership.

1976
02:39:23,352 --> 02:39:24,932
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're doing our best to provide it.

1977
02:39:25,293 --> 02:39:30,415
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's hard, because again, our powers of leadership are limited here.

1978
02:39:31,015 --> 02:39:36,138
[SPEAKER_19]: And the worst thing to tell somebody is, I can't help you or I don't know.

1979
02:39:37,447 --> 02:39:39,948
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's what we seem to be seeing all the time.

1980
02:39:40,248 --> 02:39:43,849
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, I can't help you, and I'm doing the best to help you.

1981
02:39:44,629 --> 02:39:47,209
[SPEAKER_19]: And those aren't the answers people want to hear.

1982
02:39:48,090 --> 02:40:00,893
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'll say, like I said last week, I sat across from the mayor, and when she sat in that seat for all those years, she fought for the people and worked for the people,

1983
02:40:01,851 --> 02:40:04,494
[SPEAKER_19]: and that is not the person that I served with for 10 years.

1984
02:40:05,054 --> 02:40:08,458
[SPEAKER_19]: And the leadership is out the door on everything.

1985
02:40:09,899 --> 02:40:11,661
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't know what to say anymore.

1986
02:40:12,522 --> 02:40:15,665
[SPEAKER_19]: When people just keep coming up to me, I get phone calls.

1987
02:40:16,265 --> 02:40:23,593
[SPEAKER_19]: I have developers calling me because they feel they're not getting answers from the administration or anything.

1988
02:40:25,690 --> 02:40:27,271
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just not the way to do business.

1989
02:40:27,751 --> 02:40:32,112
[SPEAKER_19]: And let's say, we're not even doing basic city service as well.

1990
02:40:32,612 --> 02:40:35,833
[SPEAKER_19]: And which is really the core of what a city is.

1991
02:40:36,893 --> 02:40:42,615
[SPEAKER_19]: And I say, Councilor Knight just really took the wind out of everything.

1992
02:40:42,635 --> 02:40:45,436
[SPEAKER_19]: He said everything that I wanted to say, but it's truth.

1993
02:40:45,676 --> 02:40:47,556
[SPEAKER_19]: It is the truth and there's not much more to say.

1994
02:40:49,437 --> 02:40:50,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1995
02:40:50,217 --> 02:40:52,517
[SPEAKER_22]: So you have two motions from Councilor Scarpelli.

1996
02:40:52,998 --> 02:40:54,618
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, do you have them to read back or do you need them?

1997
02:40:56,199 --> 02:41:05,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Are they separate motions or are they amendments to your main paper?

1998
02:41:05,845 --> 02:41:10,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, just make it easy.

1999
02:41:11,408 --> 02:41:17,492
[SPEAKER_13]: First one I have is to ask the administration to forward to the council any ordinance that's signed by KB Law.

2000
02:41:17,532 --> 02:41:21,935
The second one is for the council to ask the city administration for funding to reach out to

2001
02:41:30,702 --> 02:41:30,902
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2002
02:41:31,042 --> 02:41:34,946
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli is seconded by Councilor Caraviello all those in favor.

2003
02:41:34,966 --> 02:41:38,630
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed motion passes going back to Councilor Collins.

2004
02:41:40,091 --> 02:41:40,972
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President real.

2005
02:41:43,851 --> 02:41:51,017
[SPEAKER_20]: Tough to segway away from such a powerful topic, but I wanted to take several items off of the table that are due for third reading.

2006
02:41:51,037 --> 02:41:52,798
[SPEAKER_20]: I can read those numbers out.

2007
02:41:53,299 --> 02:41:54,220
[SPEAKER_20]: There's five of them.

2008

[SPEAKER_20]: 22519, 21053, 22058, 20024, and 23057.

2009

[SPEAKER_22]: So on the motion to take those papers off the table is seconded by... Did you do 23-043 as well?

2010
02:42:22,591 --> 02:42:23,551

2021
02:42:44,948 --> 02:42:47,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I'm sorry, just kidding, just kidding, just kidding.

2022
02:42:50,809 --> 02:42:53,871
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the amendment to the CPA ordinance.

2023
02:43:05,635 --> 02:43:06,075
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Tseng.

2024

[SPEAKER_22]: You're not on.

2026
02:43:22,415 --> 02:43:22,815
[SPEAKER_22]: Here you go.

2027
02:43:23,695 --> 02:43:25,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Council Vice President Bears.

2028
02:43:25,535 --> 02:43:25,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2029
02:43:29,036 --> 02:43:29,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Council currently.

2030
02:43:29,716 --> 02:43:29,816
Yes.

2031
02:43:32,157 --> 02:43:32,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2032
02:43:32,297 --> 02:43:32,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2033
02:43:32,457 --> 02:43:32,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2034
02:43:32,777 --> 02:43:32,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2035
02:43:34,457 --> 02:43:34,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2036
02:43:34,697 --> 02:43:35,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2037
02:43:35,137 --> 02:43:35,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2038
02:43:49,878 --> 02:43:53,431
[SPEAKER_22]: 21-053 is the housing stability ordinance eligible for third reading on March 28, 2023.

2039
02:43:55,778 --> 02:43:57,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

2040
02:43:57,639 --> 02:43:58,800
[SPEAKER_22]: I know it's gonna take a minute.

2041
02:43:59,320 --> 02:43:59,920
[SPEAKER_22]: President Bears.

2042
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:03,422
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I'm happy to do this for, I think I could do it for most of them.

2043
02:44:03,442 --> 02:44:05,243
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the housing stability notification ordinance.

2044
02:44:05,283 --> 02:44:14,887
[SPEAKER_03]: We worked on the notice to landlords and tenants about their rights when it comes to housing stability that goes out at the beginning of tenancy and the completion of tenancy.

2045
02:44:15,308 --> 02:44:20,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one thing I just wanna say while the clerk's working on the several roll call subsidies we have to work on for these several ordinances,

2046
02:44:20,810 --> 02:44:36,986
[SPEAKER_03]: is this, by and large, this is a body of work that this Council has done, that we have worked very hard to pull the pieces together to get things done in a very difficult environment that Councilor Knight just highlighted extensively.

2047
02:44:38,588 --> 02:44:43,573
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I certainly agree with Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Knight that, you know,

2048
02:44:45,035 --> 02:44:49,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I think our end of the process was done incredibly well and incredibly in a highly detailed fashion.

2049
02:44:49,577 --> 02:44:53,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm incredibly proud of this work product that we're putting out.

2050
02:44:53,239 --> 02:44:59,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're about to pass four ordinances that we worked on into third reading right now.

2051
02:44:59,142 --> 02:44:59,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I hope so.

2052
02:45:00,183 --> 02:45:01,083
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't voted on them yet.

2053
02:45:01,103 --> 02:45:02,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I truly do hope so.

2054
02:45:03,124 --> 02:45:04,385
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's incredible work product.

2055
02:45:04,485 --> 02:45:12,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it speaks to how invested this council is in doing the work that we should be doing and moving things forward and working collectively together.

2056
02:45:13,209 --> 02:45:30,120
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Councilor Tseng just spoke to me for one second about the MBTA, and he was able to say that, you know, they thought this was like the best meeting that they've been to that we were on top of our stuff and you know maybe it went a little long, but they were very happy and I think quite frankly 95% of the time, all seven of us are

2057
02:45:33,269 --> 02:45:35,391
[SPEAKER_03]: invested in doing good work for this community.

2058
02:45:36,131 --> 02:45:44,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And in many cases we are doing that in spite of or trying to work around challenges that are presented to us by the city administration that we don't have control over.

2059
02:45:44,677 --> 02:45:49,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a little bit longer probably than the clerk needed to write up all of these, these vote slips but.

2060
02:45:50,320 --> 02:45:54,921
[SPEAKER_03]: by and large, and I understand some of us may disagree on some of this, it may not be unanimous on every single one.

2061
02:45:54,961 --> 02:45:56,462
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay, that's democracy, right?

2062
02:45:56,522 --> 02:46:00,403
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had the discussions, we had the public meetings, we worked through the public engagement.

2063
02:46:00,783 --> 02:46:07,225
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not always gonna get to 100% agreement on everything, but by and large, a lot of us agree on almost everything included in a lot of these things.

2064
02:46:07,345 --> 02:46:12,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that speaks to our collective work together.

2065
02:46:12,766 --> 02:46:16,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate each one of my colleagues as we move, again, this incredible work product forward.

2066
02:46:16,707 --> 02:46:16,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2067
02:46:18,953 --> 02:46:22,235
[SPEAKER_22]: So going back to the housing civility notification ordinance is what we're voting on now.

2068
02:46:23,235 --> 02:46:24,296
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2069
02:46:25,457 --> 02:46:26,117

[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2083

[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, the furniture and the negative motion passes.

2084
02:46:43,607 --> 02:46:43,627
[SPEAKER_22]: 22-058.

2085

[SPEAKER_22]: transparency and protect civil rights and civil liberties.

2086
02:46:49,192 --> 02:46:52,533
[SPEAKER_22]: This is actually the community control over policing ordinance, correct?

2087
02:46:52,553 --> 02:46:53,153
[SPEAKER_22]: Public surveillance.

2088
02:46:53,313 --> 02:46:53,973
[SPEAKER_22]: Public surveillance.

2089
02:46:54,633 --> 02:46:56,814
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, not policing, just public surveillance.

2090
02:46:57,254 --> 02:47:02,175
[SPEAKER_22]: That is not community control over public surveillance ordinance that is before us.

2091
02:47:02,775 --> 02:47:07,676
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there any further discussion on this paper before us before we vote?

2092
02:47:07,956 --> 02:47:12,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve.

2093
02:47:13,097 --> 02:47:15,697

2094

2095
02:47:20,719 --> 02:47:24,020
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the community controller.

2096
02:47:25,221 --> 02:47:29,563
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, we do you want to keep your motion, Councilor Knight, I can go No, I'll just withdraw my motion.

2097
02:47:29,623 --> 02:47:31,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

2098
02:47:31,524 --> 02:47:36,426

[SPEAKER_22]: I said Councilor Favreau, former Councilor Favreau.

2155
02:50:24,357 --> 02:50:26,958
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, seconded by Councilor Collins.

2156
02:50:28,398 --> 02:50:29,359
[SPEAKER_22]: Voter wrong I was getting.

2157
02:50:36,482 --> 02:50:37,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Bears.

2158
02:50:37,403 --> 02:50:37,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2159
02:50:38,463 --> 02:50:39,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello.

2160
02:50:39,163 --> 02:50:39,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2161
02:50:40,464 --> 02:50:41,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins.

2162
02:50:41,284 --> 02:50:41,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2163
02:50:44,067 --> 02:50:44,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2164
02:50:44,727 --> 02:50:44,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2165
02:50:45,447 --> 02:50:45,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng?

2166
02:50:46,028 --> 02:50:46,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2167
02:50:46,528 --> 02:50:47,068
[SPEAKER_13]: President Morell?

2168
02:50:47,388 --> 02:50:47,588
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2169
02:50:47,688 --> 02:50:50,729
[SPEAKER_22]: Seven the affirmative, zero the negative, the motion passes approved for third reading.

2170
02:50:50,749 --> 02:51:01,912
[SPEAKER_22]: 23-057, establish the traffic and transportation director position in the city's classification and compensation plan eligible for third reading March 28th, 2023.

2171
02:51:02,913 --> 02:51:10,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, I do believe about three hours ago, we started a meeting.

2172
02:51:11,275 --> 02:51:13,076
[SPEAKER_10]: And when this meeting started, this room was filled

2173
02:51:14,097 --> 02:51:16,419
[SPEAKER_10]: filled with workers that wrote the contract.

2174
02:51:18,101 --> 02:51:23,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Talked about five bargaining units in the city side at least, plus police and fire, that's seven.

2175
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:25,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven bargaining units without contracts.

2176
02:51:27,049 --> 02:51:35,897
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about transparency, we talked about finance, we talked about morale, we talked about the way workers are treated in the city.

2177
02:51:39,468 --> 02:51:50,097
[SPEAKER_10]: I made a pretty strong statement, Madam President, saying that I don't think there should be any more reclassifications of positions or creations of new positions until these contracts get settled, until these working people get taken care of.

2178
02:51:51,518 --> 02:52:05,089
[SPEAKER_10]: The existing employees that are doing the work now, that are going without a contract, a collective group of people, not just an individual, five bargaining units, all represented by one person, fighting every day.

2179
02:52:06,187 --> 02:52:12,671
[SPEAKER_10]: for groups and groups of people, just like we are, to get the same information that we're looking for, they can't attain.

2180
02:52:12,691 --> 02:52:19,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's right and I don't think it's fair at this point in time that we bring this paper up, Madam President.

2181
02:52:20,235 --> 02:52:21,636
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the gentleman's doing a good job.

2182
02:52:21,696 --> 02:52:23,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I said that when this paper came up for first reading.

2183
02:52:24,698 --> 02:52:31,402
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a particular issue with the paper other than the fact of when it's presented, how it's been presented,

2184
02:52:32,781 --> 02:52:38,405
[SPEAKER_10]: and the ongoing situation with the labor and workforce here in the community of Medford.

2185
02:52:39,105 --> 02:52:42,087
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, Madam President, I can't support this paper this evening.

2186
02:52:42,147 --> 02:52:45,870
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to, I'd like to support it in the near future, but I can't support it this evening.

2187
02:52:46,570 --> 02:52:48,031
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd ask that it remain on the table.

2188
02:52:48,652 --> 02:52:53,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's a contrary to the motion that's been made, but I might ask that it remain on the table until these contracts get adjusted.

2189
02:52:54,556 --> 02:52:56,037
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not fair to these working people.

2190
02:52:56,377 --> 02:53:02,201
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not fair for the mayor to pick and choose and pick and choose who's gonna get upgrades and who's not.

2191
02:53:03,964 --> 02:53:04,544
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just not fair.

2192
02:53:04,724 --> 02:53:05,185
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not right.

2193
02:53:05,265 --> 02:53:06,285
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not collective bargaining.

2194
02:53:06,746 --> 02:53:07,586
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not organizing.

2195
02:53:09,627 --> 02:53:11,108
[SPEAKER_10]: That's nepotism.

2196
02:53:11,128 --> 02:53:12,809
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a problem.

2197
02:53:13,669 --> 02:53:16,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I don't have a problem with the individual that holds the position.

2198
02:53:16,271 --> 02:53:17,251
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he's doing a great job.

2199
02:53:18,512 --> 02:53:21,273
[SPEAKER_10]: But at this point in time, I think that there are other people that are a priority.

2200
02:53:22,134 --> 02:53:24,015
[SPEAKER_10]: And the mayor said that they don't have any money for raises.

2201
02:53:24,415 --> 02:53:27,357
[SPEAKER_10]: And the mayor said that she has double the amount of free cash that they've ever had in the past.

2202
02:53:28,045 --> 02:53:30,806
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably because we spent all our alpha money, but that's a whole different story.

2203
02:53:31,266 --> 02:53:34,508
[SPEAKER_10]: So Madam President, with that being said, I think this paper should be on the table.

2204
02:53:35,688 --> 02:53:35,948
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2205
02:53:35,988 --> 02:53:38,089
[SPEAKER_22]: And we already took a motion to take the paper off the table.

2206
02:53:38,109 --> 02:53:45,893
[SPEAKER_22]: Do I have a second from Councilor Knight's motion to put the paper back on the table?

2207
02:53:45,913 --> 02:53:46,533
[SPEAKER_22]: I second that.

2208
02:53:46,913 --> 02:53:48,074
[SPEAKER_22]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2209
02:53:49,514 --> 02:53:50,275
[SPEAKER_22]: All those in favor?

2210
02:53:50,955 --> 02:53:51,135
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

2211
02:53:52,115 --> 02:53:54,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2212
02:53:54,597 --> 02:53:56,337
[SPEAKER_22]: I heard some nos and some yeses.

2213
02:53:56,838 --> 02:53:57,798
[SPEAKER_22]: Someone's call for roll call.

2214
02:53:58,682 --> 02:53:58,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2215
02:53:59,042 --> 02:53:59,383
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, sir.

2216
02:53:59,783 --> 02:54:01,444
[SPEAKER_22]: Roll call, please.

2217
02:54:04,627 --> 02:54:06,308
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the motion to put the paper back on the table.

2218
02:54:06,328 --> 02:54:06,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2219
02:54:16,116 --> 02:54:16,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Pierce?

2220
02:54:17,397 --> 02:54:17,657
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2221
02:54:18,858 --> 02:54:19,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello?

2222
02:54:19,578 --> 02:54:20,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2223
02:54:21,360 --> 02:54:22,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins?

2224
02:54:22,260 --> 02:54:22,621
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

2225
02:54:25,823 --> 02:54:26,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

2226
02:54:26,644 --> 02:54:26,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2227
02:54:29,602 --> 02:54:30,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2228
02:54:30,743 --> 02:54:31,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2229
02:54:31,984 --> 02:54:32,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng?

2230
02:54:32,705 --> 02:54:32,845
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2231
02:54:33,706 --> 02:54:34,226
[SPEAKER_13]: President Morell?

2232
02:54:34,747 --> 02:54:34,907
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

2233
02:54:35,027 --> 02:54:36,569
[SPEAKER_22]: Three in the affirmative, four in the negative.

2234
02:54:37,830 --> 02:54:38,570
[SPEAKER_22]: The motion fails.

2235
02:54:39,752 --> 02:54:41,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam President, if I may.

2236
02:54:41,633 --> 02:54:42,814
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Bears.

2237
02:54:42,955 --> 02:54:43,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

2238
02:54:44,636 --> 02:54:53,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you know, as I said a couple of minutes ago, we were starting this exercise and I'm kind of bummed this is the last one of the six and not one of the earlier ones, but it's okay.

2239
02:54:56,108 --> 02:55:07,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think as I've said before to to Mr. South when the room is full and I kind of, you know, said tonight, you know, I don't think a blanket policy is the best policy.

2240
02:55:07,235 --> 02:55:10,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't disagree with the motivation whatsoever.

2241
02:55:10,717 --> 02:55:16,460
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really tough for me to say, we're not going to do anything because I don't think the mayor cares.

2242
02:55:17,533 --> 02:55:18,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the part of it.

2243
02:55:18,334 --> 02:55:22,758
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I'm willing to try to use the power and leverage that we have to achieve a goal.

2244
02:55:23,479 --> 02:55:27,462
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not willing and I'm not implying that this is what this paper is about.

2245
02:55:27,602 --> 02:55:37,271
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think taking, you know, going to the fullest extreme and saying we won't do anything on any financial paper, any classification, anything ever, you know,

2246
02:55:38,052 --> 02:55:47,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Something could write we had the fire department here last week about fire trucks and we weren't going to get fire trucks for 800 days and then it would have been 1600 days if we didn't approve it right and we all voted for it.

2247
02:55:47,418 --> 02:55:58,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And I we all I think shared the same record you know concerns about it right like we don't like how it's going but when the fire chief says we need to do pieces of gear so that buildings don't burn down.

2248
02:55:59,687 --> 02:56:09,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and we should have more, and again, I can agree on the motivations, I can agree on the merits, and I can agree that it's not the perfect proposals that are coming before us, far from it.

2249
02:56:10,557 --> 02:56:15,061
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, again, on this one, can I do a little bit of good for the city voting?

2250
02:56:15,101 --> 02:56:15,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

2251
02:56:16,142 --> 02:56:17,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I think I do any good voting?

2252
02:56:17,883 --> 02:56:21,126
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, because I don't think it's gonna change the mayor's approach.

2253
02:56:21,927 --> 02:56:37,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Now are there other things that I hope will and that I hope that we can hold lines on that we you know we held lines on those positions that came before us last December and last January for a year, we, we removed them from the table last week some of them sat for 15 months, shouldn't care, she just never hired these people.

2254
02:56:38,053 --> 02:56:45,476
[SPEAKER_03]: You know we got a list of 12 positions that were urgent and important for the city and then 15 months later when we took them off the table there was even a whisper.

2255
02:56:46,329 --> 02:56:52,696
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we hold this up, does she change her mind on all this other stuff either?

2256
02:56:52,716 --> 02:56:53,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

2257
02:56:53,878 --> 02:56:55,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I've said this to other folks.

2258
02:56:56,340 --> 02:56:57,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm willing to admit I may be wrong.

2259
02:56:58,743 --> 02:57:01,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 100% sure that everything I do is always right.

2260
02:57:01,687 --> 02:57:02,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be the...

2261
02:57:03,376 --> 02:57:05,456
[SPEAKER_03]: epitome of arrogance to feel that way.

2262
02:57:05,476 --> 02:57:07,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think anyone makes good decisions when they're acting that way.

2263
02:57:08,617 --> 02:57:14,438
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just personally think that there's some good that I can do supporting this paper tonight.

2264
02:57:14,538 --> 02:57:17,539
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't see the good that comes by not supporting it.

2265
02:57:17,699 --> 02:57:22,600
[SPEAKER_03]: But I respect my colleagues for feeling differently because it's a catch 22 situation.

2266
02:57:22,640 --> 02:57:26,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at the end of the day, it's like, do this or don't do this.

2267
02:57:26,341 --> 02:57:29,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you help or hurt?

2268
02:57:30,382 --> 02:57:37,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the answer is, you know, people are very hurting right now, and I hear that, and I've heard it very personally, not in public setting about how much people are hurting.

2269
02:57:38,785 --> 02:57:40,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I completely respect and agree with that.

2270
02:57:41,286 --> 02:57:46,067
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've also heard from some other people who are hurting because things aren't moving forward that are getting proposed to us.

2271
02:57:46,748 --> 02:57:50,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we may think we're putting the mayor in the bind, but she's putting these people in a bind.

2272
02:57:51,309 --> 02:57:53,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the piece of the fairness that I have a hard time with.

2273
02:57:53,910 --> 02:57:58,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I respect the difficulty of this, but that's why I want to move forward.

2274
02:57:58,351 --> 02:57:58,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2275
02:57:59,132 --> 02:57:59,732
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Collins.

2276
02:58:00,694 --> 02:58:01,534
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell.

2277
02:58:01,574 --> 02:58:06,456
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also want to, you know, I don't want to just bring this up and vote for it uncommented on.

2278
02:58:06,496 --> 02:58:18,781
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want to be clear that to my fellow councilors, I know that don't agree with voting on this tonight at all, you know, that I, I hear you and I really genuinely do respect your opinion and sympathize with where you're coming from.

2279
02:58:18,801 --> 02:58:26,684
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel the cognitive dissonance of having those workers in the room before, and, you know, for weeks and months before this and having those discussions and hearing from them.

2280
02:58:27,295 --> 02:58:36,220
[SPEAKER_20]: and then taking this up, I feel it, it's palpable, and I think I really hear and understand where you're coming from and that difference in strategy.

2281
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:48,247
[SPEAKER_20]: But for me, the reason I feel that this is important, and I think that Councilor Behr has put this really well, for me, the cognitive dissonance isn't between this type of positions and the collective bargaining units positions that they represent.

2282
02:58:48,307 --> 02:58:56,152
[SPEAKER_20]: It's between all workers in the city of Medford and this financial strategy that leaves money on the table while not giving every worker

2283
02:58:56,618 --> 02:58:58,299
[SPEAKER_20]: the raise that they deserve.

2284
02:58:58,800 --> 02:59:00,281
[SPEAKER_20]: That is the cognitive dissonance to me.

2285
02:59:01,001 --> 02:59:04,884
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think, you know, Councilor Bears put it well, what do we have the power to do?

2286
02:59:05,384 --> 02:59:14,791
[SPEAKER_20]: I think if we had the power to say, you have to give at least a 3% raise to all of these unionized workers in the city, we would have executed that already because that's where all of our hearts lie.

2287
02:59:15,371 --> 02:59:16,933
[SPEAKER_20]: If we had that power, we would have done it already.

2288
02:59:17,113 --> 02:59:18,073
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't have that power.

2289
02:59:18,093 --> 02:59:24,138
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that all of us are going to continue to try to advocate for those workers how we can, but given that,

2290
02:59:25,190 --> 02:59:26,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Our jurisdiction here is limited.

2291
02:59:26,651 --> 02:59:27,691
[SPEAKER_20]: Our power here is limited.

2292
02:59:28,811 --> 02:59:32,153
[SPEAKER_20]: It's important to me to move this needle forward because we can.

2293
02:59:32,213 --> 02:59:35,994
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just, I don't expect that to persuade anybody who sees the strategy differently.

2294
02:59:36,034 --> 02:59:46,259
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to explain my view to let you know that I do sympathize with other approaches to this and I, well, thanks.

2295
02:59:47,729 --> 02:59:48,109
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2296
02:59:48,489 --> 02:59:59,176
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Vice President Bears and Councilor Collins put over pretty eloquent in describing what, what, what's been going through my mind when it comes to this specific vote.

2297
03:00:00,437 --> 03:00:07,662
[SPEAKER_18]: I just think I can't look some resident in the eye and promise them that a no vote on this would really benefit our city.

2298
03:00:07,962 --> 03:00:08,522
[SPEAKER_18]: I just can't.

2299
03:00:09,303 --> 03:00:15,307
[SPEAKER_18]: I, there's been evidence that, you know, the mayor doesn't care enough about it, and, and

2300
03:00:16,247 --> 03:00:22,250
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't look a voter in the eye and say that we're not gonna have a vacancy if we don't approve this.

2301
03:00:23,051 --> 03:00:27,353
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm afraid we're already having a very difficult time filling all the vacancies in this building.

2302
03:00:27,973 --> 03:00:39,059
[SPEAKER_18]: And if a private firm were to come in and offer a position to our traffic and transportation director, I could not promise the residents of the city that we wouldn't have a vacancy.

2303
03:00:39,686 --> 03:00:51,499
[SPEAKER_18]: And to me that rings large and I am afraid that a Nova would hurt our city overall, even though I do agree with the principles that my other my other colleagues are laying out.

2304
03:00:51,899 --> 03:00:52,960
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I agree.

2305
03:00:53,381 --> 03:00:58,546
[SPEAKER_18]: And my first reaction when we heard about 25 million free cash was, well,

2306
03:00:59,227 --> 03:01:08,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Where was that money when we needed to negotiate with unions where was that money when we needed to, to treat our workers well, but look, this it's a difficult decision.

2307
03:01:08,672 --> 03:01:11,634
[SPEAKER_10]: It was used on these one offs to give the personal people raises.

2308
03:01:11,814 --> 03:01:13,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, this isn't $25 million.

2309
03:01:13,194 --> 03:01:15,636
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, and so that's why I'm planning on voting yes.

2310
03:01:15,656 --> 03:01:15,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2311
03:01:27,547 --> 03:01:37,855
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just saying, you know, when the mayor was running her staunch campaign two years ago, she was very proud of this grant that they got from the Collins Center that was gonna be a compensation and classification study that we still have never seen.

2312
03:01:38,435 --> 03:01:42,098
[SPEAKER_10]: But the mayor has proposed how many one-off positions to get raises?

2313
03:01:43,479 --> 03:01:47,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at the same time, stonewalling labor, all right?

2314
03:01:48,202 --> 03:01:51,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we're putting the individual in front of labor, I think that's wrong.

2315
03:01:51,484 --> 03:01:56,088
[SPEAKER_10]: When we're putting the individual department head in front of the lowest paid workers,

2316
03:01:57,167 --> 03:02:00,368
[SPEAKER_10]: in this community, I think it's wrong, you know?

2317
03:02:01,649 --> 03:02:20,715
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we talk about, you know, the difficulty to fill jobs, I think it has less to do with compensation and more to do with the fact that when you Google Medford, you see that people gotta undergo psych evaluations, people having GPS trackers put on their car, people are getting banned from city hall, people are getting taken out in handcuffs.

2318
03:02:21,115 --> 03:02:23,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's the stuff that deters people from coming.

2319
03:02:23,936 --> 03:02:26,677
[SPEAKER_10]: The people filing racial discrimination suits,

2320
03:02:27,873 --> 03:02:28,754
[SPEAKER_10]: against the administration.

2321
03:02:28,774 --> 03:02:32,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I think those are more deterrent than anything else.

2322
03:02:32,916 --> 03:02:36,177
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think the compensation is necessarily the biggest issue.

2323
03:02:37,558 --> 03:02:41,700
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I look at this, I just say, I think it's backwards.

2324
03:02:43,001 --> 03:02:43,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to vote for it.

2325
03:02:44,662 --> 03:02:45,382
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is what it is.

2326
03:02:45,882 --> 03:02:52,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, ultimately, we've been hearing about this grant since Dave Rodriguez was up there about the compensation study, but none of us have ever seen a copy of it.

2327
03:02:52,526 --> 03:02:56,868
[SPEAKER_10]: But the mayor has proposed I get at least seven, at least seven position upgrades and new jobs.

2328
03:02:59,260 --> 03:03:02,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus whatever she created through the Apple money that we don't even know about.

2329
03:03:07,763 --> 03:03:09,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one last point.

2330
03:03:09,444 --> 03:03:20,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we talk about the fact that you can't say that not approving this raise isn't good for the community.

2331
03:03:21,792 --> 03:03:26,015
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we know that when there's only a finite pool of money that we have to elevate the workers?

2332
03:03:26,735 --> 03:03:36,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're using this finite pool to elevate individuals versus collective bargaining organizations, groups that have ownership in their work.

2333
03:03:37,403 --> 03:03:39,644
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems to me like if you talk back, you don't get a race.

2334
03:03:40,525 --> 03:03:43,887
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a loyal soldier, then you might get an upgrade, right?

2335
03:03:43,927 --> 03:03:44,748
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it looks like, right?

2336
03:03:44,768 --> 03:03:47,510
[SPEAKER_10]: If you fight for your rights, you're gonna be going to mediation.

2337
03:03:48,591 --> 03:03:50,232
[SPEAKER_10]: If you keep your mouth shut and you're a loyal soldier,

2338
03:03:51,910 --> 03:03:52,710
[SPEAKER_10]: we're gonna give you an upgrade.

2339
03:03:53,851 --> 03:04:00,513
[SPEAKER_10]: If you are the federal funds manager and you come before the council and you say, whoa, whoa, whoa, something's wrong here during the budget debates, you get fired.

2340
03:04:04,114 --> 03:04:07,935
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the things that I look at when I talk about fairness and the way that it's going.

2341
03:04:08,315 --> 03:04:10,556
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, you guys know where I stand on this.

2342
03:04:10,596 --> 03:04:11,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I've talked about it too much.

2343
03:04:11,516 --> 03:04:12,157
[SPEAKER_10]: I rest my case.

2344
03:04:12,197 --> 03:04:12,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

2345
03:04:13,337 --> 03:04:13,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2346
03:04:14,077 --> 03:04:14,677
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Bears.

2347
03:04:14,977 --> 03:04:15,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

2348
03:04:15,738 --> 03:04:17,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I get where you're coming from on it.

2349
03:04:17,978 --> 03:04:18,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just two things for me.

2350
03:04:20,653 --> 03:04:30,700
[SPEAKER_03]: that work environment that you just described, I quite frankly think anyone who's willing to stay here and stick that work environment out to do good work for Medford, we shouldn't be the reason that they leave.

2351
03:04:31,241 --> 03:04:35,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand, you know, and I understand that where you're coming from on it.

2352
03:04:35,203 --> 03:04:48,693
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is, I think in my memory, I think that, or maybe we shouldn't be the reason that we leave is not the right way to phrase it, but I don't want us to be the barrier because there's so many other barriers that these people are facing that you eloquently outlined that are really tough and they want to stay here anyway.

2353
03:04:48,853 --> 03:04:53,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information just on that, my buddy Biggie, I think it was Biggie Small, more money, more problems, right?

2354
03:04:53,476 --> 03:04:55,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think, more money's not gonna make any happier, all right?

2355
03:04:55,898 --> 03:04:57,639
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just gonna make you better compensated.

2356
03:04:57,719 --> 03:05:01,362
[SPEAKER_10]: But if the environment's hostile, right, how do you address it?

2357
03:05:01,662 --> 03:05:03,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, take more money and let me be evil to you?

2358
03:05:03,383 --> 03:05:04,664
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

2359
03:05:04,684 --> 03:05:05,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that makes sense either.

2360
03:05:05,705 --> 03:05:06,265
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not correct.

2361
03:05:06,646 --> 03:05:09,027
[SPEAKER_22]: I disagree, that's what more money, more problems means.

2362
03:05:10,328 --> 03:05:15,849
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, yeah, we can have a diatribe on biggie but I'm familiar with familiar.

2363
03:05:16,450 --> 03:05:33,093
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and that's not what I'm saying at all I don't think that you should be able to get paid off to live in a hostel apartment I certainly don't agree with that I'm just saying people are sticking this out, and some of them are saying hey, this is what I need but the other piece I want to say to to your point, I think the mayor since January 22 is proposed 16 calf changes.

2364
03:05:33,614 --> 03:05:34,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We've rejected 14.

2365
03:05:35,514 --> 03:05:36,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're batting pretty high.

2366
03:05:37,337 --> 03:05:46,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree, you know, you may want to be 100 I'm okay with 90 I think I'm fulfilling the principle you're fulfilling we disagree on it, that's okay with me but we're doing all right, in my opinion, but I see where you're coming from.

2367
03:05:47,170 --> 03:05:47,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2368
03:05:50,983 --> 03:05:51,783
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

2369
03:05:51,903 --> 03:06:00,165
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sticking by my statement I made earlier this evening, that I will not support any race for any department head until the workers get their race.

2370
03:06:00,745 --> 03:06:04,225
[SPEAKER_19]: My father taught me this when I first started working for him many years ago.

2371
03:06:04,705 --> 03:06:12,267
[SPEAKER_19]: We ran a union factory, and the workers are the people that are most important to your business, not the bosses.

2372
03:06:12,447 --> 03:06:13,127
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the workers.

2373
03:06:13,467 --> 03:06:15,187
[SPEAKER_19]: They're the ones that do the grunt work.

2374
03:06:15,227 --> 03:06:16,627
[SPEAKER_19]: They're there day in and day out.

2375
03:06:17,547 --> 03:06:20,508
[SPEAKER_19]: When they get their race, I'll start supporting department head races.

2376
03:06:22,002 --> 03:06:23,022
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam President.

2377
03:06:23,362 --> 03:06:23,822
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2378
03:06:24,382 --> 03:06:24,823
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Collins.

2379
03:06:25,543 --> 03:06:26,283
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell.

2380
03:06:26,323 --> 03:06:27,403
[SPEAKER_20]: And I appreciate this discussion.

2381
03:06:27,443 --> 03:06:28,383
[SPEAKER_20]: I was going to move the question.

2382
03:06:29,003 --> 03:06:31,284
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2383
03:06:31,364 --> 03:06:33,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Just one point of privilege.

2384
03:06:33,464 --> 03:06:35,564
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's also a point to point out that this isn't the race.

2385
03:06:35,964 --> 03:06:37,265
[SPEAKER_10]: This position is going to get upgraded.

2386
03:06:37,965 --> 03:06:39,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Then it's going to get the raises.

2387
03:06:39,245 --> 03:06:41,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the question is, are these raises retroactive?

2388
03:06:42,186 --> 03:06:44,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do the raises only begin when we create the position?

2389
03:06:44,586 --> 03:06:50,307
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I believe it was explained to us as a second.

2390
03:06:52,192 --> 03:07:01,257
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President, I won't belabor this I know you know where I stand on this I think that this discussion is a healthy discussion the banter is healthy.

2391
03:07:01,737 --> 03:07:10,081
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is what people elected us for to think of outside the box and think of, you know, every avenue so I think it's, it's a.

2392
03:07:10,781 --> 03:07:16,302
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a positive step, whether you're on the side that wins this argument or loses this argument.

2393
03:07:16,382 --> 03:07:21,283
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do think that my point is this, and I'll say this again.

2394
03:07:21,963 --> 03:07:38,007
[SPEAKER_17]: My fear is, no matter who is in that position, as we figure out this financial path that we're in, because we still don't know, and I know it's one person's race, but

2395
03:07:41,076 --> 03:07:48,898
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of little pieces that have been put into place and given the money that we need without knowing what's going on.

2396
03:07:48,998 --> 03:08:04,581
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, that's just another reason why I wouldn't vote against anything with the money paper, like I said, for the fact that we don't know our financial future.

2397
03:08:06,681 --> 03:08:09,922
[SPEAKER_17]: We appreciate the finance director presenting what he did, but that's not,

2398
03:08:11,380 --> 03:08:17,265
[SPEAKER_17]: You're right, it's not the complete piece, and that's what I'm nervous about.

2399
03:08:17,665 --> 03:08:22,629
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, thank you for the time.

2400
03:08:23,129 --> 03:08:23,410
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2401
03:08:24,771 --> 03:08:31,416
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears is seconded by Councilor Tseng to approve for a third reading.

2402
03:08:32,337 --> 03:08:33,337
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2403
03:08:35,379 --> 03:08:36,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Bears.

2404

[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng present room.

2411
03:08:52,083 --> 03:08:56,127

2412
03:08:58,029 --> 03:08:58,490
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

2413
03:08:59,250 --> 03:09:02,714
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion Councilor scarpelli to adjourn second by Councilor Tseng all those in favor.

2414
03:09:03,314 --> 03:09:05,316
[SPEAKER_22]: All those opposed motion passes meeting adjourned.
