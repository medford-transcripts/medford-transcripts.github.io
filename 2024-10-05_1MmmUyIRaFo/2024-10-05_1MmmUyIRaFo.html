    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1.542s">Seventh</a>  regular meeting of the Medford City Council March 28 2023 is called to order Mr. Clerk please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7.225s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=36.608s">Announcements,</a>  accolades, remembrances, reports, and records. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=40.833s">23-076</a>  offered by Vice President Bears and Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=43.056s">A</a>  resolution to extend best wishes to Muslims in Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=49.728s">Thank</a>  you, vice president bears on the motion of ice is embarrassed to suspend the rules to take public participation seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=55.915s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=57.056s">I</a>  always oppose motion passes, I know we have some folks from Winthrop street that wanted to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=63.503s">If</a>  anyone wants to speak and come up and name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=72.56s">Good</a>  evening, my name is Mark chubs 356 went up street 40 year resident lifetime resident West Method, my family's been in West Med for 150 years, retired as a union construction worker, I'm disabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=85.284s">I</a>  have three grandchildren, I live on one step street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=89.125s">And</a>  it's a very debilitating situation for us to lose our parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=94.949s">I'm</a>  all about safety, but I'm concerned about safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=98.635s">My</a>  grandchildren happen across the street, me crossing the street, parking on side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=103.683s">We</a>  all have shared driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=106.683s">I</a>  have a visiting visiting nurse my mother's 90 years old she comes to my house I don't even know how I can get her out of my house.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=112.868s">I</a>  can, I can just interject just so I know that sure it's, you're a little fired up I just want to make sure that I know we get the opportunity to talk I think what Mr. Chubbs is talking about is the traffic commission meeting that was held last week, that there was some sort of approval or process that they're looking to take both sides of Winthrop Street, I believe, from <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=135.547s">the</a>  park, all the way to South Street to implement bike lane safe bike lanes but would put in bollards along both sides of the street, and we've got many phone calls from residents that were concerned that it's going going to directly affect their life, their quality of life, the safety and well being to the families and <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=155.662s">businesses</a>  like the American Legion that is located right on that street that that need those parking spaces for their survival. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=164.827s">So</a>  again, I think I just want to clear just so you're all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=168.469s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=168.93s">So</a>  again, you have another neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=171.971s">You'd</a>  like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=173.072s">Thank</a>  you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=173.933s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=175.368s">Yeah,</a>  and just to add to Councilor Scarpelli, that issue was tabled at the Traffic Commission, so it's something they'll take up at their next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=181.152s">And</a>  I did talk to Director Blake, and because it hasn't been accepted yet, I think there is, you know, there is the ability to go back and forth and hear from more residents on it, so I just want to make that clear that it's not set in stone yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=193.519s">They</a>  do have this plan, it's a plan they've worked on, but they tabled it for a reason, so.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=198.163s">Madam</a>  President, if we could just ask that the city clerk reach out to our friends at the American Legion to see what impact this will have on our election day operations as well, whether or not if those pocket spots are gone, the American Legion will still be able to continue to serve as a polling location during those days because they have operational needs to meet as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=216.852s">So</a>  if they don't have those pocket spots, they might have to pull out of their agreement with the city to be used as a polling place. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=222.155s">So</a>  that's something that I think we need to look into because we have an election coming up very shortly.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=225.396s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=226.116s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, do you have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=227.988s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=230.786s">My</a>  name is George Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=231.746s">I</a>  live at 352 Winthrop Street, and I'm here to talk about the elimination of parking Winthrop Street for this specific area from Lawrence Road to Winthrop Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=240.408s">I</a>  understand the council does not vote on this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=242.609s">The</a>  vote is taken by the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=244.769s">I</a>  stand before you today to request that the council ensure safety is fairly applied to everyone using Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=250.231s">This</a>  includes cyclists and homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=252.431s">Winthrop</a>  Street is dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=253.611s">I</a>  know, I live on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=254.852s">Bike</a>  lanes are being recommended to make it safe for cyclists, but Winthrop Street is also very dangerous for me and my neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=261.774s">We</a>  currently enjoy the right to safely park in front of our homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=264.916s">If</a>  parking is eliminated, we'll have to park across the street on the side streets of Badger and Burbank roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=270.54s">This</a>  means unlike cyclists who move the flow of traffic, residents will need to cut directly across the street every time we need to access our vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=277.666s">I</a>  currently don't park on those side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=279.307s">It's</a>  too dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=280.428s">I'm</a>  healthy and I can easily run across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=282.749s">If</a>  Winthrop was a sleepy side street, I have no problem eliminating parking, but it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=287.293s">It's</a>  busy and dangerous to cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=289.41s">At</a>  the last traffic commission meeting, the first order of business was approving a handicapped space for a woman with mobility limitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=295.898s">She</a>  requested a dedicated handicapped space in front of her home because it was difficult for her to walk and she needed to park sometimes far away. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=303.607s">The</a>  commission approved the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=305.469s">The</a>  commission approved the request to ensure her safety due to mobility limitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=310.638s">I</a>  asked the council to work with the Traffic Commission so they fully understand that the residents of Winthrop Street need to continue to have safe parking in front of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=318.401s">Elimination</a>  of parking will force residents with mobility issues to park across the street, a heavily trafficked street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=325.064s">Our</a>  request to continue to have access to safe parking for older residents is the same philosophy they used in approving the handicap request. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=334.317s">I've</a>  lived in my home for 35 years and I have enjoyed the right to safely park in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=339.36s">I</a>  plan to live in my home as long as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=341.801s">This</a>  goal can only be achieved if I continue to have access to safe, close parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=345.744s">It</a>  worries me when I get older and develop mobility limitations, I might have to consider moving as there's no way I can easily cross the street multiple times a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=354.749s">It's</a>  not safe now, let alone if I had a cane. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=358.0s">I've</a>  heard that I've heard that the elimination of parking is a done deal the traffic commission has already decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=363.526s">I</a>  was devastated when I heard this, where did democracy go in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=367.49s">Proper</a>  notification was never given to me and my neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=370.131s">I</a>  asked the Council to ensure that the democratic process is preserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=373.873s">The</a>  residents of Winthrop Street received proper notification of parking changes that will affect their access to safe parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=380.495s">With</a>  proper notification, residents will be able to take part in a debate and discussion at the next Traffic Commission meeting and have time to bring up their concerns to both the Traffic Commission and members of City Council as I am doing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=393.042s">I'm</a>  drafting a letter to the Traffic Commission that recommends a compromise be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=396.984s">This</a>  compromise will preserve resident parking on the even side of the street with the current share of the lane markings, and that parking be removed on the odd side of the street so a dedicated bike lane can be added. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=408.37s">Residents</a>  on the odd side of the street are few in numbers, and they have access to Badger and Burbank Road without having to cross Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=415.03s">I</a>  plan to reach out to all the neighbors and ask them to sign this compromise letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=418.592s">I</a>  will submit the letter to the Traffic Commission in advance of the April 11th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=422.275s">Once</a>  again, this is only from the section from Lawrence Road to Winthrop Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=426.117s">I</a>  don't want to be up here today talking in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=427.978s">Public</a>  speaking makes me uncomfortable, but I got no choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=431.621s">I</a>  love my home, I love where I live, and I need to ensure continued access to safe parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=437.124s">I'm</a>  here to represent all my neighbors of the neighborhood and keep them to keep access to safe parking we enjoy today. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=445.037s">In</a>  closing, I ask the council to ensure that the concept of safety is applied to all citizens, both cyclists and homeowners, and that the democratic process of notification debate and reaching a compromise be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=457.286s">Thank</a>  you for your time, and I appreciate your consideration in this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=459.948s">It's</a>  very important to me and my neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=462.15s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=468.491s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, President, I received several phone calls from residents of winter street, along with members of the Legion over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=477.199s">We</a>  got to this, you know, not too long ago, the traffic commission took away all the spots, most of the spots on high street for all those residents who now only can park on <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=488.544s">one</a>  side of the street and in certain sections of High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=491.085s">And</a>  to do that on Winter Street, like Councilor Scott probably said, and Councilor Knight said, you've got the legion, which depends on those parking spaces for their existence. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=502.629s">And</a>  again, on voting day, are we gonna be able to vote there? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=505.63s">Because</a>  most people park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=507.35s">But</a>  these people who live in those streets, those are private ways that come up at Winter Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=513.592s">So</a>  technically, they don't have the right to park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=516.831s">because</a>  those are for the residents that live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=519.272s">If</a>  those residents want to have those cars towed, they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=522.134s">I</a>  don't think they would do that, but their options are thin. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=526.176s">The</a>  holidays come up, where do their friends park if you don't have a big enough driveway? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=532.2s">It's</a>  just not fair to just wipe our parking spots without having alternatives for these people to park.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=538.667s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=540.288s">Again,</a>  I appreciate the residents that came up to speak but I think that it'd be something that possibly we asked the traffic, make a motion that we asked the traffic engineer to come to the city council next city council meeting because I think that compromise sounds great but. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=559.261s">It's</a>  great if you live on the side of the road that still has parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=563.924s">So</a>  I think that the phone calls we received, and I think the biggest one is the American Legion and the fact that they're a veteran service function hall that survives on rentals and having those spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=578.313s">Because</a>  if you talk about competition and they don't have those parking spots, they're just gonna leave to Arlington or other communities and they lose their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=587.898s">And</a>  that's something that <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=589.099s">this</a>  community needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=591.36s">And</a>  they've been very good to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=592.76s">So</a>  the other piece of this is unlike high street, when I've talked to some of the residents, Madam President, the discussion was most of those side, most of those driveways are shared driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=604.603s">So</a>  to access your parking area in your property, you have to go through a shared driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=612.405s">So</a>  it's beneficial or it's necessary to have <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=617.706s">the</a>  parking on the street so neighbors can easily park in their driveways and then put their cars away at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=623.308s">So</a>  it's a different dimension that we never had to look at with High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=626.75s">So</a>  I appreciate you hearing, allowing us to present to our neighbors and I just move on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=635.873s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=636.894s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=638.414s">Any</a>  other members of the public wish to speak on Winthrop Street specifically?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=644.096s">Madam</a>  President, on this issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=645.974s">If</a>  we look at the agenda, I believe we do have some representatives from Eversource that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=649.476s">And</a>  the construction schedule is going to be something we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=652.077s">And</a>  as I'm looking at the handout that they gave us, it looks like they're going to be doing about 3,000 linear feet of milling and paving from Winthrop Street to Mystic Valley Parkway in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=662.402s">So</a>  maybe we could hold the discussion on this topic until that comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=666.444s">Because</a>  it's brought under public participation, we can't make any motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=669.085s">But</a>  if we bring it up underneath the Eversource paper, we'll be able to make some motions and have some action on it now.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=673.727s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=674.408s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=682.709s">Anyone</a>  here or anyone on Zoom if you want to speak on Winthrop Street, if you want to raise your hand on Zoom, if it's something you want to speak on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=688.17s">I</a>  don't see any anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=694.712s">Not</a>  seeing anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=699.534s">Yep,</a>  yeah, we'll revisit during the...</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=706.982s">want</a>  to speak during community participation, if we allow them to join us.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=712.948s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=713.389s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=715.472s">Stephen</a>  South 106 Damon Road Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=719.053s">Also</a>  the secretary treasurer of Teamsters local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=723.794s">Thank</a>  you for having us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=725.855s">Madam</a>  President members of the council appreciate all you do just wanted to give you your monthly update from me regarding all of the contract negotiations and other issues going on within the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=739.558s">As</a>  I've stated before, Teamsters Local 25 represents eight bargaining units in the city of Medford, both on the school and the city side, over 200 members. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=750.863s">So</a>  I wanted to update you on the agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=753.904s">So</a>  since I last reported to you a little over a month ago, or a month and a half ago, we've continued negotiations with multiple units. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=763.428s">Three</a>  of the units, the DPW, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=766.145s">the</a>  inspectors, recreation department and DPW superintendents, which is the other agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=774.088s">And</a>  the third one is the Medford clerical. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=777.85s">We</a>  had come to impasse with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=780.511s">They</a>  gave us a last and final, which was obviously unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=786.073s">We</a>  brought it back to our members and all three bargaining units voted down the contracts unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=792.456s">all</a>  three units. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=793.718s">So</a>  we filed to mediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=795.401s">Those</a>  three units we are set to meet with the state mediator on April 13 right here in City Hall at 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=803.419s">I'd</a>  like to invite all seven of you, Councilors, I'd love for any or all of you to attend negotiations I'd love to see the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=813.79s">I</a>  shouldn't even say the city they don't have anyone speak it at any of our meetings it's KP law, I'd love for the KP law lawyer to <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=822.258s">put</a>  his positions out there on behalf of the city in front of all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=826.203s">I</a>  think you'd be very surprised by the positions that they're taking with regards to taking concessions from these hardworking workers, many of which that are behind me and giving only 2% raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=840.609s">when</a>  all of the other communities that we're bargaining with are giving much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=847.152s">On</a>  the city side also, the parking department and the department heads and assistant department heads, we'll have one more session, then we'll be at impasse. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=857.817s">We'll</a>  file for mediation with those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=860.718s">On</a>  the city side, we met last Friday with the superintendent and the city's attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=868.546s">We</a>  came to impasse on two of the groups, that's the school security and the school custodians. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=875.212s">That's</a>  being filed the mediation this week and I'll let you know when those dates are coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=880.557s">And</a>  the school administrators, which include the coordinators, department heads, directors, and assistant principals, we'll be at impasse with them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=893.029s">They're</a>  offering less, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=894.497s">to</a>  them than they are to the teachers who they supervise. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=898.058s">So</a>  obviously that's not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=900.439s">We've</a>  asked the city in all of these groups if they'd be willing to give our units what they gave the 500 teachers who we love, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=910.662s">And</a>  believe me, they deserve even more than they got. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=914.343s">But</a>  the city <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=916.024s">When</a>  they promised us previous whatever the teachers got would get, now they've reneged on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=921.01s">We</a>  have an email to that effect that we'd be getting what the teachers got. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=926.456s">Assistant</a>  Superintendent David Murphy, who we bargained with, was the city's chief negotiator all through negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=932.663s">He's</a>  since quit and went to work for Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=936.568s">So</a>  now the city's not honoring, I should say the school committee's not honoring what we previously agreed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=942.933s">So</a>  I believe we'll be at impasse with all eight groups that we represent. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=949.297s">And</a>  a couple of things, since my last report, we've also filed a whole bunch of labor charges for all various issues, for all the various groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=959.585s">I'll</a>  send you the updated labor charges tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=962.863s">I</a>  apologize, I wasn't able to prepare those for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=965.586s">The</a>  termination update, obviously you know that the HR director has resigned effective Friday, but also we had another termination since I last left, last report to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=977.698s">That's</a>  one of the senior sanitarians, been here over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=981.562s">She</a>  was terminated on Friday, which was two business days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=987.484s">I</a>  also want to just refresh your memory from my last report. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=992.469s">All</a>  the groups behind me representatives from all the groups from the bargaining units. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=998.836s">They</a>  haven't had a raise no one's had a raise in over a year, up to four and a half years for the clerical, the city hall clerical right in this building <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1008.504s">have</a>  not had a raise in just shy of four and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1012.986s">So</a>  some of the reasons that's problematic is like I said, the surrounding communities were settling contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1019.549s">We</a>  have been for the last year plus for anywhere to three to 7% wage increases each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1026.491s">The</a>  city's offering all of these groups 2% raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1031.393s">And</a>  I was very, very disheartened. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1033.414s">I</a>  wasn't able to make last Tuesday's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1036.736s">I</a>  was out of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1039.028s">And</a>  I believe that was an add on meeting so I wasn't able to change my schedule but it was brought to my attention that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1047.317s">The</a>  mayor put a paper on the table to give everybody, all the non-union in the city raises, including herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1054.462s">And</a>  I can tell you that that's a slap in the face to the many people that are standing behind me and the hundreds of people that I represent. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1062.929s">And</a>  then many of the groups that I don't represent, I know police and fire still don't have contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1068.533s">So</a>  I think for the mayor to ask to give herself a raise and retro pay, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1073.016s">when</a>  a majority of the bargaining units in the city of Medford have been without a contract for and haven't had a raise for up to four and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1083.122s">That's</a>  a disgrace and the mayor should be ashamed of herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1087.124s">Also</a>  last week I'm sure many of you saw on Facebook, but if you don't, if you didn't I can send it to you after the meeting that the mayor was bragging on Facebook <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1097.69s">about</a>  how the city has doubled its free cash since she took office and that now you have $25 million in certified free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1112.633s">You</a>  know we're bragging online to every for everybody to see in the community about how much free money the city has sitting out there when we're being told the opposite of contract negotiations, and we're being told to get 2% wage increases that we have to give concessions give back <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1131.551s">benefits</a>  and different things that the employees behind me already enjoy so I think somebody from the administration should get their story straight, is the city broke, or is the city swimming and free certified cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1145.366s">I'm</a>  curious to know I'm sure you are as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1149.91s">You</a>  know that that's really all I have and I'll just leave you with this, you know, we, we have hundreds of members that work for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1157.314s">We</a>  have another three or 400 members that live in the city that don't work for the city, and we're going to be out here we're going to be out here this month, we're going to be out here next month we're going to be out here through the summer, straight into election season if we need to be, we are the the workers behind me and the hundreds that <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1174.803s">that</a>  aren't here tonight, they are not going to accept a contract that is substandard and subpar, 2% raises with a bunch of concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1183.97s">That</a>  will never happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1185.811s">I'll</a>  be here next year, the year after, and the year after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1188.793s">That</a>  will never, ever happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1190.895s">Local</a>  25 will never agree to that the workers in the city will never agree to that, and I hope none of you will stand for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1197.598s">I</a>  know for many months that you've been talking and I believe you that you support the workers in the city that are behind me, and all the city's workers I appreciate that but I would call on all seven of you to please use the power that you have send letters <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1213.805s">take</a>  a stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1214.886s">Let</a>  this administration know that this is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1218.428s">This</a>  isn't happening in any of the other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1221.229s">Why</a>  are we getting strong contracts and fair contracts in all of the surrounding communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1227.292s">All</a>  of the communities that border the city of Medford are able to give <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1232.495s">fair</a>  contracts and fair wages and benefits to their employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1236.237s">I</a>  don't know, I can't figure out why Medford's the only city that cannot provide a living wage to its workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1244.541s">I</a>  would appreciate it if any or all of you could attend the April 13 meeting right here at 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1251.304s">Please</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1251.964s">We</a>  also have another meeting on the school side at the end of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1256.406s">I'll</a>  send you the dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1258.287s">I</a>  would respectfully ask and request that all of you utilize the power that you have, utilize the resources that you have, and support these workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1267.971s">They</a>  need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1268.831s">They</a>  need a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1270.091s">Some</a>  of them are starving. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1271.792s">I</a>  don't know about all of you and your real jobs, your regular day jobs, but I know I couldn't go four or five years without a wage increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1280.455s">That's</a>  ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1281.936s">And</a>  any support that you can provide to the <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1285.898s">workers</a>  that are here and the ones that aren't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1288.24s">We</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1289.501s">And</a>  as always, I thank you for your service to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1293.484s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1309.25s">I</a>  wish people wouldn't use the word free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1311.693s">It's</a>  not free, it's taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1314.296s">So</a>  I don't want people to think that it's money that we just came about for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1319.282s">It's</a>  money that belongs to the taxpayers of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1322.826s">The</a>  word free should be taken out of that text there.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1327.551s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1328.272s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1329.134s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much, and Mr. so thank you for a presentation once again this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1334.479s">So</a>  you talked about some of the surrounding towns and I just want to get a good visual Can you explain, can you name some of the surrounding towns like Everett Malden.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1347.59s">Councilor</a>  Knight I'm glad that you asked because I actually came prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1354.222s">what</a>  an administrative administration official said last week we are prepared and I have some facts for you in the city of Everett, little over a year ago we signed a four year deal 3% 3% 3% 3% and many other improvements no concessions in the city of Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1371.835s">several</a>  months ago, I believe it was November, we signed a three-year contract, 3%, 3%, 3%, as well as market rate adjustments, meaning additional raises to bring them up to other communities surrounding, as well as many other improvements, no concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1389.763s">That's</a>  Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1390.503s">City</a>  of Chelsea, three-year deal, 4%, 3.5%, 3.5%, as well as market rate adjustment raises, other improvements, no concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1401.228s">City</a>  of Newton four year deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1403.029s">This</a>  was last year, 3% 3% 3% 3% as well as market rate adjustment raises many other improvements no concessions in the city of Waltham this was I believe, December, January, couple months ago, three year deal 3.25 3.25 3.25, as well as market rate adjustment raises many other improvements no concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1428.836s">Town</a>  of North Reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1430.93s">This</a>  was about three months ago, three-year deal, 3%, 3%, 3%, many other improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1436.553s">And</a>  another smaller community, but the town of Stowe, this was about six months ago, did a three-year deal, 15 to 21% over the three years, depending on what classification, many other improvements, no concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1452.482s">So</a>  there's seven communities we've done in the last year or so right here, besides Stowe, all the other ones border.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1459.506s">Medford.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1459.966s">And</a>  I think Mr. Salt is important to point out the demographic differences of all these communities, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1464.727s">So</a>  we have, we have more than ever, Chelsea, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1466.948s">Then</a>  we have Newton, we have North Reading, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1468.868s">Then</a>  we have Waltham, which is one of our number one comps. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1471.408s">When</a>  we talk about what my community is doing, Waltham and Braintree are two that we always talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1476.309s">Waltham</a>  and Braintree do we always compare ourselves to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1478.77s">So</a>  when we look at what's going on, we're seeing that every other community can do it no matter what their demographic, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1483.291s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1483.731s">No</a>  matter what their makeup or where failing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1485.771s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1486.271s">Can</a>  you tell me what the cost of a mediation would be?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1489.876s">Um,</a>  I think for both sides, the cost is the legal fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1495.059s">Um,</a>  and clearly the city of Medford is no stranger to legal fees because you don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1501.442s">You</a>  don't have an assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1503.903s">The</a>  cost is astronomical. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1505.444s">I</a>  mean, uh, KP law is negotiating all, um, all five of the city side agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1511.447s">And</a>  then there's, uh, attorney Greenspan is on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1514.769s">That's</a>  separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1515.429s">But,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1517.488s">KP</a>  Law is doing all the labor charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1519.469s">We</a>  have about 50 open labor charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1522.011s">KP</a>  Law is handling our six wage and hour lawsuits that we have against the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1527.554s">Actually</a>  five, one's settled, one's about to settle. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1531.577s">KP</a>  Law is handling the complaints we have at the Secretary of State's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1535.639s">It's</a>  hilarious. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1537.44s">KP</a>  law is handling the complaint at the Secretary Secretary of State's office and the complaint is the city's refusing to provide local 25 with the legal bills for KP law and KP law is defending it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1548.565s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1549.045s">But</a>  the irony there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1550.986s">But</a>  yes, the legal fees are astronomical.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1554.147s">So</a>  we have five agreements in the city that are going to be going to mediation legal fees that are going to be paid privately because we don't have a city solicitor 50 labor charges five wage lawsuits and then</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1564.398s">Complaints</a>  to the Secretary of State's office as well.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1567.199s">And</a>  then a number of freedom of information requests that have gone unanswered. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1570.14s">So</a>  we're at the Secretary of State's fighting for that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1571.901s">Well,</a>  we have labor charges on those as well.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1574.182s">And</a>  a lot of the stuff that you request, I believe is necessary for you to have the proper information and tools to represent your membership effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1581.284s">So</a>  the way I'm looking at this, Madam President, what I'm seeing here is that this has become a situation where it's a refusal to provide information because they don't want you to be a strong advocate for your membership.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1592.382s">Right,</a>  well not just that I believe that the city may have things to hide they don't want us to see the KP law legal bills for reasons that I won't get into here but I think that there's this, it's problematic for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1605.869s">If</a>  we do get those unredacted, they did provide me with the legal bills they were 100% redacted.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1616.193s">say</a>  redacted, could you explain what it looked like?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1618.734s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1619.034s">You</a>  ever hear of Area 51? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1620.894s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1622.054s">So</a>  if you request any info on Area 51, the government will give it to you, but everything's blacked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1628.336s">Well,</a>  it must be very secretive, like the military base in Nevada here in Medford, because they gave me the documents, but everything's 100% blacked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1637.877s">There's</a>  aliens in the vault. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1639.038s">There</a>  might be aliens.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1642.16s">really</a>  in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1643.723s">Well,</a>  Madam President, I thank Mr. South once again for coming up here and the advocacy that he's doing for his membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1650.414s">It's</a>  not often, you know, I've been on the council for a number of years now, and it's not often to see this many people in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1656.659s">week</a>  in and week out, week in and week out, right, the issue needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1662.044s">I</a>  as one Councilor proposed it in the past and I still believe that this council should not approve any new positions in any reclassifications of existing positions until such time as the existing employees that we have in City Hall taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1674.608s">That</a>  means that these contracts should be settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1676.049s">We</a>  shouldn't be given any new, creating new positions or reclassifying existing positions until these people right here are taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1683.896s">The</a>  five groups that are going to be going to mediation reach some sort of satisfactory conclusion that we can all live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1689.981s">Because</a>  ultimately it's bringing the morale down in the city to the point where I wonder how these people get up every day and go to work because they're not feeling respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1696.466s">They're</a>  not feeling valued. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1698.428s">And</a>  that's not the values that we share. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1701.685s">So</a>  I agree with the speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1703.986s">I</a>  mean, if it weren't for him coming up here every week and keeping the full court press on, I think this would be an easy walk for the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1710.49s">Steve's</a>  doing his job and he's really making us aware of a lot of things that are going on behind closed doors, things that we don't get to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1717.454s">I</a>  know that this is the transparency administration, but it's not very transparent sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1722.457s">And</a>  I thank him for taking the time, energy and effort to come up here week in and week out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1726.64s">I</a>  mean, the gentleman represents many, many, many, many units, not just Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1730.518s">But</a>  every time there's a meeting, he's here, he gives this time to come here and do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1735.183s">And</a>  he's not wrong on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1737.606s">He's</a>  not wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1738.947s">So</a>  again, you know, I'm of the firm belief that no new positions, no reclassifications until these contracts get taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1745.594s">We</a>  need to take care of our existing employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1747.096s">We</a>  need to show them that they're valued and respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1748.918s">If</a>  the administration isn't going to do it, then we need to do it.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1753.36s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1754.08s">I'm</a>  in prison. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1754.861s">Did</a>  we not get an email last week, saying that our legal fees last year were $450,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1759.602s">We</a>  did.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1760.582s">Yes,</a>  we got that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1762.083s">So</a>  the gentleman's talking about exorbitant legal fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1765.924s">How</a>  are all these, how was the city providing, KP Laws providing legal for the whole city of Medford in fighting these lawsuits all for $450,000?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1778.138s">I</a>  think the administration and KP law have been very clear that they don't represent the whole entire city they represent the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1783.96s">Well</a>  they seem to be working for every department but they're only representing the mayor's, the mayor's interests, because they're the mayor's private lawyer, that's who their client is what so no one's representing the taxpayer.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1794.762s">Every,</a>  every department in the city is using KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1799.055s">And</a>  they're also fighting all these lawsuits. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1800.836s">So</a>  I don't understand how all these are getting done, how everyone's using them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1805.518s">We're</a>  fighting lawsuits for 450,000 and we only agreed to $6,000 a month on our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1814.723s">So</a>  when you say exorbitant law, what would you be saying for exorbitant law? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1822.487s">Well,</a>  to fight all these cases that we're fighting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1825.112s">I</a>  don't think I have the, the municipal experience that all of you do behind the rail but I can tell you that out of all the communities that I just named, including dozens of other ones that local 25 represents bargaining units and <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1840.198s">The</a>  city of Medford is the only community that does not have a city solicitor and assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1847.181s">And</a>  the reason being, and as a taxpayer it's, it's worrisome for me is, you know, you can pay a city solicitor 130 150,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1858.466s">And</a>  that's a finite cost, but the legal bills for a law firm like KP Law, the possibilities are endless. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1867.576s">So</a>  in Everett and Malden and Chelsea and Newton and Waltham, they have city solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1873.863s">Some</a>  of these communities have three, four, five, six solicitors, but no one has zero, nobody. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1881.117s">only</a>  Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1881.798s">And</a>  I believe if I remember correctly, you know better than me, but I believe we haven't had a city solicitor or assistant solicitor, I think, since October of 2022, if I remember correctly.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1893.82s">I'm</a>  an assistant since January 2020 I mean one or one of the end I know but nobody. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1898.722s">Yeah,</a>  it's bad.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1899.982s">So</a>  now instead of paying 130, whatever you were paying the previous 130 a year or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1906.805s">Now</a>  you know it's whatever hundreds of dollars per hour instead of a finite salary.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1913.147s">On</a>  that point though Madam President, the council passed an ordinance, probably 60 years ago, and the ordinance says there shall be a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1922.221s">And</a>  the legislative intent is that for my research, behind that ordinance was to control legal costs so that we don't end up in a situation like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1929.883s">So</a>  ultimately we have an administration that's working outside the scope of the existing ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1934.564s">And</a>  she did take an oath to say that she would, to the best of her ability, uphold the ordinances of this community when she got elected to office.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1942.325s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1942.706s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1943.946s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1944.886s">And</a>  to that point, I have a resolution that will be up later that <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1950.112s">that</a>  will speak specifically to that and I'll make some recommendations with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1953.239s">But</a>  what I wanted to do is really just thank you, Mr. South. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1956.988s">I</a>  know that... <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1959.542s">The</a>  common cry from this council is a lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1962.844s">And</a>  last week was a great example. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1965.166s">When</a>  we're sitting here and we're asked to provide votes for raises for non union employees and then when Councilor Knight asked, but it's funny because it's not the name it's not the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1977.313s">It's</a>  the calf so what Council night recommended or asked, could you please give us the name of the position for those caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1983.657s">And</a>  what the chief of staff did say first was the mayor and the city council to us as a you know forget about the mayor that's whatever decision but it's a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1994.246s">We</a>  were never even talked about because we would have not even entertained just even bring that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1999.991s">So,</a>  you know, I find it hard to believe that, again, is there a representative from the city.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2006.737s">Tonight,</a>  there is not the administration told me they would not be sending him on tonight.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2010.586s">Okay,</a>  so that just tells you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2012.228s">So</a>  last week, I believe it was comments were made that, you know, the facts sometimes that you are presenting aren't true, but for one person, I appreciate the facts you are sharing, and it's easy to find out if your facts are true or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2028.784s">with</a>  one phone call or one Google of what you're saying and they come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2034.289s">So</a>  not like I had to, but I wanted to make sure because it's easy to come to that podium as administration and defend themselves because it's all they seem to be doing and look at this council and call us bullies because we're asking questions that pertain to serious matters of all of our constituents, all of our city members. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2054.545s">And</a>  we're in a spot right now that <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2059.82s">What</a>  you're hearing with our union situation, I think, is just a smaller piece of where we are in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2070.758s">We're</a>  in a sinking ship. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2073.988s">We're</a>  in a tailspin. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2075.67s">And</a>  as a resident and a homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2079.375s">I'm</a>  petrified, but I do want to thank you and your members again, I, I have not will not vote for money paper until I've been very clear, I will not vote for any money paper until <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2091.828s">We</a>  see financial paperwork that's showing us our direction, and that our union members are taking care of, because this has gone long enough four and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2103.962s">That's</a>  a disgrace.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2105.363s">It</a>  is.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2105.604s">So</a>  we talked about cost of living just last year went up seven and a half percent.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2109.902s">and</a>  their healthcare goes up every year.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2111.603s">And</a>  we're getting another, we're getting another kick now with healthcare, with the elimination of Tufts, I believe, GAC now is now moving to Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2120.751s">So</a>  we're going to see a bigger kick now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2122.713s">So</a>  again, thank you, Madam President, allow me to speak, but thank you, Mr. South for sharing that information.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2129.678s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2132.441s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2133.241s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. South for your presentation and for the information that you're giving us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2140.253s">You</a>  know, much respect to everyone who's here tonight but this clerical thing I mean I had people calling me or messaging me communicating with me last week and it's, you know, four and a half years a lot four and a half years for some of the lowest paid workers in the city is a lot more. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2158.062s">And,</a>  you know, it's just, it's just, it's a shame we can use all the words that we want to use but you know, everyone deserves better than what they're getting in these long delays. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2169.872s">put</a>  it in my calendar for the 13th and I'm gonna be there and I'm gonna appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2174.942s">the</a>  notice on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2176.704s">The</a>  other pieces I wanna say is, and I respect my colleagues, their approach, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2180.467s">We</a>  may not always agree on exactly the approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2182.248s">Quite</a>  frankly, I don't think this administration cares what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2185.631s">I</a>  wish they cared more. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2186.791s">I</a>  hear you on using our power in the best ways that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2189.894s">We've</a>  tried to use our power a lot and it doesn't seem to be making a lot of difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2192.956s">I'm</a>  sure actually, probably you and your members sometimes feel a similar way that you've said your piece many, many, many times and it doesn't seem to be getting through their head, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2201.783s">And,</a>  and so, you know, the piece of this discussion for me and I think the piece that all seven of us and you and I hope everyone in this room do do agree on is. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2211.673s">know,</a>  this question around the finances, you know, if every other community can provide this, why can't we? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2216.877s">And</a>  we're not getting a straight answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2218.998s">And</a>  my response is, once we get a straight answer on that, if their answer, if we get a straight answer, we see the numbers, the math laid out before us, and the answer is no, then we have to say, okay, then how do we get the money to give a fair contract, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2229.465s">And</a>  until we have that information, we can't even engage in that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2233.413s">And</a>  that's the place that we want to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2235.414s">I</a>  think all seven of us behind this council is to say, what is it going to take for us to be able to give a fair contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=2242.917s">And</a>  that's the answer we're not getting at all on any front and I'm sure you're not getting it and you're getting stonewalled as well.</p>
