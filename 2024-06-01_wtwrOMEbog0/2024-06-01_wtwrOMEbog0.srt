[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council at 6 p.m.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,792
[SPEAKER_08]: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, MA, and via Zoom.

00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:35,312
[SPEAKER_08]: To submit written comments, please email ahertabese at medford-ma.gov.

13
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:45,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Action and discussion items 24-045, offered by President Bears's resolution regarding annual budget process for fiscal year 2025.

14
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:52,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Council President request City Councilors submit individual budget recommendations to the City Clerk,

15
00:00:53,137 --> 00:01:06,888
[SPEAKER_08]: by Friday, March 1st 2024 for consideration and committee of the whole being further resolved that based on the schedule included in the soon to be finalized budget ordinance, the city council and city administration will follow the following budget schedule for the fiscal 25 city budget.

16
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:10,591
[SPEAKER_08]: By March 1st, city councilors submit individual budget recommendations.

17
00:01:11,212 --> 00:01:15,175
[SPEAKER_08]: By Friday, March 22nd, city council submits collective budget recommendation to the mayor.

18
00:01:15,835 --> 00:01:20,159
[SPEAKER_08]: From April 15th to May 15th, city council holds preliminary budget meetings with department heads.

19
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:25,012
[SPEAKER_08]: and by Friday, May 31st, the mayor will submit a comprehensive budget proposal to the city council.

20
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:49,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of the budget ordinance, just to further elucidate the process that we're going through here, this new budget process, once we have submitted those recommendations to the mayor, we will get a response in writing prior to the presentation of the comprehensive budget proposal.

21
00:01:50,020 --> 00:02:05,344
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition, when we hold the preliminary budget meetings, we will have the annual operating budget for the previous year, the department head's budget request for the upcoming fiscal year, and requested new staff and programs or services for the upcoming year.

22
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:14,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also should be getting the budget to actual paperwork that we have been talking about wanting for a while.

23
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:18,867
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will have all of that in advance of our preliminary budget meetings.

24
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:26,520
[SPEAKER_08]: which will start in April, and I'm working with the administration to lock down some days for those meetings.

25
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,942
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some April dates, and then we'll have some May dates.

26
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:32,604
[SPEAKER_08]: They will be mostly Wednesdays at 6 p.m.

27
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:33,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Committee of the Wholes.

28
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:41,469
[SPEAKER_08]: So we may avoid a Saturday meeting this year on the budget.

29
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:42,949
[SPEAKER_08]: We may not.

30
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:43,770
[SPEAKER_08]: No promises.

31
00:02:46,260 --> 00:03:05,408
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that we talked about at our Committee of the Whole on March 6th was submitting, we talked about the recommendations that we had submitted, which should have gone back out to the Council and is available on our meeting portal, is all of those recommendations kind of grouped by category.

32
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:08,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I put them into four categories.

33
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,230
[SPEAKER_08]: One was preventing budget cuts,

34
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:16,677
[SPEAKER_08]: The second category was increases in staffing and personnel expenses.

35
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:21,239
[SPEAKER_08]: The third was increases in non-staffing and ordinary expenses.

36
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:25,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fourth was one-time expenses and items for further study.

37
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,662
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also included was just all of our recommendations in one document.

38
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure mostly unedited.

39
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:40,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I may have made some edits to Councilor Tseng's because his came in memo form and I made some bullet points.

40
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they satisfy what your intent was.

41
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:45,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

42
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:59,345
[SPEAKER_08]: At this point, I think the goal of tonight's meeting is to report something out of committee to the mayor around collective recommendations of the City Council.

43
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:05,747
[SPEAKER_08]: We will also attach this document, which has everyone's individual recommendations.

44
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:10,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor is saying, if you want me to attach your memorandum, I'm happy to attach that as well.

45
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:14,752
[SPEAKER_08]: But you put a lot of work into it.

46
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:18,094
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like an ink signature on it.

47
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:19,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Thesis.

48
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:19,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Thesis.

49
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:21,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Thesis.

50
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:22,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Application.

51
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Amendment.

52
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Constitutional amendment.

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,942
[SPEAKER_08]: So at this point, this is the first time.

54
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:41,046
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the first time we've done this at all, but it's the first time we've done this under these kind of timelines.

55
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:56,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe last year we sent a set of five recommendations to the mayor for inclusion in the budget, and that seemed to be a reasonable number of kind of what we all collectively determined to be our top priorities.

56
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:11,015
[SPEAKER_08]: We could do something similar or different this year, but I do think there's a lot of value to kind of honing down this couple, two, three page list into something that is very clear about

57
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:14,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Council's wishes for this budget.

58
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:16,662
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll leave it at that.

59
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:21,067
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll open it up to members of the Council to guide our path forward.

60
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:22,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng.

61
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

62
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:29,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to thank you for putting in all the effort of collecting and

63
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:33,604
[SPEAKER_03]: and rearranging our individual recommendations.

64
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:34,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we had a lot.

65
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:38,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really helpful to see it all in one place.

66
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:43,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I think looking at it, one of my general thoughts is that there

67
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:55,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the things I'm asking for, like the community liaisons program, some of the things that other councils are asking for all fall under the purview of the health department.

68
00:05:55,497 --> 00:06:11,131
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think maybe we could further kind of collapse that into that one big category and say, prevent cuts to this department and then note, like in a parentheses, those positions that we're referring to.

69
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:18,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor say a health department or general recommendation around the Health Department Board of Health.

70
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:22,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins.

71
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:25,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

72
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:30,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to my colleagues again for everyone's recommendations.

73
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:35,099
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to kick off this discussion at our first committee of the whole on topic.

74
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:39,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking over the compiled recommendations from us all, I think that

75
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:48,028
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some, I think, clear avenues for consolidating this, even just looking at category one of preventing budget cuts.

76
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:56,235
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other way that I would characterize this grouping of suggestions is around maintaining level service.

77
00:06:57,176 --> 00:07:04,239
[SPEAKER_00]: within the Schools Department, within the Board of Health, which Councilor Tseng just noted, within the Library Department.

78
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:20,227
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think that this also characterizes kind of this shared priority of preventing the loss of positions that are currently grant funded within the Board of Health, within the Office of Outreach Prevention, and within the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Department.

79
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,748
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that across all of our

80
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:48,543
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions, most of us in some way phrased that same recommendation around meet the school's budget request, meet the library budget request, don't cut any positions within Board of Health, Office of Prevention and Outreach, Planning Department, even if it means, and perhaps especially if it means finding a way to fit those positions into the operating budget or shift them over to other sources of grant funding.

81
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:52,485
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would put forward that I do believe there is consensus

82
00:07:53,065 --> 00:08:05,230
[SPEAKER_00]: around all of the numbered points under category one, and I think that those can be consolidated into a maintaining level service for schools, libraries, Board of Health, and planning departments.

83
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:10,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

84
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, is that a motion, Councilor Collins?

85
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:18,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

86
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,490
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, do you need to repeat it yet?

87
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:25,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you repeat that for the clerk, please?

88
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:29,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I'll improv it.

89
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:47,700
[SPEAKER_00]: The motion would be to consolidate all of the bullet points under category one into the recommendation to maintain level service for the schools

90
00:08:49,389 --> 00:09:02,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Libraries, Board of Health, Prevention and Outreach, PDS Department, including maintaining all currently grant-funded positions.

91
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:03,745
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Clerk, I can email that to you.

92
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:29,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins moves to consolidate all of the bullet points under category one into the recommendation to maintain level service for the schools, library, the Board of Health, Prevention and Outreach, and PBS department, including all currently grant-funded positions.

93
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:32,113
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can, Mr. President.

94
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, we have a motion by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, discussion Councilor Scarpelli.

95
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:53,787
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is the way we're going, I think that in all reality, to put a paper out like this, I don't want it to be presented as the other departments in the community like DPW, fire, police are being left off that.

96
00:09:53,847 --> 00:10:01,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would motion that either we add those city departments to that list,

97
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,452
[SPEAKER_01]: if that's how we're going to break it down.

98
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:27,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, the optics of something that reads as Vice President Collins wants to move forward, which I don't disagree, but we're going to be getting to some nitty gritty budget issues when it comes time.

99
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:43,549
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want the perception to go out to say, well, we want to maintain these budgets, but it's okay for cuts that the city council wouldn't support the cuts of police or cuts the fire or cuts the DPW.

100
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:51,173
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in other city departments, whether it's a secretarial staff, whether it's the veteran services.

101
00:10:51,393 --> 00:11:01,837
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just think by wording it that way, it opens it up for a slippery slope for what the message should be.

102
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:07,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, we wanna be level funded with all city entities and school entities.

103
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:11,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

104
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:15,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins, is that a new hand or an old hand?

105
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:17,554
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new hand.

106
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:20,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins and Councilor Sands.

107
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:21,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

108
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:28,680
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to respond quickly to say I think Councilor Scarpelli's point is well taken and I think that it's, I think that we have

109
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:38,899
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as usual, somewhat of a challenging needle to thread here where, of course, I think it's absolutely not the message to send to say, we care about these cuts and not those cuts.

110
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Scarpelli is absolutely right.

111
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,802
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, you know, and I hope it would go without saying that's that's not the message that this council would want to be sending.

112
00:11:48,303 --> 00:11:51,484
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, you know, we're placed in this difficult position of

113
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:57,137
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that cuts are likely to be proposed somewhere.

114
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:11,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think maybe it would be better to articulate in some fashion, maybe elsewhere in the packet, that the council will ultimately vote dissent to the mayor, that certain departments or positions

115
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:16,109
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever this council decides that they will be, are highlighted.

116
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:28,361
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in this case, I think many of us mentioned the schools department and the library department, because often that is where cuts are proposed, and that is where level service is not funded.

117
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:32,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, just speaking only for myself, that's why I prioritize those in my memo.

118
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,146
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think

119
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:49,615
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a discussion point for this council is how to make sure that we target our recommendations towards those departments that we know are usually the most vulnerable, while saying, of course, we're gonna, at the same time, we're advocating for level service citywide.

120
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to offer that to say I agree with Councilor Scartelli.

121
00:12:55,077 --> 00:13:01,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there are, and I'll go to Councilor Callahan after Councilor Sagan to say, I think there's kind of three principles getting lumped in here.

122
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:03,522
[SPEAKER_08]: One is we're talking about

123
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:13,872
[SPEAKER_08]: recommendations from independent entities, independent governing bodies, so the school committee for the public schools, the library trustees for the library.

124
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:18,715
[SPEAKER_08]: They make recommendations as to their budget in a different way than happens for the city departments.

125
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:26,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're highlighting that there's a lot of ARPA grant-funded positions in health prevention and planning.

126
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the third piece, I think, is all grant-funded positions.

127
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,425
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there are grant-funded positions in police or fire or DPW,

128
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:41,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure, you know, there may be one in police, there might be one in DPW, I'm not sure of any in fire.

129
00:13:41,802 --> 00:14:01,786
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wonder if we could just adjust this wording to say, to more along those lines, to say, meet the recommendations of the school committee, budget request of the school committee for Medford Public Schools, the library trustees for the Medford Public Library, and

130
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:23,793
[SPEAKER_08]: do not cut any ARPA grant funded positions in any city department with particular focus on the, most of those positions are in health prevention and planning, development, sustainability, and then we have all city departments in there.

131
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:31,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And then through this process, we'll actually, I think for the first time in my time on the council, we'll actually be able to see what

132
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:42,626
[SPEAKER_08]: the chiefs requested, what the commissioner requested, so that'll be interesting, because usually we only get what the school committee and the library request, because they're independent.

133
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:46,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Callahan.

134
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you basically, what I was going to say parallels what you just said.

135
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:58,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I wanted to bring special attention to the last two years that we've done this.

136
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:09,274
[SPEAKER_03]: We have brought out the schools and library in particular, and I think it was clear that we weren't privileging any one department over the other or leaving anyone behind.

137
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:17,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think Councilor Collins, where she was coming from, was just following what we did in past practice.

138
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:20,843
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there's some nuance to it and how it breaks down.

139
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:23,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the proposed amendments make a lot of sense.

140
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:25,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Kelly.

141
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:31,764
[SPEAKER_09]: If that proposal goes through, then it probably makes my point sort of moot.

142
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:41,188
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was sort of looking as a relatively new Councilor to understand, obviously the Metro Public Schools is the largest department in terms of funding.

143
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:46,131
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's dozens of departments listed here on the website.

144
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:50,293
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm looking for a chart that shows me the size of the budget for each one.

145
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:54,655
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have an understanding of like, okay, are 20 of these so tiny that they're not, you know,

146
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,378
[SPEAKER_09]: worried, concerned about them, but I will do some research there.

147
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:12,595
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that rephrasing to make it any grant funded position is probably a good one.

148
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:13,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

149
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:14,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

150
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:29,508
[SPEAKER_01]: The court of public opinion would throw out and say, well, here we go again.

151
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:39,198
[SPEAKER_01]: The council doesn't want to do X, Y, and Z. So I think if it's phrased that way, I think that speaks volumes because we don't want to lose any of these positions.

152
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,569
[SPEAKER_01]: the fear of losing Penny's position.

153
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:55,084
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we lost Penny, but losing Penny's position, I think, would be a huge, huge loss to our community, especially in what she's done for drug prevention and awareness.

154
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,626
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you.

155
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:57,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Agreed.

156
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try to write down this change.

157
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:12,867
[SPEAKER_08]: If we want to move to another recommendation, if this will be our first recommendation, and then I'll read back what I have once I've written down what everybody said.

158
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:26,777
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can, Mr. President, I can see this, the hard work you've done, but are we meeting, are we still going to have the department meetings and are they going to be open and honest discussions, you think,

159
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:29,524
[SPEAKER_01]: with department heads?

160
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:32,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping more open and honest.

161
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:32,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.

162
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:37,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think we're starting before we get the final budget, which is good.

163
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,916
[SPEAKER_08]: And we put in the ordinance that we would get the requests of the departments.

164
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:46,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if the departments are tailoring their requests prior to writing them, we can't control for that.

165
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:47,963
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is my hope.

166
00:17:48,623 --> 00:18:07,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think having in the past, not the last few years, but going back four or five years, we would get an update from my finance director of the state of the state and see what kind of, what the climate looks like and what our funding would look like from the state.

167
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:11,573
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if the mayor has discussed anything with you about

168
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:16,119
[SPEAKER_01]: giving us some clarity as we get closer.

169
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like I said, all you hear is, you know, different communities.

170
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:29,188
[SPEAKER_01]: they've already been given some sort of understanding of what's happening in the state and what their community is going to be looking at for funding.

171
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't look too promising.

172
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:42,514
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder if we'll be getting some information that can help us prepare our constituents as we move forward.

173
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:51,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, before, I don't know entirely what level of detail some of that will be.

174
00:18:52,913 --> 00:19:00,816
[SPEAKER_08]: The cherry sheet did come out from the state administration and finance and it's basically a level fund cherry sheet.

175
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:10,942
[SPEAKER_08]: for state aid, but yes, we would get a revenue update as well as a budget to actual update before maybe as the part of that first meeting.

176
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:12,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, that is the intent.

177
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:13,763
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be helpful with everybody.

178
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:14,183
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

179
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:20,207
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm hoping we will get the documentation in advance of the meeting, maybe by a week or two, maybe more.

180
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

181
00:19:22,268 --> 00:19:31,373
[SPEAKER_08]: And Q3 ends on the 31st, so maybe we'll get something that's just quarter two and maybe we'll get quarter three for that meeting.

182
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:33,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

183
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,984
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be good.

184
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:35,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Agreed.

185
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:40,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have our first recommendation, which I'll read back in a minute.

186
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:46,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to get the wording right around a level service budget and meeting certain requests and preventing certain cuts.

187
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:49,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng raised the health department.

188
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:52,268
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some specific requests.

189
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone else?

190
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,089
[SPEAKER_08]: We could go up to five recommendations.

191
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:58,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, the first one is needy, and I think

192
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:08,940
[SPEAKER_08]: addresses directly the concerning narrative about cuts and not having a level service budget, but there was a lot of other good stuff in here, so we have some room.

193
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Councilor Collins, and then if anyone else wants to chime in, Councilor Collins.

194
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:17,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

195
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:20,411
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there is also substantial

196
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:42,963
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap, kind of a clustering for many of our contributions around the issue of budgeted amount for city solicitor and assistant city solicitor salaries, as well as funding for salaries within the elections department that's split I think between

197
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,185
[SPEAKER_00]: category two and category three in the memo that you provided.

198
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:55,769
[SPEAKER_00]: So just flagging that again as something that I think there is a ponderance of interest in from this council.

199
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:11,117
[SPEAKER_00]: That was you know of course I'm a little biased that was one of my individual recommendations was to raise the salary of the city solicitor and the assistant city solicitor salaries to be more competitive with our municipal neighbors and to raise the salary budgeted for an elections

200
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:17,682
[SPEAKER_00]: director to that of a director level position so as to attract more competitive candidates.

201
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:33,033
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, I think that there's pretty close to consensus from the individual recommendations that we received a couple weeks ago to put that forward as one or two of our additional recommendations.

202
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:42,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to hear from my fellow councillors if we would want to put legal salaries and elections director salaries forward as two more of our recommendations to the mayor.

203
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:47,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I would support that.

204
00:21:47,093 --> 00:21:48,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

205
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:49,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry about that.

206
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:51,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I would support that.

207
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:54,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's been our biggest cry for the last three years.

208
00:21:54,961 --> 00:22:01,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we've all been pushing together for that because that helps us do our jobs better.

209
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:07,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And having someone here, I think even somebody neutral

210
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:13,407
[SPEAKER_01]: with contentious issues in the city where it's not coming from the administration.

211
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:20,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it helps having a city solicitor come up and say, hey, this is what other communities have done for a transfer tax.

212
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:26,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the reason, legally, why X, Y, and Z. We don't have that.

213
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:29,816
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like we have a divide.

214
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:32,938
[SPEAKER_01]: KP Law has already mentioned that they don't work for this council.

215
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:40,925
[SPEAKER_01]: that brings up another contentious issue that everybody keeps harping on.

216
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:53,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether we are or whether we're not, we just don't know because we haven't seen the actuals that break down KP laws, what they've been paid the last few years.

217
00:22:54,377 --> 00:22:59,942
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that stuff would help with really helping us grow and get together.

218
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:01,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's important.

219
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:12,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we can too, Mr. President, if we can, number nine, for the DPW cement and hot top, I appreciate you putting that up there.

220
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,887
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, even if we can reach out in a form of a motion to ask the DPW director,

221
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:24,809
[SPEAKER_01]: just to do an analysis of what it would cost for a three team and equipment.

222
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:37,712
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that when I did it, it took me maybe three days with the director of DPW in Somerville and the director of DPW in Wakefield at the time that helped me get those numbers.

223
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:48,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just show us, give us an idea of what we spent in bonding and how it's these issues that

224
00:23:50,051 --> 00:24:03,214
[SPEAKER_01]: we've had the data and it's presented and they say, George, what we're spending for this staff plus the benefits in the equipment is definitely less more than what it would cost to bond the $2 million a year.

225
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:11,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an easy look at something to say, okay, that's just not efficient.

226
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:13,877
[SPEAKER_01]: But that can also come back the other way and say,

227
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:25,545
[SPEAKER_01]: while a crew of three can do X, Y, and Z, but I think it would help us moving forward to make some big decisions moving forward.

228
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:36,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it happening in this budget, from what I hear, where we're gonna be, but maybe down the line, we'll have things in place that would help us make better fiscal decisions.

229
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:38,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

230
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:41,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

231
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:54,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, I have that as requesting a cost analysis from the DPW commissioner for in-house cement and hot tub equipment and staffing compared to the annual cost of bonding for sidewalk and street repair.

232
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you, that's perfect.

233
00:24:57,218 --> 00:24:59,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng, or did I have Councilor Callahan first?

234
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, it was just a quick, did this not already go into committee as a request that we were making in the committee, in Public Works Committee?

235
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it maybe did.

236
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:12,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanna make sure we're not doubling up two motions for the same.

237
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:21,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm totally in favor, and also the five-year plan for the roads, I think, is going to go through that committee as well, rather than be a budget request.

238
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:27,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clark, do you happen to remember if a motion went through the committee, the Public Works Committee?

239
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:28,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking it up.

240
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:37,909
[SPEAKER_09]: either way we should have to look.

241
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Either out of here or out of there.

242
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:44,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to get it before the budget season, I think that just an understanding so we know.

243
00:25:44,153 --> 00:25:48,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we discussed it.

244
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:51,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember if a motion was referred out to the administration.

245
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,163
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can just put this as a motion coming out of here.

246
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:58,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

247
00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:00,806
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe we can give it a paper number, Mr. Clerk.

248
00:26:03,868 --> 00:26:05,870
[SPEAKER_07]: This committee report has a paper number.

249
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:09,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, can we separate this out as a separate, like a B paper?

250
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:11,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

251
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:17,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can refer the response to Public Works.

252
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:20,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

253
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tsengng.

254
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if Scorpio council's car probably would be amenable.

255
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:44,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the paper would be a good chance to ask dpw what they think inappropriate increase in the spending for road signage markets are, because I was talking with some of our department heads and they were saying,

256
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:59,068
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that they wanted to advocate for in this year's budget because it slows down road repavings a lot, but they didn't give me a solid figure for us to advocate for.

257
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:09,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, so would that be a requested amendment to the B paper that they also include a proposed

258
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:23,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I can't type that fast.

259
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:31,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Requesting a proposed number for increased spending in road signage, markings, and striping.

260
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:43,039
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's to ensure no delays in road repair?

261
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:11,824
[SPEAKER_04]: do it without that appropriation for the department.

262
00:28:12,746 --> 00:28:13,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

263
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Chancellor Leibnig.

264
00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:20,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

265
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:24,398
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just just asking if anybody knows this information.

266
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:37,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So I remember when I was asking about a couple of these positions a few months ago, specifically the salary increases response that I got was that they need to do a study to figure out what the salary increases ought to be.

267
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:39,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that.

268
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:45,198
[SPEAKER_06]: that was being brought up for the economic development director specifically, but that position did end up being hired.

269
00:28:45,238 --> 00:29:03,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just curious, is there any of these positions still under any study to figure out what exactly the salary increase should be, like the city solicitor in particular, or is that floating around at the staff level at this point?

270
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:07,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe they are also under study, and I do not know the timeline when we will receive that study.

271
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:11,916
[SPEAKER_08]: so they're all, the city solicitor, everything is still under study.

272
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:27,446
[SPEAKER_08]: My understanding is that everything, every position on the city side is undergoing a classification and compensation study by the call-in center, and we have not received a timeline when that will be submitted for updating the CAF ordinance, right?

273
00:29:28,347 --> 00:29:28,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

274
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:33,070
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and that's been going on a while now.

275
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that staff had a,

276
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,944
[SPEAKER_08]: City side staff had interviews with town center representatives last fall.

277
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:41,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that sound right to you?

278
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:42,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

279
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:48,570
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's been a pretty long process, and we haven't been given a clear timeline.

280
00:29:50,812 --> 00:29:55,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has been used to justify not moving on certain things.

281
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So just so I have it correct right now, we have the B paper regarding some DPW costs.

282
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:09,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we have the recommendation for level service budget.

283
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:14,442
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a recommendation to increase the budgeted amount for city solicitor and assistant city solicitor.

284
00:30:17,405 --> 00:30:18,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want to get more specific?

285
00:30:19,656 --> 00:30:21,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Councilor Tseng you had a health department item.

286
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:23,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to get more specific on that?

287
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:25,938
[SPEAKER_03]: We can list out the positions.

288
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:32,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what I was thinking was prevention and outreach positions and the community liaisons.

289
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:36,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you think that that is captured by the preventing cuts to grant funded positions?

290
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:37,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

291
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:37,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

292
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

293
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:42,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've still got some room here.

294
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:46,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I would like to see something included around

295
00:30:49,753 --> 00:31:00,223
[SPEAKER_08]: seed money as part of the budget or from free cash to create a clear plan for updating city financial software and payroll systems.

296
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:01,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a huge problem.

297
00:31:02,184 --> 00:31:05,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy to move on it, especially since I also brought it up.

298
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:14,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we really need to be putting in the long-term steps for us to

299
00:31:15,393 --> 00:31:20,334
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, grow our finances and to be able to process our finances better.

300
00:31:20,354 --> 00:31:22,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I completely agree.

301
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:23,195
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a priority of ours.

302
00:31:24,255 --> 00:31:24,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

303
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:25,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Collins.

304
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:33,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Just adding my note of assent, I would also support putting that forward as a recommendation at this time.

305
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this Council has spoken before about

306
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:45,643
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how many other problems that touches and exacerbates city side in terms of staffing and departmental function?

307
00:31:45,763 --> 00:31:51,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, the time to start advocating for progress towards a solution is the sooner the better.

308
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:58,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it does seem to be the source of many of our other mistrusts and disagreements.

309
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, Mr. President.

310
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Scarpelli.

311
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:07,812
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I get a little confused because it's the functions

312
00:32:09,281 --> 00:32:17,105
[SPEAKER_01]: When you hear some of the issues with the finance department, the software, is it truly that?

313
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:19,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that truly hasn't been defined yet.

314
00:32:23,128 --> 00:32:30,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of the information we're getting from the previous finance director, the information was the same software that's being used.

315
00:32:32,873 --> 00:32:35,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend that maybe getting more staffing

316
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:57,773
[SPEAKER_01]: and moving that forward, because I'd like to see a cost analysis to that to see what it would take if it's a $80,000 software system that we have to pay year after year, purchase once and then pay year after year, in comparison to hiring an assistant in the finance department.

317
00:32:58,653 --> 00:33:00,614
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be interesting to see what that would look like.

318
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:12,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, a lot of it, a lot of the financial questions we have, I think revert back to not being communicated, not being transparent.

319
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:30,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't, I don't really trust the administration when they say it's the software system that's antiquated because the finance department that worked at the beginning of your tenure, Mr. Mr. President,

320
00:33:31,624 --> 00:33:37,906
[SPEAKER_01]: At the beginning of my time at the council, we were updated and we were informed.

321
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:45,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And those pieces were in place to make sure that, for instance, the retro pay.

322
00:33:48,329 --> 00:34:00,212
[SPEAKER_01]: That system was in place when contracts were ratified years ago that did the work to make sure that our employees were given their

323
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:04,015
[SPEAKER_01]: retro pay and reasonable time.

324
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:09,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, again, I just, I, I don't want to be the pessimist.

325
00:34:09,098 --> 00:34:23,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be the, the, the, this, the, you know, the, the, the siren every time, but I, I don't want us to throw good money after bad when it could be something that it's just management, not system.

326
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:27,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

327
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:28,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

328
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:30,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Hsuang.

329
00:34:31,288 --> 00:34:38,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that the last committee of the whole, you had a really good explanation for what exactly we're looking for in terms of financial software.

330
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:46,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what Councilor Scarpelli is maybe referring to is a little different to what we were referring to.

331
00:34:46,513 --> 00:34:49,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wondering if, I mean, you explained it best.

332
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:52,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you could explain it again for the council.

333
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:55,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

334
00:34:56,259 --> 00:35:02,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think there's a both and here, and I think it's fine to update this to be a both and kind of question.

335
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:17,974
[SPEAKER_08]: My understanding is that there are multiple systems that have difficulty talking to each other and require a lot of work to make sure there's not double counting and things of that nature.

336
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:20,135
[SPEAKER_08]: We've suffered through that with the fiscal 20

337
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:36,781
[SPEAKER_08]: pre-ARPA discussion, the schools just had another example of that where it was like, oh, we have a 2.5 million deficit, but then it's like, oh, when we go through, we look at double counting, we look at making sure everything's in the right account, it's not 2.5 million, it's 216,000, right?

338
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:48,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have these issues where maybe the expertise of prior staff or reasons that those weren't issues in the past, maybe they understood the software better,

339
00:35:49,685 --> 00:35:53,729
[SPEAKER_08]: and maybe had been here when they established the, put that software into place.

340
00:35:55,591 --> 00:36:01,257
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it could be both, and I'm happy to, personally, I'd be more than happy, I think I had it in here.

341
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:12,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Study or consult and review of finance department, software upgrade, or this is Councilor Collins, software upgrade options and development implementation scenarios.

342
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:20,535
[SPEAKER_08]: which also talked about expanding the personnel budget, because maybe it is there's a bottleneck on the personnel side of just reviewing reports in a timely manner.

343
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:21,515
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

344
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:23,556
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we could throw that in as well.

345
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:23,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate that.

346
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:24,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

347
00:36:24,577 --> 00:36:28,438
[SPEAKER_08]: The communication issues are twofold.

348
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:35,041
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the communication issues between people, and it seems to be also communication issues between systems.

349
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:38,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd appreciate that, thank you.

350
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think since I had to make the motion, I'd be happy to amend it as well.

351
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:45,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

352
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:48,824
[SPEAKER_05]: To include staffing.

353
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:49,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

354
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:01,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm writing them down and I'll send them to you.

355
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:05,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have three things.

356
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:08,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins.

357
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:10,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

358
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:13,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate this exchange around the Finance Department.

359
00:37:14,347 --> 00:37:16,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil Yu, I'll second the motion.

360
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:18,889
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with all that's been stated.

361
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:22,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, obviously it is not one or the other.

362
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:28,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I think being a member of the Administration and Finance Committee this term and also in the past one, we've had many, I think,

363
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:36,710
[SPEAKER_00]: very revealing conversations with the current finance director about the ways in which the software really is a problem right now.

364
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:44,335
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I think it is very obvious that staffing is also an issue and that the two exacerbate the other.

365
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:50,018
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the phrasing we've worked towards strikes the right balance of acknowledging both.

366
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:51,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

367
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:53,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

368
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:11,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have three that I can read back now.

369
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we have to go beyond three.

370
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:18,516
[SPEAKER_08]: These are pretty major issues around the budget.

371
00:38:18,556 --> 00:38:21,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they do hit what a lot of us are concerned about.

372
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to quickly look through what else we have here.

373
00:38:39,953 --> 00:38:42,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of these have value, and again, all of them will go up.

374
00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:49,044
[SPEAKER_08]: But is there anything else that anyone else wants to include beyond the three main recommendations that we have before I read them back?

375
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:56,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

376
00:38:58,697 --> 00:38:59,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

377
00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:11,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you read them back, I just want to kind of note my support for keeping our list of recommendations short and sweet this year.

378
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,743
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of going against my own instinct.

379
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:27,688
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my first year on the council, the wish list that I submitted for our first committee of the whole on this topic was amounted to the hundreds of millions of dollars and ideas for how to make our

380
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:35,869
[SPEAKER_00]: city more functional and shore up all of our critical departments.

381
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:47,737
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm extremely compelled by and sympathetic to all of the other recommendations that I also submitted two weeks ago and agree with everything that's been submitted by my fellow councillors.

382
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:55,885
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I think that we're going into this knowing that this is going to be a difficult budget season after a couple of difficult budget seasons.

383
00:39:56,926 --> 00:40:07,496
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there is a power that comes from having a very succinct list and saying, you know, we've done the hard work and we've really considered

384
00:40:09,278 --> 00:40:17,004
[SPEAKER_00]: what needs to be in that short list of things that we cannot go without in this budget cycle, even though we know it is going to be a hard one.

385
00:40:17,564 --> 00:40:27,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I appreciate about this group of three that we've put together is that to me it's about level service,

386
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:35,709
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think over the past couple of years, we've had many important public discussions about the difference between level service and level funding.

387
00:40:36,189 --> 00:40:39,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the residents and city staff deserve is level service, not level funding.

388
00:40:41,053 --> 00:40:42,994
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this list prioritizes that.

389
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:51,981
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it gets at the heart of the staffing and funding infusions that need to happen so that we can

390
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,946
[SPEAKER_00]: stop regressing in certain departments and start to move forward.

391
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:02,890
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think here on the city council we see that the most with the legal department, or lack thereof.

392
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:10,457
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that these few recommendations that we put together so far kind of strike at

393
00:41:11,258 --> 00:41:14,660
[SPEAKER_00]: what we really need to see in order to be functional as a body and functional as a city.

394
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:27,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if other councilors have recommendations of things that they need to be on the short list, I'm sure I'll find those ideas compelling, but I just wanted to note advocacy for a short, tight list this year.

395
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:28,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

396
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

397
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:35,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further discussion on this topic before I read back the motions?

398
00:41:38,419 --> 00:41:49,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, we have the main motion by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Collins, as amended by Councilors Scarpelli and Callahan for the fiscal year 25 council budget recommendations.

399
00:41:50,345 --> 00:42:05,472
[SPEAKER_08]: First recommendation for a level service budget for the city of Medford, including meeting the Medford Public Schools funding recommendation of the Medford School Committee, the Medford Public Library funding recommendation of the Library Trustees, and maintaining all grant-funded city positions in every department

400
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:15,376
[SPEAKER_08]: with the acknowledgement that most of those grant-funded positions currently exist in the Board of Health, Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, and Office of Planning and Outreach, or sorry, Office of Prevention and Outreach.

401
00:42:16,497 --> 00:42:25,840
