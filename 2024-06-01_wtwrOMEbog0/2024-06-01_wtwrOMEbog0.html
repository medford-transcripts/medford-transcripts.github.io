    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1.054s">Committee</a>  of the whole March 19 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=4.038s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the role.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=11.346s">President</a>  seven present none absent the meeting is called to order.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=22.91s">There</a>  will be a meeting of the Medford City Council at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=25.35s">in</a>  the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, MA, and via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=30.892s">To</a>  submit written comments, please email ahertabese at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=36.593s">Action</a>  and discussion items <a href="../resolutions/24-045.pdf"><font color="green">24-045</font></a>, offered by President Bears's resolution regarding annual budget process for fiscal year 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=46.675s">Be</a>  it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Council President request City Councilors submit individual budget recommendations to the City Clerk, <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=53.137s">by</a>  Friday, March 1st 2024 for consideration and committee of the whole being further resolved that based on the schedule included in the soon to be finalized budget ordinance, the city council and city administration will follow the following budget schedule for the fiscal 25 city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=67.329s">By</a>  March 1st, city councilors submit individual budget recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=71.212s">By</a>  Friday, March 22nd, city council submits collective budget recommendation to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=75.835s">From</a>  April 15th to May 15th, city council holds preliminary budget meetings with department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=80.731s">and</a>  by Friday, May 31st, the mayor will submit a comprehensive budget proposal to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=86.153s">Part</a>  of the budget ordinance, just to further elucidate the process that we're going through here, this new budget process, once we have submitted those recommendations to the mayor, we will get a response in writing prior to the presentation of the comprehensive budget proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=110.02s">In</a>  addition, when we hold the preliminary budget meetings, we will have the annual operating budget for the previous year, the department head's budget request for the upcoming fiscal year, and requested new staff and programs or services for the upcoming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=126.024s">And</a>  we also should be getting the budget to actual paperwork that we have been talking about wanting for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=135.626s">So</a>  we will have all of that in advance of our preliminary budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=140.137s">which</a>  will start in April, and I'm working with the administration to lock down some days for those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=147.061s">We</a>  have some April dates, and then we'll have some May dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=150.102s">They</a>  will be mostly Wednesdays at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=152.644s">Committee</a>  of the Wholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=154.965s">So</a>  we may avoid a Saturday meeting this year on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=162.469s">We</a>  may not. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=163.109s">No</a>  promises. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=166.26s">One</a>  of the things that we talked about at our Committee of the Whole on March 6th was submitting, we talked about the recommendations that we had submitted, which should have gone back out to the Council and is available on our meeting portal, is all of those recommendations kind of grouped by category. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=186.888s">I</a>  put them into four categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=189.129s">One</a>  was preventing budget cuts, <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=192.756s">The</a>  second category was increases in staffing and personnel expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=197.437s">The</a>  third was increases in non-staffing and ordinary expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=201.979s">And</a>  the fourth was one-time expenses and items for further study. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=205.16s">And</a>  then also included was just all of our recommendations in one document. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=212.442s">I'm</a>  pretty sure mostly unedited. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=214.923s">I</a>  may have made some edits to Councilor Tseng's because his came in memo form and I made some bullet points. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=222.04s">I</a>  hope they satisfy what your intent was. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=224.901s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=227.482s">At</a>  this point, I think the goal of tonight's meeting is to report something out of committee to the mayor around collective recommendations of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=241.266s">We</a>  will also attach this document, which has everyone's individual recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=246.548s">Councilor</a>  is saying, if you want me to attach your memorandum, I'm happy to attach that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=251.991s">But</a>  you put a lot of work into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=256.093s">There's</a>  like an ink signature on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=259.235s">Thesis.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=259.495s">Thesis.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=260.835s">Thesis.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=262.156s">Application.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=262.876s">Amendment.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=264.938s">Constitutional</a>  amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=269.84s">So</a>  at this point, this is the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=272.962s">It's</a>  not the first time we've done this at all, but it's the first time we've done this under these kind of timelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=282.441s">I</a>  believe last year we sent a set of five recommendations to the mayor for inclusion in the budget, and that seemed to be a reasonable number of kind of what we all collectively determined to be our top priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=298.629s">We</a>  could do something similar or different this year, but I do think there's a lot of value to kind of honing down this couple, two, three page list into something that is very clear about <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=311.656s">Council's</a>  wishes for this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=315.921s">And</a>  I'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=316.922s">I'll</a>  open it up to members of the Council to guide our path forward.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=322.249s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=323.19s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=323.79s">I</a>  wanted to thank you for putting in all the effort of collecting and <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=330.401s">and</a>  rearranging our individual recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=333.664s">I</a>  know we had a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=335.165s">And</a>  it's really helpful to see it all in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=339.067s">I</a>  think looking at it, one of my general thoughts is that there <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=346.949s">So</a>  some of the things I'm asking for, like the community liaisons program, some of the things that other councils are asking for all fall under the purview of the health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=355.497s">And</a>  so I think maybe we could further kind of collapse that into that one big category and say, prevent cuts to this department and then note, like in a parentheses, those positions that we're referring to.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=372.789s">Councilor</a>  say a health department or general recommendation around the Health Department Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=380.453s">Councilor</a>  Collins, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=384.374s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=385.495s">Thank</a>  you to my colleagues again for everyone's recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=390.977s">It</a>  was great to kick off this discussion at our first committee of the whole on topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=395.559s">Looking</a>  over the compiled recommendations from us all, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=401.662s">There</a>  are some, I think, clear avenues for consolidating this, even just looking at category one of preventing budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=408.148s">I</a>  think the other way that I would characterize this grouping of suggestions is around maintaining level service. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=417.176s">within</a>  the Schools Department, within the Board of Health, which Councilor Tseng just noted, within the Library Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=424.82s">And</a>  then I think that this also characterizes kind of this shared priority of preventing the loss of positions that are currently grant funded within the Board of Health, within the Office of Outreach Prevention, and within the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=440.367s">And</a>  I do believe that across all of our <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=444.149s">contributions,</a>  most of us in some way phrased that same recommendation around meet the school's budget request, meet the library budget request, don't cut any positions within Board of Health, Office of Prevention and Outreach, Planning Department, even if it means, and perhaps especially if it means finding a way to fit those positions into the operating budget or shift them over to other sources of grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=469.103s">So</a>  I would put forward that I do believe there is consensus <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=473.065s">around</a>  all of the numbered points under category one, and I think that those can be consolidated into a maintaining level service for schools, libraries, Board of Health, and planning departments.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=489.171s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=494.233s">Sure,</a>  is that a motion, Councilor Collins?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=498.295s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=499.969s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins, do you need to repeat it yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=504.011s">Could</a>  you repeat that for the clerk, please?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=508.712s">Sure,</a>  I'll improv it. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=511.594s">The</a>  motion would be to consolidate all of the bullet points under category one into the recommendation to maintain level service for the schools <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=529.389s">Libraries,</a>  Board of Health, Prevention and Outreach, PDS Department, including maintaining all currently grant-funded positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=542.283s">And</a>  Mr. Clerk, I can email that to you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=556.578s">Vice</a>  President Collins moves to consolidate all of the bullet points under category one into the recommendation to maintain level service for the schools, library, the Board of Health, Prevention and Outreach, and PBS department, including all currently grant-funded positions.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=571.232s">If</a>  I can, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=572.879s">Sure,</a>  we have a motion by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, discussion Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=578.301s">If</a>  this is the way we're going, I think that in all reality, to put a paper out like this, I don't want it to be presented as the other departments in the community like DPW, fire, police are being left off that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=593.847s">So</a>  I would motion that either we add those city departments to that list, <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=602.771s">if</a>  that's how we're going to break it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=605.992s">Because,</a>  you know, the optics of something that reads as Vice President Collins wants to move forward, which I don't disagree, but we're going to be getting to some nitty gritty budget issues when it comes time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=628.809s">I</a>  don't want the perception to go out to say, well, we want to maintain these budgets, but it's okay for cuts that the city council wouldn't support the cuts of police or cuts the fire or cuts the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=644.17s">So</a>  I think in other city departments, whether it's a secretarial staff, whether it's the veteran services. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=651.393s">So</a>  I just think by wording it that way, it opens it up for a slippery slope for what the message should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=661.957s">And</a>  that's, we wanna be level funded with all city entities and school entities.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=671.101s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=674.072s">Councilor</a>  Collins, is that a new hand or an old hand?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=676.954s">It's</a>  a new hand.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=678.635s">Councilor</a>  Collins and Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=680.656s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=681.096s">I</a>  just wanted to respond quickly to say I think Councilor Scarpelli's point is well taken and I think that it's, I think that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=689.676s">you</a>  know, as usual, somewhat of a challenging needle to thread here where, of course, I think it's absolutely not the message to send to say, we care about these cuts and not those cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=699.039s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=700.56s">That's,</a>  that's, you know, and I hope it would go without saying that's that's not the message that this council would want to be sending. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=708.303s">But</a>  unfortunately, you know, we're placed in this difficult position of <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=714.235s">knowing</a>  that cuts are likely to be proposed somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=717.797s">And</a>  I think maybe it would be better to articulate in some fashion, maybe elsewhere in the packet, that the council will ultimately vote dissent to the mayor, that certain departments or positions <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=732.906s">whatever</a>  this council decides that they will be, are highlighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=736.31s">You</a>  know, in this case, I think many of us mentioned the schools department and the library department, because often that is where cuts are proposed, and that is where level service is not funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=749.302s">I</a>  know, just speaking only for myself, that's why I prioritize those in my memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=753.686s">So</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=755.167s">you</a>  know, a discussion point for this council is how to make sure that we target our recommendations towards those departments that we know are usually the most vulnerable, while saying, of course, we're gonna, at the same time, we're advocating for level service citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=770.035s">So</a>  I just wanted to offer that to say I agree with Councilor Scartelli.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=775.077s">I</a>  think there are, and I'll go to Councilor Callahan after Councilor Sagan to say, I think there's kind of three principles getting lumped in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=781.621s">One</a>  is we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=784.386s">recommendations</a>  from independent entities, independent governing bodies, so the school committee for the public schools, the library trustees for the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=794.312s">They</a>  make recommendations as to their budget in a different way than happens for the city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=800.256s">And</a>  then we're highlighting that there's a lot of ARPA grant-funded positions in health prevention and planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=806.24s">And</a>  then the third piece, I think, is all grant-funded positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=809.942s">So</a>  if there are grant-funded positions in police or fire or DPW, <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=814.901s">I'm</a>  not sure, you know, there may be one in police, there might be one in DPW, I'm not sure of any in fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=821.802s">So</a>  I wonder if we could just adjust this wording to say, to more along those lines, to say, meet the recommendations of the school committee, budget request of the school committee for Medford Public Schools, the library trustees for the Medford Public Library, and <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=847.009s">do</a>  not cut any ARPA grant funded positions in any city department with particular focus on the, most of those positions are in health prevention and planning, development, sustainability, and then we have all city departments in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=867.414s">And</a>  then through this process, we'll actually, I think for the first time in my time on the council, we'll actually be able to see what <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=873.055s">the</a>  chiefs requested, what the commissioner requested, so that'll be interesting, because usually we only get what the school committee and the library request, because they're independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=883.608s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=887.56s">I</a>  think you basically, what I was going to say parallels what you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=894.104s">I</a>  think I wanted to bring special attention to the last two years that we've done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=898.707s">We</a>  have brought out the schools and library in particular, and I think it was clear that we weren't privileging any one department over the other or leaving anyone behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=910.155s">And</a>  so I think Councilor Collins, where she was coming from, was just following what we did in past practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=917.761s">But</a>  I think there's some nuance to it and how it breaks down. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=920.883s">And</a>  I think the proposed amendments make a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=925.266s">Councilor</a>  Kelly.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=927.982s">If</a>  that proposal goes through, then it probably makes my point sort of moot. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=932.324s">But</a>  I was sort of looking as a relatively new Councilor to understand, obviously the Metro Public Schools is the largest department in terms of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=942.509s">But</a>  there's dozens of departments listed here on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=946.231s">And</a>  I'm looking for a chart that shows me the size of the budget for each one. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=950.593s">So</a>  we have an understanding of like, okay, are 20 of these so tiny that they're not, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=956.414s">worried,</a>  concerned about them, but I will do some research there. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=960.039s">And</a>  I think that rephrasing to make it any grant funded position is probably a good one.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=972.675s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=974.037s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=985.124s">The</a>  court of public opinion would throw out and say, well, here we go again. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=989.528s">The</a>  council doesn't want to do X, Y, and Z. So I think if it's phrased that way, I think that speaks volumes because we don't want to lose any of these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1000.746s">the</a>  fear of losing Penny's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1002.589s">I</a>  know we lost Penny, but losing Penny's position, I think, would be a huge, huge loss to our community, especially in what she's done for drug prevention and awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1015.144s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1017.367s">Agreed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1019.417s">I'm</a>  going to try to write down this change. <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1021.138s">If</a>  we want to move to another recommendation, if this will be our first recommendation, and then I'll read back what I have once I've written down what everybody said.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1033.748s">So</a>  if I can, Mr. President, I can see this, the hard work you've done, but are we meeting, are we still going to have the department meetings and are they going to be open and honest discussions, you think, <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1048.243s">with</a>  department heads?</p>
