Welcome back to our second edition of Coffee Chats with the Kingsleys. I am joined with another new interviewer today. This is Annie, my middle child. Yeah. All right. Annie's going to help us talk through, uh, kind of some of my platform for why I'm running for school committee. Um, so, um, what was the first reason why you're running? Yeah. So I have a lot of reasons for running, right?

2
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:41,729
But one of the things that I see that Medford Public Schools that I want to kind of continue to push for is that I think we really need a clear vision of what we think good and effective instruction looks like.

3
00:00:41,932 --> 00:01:07,430
I think that every teacher in the district and every family in the district needs to know kind of what Medford's beliefs are about what good teaching and learning looks like. Because once you have that, you can decide how do you allocate resources, like how do you give away money on different things. You can choose curriculum. You can decide how to make staffing decisions. And Medford as a district doesn't have enough money.

4
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:27,258
Most school districts don't, but I think it's especially tricky here. And so, if you really have that vision, it helps you decide how to make decisions that best support that vision. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah. So, what happens if you can't do that vision?

5
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:48,487
If you can't do it? Well, so if you don't have a vision, right, then every time you need to make a new decision, you're kind of making it without any sort of like shared understanding of what's important. So you might think one thing is super important, I might think something else is super important, and then it's hard to determine what we're going to do.

6
00:01:48,487 --> 00:02:09,817
Right? But if you have a vision that you realize you can't do, you don't know how to, or you don't have the skills to, then you know how to help support different people in building skills. That make sense? Yeah. All right. Well, do you want to say goodbye? Goodbye. Thank you for joining us on this edition of Coffee Chat with the Kingsleys. Cheers.
