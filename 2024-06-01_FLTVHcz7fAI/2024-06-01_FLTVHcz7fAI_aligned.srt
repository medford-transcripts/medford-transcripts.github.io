This is a committee of the whole we held last week on school committee compensation.

18
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,106
There are items on the agenda tonight that were reported out of that meeting.

19

Resolution to discuss modernizing the City Council Communications and Outreach Strategy.

26
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:45,009
Be it resolved that the Committee on Resident Services and Public Engagement

27
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:54,337
me to discuss modernizing the council's communications and outreach strategy, including, but not limited to, developing guidelines and action plans for social media and press releases.

28
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:55,137
Councilor Sang.

29
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:56,819
Thank you, President Bares.

30
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:05,466
This is a resolution born out of our drive to modernize the work of our city council, which we spoke about at the last regular meeting.

31
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:10,671
I told folks that there's a lot to look forward to when it comes to making sure that we are up to date.

32
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:14,193
in our practices and in our communications.

33
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:20,855
And as a lot of residents have pointed out in the past, it can be a little bit hard to get information.

34
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:40,481
This is about really coordinating our strategy and making sure that there are one-stop shops for communications, while making sure that those strategies, social media, press releases, et cetera, truly do reach out to as wide an audience as possible, but also follow nonpartisan and neutral guidelines.

35
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:41,141
Thank you.

36
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,381
Thank you, Councillor Seng.

37
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,282
Any further discussion?

38
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:51,124
On the motion of Councillor Seng to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, seconded by Councillor Collins.

39
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:52,405
All those in favour?

40
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:53,065
Aye.

41
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:53,865
Opposed?

42
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:55,285
Motion passes.

43
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:58,827
2.4-016, offered by Councillor Seng.

44
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:05,149
Be it so resolved that the Committee on Resident Services and Public Engagement meet to discuss recommendations for updating the City website.

45
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:05,789
Councillor Seng.

46
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:06,469
Thank you.

47
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:11,312
The city website is a portal to city government for a lot of people.

48
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:22,499
Even though we've seen a lot of improvements on the city website, I don't think it would surprise anyone to say that we could use even more updates to the city website.

49
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:33,326
And so I want to call for a meeting of the Committee on Resident Services and Public Engagement with Communications Director Steve Smerdy.

50
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:37,370
to talk about recommendations for updating the city website.

51
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:43,397
I know folks have sent me a bunch of ideas, and in particular, to update the city council part of the website.

52
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,340
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,281
Any further discussion?

54
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:53,662
on the motion of Councillor saying to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, seconded by Councillor Zaro.

55
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:54,423
All those in favour?

56
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,043
Aye.

57
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:55,923
Opposed?

58
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:56,803
Motion passes.

59
00:03:56,823 --> 00:04:15,588
24-017 offered by Councillor Scarpelli, with the goal of keeping Medford residents informed on the process, be it resolved that the Medford City Council meet with the Medford Legislative Delegation, with General Keefe of the National Guard, and with representatives from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities to discuss a temporary shelter proposed within the City of Medford.

60
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:17,955
before I turn it over to Councillor Scarpelli.

61
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:23,599
There was an update today from the city online from Communications Director Smriti and the mayor.

62
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:32,245
The city has been informed by state officials that the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities will be opening its emergency overnight shelter in Medford in February.

63
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:44,334
The state is working on a contract with the provider to assist with services on site, and at the insistence of Mayor Lungo Kern has signed a memorandum of understanding with the city, agreeing to several specific terms identified by the mayor.

64
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:51,176
The first no more than 75 families, or roughly 250 people, will be housed at the site for short-term shelter only.

65
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:55,238
Two, the duration of the stay will likely not exceed five days.

66
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:58,919
Three, school-age children will not enroll in Medford public schools.

67
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,583
At the urging of Mayor Longo Kern, the state has agreed to hold a public information session prior to the opening of the shelter with the community to answer questions.

68
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,145
and to give an overview of how the facility will operate.

69
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:14,069
We put in a request for next week, but the state has not given us a date and time yet.

70
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:16,151
So that is the public meeting update.

71
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:17,712
I will go to Councillor Scarpelli.

72
00:05:19,244 --> 00:05:23,707
Thank you, Mr President, and I appreciate all the hard work.

73
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:34,315
I know that City Clerk has put into making sure that we have the proper people at the table to answer any questions that the community has reached out.

74
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,817
I first want to thank Representative DiNardo for being here tonight.

75
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:39,758
We realize that

76
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:46,382
He really doesn't have much information either, but he's here just to really listen to people.

77
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:49,345
And I really appreciate you doing that.

78
00:05:49,685 --> 00:06:01,215
And especially when you're talking about an issue that really concerns a lot of people and a lot of people looking for answers and really not getting many responses back from other parties.

79
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:05,618
So we appreciate you being here tonight, Representative Donato.

80
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:10,202
I know that both Representative Garbally and Representative Barber

81
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:23,789
We're invited, but they know that it's the same message that Representative Donato would share, and as their colleagues, I think that he's representing everyone, but this really falls into his district, which is key.

82
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:30,533
So I brought this forth because we did have some neighbors that had some concerns.

83
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:37,761
And the concerns really, you know, it goes from one extreme to another extreme.

84
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:41,345
One extreme is simple is that we understand and we want to be supportive.

85
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:55,191
to the people that need this type of shelter at the time, but we want to make sure we're educated and everybody knows the process, especially the neighbors, the direct abutters, that they're informed.

86
00:06:56,252 --> 00:07:02,895
I've received calls from people that are in the health fields that find it a little alarming that

87
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:16,323
What they're seeing in different neighborhoods in different states is the lack of vaccinations for the support that we're giving for the people that are in need.

88
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:20,186
So I think that there are a lot of questions that have to be asked.

89
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,468
There are a lot of questions that have to be answered.

90
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:28,172
Unfortunately, I think the key, what we'll hear tonight is really just people

91
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:30,790
sharing what the how they feel.

92
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,831
I think that's very important.

93
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:45,961
But I also understand that truly, from what we've heard, both from the communications from the mayor's office and outside is that we really need the the landlord

94
00:07:47,281 --> 00:08:05,952
We need someone from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, and someone from the Mayor's Office, and most importantly, someone from the Governor's Office that's going to come in and really set up a meeting that really can answer some questions.

95
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,273
We're hearing that it's a done deal.

96
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,046
but at the same time, we're not seeing it.

97
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:18,490
We're hearing that the mayor has put out an MOU, but it hasn't been followed through yet from the state.

98
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,812
So there's a lot of different variables that are still left wide open.

99
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:38,502
And I appreciate, I think that the phone calls I got from a lot of teachers and parents from especially the McGlynn and the Roberts where they're at extended capacity right now and making sure that having

100
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:46,524
to the public schools right now would be totally devastating in some of our schools.

101
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:51,246
So I think that, you know, the questions we have is infrastructure, George.

102
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:52,187
Do we have enough police?

103
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:53,787
Do we have enough fire?

104
00:08:54,848 --> 00:09:02,331
Does the health department have enough support to make sure that everything is on the up and up at this facility?

105
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:03,992
So there are a lot of questions.

106
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:09,214
So like I said, Mr. President, this is really, I put this out for

107
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:26,409
the residents that had some questions that can share it publicly so we can get it on the record and hopefully the governor's office can follow through with a meeting so people are notified properly and for one person

108
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:38,597
mentioned that for her and her family, it's scary, not in a disrespectful thought process to the people that are going through this, but it's scary because of the organizational piece.

109
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:42,658
I think that that's where they're not understanding and not knowing.

110
00:09:42,718 --> 00:09:48,921
So I know that other people want to talk, so I yield to them now.

111
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:49,921
So thank you, Mr. President.

112
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:51,762
Thank you, Councilor Schapiro.

113
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:54,763
I hear from Representative Donato, and then I hear from fellow councilors.

114
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:55,744
Representative Donato.

115
00:09:58,646 --> 00:09:59,406
Press a button.

116
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:01,567
First time here?

117
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,348
This is my first time.

118
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:06,229
I'm very nervous.

119
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,390
My first time speaking in front of an audience.

120
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,211
Name and address for the record, please.

121
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:12,152
It's a joke.

122
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,924
So my name is Paul Donato.

123
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:18,865
I'm the state representative for the 35th Middlesex District.

124
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:22,226
I live at 48 Maurice Street in Medford.

125
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:40,634
And let me clarify to make sure that the members of the council know that both Representative Garber and Representative Barber acquiesced to my request, along with the state senator, that it's my district and I would be more than happy to represent

126
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:44,716
the delegation here before the city council.

127
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:58,405
I believe that the mayor has provided a great deal of information to the members of the council as to what this situation is, and I know that there's major questions and concerns.

128
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:06,610
We as a delegation, and I know that the residents in the area and the mayor herself has many questions that we want to ask.

129
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,212
The governor has the emergency power

130
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:13,774
and MOU was presented to the landlord.

131
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:25,761
HomeServe is attempting to work with the governor and the migrants to find out what their needs are.

132
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:33,626
My understanding is that there will be no children attending the schools, that this is a

133
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:46,023
transitional system and a transitional place so that those children will be going to permanent shelters.

134
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:53,369
So it would not make sense to put a child into the McGlynn or to the Andrews or to any other schools.

135
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:55,650
And then all of a sudden they'd be in

136
00:11:56,651 --> 00:12:05,195
Chelsea, Revere, or Maynard, and we would have to pay busing to bring those children back to our schools since they started.

137
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:09,556
So I think that it's important that the mayor gave you that information.

138
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:12,498
And as she said, she has set the criteria.

139
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:20,641
She has been in touch with me relative to the process, making sure that I was aware

140
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:26,724
since it's my district, but I was aware more important to give the rest of the information to the delegation.

141
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:32,727
So there are many questions and the residents have a right to ask those questions.

142
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:37,910
And the mayor is on top of it with the lieutenant governor trying to get

143
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:53,623
a community meeting for the residents so that they can ask the questions, the council can ask the questions, and we can get the answers from the administration as to what is the process, how long is the process, and where

144
00:12:54,741 --> 00:13:08,764
Where is it going to be to make sure that the community is safe, that the residents are satisfied with the process, and that the migrants themselves are safe in that particular venue?

145
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:19,086
So I'm more than happy to answer any other question, but on behalf of the delegation and the mayor, I know that we've tried to keep the council abreast of what's going on.

146
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,176
Thank you, Representative Donato.

147
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:29,180
Yes, and I want to acknowledge we have received several communications from the mayor, including the memorandum of understanding was emailed out to the council.

148
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:31,982
Some questions have been answered.

149
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:36,325
Some further questions have been generated as the process has moved along.

150
00:13:36,905 --> 00:13:42,669
And it does seem that, at this point, the people who have the answers to those questions are from the state government.

151
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,411
And the mayor is working to bring them here for a community meeting.

152
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,252
But the date is not certain.

153
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,150
At this point, that's kind of my just quick summary.

154
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,391
I will go to councilors.

155
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:59,158
I wasn't tracking hands, but if anyone has anything they want to say or any questions they want to put on the record, then we can go to the members of the public.

156
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:00,940
Councilor Lazaro.

157
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:11,647
I wonder, Representative Donato, if you can speak to other similar shelters in different cities that have been set up.

158
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:13,988
I know this crisis has been going on for a while.

159
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:21,632
Have there been other temporary shelters very short term like this that have been set up in other places?

160
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:42,012
Um most of the yeah the legislature put a 7500 permanent shelter into the budget with the 250 million dollars that uh has been the shelters and unfortunately uh the 7500 shelters are now overcrowded uh and um

161
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:59,621
We're working, well, the governor is working on finding permanent shelters for those individuals, and as those shelters open up, then the migrants who are in temporary shelters will be able to be accommodated.

162
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:04,362
My understanding is there's one in Chelsea and one in Revere.

163
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,542
Okay.

164
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:10,103
My question is about the five-day

165
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,422
sort of ideal limit.

166
00:15:15,384 --> 00:15:28,495
I think with the way that housing and bureaucracy and the way these things tend to go, my suspicion is that sometimes people will be somewhere for a little bit longer.

167
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:31,258
And my concern about that isn't that

168
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:58,544
the migrants will be in this shelter for longer, but that if we have presented it as such a temporary location that we're making it harder for maybe students who do need to enroll, if they end up staying for longer and they're out of school as a result for a long time, I wouldn't want to give the impression that they're blocked from attending school if they do.

169
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:02,826
stay for a while, if they're there for two or three months, maybe.

170
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:05,187
I don't know that that would happen.

171
00:16:05,907 --> 00:16:15,610
But in working with people who are trying to attain housing, often, even if you have something that's in the works, it takes a month just to roll over the next

172
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,189
the last person to move out of somewhere, you know, like these things can kind of sometimes take time.

173
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:33,415
So I'm curious about, you may not know this, but I'm curious about Medford's understanding of how we can treat the folks that are staying there as though they're residents of Medford while they're residents of Medford.

174
00:16:34,389 --> 00:17:00,748
It is my understanding from the mayor and the governor's office, the mayor has been in touch with the lieutenant governor on a daily basis relative to the concerns that the residents have and the concerns that the government has with regard to the migrants, that they have listened to the mayor's concern relative to a temporary shelter, and whether that's five days or seven days,

175
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:16,356
She does not anticipate any more than that at this particular time, and that's why she's adamant that the Lieutenant Governor is assured that we are not going to be taxing the educational system.

176
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:17,296
Okay, got it.

177
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:17,677
Thank you.

178
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:20,618
Thank you.

179
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:22,819
Any other comments or questions from Councillors?

180
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:24,100
Councillor Collins.

181
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:28,025
Thank you for being here, Representative Donato.

182
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:28,926
Sorry to make you stand up again.

183
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:35,033
Feel free to say so if this is a question, but are directed to the folks at the Office of Housing and Livable Communities.

184
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:39,578
So these migrant, sorry, these temporary shelters are being set up because

185
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,328
We're at a crisis level in terms of the lack of shelter space.

186
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:51,311
You mentioned the permanent shelters that are coming online to be sort of the more long-term solution to this issue.

187
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:56,594
Can you provide any sense of the status of the permanent shelters that are being set up?

188
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:09,362
Well, the permanent shelters that are being established at this particular time have been most of the hotels and motels throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

189
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:16,845
And what they're hoping is, what the governor's, I'm assuming, what the governor's hope is, is that

190
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:41,764
as we find more housing in public housing, as there are openings in the public housing, is to extract those migrants who are in the hotels and motels, which are very difficult, bring them into the permanent housing, and then bring those who are in these temporary shelters into something that's a little more accommodating.

191
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:43,825
Got it.

192
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:44,426
Thank you so much.

193
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:46,728
And the reason we're here in the first place is because even

194
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:55,956
permanent, sorry, the longer term shelter beds in the hotels and motels, those are actually, we don't have as many beds as we used to.

195
00:18:56,116 --> 00:19:05,581
I think the governor's indicating that there's something like 1,000 migrants a week that are anticipated in coming into the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

196
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:12,966
So it's something that we in the legislature, the speaker and the governor and the Senate president

197
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:25,115
grappling with this issue, both on the basis of the numbers of people who are coming and how to accommodate them and the potential cost in the budget.

198
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:27,777
Thank you.

199
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:30,159
Thank you, Councillor Collins.

200
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,244
And I just do want to note, I think it's good to ask questions, and Rep Tornado is here, and we'll also have the record of this meeting.

201
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:42,838
very likely will have to direct these questions to the state officials at their public meetings.

202
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:51,026
So we're gathering some feedback here, but we don't have the answers or the folks who do have the answers or are working on creating the answers are not here.

203
00:19:51,126 --> 00:20:03,958
Well, you can be assured that the mayor is on top of this, the lieutenant governor on a daily basis to make sure that the residents are fully aware of what's going to go on, how it's going to happen and

204
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,783
what is the final solution to the site.

205
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:12,224
Thank you, Representative.

206
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:17,068
I'm going to go to members of the public who have questions, unless there were other councillors.

207
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:20,390
I'm going to go to members of the public.

208
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:21,791
We have some folks on Zoom.

209
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:22,552
We have some folks here.

210
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:23,533
I'll start at the podium.

211
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,594
Please give your name and address for the record.

212
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:29,377
My name is Charlie Pagliarulo, 249 Gaston Street.

213
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:29,717
Go ahead.

214
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:31,759
All right.

215
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,103
I want to start off by saying this.

216
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:44,950
This was, according to State Representative Donato, it was a state of emergency from the governor back in August.

217
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,011
Am I right?

218
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:48,173
August 23rd, if I'm not mistaken?

219
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:50,535
Okay, state of emergency.

220
00:20:51,035 --> 00:21:03,786
Now, I'll get to that in a minute, but understand something, I did my research too, and every time a law, a bylaw, a rule, a regulation is written up and okayed, it usually has these words in it.

221
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,580
to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth.

222
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,100
State representative, am I correct in that?

223
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:13,841
Thank you.

224
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:16,261
Sir, if you could direct your comments to me, thank you.

225
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:19,182
Well, he's the one who knows, they write up the laws of the state.

226
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:23,643
Pursuant to the rules of the council, comments should be directed to me, whether it's counselors or members of the public.

227
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:25,043
All right, that's fine.

228
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:33,945
But my little bit of homework says to me, when it comes to definitions, this is on the state of emergency, by the way,

229
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:36,157
Civil Defense Act.

230
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,761
How about that?

231
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,867
Civil Defense Act, Acts 1950, Chapter 639.

232
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:48,898
And it says in paragraph S5, power to seize or possess personal property.

233
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:52,481
And I'll be quick, I won't go through the whole thing, but I'll get to the point.

234
00:21:52,981 --> 00:22:02,848
Because of the existing possibility of occurrence, whatever that might be, it goes on to say, to preserve the lives and property of the people of the Commonwealth.

235
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:09,113
And I'll go on to another one, paragraph S5A, and I'll go on.

236
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:11,955
Governor may employ every agency.

237
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:20,041
as you go forward, to protect the lives and property of its citizens and to enforce the law.

238
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:24,584
That's us and nobody else.

239
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:29,687
And nobody else, that's us.

240
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:35,931
Now, I wanna ask out loud, what is the emergency?

241
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,146
Is it health?

242
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:40,288
Do we have a COVID problem anymore?

243
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:41,129
I don't think so.

244
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:43,711
We're cautious, but there's no emergency.

245
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:45,793
Is it civil unrest?

246
00:22:46,473 --> 00:22:47,254
Are there riots?

247
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:49,556
Is there political upheaval?

248
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,198
Is there military action?

249
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:53,479
No.

250
00:22:55,261 --> 00:22:56,322
Natural disasters?

251
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:56,982
Are there floods?

252
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:57,843
Are there hurricanes?

253
00:22:57,903 --> 00:22:58,864
Are there snowstorms?

254
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:00,806
I don't see any in sight.

255
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:10,351
Those are definitions of an emergency act for this Commonwealth from the governor to enforce it.

256
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:11,752
I don't see that.

257
00:23:12,552 --> 00:23:15,033
But then I hear refugees.

258
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:18,515
Refugees.

259
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:20,596
You know what they are?

260
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:23,498
People fleeing from what I just described.

261
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:25,679
Who are they?

262
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,680
Where are they?

263
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,640
What are they doing here?

264
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,282
How about this one?

265
00:23:30,882 --> 00:23:32,083
Homelessness and shelter.

266
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:36,167
for our citizens of the Commonwealth.

267
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:38,889
Nobody else.

268
00:23:44,594 --> 00:23:45,714
So let me add to that.

269
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:51,059
For a little over a decade or so, we've quote, had a housing crisis.

270
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,001
This realtor knows a little bit about housing.

271
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:56,123
We've always been in a housing crisis.

272
00:23:56,763 --> 00:23:58,545
There'll never be enough housing.

273
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:00,907
So where's the emergency?

274
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:02,328
I want to know.

275
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:08,905
You know what's gonna happen when this happens?

276
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:10,725
We'll be under a lot of duress.

277
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:15,668
We don't have an answer as to how long it will be or how extended this will be.

278
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:18,969
Think about that for a minute.

279
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:24,451
Oh, by the way, these refugees, these refugees, I wanna know something.

280
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:28,853
How did they get here?

281
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:29,974
Were they vetted?

282
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:32,855
I don't think so.

283
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:36,210
Were they were they running away from something?

284
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,830
I don't know.

285
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:39,511
This is hard to understand.

286
00:24:39,552 --> 00:24:41,592
Why are they here for asylum?

287
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:47,415
They were ready, willing and able and also paid to cross these borders.

288
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:49,916
They're called illegals.

289
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:53,038
That's what they're called.

290
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:54,258
Call it for what it is.

291
00:24:59,461 --> 00:24:59,801
Damn.

292
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:01,582
Now,

293
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:09,721
There's a simple way to fix an emergency because if it's manmade, unnatural disaster, there's a simple way to fix this.

294
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:10,821
Don't let it happen.

295
00:25:12,402 --> 00:25:13,742
And we won't have an emergency.

296
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:15,563
Turn them around.

297
00:25:19,024 --> 00:25:19,744
Turn them around.

298
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:24,465
Oh yeah, I hope there's no ulterior motive to this in the end, quite frankly.

299
00:25:24,845 --> 00:25:26,205
Now I'm gonna show you something.

300
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:27,566
What am I here for?

301
00:25:29,414 --> 00:25:33,177
to defend my way of life and how I got here.

302
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:36,580
See this picture?

303
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:41,063
I'll be happy to pass it around proud as could be.

304
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:42,744
This is my heritage.

305
00:25:42,784 --> 00:25:45,686
This is my lineage.

306
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:48,469
Yeah, that's my grandfather when he's 12 years old.

307
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,992
I get the fact that it's his passport to come here.

308
00:25:54,914 --> 00:25:56,094
I'll be very quick about this.

309
00:25:56,415 --> 00:25:58,877
But I hope you understand where I'm coming from and why.

310
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,552
Because I have to explain this to my grandchild.

311
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:08,797
This man at 12 years old came over here.

312
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:17,665
But before he did, his father had to be sponsored, he had to have a skilled job, and he needed housing within two years.

313
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:20,408
If he didn't have any of that in place, he's going back.

314
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:24,032
He's going back.

315
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:27,498
Well, he succeeded, and he didn't get any aid for it.

316
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,121
That was my great-grandfather.

317
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,605
I was able to speak to him when I was younger.

318
00:26:32,587 --> 00:26:34,750
Here's my grandfather, 12 years old.

319
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:36,072
He comes over.

320
00:26:38,356 --> 00:26:42,097
If this bores you, let me know, because this is why I am here.

321
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:44,318
He come over at 12 years old.

322
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:45,078
I'm not done.

323
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:47,639
You have about 30 seconds left to return to the rules.

324
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,799
I have 30 seconds.

325
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:49,079
Yes.

326
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,220
My grandfather gave me a lifetime.

327
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,581
I'll talk about my grandfather proudly.

328
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:55,441
He came over here.

329
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:56,882
Okay.

330
00:26:57,022 --> 00:26:57,922
Self-made man.

331
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:59,122
He didn't get assistance.

332
00:26:59,522 --> 00:27:01,443
He didn't get an EBT card.

333
00:27:01,483 --> 00:27:03,184
He didn't get transportation or a phone.

334
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:04,144
He got nothing.

335
00:27:05,185 --> 00:27:08,207
He wasn't even taught how to speak, he had to do it on his own.

336
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,208
And they found a way to do it.

337
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:18,992
And you know what his father not only was he a machinist, my grandfather was and he had a great way of life all on his own a self made man.

338
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:26,676
And I had the honor and privilege to work with my grandfather in his business for five years, shoulder to shoulder.

339
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:32,979
At the young age of 21 years old, I said to him, Papa,

340
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:35,466
Why didn't you teach me Italian?

341
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:38,768
You know what he said?

342
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:40,889
Because I wanted to be an American.

343
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,191
I want to see a show of hands here.

344
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:50,089
If you don't mind, sir, thank you for your time.

345
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:50,629
What's the matter?

346
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:52,310
You don't want to answer me, sir.

347
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,150
I asked you a question out loud here.

348
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,932
Who is in favor of this movement?

349
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:59,433
I want to see a show of hands.

350
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:00,913
You've presented your topic.

351
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:01,734
You've had your five minutes.

352
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:02,574
I want an answer.

353
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:03,814
You don't get an answer, sir.

354
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:04,735
I didn't get an answer.

355
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:05,155
No, sir.

356
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:06,575
I know my answer.

357
00:28:06,636 --> 00:28:07,796
We've heard public comment from me.

358
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:08,556
You may sit down.

359
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:10,837
Yes, of course it is.

360
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:13,278
Yes, the great treason of loving.

361
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,279
Sir, please sit down.

362
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:17,055
Sir, please sit down.

363
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:19,878
The great treason of loving thy neighbor is no treason at all.

364
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:24,242
We'll go to Lorna Wilkerson.

365
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:31,329
Lorna, I've marked you to unmute.

366
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:32,690
Name and address for the record, please.

367
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,751
You'll have about five minutes.

368
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:39,731
Hello, can you hear me?

369
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:40,251
Can you hear me?

370
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,212
Yes, we can hear you.

371
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,633
Name and address for the record, please.

372
00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:52,416
My name is Lorna Wilkerson, MD, MS, member of the fellow American of College of OB-GYN.

373
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,939
I would like to thank the person who just spoke for his absolutely excellent presentation.

374
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:15,549
I would like to say that I have not only taken care of many of the illegal refugees who are coming into Boston right now as a physician, but I am the daughter of an immigrant.

375
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,232
I am the great granddaughter of a slave.

376
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:31,053
I am shocked and appalled after living in Medford for 26 years, paying my taxes, and never once coming to the city council complaining of anything.

377
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:40,320
That the members of this hardworking community are treated like they are knuckleheads by this city council and by this mayor.

378
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,821
There is no way

379
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:58,708
When we are told coming to this meeting that this is already set in February 26, we will be coming with the shelter, which by the way, the address has never been given to the rest of this community without our input.

380
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:01,250
I will say this.

381
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:19,626
I cannot say the hospital, but currently right now as a physician, there are in a hospital in the city, two cases of tuberculosis that are the type that are resistant to medication.

382
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:24,991
I would like to say that in Newton, where there is a shelter, where

383
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:31,325
A colleague of mine kept a family that came in with a child that was sick.

384
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:37,108
She became sick and was sick for three months with pneumonia.

385
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:50,696
We are not looking as a physician, and I have presented information to the counselor, where tuberculosis and various other diseases, not just my opinion,

386
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:53,298
are coming into the city.

387
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,963
Do you know that children cannot stay in shelters in this city, in this country, for more than three months?

388
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:07,551
And we have thousands of children that are coming into the city, it's not from me, it's from the federal government, with untreated tuberculosis.

389
00:31:09,012 --> 00:31:15,798
Does anybody here tell me how many patients can come into the Department of Health of the City of Medford a day?

390
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,593
I know that you're saying that there's no children coming in, but there are people coming in.

391
00:31:21,773 --> 00:31:26,597
Who's going to take care of the pregnant women coming in with various diseases?

392
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,939
We have schizophrenia coming into this country.

393
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:38,906
Is there anybody here who's going to take care of the many women coming here who are immigrants, illegal aliens who are being raped and abused?

394
00:31:39,187 --> 00:31:42,089
Do we have a domestic violence program that's going to take care of these people?

395
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:57,785
I'm just saying this is a middle class town that is totally unprepared for the various issues from the aliens that I have taken care of working in a federally funded health center for the last several years.

396
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:20,318
And I cannot say how disappointed and shocked I am, A, by how this council seems to be totally unprepared for what's coming to it, and B, let me just say as a Medford citizen for a quarter of a century, how the previous member who spoke of his family and how hard they worked to come here was treated.

397
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:25,841
It took my mother 15 years to become a legal citizen of this country.

398
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:31,623
And when she died a month ago at the age of 98, she could still speak the Constitution.

399
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:35,225
How many people coming in here respect this country like she did?

400
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:37,126
Thank you very much.

401
00:32:37,326 --> 00:32:38,106
That's my time.

402
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:40,567
Thank you.

403
00:32:44,989 --> 00:32:46,390
Any other residents like to speak?

404
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,151
Any other comments from Councillors?

405
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:50,252
Councillor Collins.

406
00:32:52,295 --> 00:32:53,676
Thank you so much, President Behrs.

407
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:56,758
Representative Donato, sorry, another question for you, if you're willing to speak to it.

408
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:09,205
In the couple weeks since the mayor started circulating information about this temporary shelter, I've heard from a number of residents who have asked, you know, obviously folks are coming here because they're in this crisis situation.

409
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:14,108
How can we as Medford residents help these folks who might be coming temporarily into our community?

410
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:15,949
And I know, again, this might be one of the many questions

411
00:33:16,343 --> 00:33:23,372
That can only be answered by our partners at the state level, but is there anything you can share about folks that here in Medford can have on their radar about how to help out?

412
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:39,366
The only thing I can share is that the mayor has done everything in her power to deal with the state administration to see that the migrants are treated, they're in a safe place.

413
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:51,891
But like I have indicated from the beginning, it's very difficult since the administration has not given full information to both the mayor and to the delegation.

414
00:33:52,472 --> 00:33:53,132
And until

415
00:33:54,395 --> 00:34:08,527
until they come in, have the public meeting so that the residents can understand and the members of the city government and the state government can understand what the process is, then all we can do is wait for that particular time.

416
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:13,912
But I can assure you that the delegation and in particular, the mayor is on top of it.

417
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:15,513
Understood, Representative.

418
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:15,813
Thank you.

419
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:18,696
And I think it's very clear that the bottleneck here is at the state level.

420
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:20,597
So thank you for the updates that you're able to provide.

421
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:22,359
Thank you.

422
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:26,816
Name and address for the record, please, and you have five minutes.

423
00:34:27,116 --> 00:34:27,336
Sure.

424
00:34:27,576 --> 00:34:29,918
Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave in Medford.

425
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:31,620
I am an abutter of this place.

426
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,023
The address is 400 Riverside Ave for the public that wants to know.

427
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:41,928
And I am not satisfied with how the mayor has communicated information to the neighborhood.

428
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:43,890
Mr. Merritt, if you could direct your comments to me.

429
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:44,851
Absolutely.

430
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:53,818
Through the chair, I am not satisfied how the mayor has communicated information to the neighbors and the neighborhood and the abutters of that.

431
00:34:54,338 --> 00:35:13,073
If this was the Locust Street project again, right, this council hired an attorney because the Zoning Board of Appeals dropped the ball, didn't even have a public meeting, violated public meeting law, and the mayor was part of that.

432
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:16,796
She understood that the residents had a right to information.

433
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:19,518
But I only hear things when I come here.

434
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:26,684
So I brought my wife with me tonight, who is an immigrant, and to all the Facebook keyboard warriors out there that want to say something.

435
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,645
She's first generation American.

436
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:31,828
I'm a grandchild of immigrants.

437
00:35:32,248 --> 00:35:33,589
I don't have a problem with immigrants.

438
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:38,053
I do have a problem with the way that all the information has been communicated.

439
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:40,735
This project started in October.

440
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:48,812
And there's been nothing officially published until I came here and started asking questions to get them on the record.

441
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:55,554
And thank you that you all as a body are willing to entertain this, but the mayor is not publishing anything except one Facebook post.

442
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,594
And that's on set.

443
00:36:00,755 --> 00:36:06,436
That is not a way you communicate information and especially to gain information from your neighbors.

444
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:08,457
She hasn't talked to me.

445
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:12,238
She hasn't talked to my neighbors that I'm on the phone with right now.

446
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:15,004
So no, I don't think she's got it.

447
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:18,366
You know, she does not have a handle on this.

448
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,147
And honestly, I don't think you do either.

449
00:36:21,968 --> 00:36:23,548
I care about safety of my kid.

450
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:31,312
And again, for all the keyboard warriors out there that live up in the ivory tower in the hills of this community, you don't live where I do.

451
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:40,357
Wegmans has a police guard every night, obviously because it's so safe and they're not worried about any crime.

452
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:51,854
But yet New York City, which has one of the most fantastic police forces in the world, you had a Venezuelan migrant in a shelter stabbed by other Venezuelan migrants.

453
00:36:53,435 --> 00:37:01,060
Bullets fly through windows, bullets fly through siding, and it's my house that could potentially be a target with my two little kids at home.

454
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:04,683
So yeah, I got concerns because it's my neighborhood.

455
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:10,907
Is anyone in this council within view of this building at 400 Riverside Ave?

456
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:12,428
Just posing the question here.

457
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:13,729
Anyone?

458
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:16,851
Ma'am?

459
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:18,492
Justin?

460
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:20,414
Direct your comments to me, Mr. Mayor.

461
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:23,015
Okay, through you to anyone.

462
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:28,099
I'd like to hear an affirmative or a negative, quite honestly, from all the members.

463
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,701
We're happy to hear your comment, but our address is a public record.

464
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:32,422
Yes.

465
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,371
And so it's a simple yes or no.

466
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:36,472
I think that's fair.

467
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:40,597
I think you know the answer to the question.

468
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,458
The answer is no.

469
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:42,019
OK.

470
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,122
So I am concerned.

471
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:45,724
The neighbors are concerned.

472
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:54,149
So if they can't find more housing, this is temporary five days until you just said, there's no housing available.

473
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,010
So then what?

474
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,770
What is preventing actually the children from being enrolled in school?

475
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:04,492
Because how does the city stop it when the state law says that they have to be allowed to enroll in community?

476
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:13,353
These are, I think, some critical questions we need answers to in the utopian ideal situation, all's well and they move away in five days.

477
00:38:14,114 --> 00:38:15,274
How long is this gonna go on for?

478
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:15,994
How many years?

479
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:20,848
There are some legitimate concerns, public safety.

480
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:23,269
How are we gonna address that, even for the neighborhood?

481
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:30,772
Trash and garbage and logistical things like that that happen.

482
00:38:31,053 --> 00:38:33,814
We have some questions, but apparently now it's a done deal.

483
00:38:34,254 --> 00:38:39,076
So the train's gonna roll over us and you have zero way to influence it, is what I just heard tonight.

484
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:41,457
That's unsat.

485
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:43,718
Madam Mayor, that's unsat.

486
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,200
I'm looking forward to the community meeting

487
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:56,147
I think you're gonna have some neighbors that are very concerned, and I hope this council can help us, at least like they tried to do during the Locust Street project.

488
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:58,870
So, who's gonna pay for this?

489
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:02,533
I mean, there's a lot of questions to get answered.

490
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:02,814
Thank you.

491
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:10,565
I appreciate you bringing this forward because this was started by a community member like yourself that had an issue.

492
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:15,668
So I think we all feel the same pain of the lack of lack of information.

493
00:39:15,908 --> 00:39:17,249
And I think that that

494
00:39:19,076 --> 00:39:20,577
And we'll relay this to the mayor.

495
00:39:20,617 --> 00:39:32,524
I think we'll put it in a form of motion that when we do have this meeting, that the information is put out the robocall for all the residents in that neighborhood for at least to get those questions answered.

496
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:37,307
Because I think that one thing we all share are these same questions.

497
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:49,010
You know, we understand the situation that we're in that we're put in, but I think the biggest biggest concerns right now is getting the answers to the questions that we have so we can move forward.

498
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,851
And this is the big problem with what you see in most communities.

499
00:39:52,592 --> 00:39:56,553
When there isn't transparency, there isn't lack of there is a huge lack of.

500
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,090
communication.

501
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:14,860
But this is truly coming from, you know, the state level, where I think that, you know, looking at the governor's office and making sure that they hear us and they that that meeting when that meeting does come, come to fruition, that the message is sent loud and clear.

502
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,482
It's, it's, it's, you know, this is this is an issue immigrations of

503
00:40:20,576 --> 00:40:21,296
It's a big issue.

504
00:40:21,316 --> 00:40:22,717
It's a bigger issue than we have right now.

505
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:28,298
That's why I know Mr. Pagliarulo brings up good points in the sense that this is a federal issue.

506
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:30,179
We're a mess.

507
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:32,199
And it's not fair to the families that are brought here either.

508
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:46,263
I've had the fortune of coaching a lot of these young people that are forced to come into our country because they don't have anything else, and they thrive in our country, and they try to make it

509
00:40:47,256 --> 00:40:51,641
make it through as legal as possible to make sure they want to be American citizens.

510
00:40:52,122 --> 00:40:53,484
So it's a hurdle.

511
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,386
We understand on every level.

512
00:40:55,947 --> 00:41:01,453
But with this situation that we're talking about right now with the Riverside issue, there are a lot of issues.

513
00:41:01,654 --> 00:41:06,199
And something that I'm going to stand strong on, we don't have the infrastructure.

514
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,020
That has to be stressed to the governor through the MOU.

515
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:20,063
This be stressed that the mayor, we don't have the infrastructure in place to house number of families and people for more than what they're saying.

516
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:23,824
I appreciate Councilor Zara bringing that question up.

517
00:41:23,844 --> 00:41:31,085
And there is a state law that says that truly, I've talked to teachers today, talked to teachers from both the McGlynn and the Roberts that called me about this issue.

518
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:31,265
St.

519
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:33,086
George, we truly don't have

520
00:41:34,046 --> 00:41:35,287
it's we're filled to capacity.

521
00:41:35,948 --> 00:41:57,325
And with the lack of support that they have in the special needs department, it's it would magnify things to a degree that we could never recover from our kids will not recover from, you know, so you bring a lot of good points, you know, trash health department being involved, the police making sure how do we how do we police that area that a friend on on zoom talking about

522
00:41:57,745 --> 00:42:05,909
health concerns and vaccinations and making sure that people that are coming into our country, listen, we can't come into the schools, our kids can't enter schools without being vaccinated.

523
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:12,372
So if they're coming into this, into the housing, we're the United States of America, we should be able to vaccinate

524
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:19,392
these young people that are coming in and make sure they're as healthy as possible if they're going to be in our community.

525
00:42:19,432 --> 00:42:21,574
So there's a lot of pieces that we all share.

526
00:42:21,594 --> 00:42:26,498
I think that, you know, it's not something that this council is for or against.

527
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:31,442
We just provided, we wanted to provide an avenue so people can come up and talk.

528
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:33,844
It's not, this isn't you against us, it's not.

529
00:42:33,944 --> 00:42:36,005
I think that we've got to find the middle ground.

530
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:39,969
We got to find the process to make sure the communication

531
00:42:40,629 --> 00:42:43,291
and the answers are met from everybody.

532
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:44,631
We feel the same way.

533
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:45,952
We all have the same questions.

534
00:42:46,072 --> 00:42:49,895
I mean, you know, just because we're city councils don't mean that, doesn't mean that we have the answers.

535
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,796
You've seen it a thousand times in different formats.

536
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:57,959
So, you know, I appreciate you bringing this forward because I think that that's what this, that's what a good community is about.

537
00:42:57,979 --> 00:43:04,723
There's an issue, community member steps up, city council step in when they're not being heard and we share, we give that avenue.

538
00:43:04,763 --> 00:43:07,005
So I appreciate that and understand that.

539
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:10,707
We feel the same way you do in the sense of getting the word out.

540
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,109
Whether you're for it or against it doesn't matter.

541
00:43:13,129 --> 00:43:18,233
The truth of the matter is we need a line of communication so everybody feels safe.

542
00:43:18,313 --> 00:43:23,317
Whether you live in the hills or whether you live right on Riverside Ave, these are big concerns.

543
00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:24,759
Because like you said,

544
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:30,404
It's not just people that are, you know, the same people that are moving in with these health issues, vaccine issues.

545
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:31,965
They're going to be shopping at Wegmans.

546
00:43:32,286 --> 00:43:33,647
They're going to be playing in the parks.

547
00:43:33,707 --> 00:43:35,629
They're going to be, you know, in our libraries.

548
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:42,595
We, that possibly, so it's making sure that we have everything in place to make sure that we're giving them the best opportunity to thrive while they're here.

549
00:43:42,635 --> 00:43:44,117
So I appreciate it.

550
00:43:44,157 --> 00:43:44,977
I just want to let you know that.

551
00:43:45,058 --> 00:43:45,318
Thank you.

552
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:54,035
Thank you for your comment there.

553
00:43:54,336 --> 00:43:57,462
And I guess just to the for the record.

554
00:43:58,689 --> 00:43:59,709
I don't think I'm a bigot.

555
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:07,212
I'm just a neighbor who's concerned and I have neighbors, you know, that are, you know, fellow neighbors that are concerned in the neighborhood.

556
00:44:07,232 --> 00:44:10,673
And this can directly impact and people like, Oh, what do you mean trash?

557
00:44:10,713 --> 00:44:11,033
What do you mean?

558
00:44:11,053 --> 00:44:11,313
Whatever.

559
00:44:11,573 --> 00:44:17,415
I find shopping carts in my yard all the time to begin with, I'd be happy to take them to some other person's address.

560
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:19,935
right and load them up in my truck and return them that way.

561
00:44:20,256 --> 00:44:21,476
It's silly things like that.

562
00:44:21,556 --> 00:44:24,757
But also, like I said, in New York, I'm not making this up.

563
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:29,358
This is on the news that there were people getting stabbed and I don't I'm sorry, I don't want that in my neighborhood.

564
00:44:29,738 --> 00:44:30,738
So how do we fix it?

565
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:35,839
And if someone says, Oh, we're going to detail a state police officer at this building every day, then okay, great.

566
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:37,760
That's a potential solution.

567
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,080
But without any answers.

568
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:41,516
to get in front of it, right?

569
00:44:41,576 --> 00:44:43,857
Are we just going to sit there and wait for all the problems to boil up?

570
00:44:44,217 --> 00:44:51,380
I've heard from a reliable source that, for instance, that the state has had to train certain migrant communities, that it's not okay to sit there and grope a woman.

571
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,401
Because culturally, that's okay from where they're coming from, but it's not okay here.

572
00:44:56,201 --> 00:45:01,703
So I mean, there are some serious issues that don't necessarily fall into the optimum narrative.

573
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:05,444
that we really need to address it for the good of everyone.

574
00:45:05,565 --> 00:45:17,230
So think of what people want, you know, of me, but this is why I'm Bruce America, far from a bigot, you've come up here and spoken in favor of many different issues, and it didn't matter what the issue was.

575
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:30,937
So I think that if that's, if that's the Facebook army that's out there, that's that you don't have to we got just to just erase it, because, you know, you've come in, you've come 1000 times to this podium, and support of many different people didn't matter what

576
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:36,860
whatever color they are, race they are, whatever gender they are, you're always there to support people.

577
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,781
So, I think that that should be mentioned.

578
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:40,362
So, thank you.

579
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:41,842
Thank you.

580
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:42,783
We're going to go to Zoom.

581
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:43,904
Jacqueline.

582
00:45:50,575 --> 00:45:52,216
My name is Jacqueline Cervone.

583
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:54,377
I'm an 18 Powderhouse Terrace in Medford.

584
00:45:54,677 --> 00:45:57,298
I am a Massachusetts registered nurse.

585
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:02,581
I share the same health concerns as Lorna and many of you do.

586
00:46:04,702 --> 00:46:07,243
You know, people are talking about their ancestors coming.

587
00:46:07,283 --> 00:46:08,964
My grandparents came from Italy.

588
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:14,486
came through Ellis Island, had to be quarantined for a while.

589
00:46:15,927 --> 00:46:24,830
People were treated for illnesses and vaccinated with whatever they had at the time for vaccinations, and had to be cleared medically before they came here.

590
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:28,131
So that's obviously a huge concern of mine.

591
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:33,854
I'm also aware of the TB cases that are popping up in Massachusetts now.

592
00:46:35,663 --> 00:46:42,127
But the other issue is, and I agree with what everyone has said, you know, we pay our taxes.

593
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:49,171
I can't even get the cedar to come and cut a branch off a tree that's leaning on my wires to my house.

594
00:46:50,412 --> 00:46:52,233
But we can house these people.

595
00:46:55,425 --> 00:47:02,807
see there are homeless people in Medford, there are homeless single mothers, there are homeless veterans, and what do we do for them?

596
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:03,347
Nothing.

597
00:47:03,627 --> 00:47:03,947
Nothing.

598
00:47:04,828 --> 00:47:08,269
But, you know, and I understand there are people in need.

599
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:12,150
I'm sure many of those people are wonderful people, I get that, but I think

600
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,592
our own people need to be taken care of.

601
00:47:17,454 --> 00:47:19,776
I find it but it sounds like this is a done deal.

602
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:26,983
So, you know, you can hear us out, and everything, but it sounds like what no matter what we say, this is going to move forward.

603
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:35,890
But my question is, so this building that they're going to be housed in, it's right now a vacant building, from what I understand.

604
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:38,012
Is that correct?

605
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:39,133
There's a

606
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:43,621
It's a vacant office building, it's not a hotel.

607
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:56,010
Okay, so they're going to completely furnish this, completely overhaul the plumbing, completely furnish the kitchens, the bedrooms, et cetera, for a five-day visit?

608
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,412
That sounds a little suspect to me.

609
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:01,074
I don't think we have the answers to that question.

610
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:03,316
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

611
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:05,758
I said I don't believe we have the answers to that question.

612
00:48:06,536 --> 00:48:18,288
Yeah, I mean, does that make sense to you, Mr. Behrs, that you would completely furnish this place with multiple, you know, I assume the offices are gonna be little apartments for families and whoever's coming.

613
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:24,154
To go through all of that for five days, I just have a hard time believing that.

614
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:39,964
I actually a hotel would be make more sense because there's already beds, there's already food, there's bathrooms, there's things like that, but to completely furnish an entire building for how many migrants did you say were coming?

615
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:42,066
Like 250 or something?

616
00:48:43,307 --> 00:48:45,309
That's what the mayor's statement says.

617
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:45,810
Okay.

618
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,673
Councilor Zaro for a second, Councilor Zaro has a comment.

619
00:48:49,353 --> 00:48:49,754
Okay.

620
00:48:50,672 --> 00:49:05,418
of information I spoke with the mayor's office they are they're doing some plumbing retrofitting and they will have bathrooms smart bathrooms built and I believe what happens is it'll be five days

621
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:13,638
her sort of family, and then they'll cycle through and it'll be the next group that will come in, it wouldn't be just open for five days, and then.

622
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:17,962
Oh, so, so it's going to be several groups at five day intervals.

623
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:23,646
So it's not just five days, it's going to be five days at a time for different groups.

624
00:49:23,686 --> 00:49:25,467
So it's going to be more than five days for us.

625
00:49:26,128 --> 00:49:26,308
Yeah.

626
00:49:28,263 --> 00:49:31,704
So let's, I think we should just step back, and there's a few facts here.

627
00:49:31,744 --> 00:49:33,924
So number one, this is a private property.

628
00:49:34,464 --> 00:49:37,225
The state is making an agreement with this private property owner.

629
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:39,346
So that's the arrangement here.

630
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:45,467
The mayor has secured a bit of understanding, but this is an agreement between the state and a private property owner.

631
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,348
The state is paying for this.

632
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:49,388
State government is paying for this.

633
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:56,070
And as councilors are set, the building will have to meet certain basic standards, such as the plumbing code.

634
00:49:58,217 --> 00:50:07,067
The issue here is that the more permanent shelters, such as empty hotels, motels, and other structures, have hit their maximum.

635
00:50:07,768 --> 00:50:10,471
And these are going to be temporary places for people to stay.

636
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:18,199
I think a few weeks ago, if people were reading the news, they were using the empty conference rooms at the Department of Transportation headquarters to house people.

637
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,849
So this is meant to be a better solution than using empty conference rooms to house people.

638
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,897
And I think if folks are also watching the news, they would know that

639
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:38,215
Governors and leaders of states on the border have decided to weaponize this issue and start shipping people to other states for political purposes.

640
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:53,383
So that is another reason that we're seeing this influx where there may be other places that could certainly handle this, but the leaders have chosen to kind of try to go against federal immigration policy and best practices.

641
00:50:54,722 --> 00:51:03,866
Um, well, I mean, what goes against our constitution and the law is the open border, but I don't, I'm not meaning to disrespect anyone.

642
00:51:04,326 --> 00:51:07,127
You know, people have a right to a home into a clean bathroom.

643
00:51:07,307 --> 00:51:08,268
I understand that.

644
00:51:08,948 --> 00:51:11,849
I understand that there's going to be people, families with children.

645
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:12,970
I respect that.

646
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,111
I understand that my concerns are health.

647
00:51:17,401 --> 00:51:19,943
And all of these people aren't going to be nice little families.

648
00:51:19,983 --> 00:51:23,545
Let's face it, we've seen a lot of fentanyl pouring over the border.

649
00:51:23,605 --> 00:51:28,528
We've seen, you know, a lot of child trafficking happening.

650
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:30,109
It's, it's, it's concerning.

651
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:31,050
It's concerning.

652
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:37,734
You know, I would love to think that they're going to be just a lot of nice families that are just looking for a better life.

653
00:51:38,215 --> 00:51:39,495
But that's not the reality.

654
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:43,338
So I do have concerns about health and safety.

655
00:51:44,824 --> 00:51:45,264
Thank you.

656
00:51:45,524 --> 00:51:45,745
Yes.

657
00:51:46,205 --> 00:51:55,251
And the state has said that these will be families and also folks who are in these facilities have been processed legally through the immigration authorities at the federal level.

658
00:51:55,952 --> 00:51:56,252
Okay.

659
00:51:56,392 --> 00:51:56,812
Thank you.

660
00:51:59,874 --> 00:52:00,054
Yes.

661
00:52:00,114 --> 00:52:04,117
I'd like to thank everybody who has come forward to speak so far.

662
00:52:04,377 --> 00:52:09,561
And I appreciate Pete and I appreciate that everybody sees this as a place where they can

663
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,200
to express their thoughts.

664
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:20,344
I'd just like to bring up one point that's been coming up in a couple of different public comment periods, which has been the safety issue specifically.

665
00:52:23,865 --> 00:52:27,667
Safety concerns can stem from several different things when it comes to

666
00:52:28,587 --> 00:52:33,388
violent crime specifically, which I think was a sentiment in a few public comments.

667
00:52:34,008 --> 00:52:38,669
I did some reading this past week, which is influencing my own thinking about this.

668
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:53,591
I'd just like to share it, which was a paper that was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2020 comparing crime rates between undocumented immigrants, legal immigrants, and native-born US citizens in Texas.

669
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:57,172
So it's one study, but I think it's pretty relevant to this, which

670
00:52:58,632 --> 00:53:12,379
You can go through the whole thing online if you'd like, but the significant section says, despite its centrality to public and political discourse, we lack even basic information on fundamental questions regarding undocumented immigrants and crime.

671
00:53:12,419 --> 00:53:15,780
This stems largely from data constraints going beyond existing research.

672
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:25,625
The authors in this study utilize data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, which checks and records the immigration status of all arrestees throughout the state.

673
00:53:26,185 --> 00:53:34,830
Contrary to public perception, we observe considerably lower felony arrest rates among undocumented immigrants compared to legal immigrants and native-born U.S.

674
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:39,112
citizens and find no evidence that undocumented criminality has increased in recent years.

675
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:42,474
Our findings help us understand why the most aggressive

676
00:53:42,994 --> 00:53:48,896
immigrant removal programs have not delivered on their crime reduction promises and are unlikely to do so in the future.

677
00:53:49,416 --> 00:54:01,199
While the news does report on unequal rates about crimes that happen in immigrant communities versus everywhere else, I think it is important to keep in mind what the scientific research says.

678
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:02,039
Thank you.

679
00:54:04,259 --> 00:54:04,900
Thank you, Councillor.

680
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,160
I'm going to let Jessica Taddeo

681
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:11,539
Hello, everyone.

682
00:54:11,899 --> 00:54:13,980
Jessica Taddeo, 50 Feldsview Ave.

683
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:14,661
in Medford.

684
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:25,825
I first and foremost want to thank Councillor Lemming for bringing those statistics forward because this was actually something I would like to mention.

685
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,646
I wasn't planning on speaking.

686
00:54:27,826 --> 00:54:34,129
I actually didn't join the meeting until a bit after it started, but I have been on long enough to

687
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:41,892
be appalled by some of the comments that I'm hearing and if you hear my voice shaking a little bit it's because I am really emotional.

688
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:56,940
I grew up in Medford and I went off to college in Rhode Island telling everyone how grateful I was to receive an education where I was sympathetic towards people's backgrounds and lived experiences and had a great

689
00:54:58,081 --> 00:55:01,104
experience being in such a diverse community.

690
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:12,453
And I am so saddened hearing the way that some of my neighbors are talking about people who are coming to this country for the same reasons that their relatives did.

691
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:15,475
I work in my mother's school.

692
00:55:15,535 --> 00:55:16,256
She works in Lynn.

693
00:55:16,276 --> 00:55:18,178
It's a majority-minority school district.

694
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:19,879
A lot of the kids don't even speak English.

695
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:20,760
And

696
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:32,846
I'm just now thinking about how some of these families staying in these temporary homes could go to the Mississaugas or the Roberts and have their first experience in a classroom and have a really positive one.

697
00:55:32,866 --> 00:55:42,710
And that experience wouldn't be afforded to them if the federal government, the state of Massachusetts didn't set up or at least develop an infrastructure for housing migrants.

698
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:44,411
I don't think it's fair.

699
00:55:45,832 --> 00:55:53,538
for people to sit here and, you know, discuss the nitty-gritty logistics of whether or not the apartments are going to be furnished.

700
00:55:53,658 --> 00:56:05,569
Like, these families deserve a roof over their head, and if Medford can play a part in making sure that can happen, then we should all, we should all without a doubt be in support of that.

701
00:56:06,673 --> 00:56:18,896
When I hear talk of crime and safety and disease, and those words are being used in the context of talking about immigrants from non-white countries, that's not just a racist dog whistle.

702
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:28,598
That is something that makes me uncomfortable, knowing that somebody in my neighborhood feels that way about someone who just wants to come here for a better life.

703
00:56:29,138 --> 00:56:32,959
And so, like I said, if Medford can play any part in making that happen,

704
00:56:33,797 --> 00:56:42,563
whether or not they communicated the initiative poorly or not, I think we have a moral obligation to these families who want to come to Medford.

705
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:49,347
If we can provide them a roof over their head and a place to learn and a place to be happy, then who are we to say no to that?

706
00:56:49,508 --> 00:56:55,231
So I just encourage members of the community to be really mindful about how they're talking about this issue.

707
00:56:56,472 --> 00:57:02,096
And I encourage them to do a little more reading about the actual statistics of trafficking, drugs,

708
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:13,838
And all of the rhetoric, the way that we talk about migrants, like, please, I encourage you to look at multiple news sources because some of the facts that I'm hearing are nothing but falsities.

709
00:57:15,819 --> 00:57:18,502
And so just that's all I have to say.

710
00:57:19,943 --> 00:57:20,844
And thank you for your time.

711
00:57:23,496 --> 00:57:28,680
Thank you, Mr. President.

712
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,822
I think that again, I think we're missing the point here.

713
00:57:31,842 --> 00:57:34,624
I think that what the biggest concern is communication.

714
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:39,867
I think the biggest concern and what people are saying are valid valid points.

715
00:57:40,968 --> 00:57:42,769
If it's offensive, I can understand that too.

716
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:44,971
I can understand how some people might feel that way.

717
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:48,994
But they're legitimately valid points when you're talking about, you know,

718
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:52,774
Are we communicating enough?

719
00:57:52,834 --> 00:58:01,635
Is it transparent enough to understand that if we're allowing this to happen, are we giving the support to help these families thrive?

720
00:58:02,536 --> 00:58:05,316
So I think some of these questions like, are they being vaccinated?

721
00:58:05,696 --> 00:58:13,618
That's not just for protection for the people that are in our community, but for the people that are gonna be in the same area with them.

722
00:58:15,017 --> 00:58:23,287
So it is a legitimate question that when I reached out to different communities like Cambridge, like Revere, these are the same questions.

723
00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:29,796
Again, I don't want to cloud this as being something that was really racist or this should be failed, it's not.

724
00:58:31,696 --> 00:58:33,118
I'm a first-generation American.

725
00:58:33,178 --> 00:58:35,641
My father and mother came through Ellis Island.

726
00:58:35,781 --> 00:58:37,223
I understand the situation.

727
00:58:38,304 --> 00:58:43,169
I work with kids that are from Lynn, same type of children.

728
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:46,053
And I understand what they go through every day.

729
00:58:46,553 --> 00:58:48,636
And I feel their pain and I work for them every day.

730
00:58:48,956 --> 00:58:50,798
But at the same time, with this situation,

731
00:58:51,579 --> 00:58:53,842
Let's not muddy the water and understand something very simple.

732
00:58:54,323 --> 00:59:08,681
This is just about communication, making sure that not only our citizens have the answers they want to be protected, but also let's not forget the people that are coming into these houses and understand to make sure that we're doing the right thing for them.

733
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,240
So I think it goes both ways.

734
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,441
I don't think it's just this shouldn't be pitted again.

735
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:16,022
Like I said earlier, this isn't something that one against the other.

736
00:59:16,342 --> 00:59:22,003
This is something that we need more information to be distributed to all parties.

737
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:29,625
To make sure that we're making sure we're taking care of not only the visitors that are here, but also the residents that are here.

738
00:59:30,356 --> 00:59:42,499
And I think that like, from what I heard from the most part, from the phone calls, the emails, and people that are coming to this podium, it's really not understanding why they're not being heard or why the messages are being sent.

739
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,519
So I thank Representative Donato for being here.

740
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:55,722
I understand the mayor has sent multiple messages about not truly knowing or getting the answers that they need, but that's why having that meeting with them.

741
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:56,562
Is it a done deal?

742
00:59:57,699 --> 01:00:01,061
I've heard it was to and then I heard it wasn't because nothing signed yet.

743
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:11,466
But again, the council bear said this is an issue that it's coming directly from a landlord and the state.

744
01:00:12,787 --> 01:00:12,907
And

745
01:00:14,005 --> 01:00:22,526
What we're hearing is our political leaders don't have the power to get that information out that we need yet.

746
01:00:23,407 --> 01:00:36,649
So like I said, I'm hoping that with getting this meeting out and all the parties are understanding, because I'm sure Representative Donato is going to go back to the state level and they're going to hear what Medford's saying and forward against it.

747
01:00:36,709 --> 01:00:41,310
And I think that we need to have that meeting that really answers these big questions.

748
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:42,650
And again, it's not just,

749
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:48,234
you know, for the last caller, it's the last person on zoom, it's, it's not just to protect our citizens.

750
01:00:48,254 --> 01:00:54,118
The truth of the matter is, it's really protecting those young, especially the children that are in that in that location.

751
01:00:54,699 --> 01:00:56,280
Because no one's giving them any answers.

752
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:07,649
And listen, for someone that's worked in this field, and worked with this demographic for the last 1520 years, 30 years, I understand how difficult it is for these families, and what they're going to be going through.

753
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:15,496
But I would hate to say that we're rushing this process through just to say we house them.

754
01:01:16,437 --> 01:01:19,280
That doesn't do people any good either.

755
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,503
We have to make sure we're protecting their safeties as well.

756
01:01:22,563 --> 01:01:23,945
So thank you, Mr. President.

757
01:01:25,466 --> 01:01:26,467
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

758
01:01:26,487 --> 01:01:28,049
I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

759
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:32,013
Eileen, name and address for the record, please.

760
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:39,704
My name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford, Mass.

761
01:01:40,645 --> 01:01:51,474
And I just would like to say that I really appreciated both Councilor Scarpelli's remarks and Jessica Taddeo's remarks as well.

762
01:01:53,215 --> 01:01:58,079
I agree with Councilor Scarpelli that information is essential.

763
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:13,760
And I think it's possible that a lot of details are just being worked out now in the state and that, you know, when they make a final decision, then then possibly we'll get to know.

764
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:18,123
But, you know, I think, Councillor Scarpella, you can't.

765
01:02:19,344 --> 01:02:21,545
You're overlooking some of the

766
01:02:23,945 --> 01:02:30,615
some of the fear and animosity and stereotyping that we have heard tonight.

767
01:02:30,635 --> 01:02:34,440
And it just goes against all the

768
01:02:35,831 --> 01:02:40,456
statements about how welcoming a city that Medford is.

769
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,480
And it's just so uncharitable.

770
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:51,126
You know, I taught English to immigrants for about 20 years.

771
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:56,151
About half of our population, these were adults, were undocumented.

772
01:02:57,032 --> 01:03:00,094
And their stories were heart-rending.

773
01:03:00,115 --> 01:03:07,220
And very few people understand what these people have gone through.

774
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,703
You do, Councillor Scarpelli, and I appreciate that.

775
01:03:11,343 --> 01:03:22,131
And I wish you would communicate to your constituency a little bit more of what you understand, because it really is upsetting listening to

776
01:03:24,178 --> 01:03:27,302
you know, propaganda from the right wing.

777
01:03:29,704 --> 01:03:33,849
And, you know, this is primarily a Christian city.

778
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:37,313
What about the Good Samaritan and all that, you know?

779
01:03:37,593 --> 01:03:39,235
Don't you want to help people?

780
01:03:39,695 --> 01:03:43,760
And yeah, we have to make sure they get the healthcare they need because yeah,

781
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:46,182
They're going to be among us.

782
01:03:46,742 --> 01:03:49,643
And we don't want to get any kind of diseases.

783
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,504
So that means we have to take care of them.

784
01:03:53,265 --> 01:03:58,367
God has placed them here in our community, whether we like it or not.

785
01:03:58,527 --> 01:04:00,088
And we need to take care of them.

786
01:04:00,968 --> 01:04:01,448
Thank you.

787
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:04,510
Thank you, Eileen.

788
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:08,952
Is there anyone else who hasn't spoken yet who would like to speak?

789
01:04:11,687 --> 01:04:13,691
All right, and I saw a couple people who had already spoken.

790
01:04:13,752 --> 01:04:15,716
I'll go, Mr. Merritt, if we could, you know.

791
01:04:15,876 --> 01:04:16,437
I'll keep it short.

792
01:04:16,457 --> 01:04:19,003
Yeah, I don't think we're going to solve federal immigration policy tonight.

793
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:21,007
No, but I did want to address.

794
01:04:22,324 --> 01:04:24,766
something that Councilor Lemming had mentioned.

795
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:28,950
I appreciate statistics, I'm a scientist also, okay?

796
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:31,893
So definitely some mind meld there.

797
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:38,499
That said, my particular home is probably the outlier.

798
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:40,580
And again, this is directly across the street.

799
01:04:40,641 --> 01:04:41,782
So this is where I'm coming from.

800
01:04:42,362 --> 01:04:48,588
When my wife was pregnant with my oldest child, just a few years ago, we had someone break into our house

801
01:04:50,404 --> 01:04:50,644
Right?

802
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:51,946
Not okay.

803
01:04:52,146 --> 01:04:57,912
And the only thing that saved her from getting hurt was me putting a door in front of that person.

804
01:04:58,273 --> 01:04:59,434
Medford PD was great.

805
01:04:59,454 --> 01:05:02,798
They came over the detectives, you know, did their thing, right?

806
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:04,720
I scared the person away.

807
01:05:05,581 --> 01:05:07,443
And they eventually caught up with them down the street.

808
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:11,207
Okay, that's a terrible thing to happen to anybody.

809
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:14,026
This is where I'm coming from.

810
01:05:14,246 --> 01:05:20,652
Not only that, during that incident, I found out from Medford PD that, oh, yeah, we arrested someone under your porch a couple years ago.

811
01:05:22,273 --> 01:05:22,553
Really?

812
01:05:22,573 --> 01:05:30,860
When the officers are familiar with my backyard, because they've had to come in and find people, I think it was shoplifters or something like that.

813
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:32,302
This isn't about race.

814
01:05:33,939 --> 01:05:37,561
My concerns are literally because number one, there's crime in my neighborhood.

815
01:05:37,622 --> 01:05:38,422
It's a real thing.

816
01:05:38,822 --> 01:05:45,567
The businesses that are there actually are concerned about, like there's a lot of mechanic shops and so on and so forth, right?

817
01:05:46,027 --> 01:05:51,711
Vehicles, I'm sure you've heard like a legitimate thing where people were cutting off Cadillac converters for cars.

818
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:55,093
I mean, there's real things that are happening in this city.

819
01:05:56,414 --> 01:05:58,196
So I'd love to hear from the police chief

820
01:05:59,281 --> 01:06:03,986
right, what the actual crime is by zone to help give you some real data to work from.

821
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:07,689
But I'm going off my personal experience.

822
01:06:07,709 --> 01:06:12,114
So now there were two, two crimes committed, literally in my house.

823
01:06:15,477 --> 01:06:19,421
Right, like I said, Wegmans has a police officer for a reason, not because they want to go spend money.

824
01:06:21,821 --> 01:06:25,922
And, you know, like I said, it's great when the police can show up at your house.

825
01:06:25,962 --> 01:06:28,182
But at the same time, what happens if it's one of my kids?

826
01:06:28,302 --> 01:06:29,022
Who am I blaming?

827
01:06:29,283 --> 01:06:30,123
Who am I suing?

828
01:06:30,143 --> 01:06:31,463
Right?

829
01:06:31,563 --> 01:06:33,763
If we don't protect our people here first.

830
01:06:36,104 --> 01:06:37,164
So that's where I'm coming from.

831
01:06:37,204 --> 01:06:41,085
It's I don't care what your race or any of that is.

832
01:06:41,305 --> 01:06:41,885
I really don't.

833
01:06:42,205 --> 01:06:51,447
But I also know when you have like the Occupy Wall Street, when you've had a lot of clusters of people in places that aren't homes, they're not built for homes, bad things can happen to everybody.

834
01:06:54,073 --> 01:06:55,194
So I'm a concerned dad.

835
01:06:56,735 --> 01:07:04,881
I'm okay to say that, but I'd rather not have statistics thrown in my face and say, oh, you know, you're just a, you know, you're just a right wing nut job.

836
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:05,581
No, I'm not.

837
01:07:06,502 --> 01:07:10,205
I'm a concerned dad where already bad things have happened in my neighborhood.

838
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:11,966
That's my concern.

839
01:07:14,788 --> 01:07:15,609
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

840
01:07:16,129 --> 01:07:18,571
I mean, I just wanna say, I think we can also appreciate

841
01:07:19,923 --> 01:07:22,224
There's outliers, and then there's statistical averages.

842
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:24,346
And outliers aren't part of statistical averages.

843
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:26,207
And we're individual people.

844
01:07:26,928 --> 01:07:32,771
But on average, if we're talking about crime in the city, crime is down massively in the last 25 years in this community.

845
01:07:32,811 --> 01:07:35,793
And that's what the statistics that the police chief provides to us annually show.

846
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:38,395
It doesn't mean that crime doesn't happen.

847
01:07:38,415 --> 01:07:40,416
It just means that the number of crimes is down.

848
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:46,200
And on average, it's a much safer community than it was even maybe 10 years ago when someone was under your porch.

849
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:49,907
five years ago.

850
01:07:50,827 --> 01:07:52,669
I'm going to go to Lorna Wilkerson.

851
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:53,430
Ms.

852
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:59,476
Wilkerson, you've already spoken once, so if you could try to keep the comments short and direct, and then we will move on the question as amended.

853
01:08:13,683 --> 01:08:14,524
Just a quick question.

854
01:08:15,084 --> 01:08:17,006
This is a private homeowner.

855
01:08:17,586 --> 01:08:25,532
Is this private homeowner benefiting from tax from the citizens of this city?

856
01:08:25,932 --> 01:08:26,793
Just a quick question.

857
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:29,255
This is a private homeowner.

858
01:08:30,075 --> 01:08:37,941
Our understanding is that the state is signing a contract with this private property owner to rent the property for the purposes that the state would like to rent it for.

859
01:08:37,961 --> 01:08:41,504
The property owner pays taxes to the city.

860
01:08:44,602 --> 01:08:54,225
So this individual is going to be able to make a decision that's going to affect the entire citizenry of this town?

861
01:08:55,445 --> 01:08:58,246
That is how private property owners have that right, yes.

862
01:09:00,426 --> 01:09:02,867
And the City Council is okay with this?

863
01:09:04,228 --> 01:09:10,949
City Council cannot violate the Constitution and take private property without due process, and I don't think we want an eminent domain in this building.

864
01:09:10,969 --> 01:09:12,730
I don't think we have the money to do so.

865
01:09:13,812 --> 01:09:15,033
Oh, no, it's quite the opposite.

866
01:09:15,393 --> 01:09:17,114
I'm not asking about eminent domain.

867
01:09:17,594 --> 01:09:22,857
I'm concerned that this citizen can affect 56,000 other people.

868
01:09:23,598 --> 01:09:39,086
And in turn, as had been discussed before, that the state could take the property from the members of this town if they can't fit enough people who are immigrants into appropriate shelters.

869
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:41,548
Thank you.

870
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:54,700
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, as amended by Councillor Scarpelli, to request a robocall to the neighbourhood once the date and time and location of the public meeting is scheduled.

871
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,421
Is there any further comment?

872
01:09:58,902 --> 01:10:00,603
Is there a second on the amended motion?

873
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:02,663
Seconded by Councillor Callaghan.

874
01:10:02,683 --> 01:10:03,364
All those in favour?

875
01:10:04,044 --> 01:10:04,404
Opposed?

876
01:10:04,464 --> 01:10:05,305
Motion passes.

877
01:10:08,366 --> 01:10:10,307
We do have the election report.

878
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:13,008
I know this went a little—could we maybe take that?

879
01:10:14,431 --> 01:10:18,394
Motion to suspend the rules and take 23474.

880
01:10:19,735 --> 01:10:24,198
Motion by Councillor Collins to suspend the rules to take paper 23-474, seconded by Councillor Sang.

881
01:10:24,218 --> 01:10:24,818
All those in favour?

882
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:25,258
Aye.

883
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:25,959
Opposed?

884
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:26,779
Motion passes.

885
01:10:30,754 --> 01:10:51,360
2023 Municipal Election Process Errors and Accountability Report, and I believe the longer motion I don't have in front of me right now, but this was requesting both a written report and that the Elections Manager and Elections Commission join us at this meeting to discuss the 2023 election, what issues and errors were identified, and what process improvements will be made going forward to address them.

886
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:55,341
And I will turn this over to Manager Ripley, Elections Manager Ripley.

887
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,360
Good evening.

888
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:05,023
Thank you for inviting me before you to discuss the election of 2022.

889
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:12,967
I submitted to you the after action report that was presented in the agenda packet last week.

890
01:11:13,487 --> 01:11:20,251
I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about the after action report and any other questions you might have about pertaining to the election.

891
01:11:25,253 --> 01:11:28,215
Any questions or comments from members of the council regarding the after action report?

892
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:31,114
Councillor Scarpelli.

893
01:11:36,196 --> 01:11:37,557
Thank you for being here tonight.

894
01:11:37,657 --> 01:11:44,141
I know it took some time, but this is obviously a very bothersome situation.

895
01:11:44,641 --> 01:11:51,965
The way the process was handled in many different levels was very alarming to us.

896
01:11:53,476 --> 01:12:02,199
Like the lack of communication was alarming to us, but I see some of the protocol in place that I'm reading.

897
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:20,825
I find it a little alarming where the biggest thing as we went through this process and how difficult it was and the concerning issues that we saw, probably the biggest thing that affected me personally is how many people

898
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:27,832
mentioned to me long time voters said they would never ever vote.

899
01:12:28,706 --> 01:12:42,111
in a local election again, by the way, the optics looks now, there was nothing wrong, I guess that everything came out that you did the refill, there was a recall or recount for for numbers, everything.

900
01:12:43,132 --> 01:12:44,612
It wouldn't nothing would change.

901
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:47,653
It wasn't this this conspiracy theory that was out there.

902
01:12:48,334 --> 01:12:53,996
But what I do know is what I saw firsthand and what I heard firsthand election day.

903
01:12:55,056 --> 01:12:56,557
And what I do want to make sure that

904
01:12:57,262 --> 01:13:11,567
we do moving forward is making sure that people that are involved in the election process, whether it be your office, our commissioners, whether it's our poll workers, or whether it's people that are working the polls, and that's where I'm going to come from.

905
01:13:12,747 --> 01:13:15,168
You have people that exercise their rights

906
01:13:16,263 --> 01:13:29,051
to go and work polls, and I'm reading the criteria, and I've been doing this since I was a little kid, neighboring communities, and understand that this is a process that's legally in place.

907
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:38,377
And there's something even here that says that what people don't understand, what I'm speaking is poll workers, people that don't know that are watching.

908
01:13:39,997 --> 01:13:54,906
candidates have an opportunity to build a team to make sure they're working their team to most efficient process to make sure they get their voters out on election day.

909
01:13:55,626 --> 01:14:05,352
So people work very hard to set up these teams that at each polling location, they had what's called the poll watcher.

910
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:09,435
And a poll watcher would sit in an approved area by law,

911
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:17,315
they would, I know that it said that they're not to provide a chair or table, we understand that.

912
01:14:18,076 --> 01:14:20,898
We have here that this is the process.

913
01:14:21,438 --> 01:14:24,920
This is where we wanna help people feel comfortable and understand the process.

914
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:31,044
And there's this part here that says they're not to sit down, even if they bring their own chairs.

915
01:14:33,066 --> 01:14:34,927
That's something I would question.

916
01:14:36,049 --> 01:14:41,450
Okay, I think that's terrible for the fact that it's exactly why we're here tonight for these little things.

917
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:48,192
The understanding of educating our workers, the process of the new pads.

918
01:14:49,092 --> 01:14:57,394
Now, what we trained, because I was part of one of these teams, they were trained, the poll workers were trained to understand this.

919
01:14:58,454 --> 01:15:03,896
As a person comes in, they're asked for their ID or not.

920
01:15:04,895 --> 01:15:08,077
They were then asked for their name and address.

921
01:15:09,197 --> 01:15:12,659
Then they would say their name and they would repeat back their name and address.

922
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:22,725
What we saw firsthand though, because I was there, what I saw was it would say, they would show their ID and then they'd go right through.

923
01:15:22,765 --> 01:15:24,306
It wasn't repeated in some cases.

924
01:15:24,826 --> 01:15:30,189
In some other cases, their names were given but they weren't repeated back.

925
01:15:31,263 --> 01:15:34,085
So the whole format was a mess.

926
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:41,690
The way that poll workers that volunteered to come out, the way they were treated was horrible.

927
01:15:42,853 --> 01:15:55,521
So as we're moving forward to this process, now, whatever the process is, if it's just putting out the markers, where to stand on election day, because we didn't do that this year.

928
01:15:55,581 --> 01:15:55,741
Why?

929
01:15:55,761 --> 01:15:57,142
I don't know, but we didn't do that.

930
01:15:57,402 --> 01:16:00,604
So we had people at different locations moving anywhere they wanted.

931
01:16:01,525 --> 01:16:06,969
And you had some areas with some aggressive poll managers that are coming out.

932
01:16:07,169 --> 01:16:10,611
I forgot what we call them, but, and then we had other areas that we didn't have it.

933
01:16:10,631 --> 01:16:11,672
So it was inconsistencies.

934
01:16:12,495 --> 01:16:31,665
So the process in total, I'm reading this, and I'll be honest with you, I'm not truly satisfied because when some of these issues occurred with the ballots and who got what ballots and the misprinting of the ballots, we as a council found it to be a problem.

935
01:16:31,705 --> 01:16:34,867
We said, quote unquote, that perception is reality.

936
01:16:36,055 --> 01:16:44,698
And if we need to do anything, please, let's work as a team to figure out a way, whether it's approving money, whether it's hiring people, whether it's getting people educated, we didn't do that.

937
01:16:44,738 --> 01:16:45,819
Instead, we just ran with it.

938
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:48,460
And it was exactly what we were afraid of.

939
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,421
It was a mess.

940
01:16:51,502 --> 01:16:52,623
It was completely a mess.

941
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:58,326
Then the process moves forward with people getting ballots that they shouldn't have.

942
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:00,147
Then we have, we've corrected that.

943
01:17:00,207 --> 01:17:04,090
Then there was some ballots that, you know, that had the wrong dates and we corrected that.

944
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:11,755
And then, then we go to the election day and there were multiple issues with people not understanding the process and how people were treated.

945
01:17:12,635 --> 01:17:20,420
Then you move after the election process and understanding that there were legal documents that were sent out saying, for instance,

946
01:17:22,793 --> 01:17:28,215
The mail-in ballots will be tabulated here at City Hall and posted at eight o'clock at City Hall.

947
01:17:29,376 --> 01:17:30,096
That was never done.

948
01:17:31,136 --> 01:17:32,277
Questions that people have asked.

949
01:17:32,637 --> 01:17:38,919
We talked about when it stopped, polling stops at eight, the voting stops at eight, and 8.30 things will be posted.

950
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:45,282
Well, we didn't get posts, we didn't realize the final numbers until one o'clock in the morning.

951
01:17:46,175 --> 01:17:48,318
So these are all legitimate issues.

952
01:17:48,358 --> 01:17:53,865
And I read through this report, and it sounds great, but I think it needs more substance.

953
01:17:53,985 --> 01:18:04,317
I think it needs more, I think the biggest part right now, especially when we talk about the election day, is the education and the fact that the poll workers

954
01:18:05,638 --> 01:18:06,318
are valued.

955
01:18:07,319 --> 01:18:17,943
And if we have to find that if value is by by expense, for those important dates, then we should find whatever we need to make sure financially they're valued.

956
01:18:17,963 --> 01:18:27,728
So we get more people interested in this council talk about, you know, what we're going to talk about in a minute about a rate pay raise for school committee and saying we'll get better candidates if we pay.

957
01:18:28,848 --> 01:18:36,772
But let's find a way to make sure that we're putting everything in place so the March elections, we don't have the issues we have.

958
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:46,577
Because like I said, I hate the fact that we had to feed into the narrative of what we saw.

959
01:18:46,857 --> 01:18:49,898
And some of these issues are concerning to me.

960
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:54,200
I still, I don't like the fact, this is part of the election process.

961
01:18:54,701 --> 01:18:57,322
And poll watchers, and I know for sure,

962
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:10,583
because I'm married to one of them, that some of these people are angels, and the way they were treated, and the way that when we were then presented to explain to them the laws of Massachusetts.

963
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:17,416
that we had and then being treated the way they were was appalling to me.

964
01:19:17,976 --> 01:19:34,941
And what we did was not only did we let questions and let perception become reality, the biggest concern I had right now was we lost good people that dedicated their voting rights to this community every time we had.

965
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:37,202
And we have to find a way as a team

966
01:19:38,254 --> 01:19:38,554
to do is to.

967
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:49,665
Commission your office in this council, the mayor's office to make people feel confident that they should come out to vote that their vote does count that if they're part of the process of a

968
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:59,792
they're given every right that they're supposed to be given to the law.

969
01:20:00,152 --> 01:20:04,413
And at the same time, educate the people so they understand the process.

970
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:13,034
So again, I hate to be harsh because I tell you what, when I say love, I love some of your commissioners.

971
01:20:13,734 --> 01:20:15,175
I go way back with the commission.

972
01:20:15,195 --> 01:20:16,495
There's no way to blame here.

973
01:20:17,015 --> 01:20:22,296
But I think my frustration came, especially right after the election, was the lack of communication.

974
01:20:23,274 --> 01:20:24,477
and the lack of understanding.

975
01:20:24,538 --> 01:20:27,225
And so, you know, here we are, January.

976
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:36,828
the 20th and we're talking about the report that was passed in and I think that this is a good start.

977
01:20:37,148 --> 01:20:54,775
But for this councilor, I would recommend that we start a subcommittee, Mr. President, with this process that we meet with both commissioners and the elections office to make sure that this council is working, working step by step to make sure you're getting everything you need.

978
01:20:55,575 --> 01:20:57,976
So we don't have the lack of

979
01:20:58,996 --> 01:21:01,557
the lack of employees downstairs.

980
01:21:01,817 --> 01:21:02,977
We saw it firsthand.

981
01:21:03,017 --> 01:21:03,838
We know it's not easy.

982
01:21:04,558 --> 01:21:08,159
We know that it's a it's an undermanned process.

983
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:15,542
But we're saying if this is the council, we our our strength is making sure that we vote on a budget.

984
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:32,017
And we're working hand in hand with the commission and the elections office that we're working through this all the way through the budget season to make sure that we're staffing a staff that's gonna give it the respect it deserves moving forward.

985
01:21:32,037 --> 01:21:35,138
Because I think this was, there were a lot of concerning issues.

986
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:44,380
And again, it's someone that's built up a lot of sadness and anger for the simple fact that

987
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:54,706
people that were there, people that dedicated themselves to the election process, and people that just came out to vote have now found themselves not wanting to do that anymore.

988
01:21:54,746 --> 01:21:57,927
And to me, that is a disgrace and it's sad.

989
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,148
So thank you.

990
01:22:00,109 --> 01:22:09,914
Chancellor Schrapp, I think you, just to clarify, you wanted a motion that we, me and the Governance Committee, we continue to continue to review the

991
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:17,416
updates and reforms listed in this report and check in on them in advance of the March election and afterwards.

992
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,998
Yeah.

993
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:24,939
Meet with the Elections Commission.

994
01:22:44,684 --> 01:22:45,365
It's the commission's fault.

995
01:22:45,425 --> 01:22:47,787
It's the election, the election department's fault.

996
01:22:48,227 --> 01:22:52,471
This is something that if we really want ownership of this, we all have to have ownership in this.

997
01:22:52,511 --> 01:22:57,716
And I think that, you know, we don't, I take blame in it myself because, you know, we let that happen.

998
01:22:58,217 --> 01:23:00,118
We let that office go down to one person.

999
01:23:02,688 --> 01:23:08,613
We saw the mistakes, so is that okay, Mr. President?

1000
01:23:08,653 --> 01:23:18,001
Yeah, I got emotional and governance committee meet with commission and staff to check in and make sure that their needs are met relative to the, yep, got it.

1001
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:23,486
Okay, Councilor Callahan, Councilor Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan.

1002
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:24,978
Thank you.

1003
01:23:25,158 --> 01:23:36,864
So, when I was reading this after action report, I assumed that it would include some explanation of the things that had gone wrong, and why they had gone wrong.

1004
01:23:37,744 --> 01:23:43,407
And I, I just don't see anything like that in here I see a lot of things like, you know, I mean,

1005
01:23:44,082 --> 01:23:52,810
As Councillor Scarpelli said, we often have these results by 9pm, and yet we didn't have the results until 1 o'clock in the morning.

1006
01:23:53,371 --> 01:23:58,776
And rather than any sort of explanation of why that happened, it says all ballots must be counted on election day.

1007
01:23:59,482 --> 01:24:03,646
The tabulation facility will post the tabulated tapes in the same method as the individual precincts.

1008
01:24:03,766 --> 01:24:08,710
Unofficial results will be released once, like there is nothing in here that explains what happened.

1009
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:13,454
So my first question is perhaps I misunderstood what this report was supposed to be.

1010
01:24:13,895 --> 01:24:15,836
So I'd like to ask what the report was supposed to be.

1011
01:24:17,258 --> 01:24:24,624
And I think it would be incredibly helpful to have some sort of understanding of what it was that actually went wrong because I don't see that in here at all.

1012
01:24:27,034 --> 01:24:28,875
I will look for the original motion language.

1013
01:24:28,895 --> 01:24:33,238
If you have anything else you want to say, I can go to Vice President Collins and get back to you with the Vice President Collins.

1014
01:24:34,939 --> 01:24:35,780
Thank you, President Pierce.

1015
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,802
Manager Ripley, commissioners, thank you so much for being here today.

1016
01:24:38,822 --> 01:24:42,624
I appreciate the diligence and effort gone into the after action report.

1017
01:24:43,165 --> 01:24:51,010
I appreciate my fellow councilors' comments on this so far, and I think that my initial observations from the report follow the same trends.

1018
01:24:52,813 --> 01:24:57,214
really appreciate that this is kind of a comprehensive overview of the beginning to end of the process.

1019
01:24:58,235 --> 01:25:10,238
But I agree, I think that, you know, for myself as one counselor, I was hoping for kind of that diagnosis of, you know, these issues that we raised before the election, on election day, after the election.

1020
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:12,979
You know, I think that

1021
01:25:14,386 --> 01:25:19,107
Everybody can relate to, you know, when you're looking at something that didn't go the way that you wanted it to.

1022
01:25:19,888 --> 01:25:23,489
You have to start out, okay, what exactly, what were we shooting for?

1023
01:25:24,349 --> 01:25:25,109
Didn't quite happen.

1024
01:25:25,569 --> 01:25:26,450
You need to know the why.

1025
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:27,470
We need to know the why.

1026
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,930
None of this is personal.

1027
01:25:30,271 --> 01:25:34,532
But as counselors, as electeds, as representatives, as a community,

1028
01:25:35,272 --> 01:25:56,318
if we're going to have faith that our three very consequential elections this year, which are going to see much higher turnout probably than the one in November did, if we can trust and tell the community to trust that those are going to go as well as we know that we can, we need to know exactly why, exactly what we're going to do differently than what we did in November in the lead up to it.

1029
01:25:56,398 --> 01:26:01,540
So, you know, for example, you know, I appreciate

1030
01:26:02,881 --> 01:26:06,004
For example, under election preparation, you're noting every part of that process.

1031
01:26:07,765 --> 01:26:17,032
You mentioned at this point in time, we have destroyed all old supplies from the state, talking about the information sheet that was sent in and mail-in ballots that referenced an election in 2022.

1032
01:26:17,532 --> 01:26:18,033
That's great.

1033
01:26:18,393 --> 01:26:19,774
For example, I would love to see

1034
01:26:20,498 --> 01:26:34,651
or maybe talk about in subcommittee, if that's a more reasonable timeline for this, what is our policy for when old elections materials are destroyed or removed from the office so that we know they will never be put in a ballot for which they're irrelevant, that kind of procedure.

1035
01:26:39,448 --> 01:26:53,142
You know, similarly, I know one of the issues that I was hearing the most about on election day was the interfacing of wardens and voters at the polls around things like voter guides or how people were checked in.

1036
01:26:55,044 --> 01:27:00,349
Totally heard that most of the wardens did a fine job, you know, did the role that they were hired to perform.

1037
01:27:03,831 --> 01:27:14,136
You know, this is one of the areas of the city where we really have to strive for perfection because voting rights are inalienable and we have to

1038
01:27:15,706 --> 01:27:23,151
It's just essential that everybody has the full accessibility to their vote and everything that comes along with that.

1039
01:27:23,231 --> 01:27:34,017
So this is why this has been a project for us to deliberate on this and meet on this and want to go over this to make sure that we're all entering into a resilient election year together.

1040
01:27:35,638 --> 01:27:46,329
And I think that the interfacing between the poll workers and those going to the polls, that is an issue where we have to, again, we have to strive for perfection every single time because it's a voter enfranchisement issue.

1041
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:47,289
It's a confidence issue.

1042
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:55,132
I know on the issue of staffing, that's one that we brought up when we raised this paper to begin with.

1043
01:27:56,793 --> 01:27:59,655
And among our questions and directives, it's not just for this report.

1044
01:27:59,695 --> 01:28:02,096
And again, I really thank you for the detail you've put into this.

1045
01:28:03,137 --> 01:28:07,820
We also had a motion to the administration to say, clearly there's a staffing need.

1046
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:10,001
There's a demonstrated, there's an articulated staffing need.

1047
01:28:10,321 --> 01:28:12,783
We wanna know how we can help expedite that.

1048
01:28:12,843 --> 01:28:15,624
I think this council is pretty young.

1049
01:28:15,704 --> 01:28:17,926
The previous council was unified in saying,

1050
01:28:19,056 --> 01:28:21,600
the election department needs staff, let's get it staffed up.

1051
01:28:23,604 --> 01:28:25,867
But if we need to dial down on that to get specific on

1052
01:28:27,318 --> 01:28:32,822
here's exactly what we need in the next budget cycle for a fully staffed elections department.

1053
01:28:32,862 --> 01:28:34,083
Let's have those conversations.

1054
01:28:34,504 --> 01:28:41,229
If we need to get specific about here's how many wardens and poll workers that we had for the November, 2023 election.

1055
01:28:41,569 --> 01:28:45,592
And it was a little thin and we know that turnout is going to be different.

1056
01:28:45,712 --> 01:28:47,053
So here's what we need to shoot for.

1057
01:28:47,093 --> 01:28:52,638
And let's talk about and communicate and make public the plan for getting to that number as close as we can to it.

1058
01:28:53,498 --> 01:29:05,962
I think that these are conversations that would really behoove us to go over publicly, you know, for our edification and again for that project of reestablishing some of the confidence that has been lost.

1059
01:29:07,803 --> 01:29:15,485
And ideally, hopefully to, you know, add to the efforts of advertising the poll worker positions.

1060
01:29:19,284 --> 01:29:25,332
I appreciate Councillor Scarpelli's motion to continue this conversation in a subcommittee of the government's committee.

1061
01:29:25,352 --> 01:29:33,683
I think that that will really help us to flesh out some of the additional detail and specific next steps that we'd like to see beyond this report.

1062
01:29:33,863 --> 01:29:37,448
And again, I thank you for your time and for all your hard work all year round.

1063
01:29:39,284 --> 01:29:39,705
Thank you.

1064
01:29:39,725 --> 01:29:40,165
Thank you.

1065
01:29:40,185 --> 01:29:40,726
Thank you.

1066
01:29:40,766 --> 01:29:41,306
Thank you.

1067
01:29:41,326 --> 01:29:41,707
Thank you.

1068
01:29:41,727 --> 01:29:41,947
Thank you.

1069
01:29:41,967 --> 01:29:42,147
Thank you.

1070
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:42,407
Thank you.

1071
01:29:42,427 --> 01:29:43,408
Thank you.

1072
01:29:43,428 --> 01:29:43,689
Thank you.

1073
01:29:43,729 --> 01:29:44,229
Thank you.

1074
01:29:44,249 --> 01:29:44,490
Thank you.

1075
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:44,850
Thank you.

1076
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:45,871
Thank you.

1077
01:29:45,891 --> 01:29:46,191
Thank you.

1078
01:29:46,372 --> 01:29:46,732
Thank you.

1079
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:46,952
Thank you.

1080
01:29:46,972 --> 01:29:47,313
Thank you.

1081
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:47,533
Thank you.

1082
01:30:01,547 --> 01:30:27,508
be it further resolved that the report include specific responses to, one, the misprinting of ballots, two, the inaccurate instruction sheets provided to voters with mail ballots, three, trainings that provided incorrect information to poll wardens and workers regarding voters bringing materials to assist them in the voting booth, and four, persistent issues with the counting of ballots in a timely manner and release of the incomplete, unofficial results to the public, be it further resolved that the mayor provide the council with a supplemental appropriation request,

1083
01:30:28,028 --> 01:30:30,711
to restore full-time staffing levels in the Elections Department.

1084
01:30:31,171 --> 01:30:45,063
That was joined with Councillor Scarpelli's paper, be it resolved that the election coordinator report back to the City Council with a detailed report and findings detailing the municipal election, which includes, but is not limited to, absentee ballots, polling rules and regulations, complaints, and malfunctions.

1085
01:30:45,083 --> 01:30:54,510
And then that was amended by Councillor Scarpelli, offering a member requesting that the election manager and election commission come before the Council to explain in detail what happened during the election.

1086
01:30:55,191 --> 01:30:55,852
Thank you for being here.

1087
01:30:56,712 --> 01:31:04,859
Councilor Sang offered an amendment that any report comes out of this that should include reference to the funding problems and full-time staffing issues in the elections office.

1088
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:11,545
And Councilor Schaffer also requested that the council send a letter to the Secretary of State's office asking them to look into the process.

1089
01:31:11,565 --> 01:31:18,571
So that was the original, that was the two motions joined and amended from our November 14th, 2023 council meeting.

1090
01:31:20,492 --> 01:31:21,073
Councilor Sang.

1091
01:31:21,533 --> 01:31:22,714
Thank you, President Behrs.

1092
01:31:24,055 --> 01:31:28,980
I think my thoughts are in line with the councilors who have spoken already.

1093
01:31:30,521 --> 01:31:34,265
I want to first thank you all for putting together this report.

1094
01:31:34,425 --> 01:31:39,310
I know oftentimes we request reports and they kind of go into the ether to have an

1095
01:31:40,811 --> 01:31:41,031
I think, um.

1096
01:31:41,051 --> 01:31:42,832
Pretty thorough report back is helpful.

1097
01:31:43,452 --> 01:31:49,876
Um that being said, you know, there's still some questions that we have that aren't necessarily settled in this report.

1098
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:54,378
It might be better and wiser to, um to meet and subcommittee about it.

1099
01:31:54,778 --> 01:31:56,899
Um that way we can give you all time.

1100
01:31:57,259 --> 01:32:01,781
We can come up with our list of, um of more specific questions that we have.

1101
01:32:09,488 --> 01:32:21,036
I think to restore that confidence, it's helpful to have some document as kind of like a guide for someone who doesn't know how elections are run.

1102
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:34,645
I think reading this part of the gap in terms of what we're perceiving and maybe what the intention was comes from the fact that you all just understand how elections are run.

1103
01:32:34,685 --> 01:32:37,507
And so there are basic underlying

1104
01:32:38,848 --> 01:32:47,732
I think underlying steps, procedures that are just very obvious to the Elections Commission that aren't very obvious to us as residents.

1105
01:32:48,572 --> 01:32:55,736
And so I think we can work together to think through what those questions might be.

1106
01:32:56,696 --> 01:33:01,979
Something in my mind is the question of central tabulation,

1107
01:33:03,337 --> 01:33:17,208
and what seems like a shift from an old system where we used to count at polling booths to now this mixed system where we have some votes, some ballots counted at polling locations, some ballots counted here as a central tab.

1108
01:33:17,648 --> 01:33:28,296
I think further clarification on what determines what's counted where, why have we made that decision versus why have we changed this new system would be helpful.

1109
01:33:29,037 --> 01:33:29,937
I think

1110
01:33:32,349 --> 01:33:42,999
There are outstanding questions I've heard from constituents about even though the numbers ultimately did add up, a lot of these numbers were found on different sheets.

1111
01:33:43,239 --> 01:33:45,561
And so why was that the case?

1112
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:49,285
How can we make sure going forward that the sheets that are published by the city

1113
01:33:50,546 --> 01:33:53,628
the numbers all add up and are final.

1114
01:33:54,829 --> 01:34:07,599
I think some over the last few election cycles, some residents have been a little confused as to why we're giving an update at 9 p.m., let's say, and another update, a final update at 1 a.m.

1115
01:34:07,779 --> 01:34:10,061
instead of doing it in one complete batch.

1116
01:34:10,381 --> 01:34:17,947
I think these are just some of the larger questions that residents might have that you might know the answers to that maybe are

1117
01:34:18,647 --> 01:34:25,111
a bit evidence to you all but not as evident to us and would be helpful to uh to have in a report or to talk about in the South.

1118
01:34:25,131 --> 01:34:28,553
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1119
01:34:28,573 --> 01:34:29,153
Councilor Lemming.

1120
01:34:30,954 --> 01:34:38,658
We appreciate that there's not enough staff working in the elections department and that the folks on the commissions are

1121
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,720
I'm a member of the community.

1122
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,961
I'm largely there as volunteers of the community.

1123
01:34:44,001 --> 01:34:54,903
So that is that is an issue, and I have sympathy for the, uh, lack of capacity to complete the work required for all the elections that you need to manage.

1124
01:34:55,783 --> 01:34:55,943
Um.

1125
01:34:57,203 --> 01:35:02,905
I do sympathize with what Councilor Callahan said about the expectations for the report in order to

1126
01:35:10,009 --> 01:35:18,595
If I were a person that knew nothing about the election and I read this report, I don't think I would be able to recount events and all the issues that happened.

1127
01:35:19,815 --> 01:35:31,123
My idea with what a complete detail-oriented report would be is if I could have that being somebody who knew nothing.

1128
01:35:31,143 --> 01:35:37,427
In order to know everything that happened on the election, you would have to have

1129
01:35:38,527 --> 01:35:51,611
This report, you'd have to have a number of different posts on the Internet, and you'd have to talk to a number of different people to find all the details, notwithstanding things that have already been mentioned by my colleagues here.

1130
01:35:51,631 --> 01:35:51,671
So.

1131
01:35:54,741 --> 01:36:16,310
That is what I was expecting and that is what I would like to see because it's important to know in details all of the issues that you experienced and all of the ways that you are potentially lacking support, which may have caused these issues to come up to begin with so that we can then try to fix them.

1132
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:18,471
So that is...

1133
01:36:21,672 --> 01:36:22,673
That's all I'd like to say.

1134
01:36:23,053 --> 01:36:26,134
Thank you very much for coming out here tonight.

1135
01:36:28,895 --> 01:36:29,635
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1136
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:32,536
Any further comments from Councilors?

1137
01:36:32,756 --> 01:36:33,997
Just one more.

1138
01:36:34,017 --> 01:36:34,337
Thank you.

1139
01:36:34,797 --> 01:36:39,299
I think Councilor Lemming brought something up that I had as a concern.

1140
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:48,002
I think that we have two commission members that have done yeoman's work and gone above and beyond, and we see you two everywhere.

1141
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:49,883
You're everywhere.

1142
01:36:50,632 --> 01:37:04,121
And that brings me to the question that I had that we talked about even during the process with the school committee and looking at commissions and boards that we feel that are that important that we have to look at it in different ways.

1143
01:37:04,381 --> 01:37:10,906
So, one question I brought up was everybody knows who the two of you are.

1144
01:37:12,196 --> 01:37:17,938
But I asked for a report to say, what is the attendance record for the other members on the commission?

1145
01:37:18,378 --> 01:37:32,964
Because I think that's important also, just for the fact that if two people are doing the job that realistically a commission of five or seven, we really need dedicated people that, hey, we heard so many people say this so many issues.

1146
01:37:33,484 --> 01:37:34,985
Well, then put up a shut up.

1147
01:37:36,095 --> 01:37:43,821
And these are the opportunities that we have in our community that come and help the commission and be part of that commission and be part of the commission all in.

1148
01:37:44,722 --> 01:37:46,223
It's a volunteer position, you guys.

1149
01:37:46,343 --> 01:37:54,790
And for the most part, I've seen the commission, these two members of the commission, very active everywhere.

1150
01:37:55,931 --> 01:38:04,839
But for the most part, most other people don't know who the other commissioners are, unless it's election day or they have to be in a certain spot.

1151
01:38:06,294 --> 01:38:07,734
And I think that's a problem as well.

1152
01:38:08,615 --> 01:38:21,199
And I think that's something that I'll be bringing forward myself because I think that in the totality of commissions and boards that we have in our community, and who's responsible for putting them into place or what they

1153
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:37,542
their weight, their responsibilities of weight, whether it's financial or whether it's weight other ways, maybe, maybe it's, we look at our assessor and say, maybe there's a tax break for residents that have these backgrounds, that we can bring people that are qualified to really support that.

1154
01:38:38,524 --> 01:38:46,666
You know, it's no different than, you know, we have commissions right now that we have nothing in place right now that we have commissions and other boards that don't even live in the city anymore.

1155
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:50,427
And that's something I'll look forward to meeting with and try to change those.

1156
01:38:50,487 --> 01:39:04,650
But I think that's another concern that I have that in totality, this isn't, this is something that we need more, more effort and more support to in every level.

1157
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:07,451
So I wanted to share that as well.

1158
01:39:07,531 --> 01:39:07,831
Thank you.

1159
01:39:10,387 --> 01:39:11,248
Thank you, Councillor Stroud.

1160
01:39:11,288 --> 01:39:11,848
Was that a motion?

1161
01:39:13,069 --> 01:39:13,910
Was there a motion in there?

1162
01:39:15,071 --> 01:39:15,792
You had the previous one.

1163
01:39:15,812 --> 01:39:16,793
Was there a further motion?

1164
01:39:17,313 --> 01:39:17,594
Okay.

1165
01:39:19,295 --> 01:39:19,675
Attendance?

1166
01:39:19,695 --> 01:39:21,577
In committee?

1167
01:39:21,597 --> 01:39:21,857
Yeah.

1168
01:39:55,745 --> 01:39:56,205
Thank you.

1169
01:39:56,225 --> 01:40:04,551
And I think if we look at the governance committee, this is on there already as well for the next several months for us to take a look at.

1170
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:09,154
I have some questions, but I will wait since we've heard from everyone else.

1171
01:40:09,334 --> 01:40:11,675
I will go to you guys since my colleagues have had a chance to speak.

1172
01:40:12,096 --> 01:40:15,338
If you have anything you'd like to say this time or any questions you'd like to answer.

1173
01:40:19,534 --> 01:40:20,174
Yeah, good evening.

1174
01:40:20,214 --> 01:40:21,435
My name is Henry Mullen.

1175
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:23,956
I'm a member of the Election Commission.

1176
01:40:24,617 --> 01:40:27,498
That will be room 102 here in City Hall.

1177
01:40:27,738 --> 01:40:29,559
I live in 8 Temple Street.

1178
01:40:30,319 --> 01:40:35,622
One of the key thing you look, the report you receive was strictly done by election manager.

1179
01:40:35,842 --> 01:40:39,524
That was something we designed to be done right after the election.

1180
01:40:40,124 --> 01:40:43,546
Am I happy to be standing in front of you today talking about election?

1181
01:40:43,606 --> 01:40:44,106
Hell no.

1182
01:40:44,667 --> 01:40:45,727
Most of you knows it.

1183
01:40:46,327 --> 01:40:48,789
Yes, the council asked for

1184
01:40:50,054 --> 01:40:54,117
and a voice message for attendance, we have that, okay?

1185
01:40:54,638 --> 01:41:05,286
What I put together is something totally different based on what I'm observing, it's what I can offer with the department to say, we need to get our process better.

1186
01:41:05,906 --> 01:41:11,650
But the night of the election, what took place wasn't there, no one saw it coming.

1187
01:41:12,391 --> 01:41:14,953
Suddenly you have five precinct,

1188
01:41:16,496 --> 01:41:19,057
that zero back in, okay?

1189
01:41:19,237 --> 01:41:21,517
Let me explain it so people understand it.

1190
01:41:22,037 --> 01:41:29,099
Once you shut the tabulator down, until the memory cards are removed, don't touch it.

1191
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:33,240
Any attempt will be to zero back in.

1192
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,440
That's the reason we lost it.

1193
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:44,403
But I do thank you, Councilor Zak, at the time who reached out to me, at the time was Vice President, now President, who reached out to me as a gentleman,

1194
01:41:45,883 --> 01:42:01,093
what you observe and we share it, you know, politely, we work it out, and we end up, whether it takes long, when I hear people say, you gotta have it by 830, by 930, there's no specific time for an official result.

1195
01:42:01,593 --> 01:42:02,293
It will be fair.

1196
01:42:02,353 --> 01:42:06,035
That night, I was standing right here, I was so happy it was gonna be there.

1197
01:42:06,356 --> 01:42:10,338
But I'm gonna share something with you where I said, that's mostly

1198
01:42:14,309 --> 01:42:18,313
I said it before, not here, but in many other communities.

1199
01:42:19,054 --> 01:42:23,118
Irregularities in election, they will be there.

1200
01:42:23,779 --> 01:42:25,161
It doesn't matter how much you do.

1201
01:42:25,241 --> 01:42:28,904
Somebody is going to do a dumb mistake, it's going to cause a lot of problems.

1202
01:42:29,245 --> 01:42:33,049
Because anytime you have human interaction, they're subject to it.

1203
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:34,370
But what I did,

1204
01:42:35,211 --> 01:42:42,293
That night, I said, we need to identify and investigate irregularities that took place.

1205
01:42:42,993 --> 01:42:44,494
We put together the evidence.

1206
01:42:45,114 --> 01:42:46,735
We tried to do everything we can do.

1207
01:42:46,855 --> 01:42:55,077
One of the things we haven't done for the first time in Medford, we did it, but we didn't really exceed on it because we had other things that prevented.

1208
01:42:55,137 --> 01:42:56,758
We put together a survey.

1209
01:42:57,318 --> 01:43:09,461
because the people you want, people stalking from the side and say, this didn't go wrong, this didn't go right, this was supposed to be, the people who's gonna tell us what's right, what's wrong, are the people who work the polls.

1210
01:43:09,901 --> 01:43:11,301
I used to be a poll worker.

1211
01:43:11,641 --> 01:43:20,703
I worked every, from inspector to clerk, from clerk to warden, I end up being here, but it's not by choice, but by love.

1212
01:43:21,641 --> 01:43:31,289
We put that, if we put that survey together, that will allow us to find out from our poll workers, okay, to find out what didn't work for them.

1213
01:43:31,469 --> 01:43:35,712
Then we can come back to the manager and say, this is where we need to adjust.

1214
01:43:36,253 --> 01:43:37,073
We didn't do that.

1215
01:43:37,314 --> 01:43:38,374
Why didn't we do that?

1216
01:43:38,715 --> 01:43:42,698
Because immediately after that, we were challenged by a recount.

1217
01:43:43,138 --> 01:43:46,061
The recount took away everything we wanted to do.

1218
01:43:47,061 --> 01:43:54,484
And we're still trying to do, because if you look at it right now, excluding today, we 41 days left until the next election.

1219
01:43:54,964 --> 01:44:00,446
And I'm not saying, I'm talking about on the day of election, I'm not including early voting.

1220
01:44:00,866 --> 01:44:02,367
I'm not including the census.

1221
01:44:02,747 --> 01:44:04,567
We have a lot of work that we have to do.

1222
01:44:06,388 --> 01:44:10,970
We need just like one thing I heard today, it's established.

1223
01:44:11,894 --> 01:44:18,339
an independent investigation, a group of people who can really work together, not a group of people who's going and solve together.

1224
01:44:18,379 --> 01:44:20,781
Because then I tell you, I've been living here for 55 years.

1225
01:44:23,447 --> 01:44:27,069
maybe not all of you knows me, most of you knows me, okay?

1226
01:44:27,189 --> 01:44:28,930
That name means something in Medford.

1227
01:44:29,691 --> 01:44:32,272
If it doesn't mean in Medford, it means something in the country.

1228
01:44:32,353 --> 01:44:35,735
First time in my life, I'm receiving threatened call, okay?

1229
01:44:36,375 --> 01:44:43,239
First time, I said that to you, you know, try to say it, not as a counselor, but as a friend, I said, this is what's going on.

1230
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:48,202
At one point, for me to go to my wife, I said, I gotta return a lawyer, okay?

1231
01:44:49,423 --> 01:44:50,363
That's unacceptable.

1232
01:44:50,664 --> 01:44:51,884
Not in the city of Medford.

1233
01:44:52,304 --> 01:44:54,445
But like I told people, I'm already a dead man.

1234
01:44:54,485 --> 01:44:55,206
You think I care?

1235
01:44:55,346 --> 01:44:55,646
I don't.

1236
01:44:55,946 --> 01:44:56,206
Okay?

1237
01:44:56,406 --> 01:44:58,667
Because I'm closer to dying than living.

1238
01:44:58,848 --> 01:45:00,068
So, that doesn't scare me.

1239
01:45:00,388 --> 01:45:04,170
I'm going to continue to display what I say in twenty twenty.

1240
01:45:04,690 --> 01:45:07,492
My love for the city of Medford is what guide me.

1241
01:45:07,712 --> 01:45:08,372
Not my hate.

1242
01:45:09,232 --> 01:45:13,414
We say we review voter registration and eligibility.

1243
01:45:13,815 --> 01:45:15,555
When somebody is calling me and

1244
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:35,965
a ballot by mail and I didn't apply and then when I come to City Council uh office, election office and said, hey, uh Josh told me, okay, they didn't apply for vote by mail and they receive it and then they pull out the application.

1245
01:45:36,005 --> 01:45:36,726
That's a lie.

1246
01:45:37,066 --> 01:45:38,446
That's an insult, okay?

1247
01:45:38,706 --> 01:45:40,707
Because your application is right there.

1248
01:45:41,067 --> 01:45:43,368
So, that means you submitted that application.

1249
01:45:43,628 --> 01:45:43,708
So,

1250
01:45:49,218 --> 01:45:54,139
process need to be changed and irregularity need to be done.

1251
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:59,201
What really messed me up is the the you saw how we did the recount.

1252
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:00,421
The recount was done.

1253
01:46:00,461 --> 01:46:01,562
You were really involved.

1254
01:46:01,662 --> 01:46:04,342
We we we we did an excellent job that night.

1255
01:46:04,803 --> 01:46:05,323
That day.

1256
01:46:05,683 --> 01:46:05,963
Okay.

1257
01:46:06,523 --> 01:46:13,705
But the thing is that what we need at that didn't change the process too long and I guarantee I I was on the phone

1258
01:46:17,264 --> 01:46:20,567
The result on the night of election was at one o'clock.

1259
01:46:20,687 --> 01:46:24,150
I have it stamped here, 12.01.

1260
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:24,150
12.01.

1261
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:31,316
You and I are standing with a group of other candidates standing in the hallway, okay, and we're going over it.

1262
01:46:31,476 --> 01:46:32,917
I have it here to prove.

1263
01:46:33,058 --> 01:46:34,879
So these are the things I said.

1264
01:46:34,899 --> 01:46:39,723
Here on this side of the rail, you guys elected official.

1265
01:46:40,504 --> 01:46:44,228
You are elected, you're representing me, every single one of you, okay?

1266
01:46:44,989 --> 01:46:49,594
Some of you used to be my friend, maybe I don't have it anymore, it's okay, okay?

1267
01:46:49,694 --> 01:46:54,499
I wasn't made to make friends, I was made to serve the city of Medford, which I'm doing.

1268
01:46:55,259 --> 01:46:57,382
The thing I'm trying to do, words are important.

1269
01:46:57,742 --> 01:47:00,925
There are things that are being said here on this side.

1270
01:47:01,385 --> 01:47:02,386
That's a brand new council.

1271
01:47:02,426 --> 01:47:03,607
I'm not blaming you guys.

1272
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:05,008
You all do.

1273
01:47:05,188 --> 01:47:07,690
I interact with every single one of you.

1274
01:47:08,471 --> 01:47:10,392
The thing is, the words are important.

1275
01:47:10,713 --> 01:47:15,897
But tonight, what I had in mind is not what I have to talk about because of what I heard.

1276
01:47:16,257 --> 01:47:18,960
If we can sit down together, we can work better.

1277
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:22,483
We can do better things, just like we did on election night.

1278
01:47:23,183 --> 01:47:28,128
Okay, two phone calls came to me and said, Henry, something is wrong with that.

1279
01:47:28,188 --> 01:47:31,452
I said, I'm looking at it, something is wrong with it, but I don't know what it is.

1280
01:47:32,032 --> 01:47:33,794
Now, I'm pressuring the guy who did it.

1281
01:47:33,974 --> 01:47:37,678
At one point, I sat and requested SLOG, right?

1282
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:43,664
Now, most of you probably don't know what everything has a backlog, everything.

1283
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:45,085
So I requested

1284
01:47:46,317 --> 01:47:52,001
from the expert, I will call him the expert, okay, who was helping us.

1285
01:47:52,121 --> 01:47:53,582
I said, something is wrong here.

1286
01:47:53,943 --> 01:47:58,106
Those numbers doesn't match to me, but I don't know what's wrong with it.

1287
01:47:58,146 --> 01:48:00,367
So we challenge him in a way.

1288
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:13,413
brought down, think about, you know, getting the owner of the company to come here, all dressed up, whatever he was partying to, we broke that, we say, you gotta come here, he came here and did it for us.

1289
01:48:13,953 --> 01:48:28,860
But now we have a better process, but perhaps the process we put in place, when we sit in that meeting, you're talking about, we can share with you as a group, then you realize, you say, well, they're proactive, they're not really reactive, they're proactive, something to,

1290
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,301
went wrong, and this is what we're doing.

1291
01:48:31,341 --> 01:48:41,304
By the time we get it, we should have the, when I heard people said the in-house early voting should be posted by certain times.

1292
01:48:41,364 --> 01:48:42,084
That's not true.

1293
01:48:42,545 --> 01:48:47,906
Early voting is incorporated into the tabulation to come up with the unofficial.

1294
01:48:48,187 --> 01:48:48,967
That's how it works.

1295
01:48:50,447 --> 01:48:51,788
If I can, to Ms.

1296
01:48:51,828 --> 01:48:52,168
Miller.

1297
01:48:53,468 --> 01:48:54,249
I will provide,

1298
01:48:55,356 --> 01:49:05,363
the commissioner with the letter that was sent to the candidate that that morning, what there was said that the votes will be tallied here and posted at eight o'clock.

1299
01:49:05,483 --> 01:49:06,243
I will get that letter.

1300
01:49:06,303 --> 01:49:06,864
Okay.

1301
01:49:06,964 --> 01:49:08,625
I appreciate that, which is okay.

1302
01:49:08,885 --> 01:49:17,031
So that may be, but the thing we're trying to do, enhancing transparency and monitoring the process is important.

1303
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:21,614
In order for us to do something, we need everybody together to work on it.

1304
01:49:21,694 --> 01:49:23,156
And I will appreciate that will be it.

1305
01:49:23,216 --> 01:49:26,739
But see, the point I'm trying to get here, it says,

1306
01:49:28,487 --> 01:49:31,448
We need to establish a better control.

1307
01:49:31,468 --> 01:49:34,209
For instance, we're looking, we talk about poll observer.

1308
01:49:34,409 --> 01:49:35,209
I heard that tonight.

1309
01:49:35,609 --> 01:49:38,530
There's a law, and I said it too many times.

1310
01:49:38,630 --> 01:49:41,271
I work almost, I mean, we have 18%.

1311
01:49:41,611 --> 01:49:45,512
I think this cycle of election, I did maybe five, okay?

1312
01:49:45,612 --> 01:49:47,933
Not like I did 16 the last time.

1313
01:49:48,473 --> 01:49:52,995
But the thing is, I told the warden, listen, the people that are observers,

1314
01:49:53,655 --> 01:49:54,515
They're Medford people.

1315
01:49:55,115 --> 01:49:56,656
They're friends of Medford people.

1316
01:49:57,016 --> 01:49:59,676
You are the official, you can treat them better.

1317
01:50:00,116 --> 01:50:08,858
Because I give them example, I say, as the law said, you're a police officer, it says 25, because I catch you doing 35 doesn't mean I gotta give you a ticket.

1318
01:50:09,138 --> 01:50:12,779
The law say I give you a ticket, but the law say I can say, hey, guess what?

1319
01:50:13,099 --> 01:50:13,999
Slow down, okay?

1320
01:50:14,219 --> 01:50:14,459
Go.

1321
01:50:14,859 --> 01:50:16,839
So it's the same thing we can do.

1322
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,880
You have something you brought here,

1323
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:23,401
the council which was really reasonable, okay?

1324
01:50:23,761 --> 01:50:26,281
What do you do before election?

1325
01:50:26,321 --> 01:50:30,242
I think we talked about that either yesterday or today and we've been talking about it.

1326
01:50:30,322 --> 01:50:34,102
You go to the site just like you saw us doing here on recount.

1327
01:50:34,443 --> 01:50:37,463
We marked everywhere you're going to be sitting.

1328
01:50:37,543 --> 01:50:39,603
This is where the candidate can be.

1329
01:50:39,663 --> 01:50:43,224
This is where 150 feet where your sign can be.

1330
01:50:43,264 --> 01:50:45,804
This is where the observer don't be sitting but

1331
01:50:49,605 --> 01:50:51,605
Training is, we know it.

1332
01:50:52,706 --> 01:50:55,466
We haven't have the time to conduct training.

1333
01:50:56,046 --> 01:51:10,069
Already, between that report, there's a place, I believe, it's in your report, that says we don't have to try to train clerk and warden twice prior to an election, inspectors at least once or twice prior an election.

1334
01:51:10,209 --> 01:51:12,009
Because we're dealing with people my age.

1335
01:51:12,629 --> 01:51:17,210
If you do something with them three months prior to the event, they forget.

1336
01:51:17,950 --> 01:51:24,038
If you do it a week, two weeks prior to the event, then remember, not everybody is sharp like Henry is, okay?

1337
01:51:24,439 --> 01:51:25,520
But that's the thing.

1338
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:26,802
The law is complicated.

1339
01:51:27,242 --> 01:51:31,088
So with that, I will lay it over and wait for the invitation.

1340
01:51:31,128 --> 01:51:34,552
We can sit down and have a conversation because what took place

1341
01:51:35,396 --> 01:51:39,439
on November 2023 is unacceptable.

1342
01:51:39,979 --> 01:51:40,239
Okay?

1343
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:40,940
Why?

1344
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:45,963
Because we need to work with the police to tell them, hey, if I need you, I need to call you.

1345
01:51:46,604 --> 01:51:50,286
We need to establish a better communication with the warden.

1346
01:51:50,847 --> 01:51:53,589
Call the warden if I need, I need to get you.

1347
01:51:53,629 --> 01:51:55,430
But this is the thing that we're missing.

1348
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:58,692
If you're calling someone and tell them what's going on.

1349
01:51:58,732 --> 01:51:59,673
Can you imagine somebody

1350
01:52:02,935 --> 01:52:03,816
We're going to sue you.

1351
01:52:04,236 --> 01:52:05,357
We're going to sue the city.

1352
01:52:06,397 --> 01:52:08,579
You know, for election, that's not fair.

1353
01:52:08,699 --> 01:52:10,340
So I need to work.

1354
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:11,921
We need to work together.

1355
01:52:11,941 --> 01:52:15,043
Until we start doing that, we're still going to get the same mess, regardless.

1356
01:52:15,703 --> 01:52:15,963
OK?

1357
01:52:16,284 --> 01:52:19,726
We have to change the process to produce different results.

1358
01:52:20,226 --> 01:52:21,427
And I will rest my case.

1359
01:52:21,487 --> 01:52:23,508
I don't want to question a little bit more of it.

1360
01:52:23,828 --> 01:52:25,489
I look forward to whatever you guys have.

1361
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:26,910
Thank you, Henry.

1362
01:52:27,211 --> 01:52:28,832
And Chairman Loren, I appreciate it.

1363
01:52:28,892 --> 01:52:29,592
Thank you, Manager.

1364
01:52:29,672 --> 01:52:31,894
Thank you, Member DiBenedetto, for being here.

1365
01:52:33,117 --> 01:52:33,737
You have one more thing?

1366
01:52:34,357 --> 01:52:35,078
Yeah.

1367
01:52:35,098 --> 01:52:43,821
The most important thing I have to say, right, is the fact tonight we were supposed to come here and present you with the election calendar.

1368
01:52:44,861 --> 01:52:48,843
Election calendar for 2024 has to be shared with the council.

1369
01:52:50,943 --> 01:52:52,504
We sent it to law.

1370
01:52:53,626 --> 01:53:00,791
because we were directed by the state to send to our law department to review to make sure we're in compliance, which we all normally do.

1371
01:53:01,071 --> 01:53:14,840
So if we had to keep it, what we're gonna do, once we get the go, the green light will probably electronically get it to you guys, yeah, that whatever mean to the clerk office, and then post it on our website.

1372
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:21,825
But the most important thing that we're facing right now, less than two days ago, we get the confirmation

1373
01:53:22,939 --> 01:53:32,525
One of our polling location, which is walking court, will not be eligible in this cycle of election.

1374
01:53:33,005 --> 01:53:34,766
So we need to relocate that.

1375
01:53:35,887 --> 01:53:43,612
We're talking about something like 2,600 voters that we have prior to March 5th.

1376
01:53:45,069 --> 01:53:51,935
even before March 5th, because we don't have early voting, to tell them, okay, where to vote.

1377
01:53:52,215 --> 01:53:54,617
And we haven't, we're gonna relocate them here.

1378
01:53:56,098 --> 01:53:59,381
That's the only place in Medford we can relocate that site.

1379
01:54:00,081 --> 01:54:09,890
We cannot go to Tufts, because Tufts doesn't anymore give us the room that we will normally need, and that a different polling location.

1380
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:14,093
We cannot send them to American Legion.

1381
01:54:14,433 --> 01:54:18,536
We're facing parking issues.

1382
01:54:20,050 --> 01:54:21,391
Uh, the only place is here.

1383
01:54:21,811 --> 01:54:25,673
So, we working with, we look at the, what's the church name, Wellesley?

1384
01:54:26,453 --> 01:54:32,757
We look at Wellesley Church, because the ramp at Wellesley Church, on Winthrop corner of uh, what's the name?

1385
01:54:32,997 --> 01:54:33,177
Dearborn.

1386
01:54:33,557 --> 01:54:35,358
Dearborn, corner of Dearborn.

1387
01:54:35,398 --> 01:54:36,959
See, she knows that, that, that.

1388
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:45,083
So, there has a ramp there, I believe the ramp was built by the city, but I checked the ramp, it's no good.

1389
01:54:46,004 --> 01:54:46,404
It's not good.

1390
01:54:46,424 --> 01:54:48,907
We will have to do that all over again.

1391
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:50,048
It will be a lot of money.

1392
01:54:50,088 --> 01:54:52,470
So I see no other alternative to bring it in.

1393
01:54:52,771 --> 01:55:03,341
And we wanted to share that with you guys, because if we had to wait as of tomorrow's 41 days, we will have to wait until February 6th, which is your next meeting to present.

1394
01:55:03,401 --> 01:55:04,162
That would be too long.

1395
01:55:05,183 --> 01:55:06,124
Yeah.

1396
01:55:06,544 --> 01:55:07,625
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1397
01:55:07,665 --> 01:55:08,246
I will come back.

1398
01:55:08,857 --> 01:55:14,879
to my comments about the report, just specifically on the call to election and the approval of polling places, if you could share.

1399
01:55:15,519 --> 01:55:22,840
My understanding is that we do have to approve those as the council pursuant to state law, even with the transition from the registrar system to the elections commission system.

1400
01:55:23,341 --> 01:55:27,582
If that is not true, if you could send me the KP law opinion that says that, just so we have that on record.

1401
01:55:30,143 --> 01:55:31,085
One quick question on this.

1402
01:55:31,566 --> 01:55:38,221
Did you ask about around Breed Memorial Hall at the corner of Winthrop and Boston Avenue as a possibility?

1403
01:55:38,241 --> 01:55:39,123
It's a tough stone building.

1404
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:41,031
That's how it took.

1405
01:55:41,651 --> 01:55:44,654
Because the first place we looked was the old library.

1406
01:55:44,775 --> 01:55:48,218
You know where we had the library temporarily on 200 Boston Ave?

1407
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:48,438
Yeah.

1408
01:55:48,618 --> 01:55:51,061
That was the first place where Elizabeth Grady.

1409
01:55:51,601 --> 01:55:51,862
Yeah.

1410
01:55:52,162 --> 01:55:53,183
We look at that too.

1411
01:55:53,303 --> 01:55:56,126
It's all gonna, that whole section is out.

1412
01:55:56,606 --> 01:56:00,450
I even went to look at the corner of North Street and Boston Ave.

1413
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:00,730
Yeah.

1414
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:04,174
You see that place where they had the chair repair and all these things.

1415
01:56:04,554 --> 01:56:10,756
I tried to get, we've been working for years to see if we can even find the owner and see if we can rent that place.

1416
01:56:10,796 --> 01:56:11,396
We couldn't get it.

1417
01:56:11,616 --> 01:56:14,077
And Tufts wouldn't make the Breed Hall available?

1418
01:56:16,137 --> 01:56:16,878
Not enough parking.

1419
01:56:17,878 --> 01:56:19,038
Tufts is another issue.

1420
01:56:19,478 --> 01:56:19,758
Okay.

1421
01:56:20,379 --> 01:56:23,439
We attempted, we reached out to Rocco.

1422
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:26,100
The place we would have had would have been Gauntlet, right?

1423
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:27,201
Which is underneath.

1424
01:56:28,241 --> 01:56:29,621
You want to talk about that?

1425
01:56:31,182 --> 01:56:31,842
Come on, you can't.

1426
01:56:34,632 --> 01:56:40,318
Hi, Aaron Benedetto 21 Dearborn Street, so I know they are very well that's my word.

1427
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:48,889
Really City Hall is our best location based on availability of parking ADA compliance

1428
01:56:49,369 --> 01:56:54,410
and just generally available for all people to come and vote.

1429
01:56:54,830 --> 01:57:06,093
I know it's a little further than some of the other places you have, but we have vetted those places and they are not as accommodating as we need either for the reasons I stated before.

1430
01:57:06,133 --> 01:57:06,553
Understood.

1431
01:57:06,573 --> 01:57:07,233
Yeah, totally.

1432
01:57:07,573 --> 01:57:10,414
And the only reason I ask this question is the first time we've been before us.

1433
01:57:10,474 --> 01:57:17,295
So, you know, just want to make sure we get, and I think we all agree in a timely manner, and you mentioned the time clock on this one,

1434
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:24,611
calls to election or notification, whatever the legal opinion is that what this council's action needs to be, of course, we will do that.

1435
01:57:25,352 --> 01:57:29,032
But we do want to get it in a way where we can ask the questions and just ask the question.

1436
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:30,273
I know you guys work hard.

1437
01:57:30,373 --> 01:57:31,613
I'm sure you've vetted it all out.

1438
01:57:32,373 --> 01:57:35,914
And my guess is we'll be able to go back to Walkley when the construction is complete.

1439
01:57:35,934 --> 01:57:37,654
Which may take years.

1440
01:57:37,674 --> 01:57:38,934
In a couple of years, yeah.

1441
01:57:39,474 --> 01:57:40,455
Until further notice.

1442
01:57:40,895 --> 01:57:41,135
Okay.

1443
01:57:43,749 --> 01:57:51,873
All right, back to some of the report, and I hear there's the motion to continue having detailed discussions to really get into the nitty gritty of it.

1444
01:57:52,374 --> 01:57:59,458
I will say, I think the point of Councillor Callaghan of saying, you know, it's one thing to have the after action report.

1445
01:57:59,518 --> 01:58:04,160
It sounds like this was something you were going to do no matter what that was the plan for the election.

1446
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:07,282
I think we requested something a little bit on top of that, which is kind of.

1447
01:58:07,922 --> 01:58:20,709
a call and response, you know, if there was something that was identified as an issue, name what the issue was, you know, kind of what your office, how you interpreted the issue, what your definition of it was, and then what your response was.

1448
01:58:20,749 --> 01:58:32,536
And I think that would have helped new councillors, an average resident who may not have all the context, to better understand, okay, this event happened, here's what we're doing now to make sure this event doesn't happen again.

1449
01:58:32,616 --> 01:58:34,057
And so that's just what I want to put out there.

1450
01:58:35,805 --> 01:58:43,670
And I appreciate in the communications privately and tonight that we've had open and honest and direct.

1451
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:44,711
This is how we're feeling.

1452
01:58:45,272 --> 01:58:46,733
Henry, very clear about that.

1453
01:58:46,833 --> 01:58:50,975
I don't think this is about friends and not friends anymore or anything personal.

1454
01:58:51,536 --> 01:58:52,356
We are all friends.

1455
01:58:52,376 --> 01:59:00,282
I think we're all friends of elections in different ways as well, having participated in them, all of us, in many different ways, including this last one.

1456
01:59:02,063 --> 01:59:21,218
So, but I think that spirit of radical candor is the most, maybe in your office, is the most, needs to be the most radically honest of any office, because it is the office that allows them from which flows all of the rest of us to do the work that we do and the legitimacy of our city government, right?

1457
01:59:22,019 --> 01:59:23,900
And it's when these, you know,

1458
01:59:26,846 --> 01:59:36,911
minor mistakes or irregularities or issues or things that we want to say, when you have a couple of them build up, then you have people calling and threatening.

1459
01:59:37,111 --> 01:59:38,852
And I'm sure you've experienced that.

1460
01:59:38,892 --> 01:59:48,497
And then you have people calling illegitimacy on the whole process and calling for recounts when recounts may not be necessary given the margins and the races, right?

1461
01:59:48,557 --> 01:59:55,981
So it's being so open as to say, even though it is probably counter to every instinct that we may have,

1462
01:59:56,601 --> 02:00:02,665
We made a mistake being so open, like not just we made a mistake, but we made this mistake at 7.41 p.m.

1463
02:00:02,706 --> 02:00:03,726
and 13 seconds.

1464
02:00:03,766 --> 02:00:05,267
And here were the three people involved.

1465
02:00:05,768 --> 02:00:14,874
And then here's the process that we're putting in, because if we have that radical candor, if we have that deep transparency, it undermines bad faith arguments.

1466
02:00:15,995 --> 02:00:18,236
that are made in that longer run.

1467
02:00:18,256 --> 02:00:21,497
And I think we all agree on that, but I just think that's why we're taking it so seriously.

1468
02:00:21,977 --> 02:00:27,398
And I think the other piece of taking it so seriously is we moved to this new system recently, and it's different than it was before.

1469
02:00:28,419 --> 02:00:37,581
So there are three things, kind of three things in the report I just want to lift up, and it sounds like we'll have further discussions on it, but the first one is the staffing and resources question.

1470
02:00:37,601 --> 02:00:43,443
And I read here, you know, one big challenge was not having enough regular staff members to assist with the amount of work when prepping for the election.

1471
02:00:43,933 --> 02:00:50,498
The Election Commission is working to address this by hiring additional pre-election team members and working with HR to hire the open part-time election staff position.

1472
02:00:51,079 --> 02:00:58,164
I think that is, you know, that's an answer to the question of staffing and resources, but I also think it's an answer that we have heard before.

1473
02:00:58,565 --> 02:01:05,350
And I understand that your office doesn't set the budget or make appropriations, but I think, you know, we've had this discussion.

1474
02:01:05,390 --> 02:01:06,991
We had this discussion November 14th.

1475
02:01:07,031 --> 02:01:08,352
We've had this discussion in private.

1476
02:01:09,312 --> 02:01:20,117
there used to be several more full time staff working on elections in the city than there are now is the replacement of those staff members with temporary, you know, pre election team members.

1477
02:01:20,177 --> 02:01:20,977
Is that sufficient?

1478
02:01:21,397 --> 02:01:25,860
Is this part time position which because of its structure has gone unfilled for a year?

1479
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:26,740
Is that sufficient?

1480
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:28,441
I think this council would say

1481
02:01:29,201 --> 02:01:36,026
This answer is we can't have the same answer to the question when this was the answer last time and it didn't produce the results intended.

1482
02:01:36,446 --> 02:01:45,172
So how can we sit down as well with you guys and with the mayor's team to say, OK, how can we build something where there's a full time position where we can get it filled?

1483
02:01:45,772 --> 02:01:49,635
Or and maybe it's not a full time that it's always in the elections office.

1484
02:01:50,135 --> 02:01:52,537
I know for a fact that there are offices around this.

1485
02:01:53,317 --> 02:01:59,179
building who would appreciate a little bit of extra support at different times of the year, and maybe half of the year that's in your office, right?

1486
02:01:59,219 --> 02:02:01,980
So kind of trying to think through those unique solutions.

1487
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,021
So I'm hoping that's somewhere we can go there.

1488
02:02:06,081 --> 02:02:11,563
The second piece for me, I know I discuss this often, was the training.

1489
02:02:11,823 --> 02:02:16,685
And Henry mentioned it, you mentioned in the report, there's need for more training, there's need to update the training.

1490
02:02:18,245 --> 02:02:22,367
Pursuant to our issue, you know, the issue that we raised on election day around the

1491
02:02:23,347 --> 02:02:24,889
checklists being brought into the polls.

1492
02:02:24,949 --> 02:02:28,392
I see that is addressed here in here, so I appreciate that.

1493
02:02:28,452 --> 02:02:37,581
I think maybe one other thing to put in the training is just make sure that all of the election workers are reading the Voter Bill of Rights that the Secretary of State's office puts out.

1494
02:02:37,621 --> 02:02:44,808
I think that's a valuable piece of something that has already been created separately that can answer some of those training questions, but I think it

1495
02:02:45,729 --> 02:02:47,751
To me, it's like, hey, look at this.

1496
02:02:47,771 --> 02:02:50,152
This is a list of what voters are allowed to do and not do.

1497
02:02:50,653 --> 02:02:51,413
It protects them.

1498
02:02:51,493 --> 02:02:52,254
It protects you.

1499
02:02:52,794 --> 02:02:54,375
And that's just a level of understanding.

1500
02:02:56,337 --> 02:03:01,740
The third thing for me is back to the tabulation of unofficial results.

1501
02:03:02,021 --> 02:03:09,626
And I really think this is part of that radical candor is setting fair expectations.

1502
02:03:11,704 --> 02:03:14,006
both for you and for everyone else in the process.

1503
02:03:14,387 --> 02:03:21,373
If a letter went out that said these things will be posted by 8.30, that's now an expectation that's been set.

1504
02:03:21,393 --> 02:03:26,778
And if that expectation goes unfulfilled, then people are going to say that expectation went unfulfilled.

1505
02:03:26,858 --> 02:03:33,424
So I think being really clear, and I see in here, we're going to add this cross-check process.

1506
02:03:33,445 --> 02:03:34,886
I have a question about that in a second.

1507
02:03:35,366 --> 02:03:38,787
We are, you know, we're going to post the tabulator tapes.

1508
02:03:38,847 --> 02:03:40,328
I have a quick question about that.

1509
02:03:40,368 --> 02:03:45,710
I mean, it seems like there's more going into this than that has happened in November 23.

1510
02:03:45,770 --> 02:03:49,131
There was also the partial release in November 22 that was corrected.

1511
02:03:49,171 --> 02:03:51,052
So it's it is a persistent issue.

1512
02:03:52,212 --> 02:03:54,073
But I think the communications from the office.

1513
02:03:54,853 --> 02:03:57,255
maybe pulling back on over promising.

1514
02:03:57,335 --> 02:04:12,168
I don't, sometimes I have the problem of sitting in this chair and over promising is something that I would just suggest and put out there because I think that's where, you know, it adds another ticker, another check on that list.

1515
02:04:12,188 --> 02:04:18,654
And now if we have one issue with the ballot and an issue with the observer and an issue with the voter checklist, and then you have an issue with the

1516
02:04:19,114 --> 02:04:30,867
expectation being set that results should be available at a certain time, then you can have people who are not acting in good faith take that list of things and turn it into a whole hullabaloo, which is what we experienced.

1517
02:04:31,287 --> 02:04:35,392
I have two specific questions and then one further thing I want to get into.

1518
02:04:37,645 --> 02:04:44,070
In terms of the central tabulation facility, we'll post the tabulator tapes in the same method as the individual precincts.

1519
02:04:44,570 --> 02:04:49,854
Does that mean that there would be 16 tapes at central tab, or one tape would be posted at central tab?

1520
02:04:51,355 --> 02:04:55,598
So central tabulation can print a 8.5 by 11 report.

1521
02:04:56,118 --> 02:04:58,460
Everything is on the report, so it's one report.

1522
02:04:58,500 --> 02:04:59,681
It wouldn't be separate tapes.

1523
02:05:00,141 --> 02:05:01,342
OK, it would not be separate tapes.

1524
02:05:01,362 --> 02:05:05,545
And I just think, you know, same method as the individual precincts, I might be expecting

1525
02:05:06,317 --> 02:05:07,098
a thin ticker.

1526
02:05:07,358 --> 02:05:08,579
It's just those kinds of things.

1527
02:05:08,619 --> 02:05:11,221
I just want to be setting that expectation, clearly.

1528
02:05:11,241 --> 02:05:14,344
But simple tabulation will provide you with a number of votes.

1529
02:05:15,085 --> 02:05:15,325
Right.

1530
02:05:15,745 --> 02:05:21,690
Number of votes, like in conversation you and I had, that's what we look at early voting.

1531
02:05:22,911 --> 02:05:23,192
We had

1532
02:05:25,691 --> 02:05:29,175
put by mail, and we have two different entry forms.

1533
02:05:29,815 --> 02:05:38,725
So, when you take that, you add them, but the part that is missing, and I want people to really understand that, and it's a learning process.

1534
02:05:39,826 --> 02:05:41,888
We have the tips that are printed.

1535
02:05:43,083 --> 02:05:43,843
They have numbers.

1536
02:05:44,544 --> 02:05:48,386
That's what your observer look and call your campaign.

1537
02:05:48,886 --> 02:05:49,146
Okay.

1538
02:05:49,366 --> 02:05:50,807
That's what they used to report.

1539
02:05:51,347 --> 02:05:52,208
That came here.

1540
02:05:52,888 --> 02:05:58,891
One come with the counters, one down with the office.

1541
02:05:59,191 --> 02:06:06,735
Now, the part that really aggravate me and we miss that is when you take the memory card, you read it.

1542
02:06:07,711 --> 02:06:14,895
Let's say we do 100 quotes for the first read, for read number one, whatever is the precept.

1543
02:06:15,475 --> 02:06:24,600
When you read card number two, if the number was 100, and when you read card number two, the number is still 100, guess what happened?

1544
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:25,761
You read nothing.

1545
02:06:27,383 --> 02:06:28,223
You see the scenario?

1546
02:06:28,844 --> 02:06:29,024
Yeah.

1547
02:06:29,064 --> 02:06:35,607
So because that was zero, so when we read the last five, and they have nothing.

1548
02:06:35,867 --> 02:06:36,088
Right.

1549
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:47,894
Now, it was smart that night for one of the, being that time we were talking, everybody was talking, I add your number minus seven, what seven one you didn't add.

1550
02:06:49,535 --> 02:06:55,598
When I pressured the gentleman, he had an issue, then one of our commissioners said, we got the tip.

1551
02:06:56,508 --> 02:06:57,548
It's at the tip.

1552
02:06:59,349 --> 02:07:05,330
At the tip, then we come up with the 13,300 something instead of 10,400 something.

1553
02:07:05,630 --> 02:07:13,351
But while he was doing that, instead of people to appreciate it, and I think it could have been the wrong place to do it right here in face of everybody.

1554
02:07:13,471 --> 02:07:16,252
Because whatever you do, you're cheating, okay?

1555
02:07:16,692 --> 02:07:21,973
But he or she was investigating to find out what missing.

1556
02:07:22,173 --> 02:07:25,494
Immediately you take the total number from the tip,

1557
02:07:27,045 --> 02:07:33,333
and reduce the total number of the unofficial account, the first unofficial account that you have.

1558
02:07:33,353 --> 02:07:34,314
We're missing a lot of it.

1559
02:07:35,145 --> 02:07:38,067
close to 3,000 foot, yeah, that's what you have to do.

1560
02:07:38,107 --> 02:07:41,769
So that part, we know how to fix that going forward.

1561
02:07:41,930 --> 02:07:51,476
And when we sit with you and say, this is what, and I had nothing to do with it, I will give her all the credit for putting it together and explain it to me.

1562
02:07:51,836 --> 02:07:57,320
Just today, we're talking about acid, there's only one part missing, okay, that we need to do it.

1563
02:07:57,380 --> 02:08:01,843
So that way, when you get it, you're not getting from one source only, you get it from everywhere.

1564
02:08:02,443 --> 02:08:04,805
So at the end, it's like balancing a check.

1565
02:08:05,225 --> 02:08:06,126
I think that's what we can do.

1566
02:08:06,486 --> 02:08:06,806
Right.

1567
02:08:07,386 --> 02:08:07,626
Yes.

1568
02:08:08,427 --> 02:08:09,467
So let me clarify.

1569
02:08:09,988 --> 02:08:14,590
The central tabulation is a high-speed scanner, just like the tabulators.

1570
02:08:15,091 --> 02:08:16,151
It's one scanner.

1571
02:08:16,391 --> 02:08:19,713
So it's all the wards and precincts, but it's one scanner.

1572
02:08:19,753 --> 02:08:27,538
So the report comes out as one report, whereas the individual tabulators, it's the individual wards and precincts.

1573
02:08:27,578 --> 02:08:29,679
So I hope that clarifies a little bit.

1574
02:08:29,719 --> 02:08:30,680
So you would have essentially 16

1575
02:08:31,843 --> 02:08:32,463
Ticker strips.

1576
02:08:32,483 --> 02:08:32,463
18.

1577
02:08:33,304 --> 02:08:35,365
18, sorry, because we have the two A's now.

1578
02:08:36,985 --> 02:08:41,368
And then you would have one from the central tabulate, and all of the precincts would be combined on that one?

1579
02:08:42,648 --> 02:08:43,729
You can see them individually.

1580
02:08:43,749 --> 02:08:45,850
You can see them individually, but if you want a sheet of paper.

1581
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:46,210
That's correct.

1582
02:08:46,230 --> 02:08:46,530
Okay.

1583
02:08:46,550 --> 02:08:48,451
And I think that's the kind of thing, you know, just setting that expectation.

1584
02:08:48,471 --> 02:08:51,693
This is what you should be seeing when it's all over.

1585
02:08:53,513 --> 02:08:58,916
The other piece that it sounds like, and this was going to be kind of my suggestion, it sounds like maybe you've already gone down this road, and I understand that you've been talking about it.

1586
02:08:59,335 --> 02:09:00,796
is that cross-check, right?

1587
02:09:01,176 --> 02:09:14,067
Like to me, if you have the memory cards and you have the tapes, you know, and maybe it's not as easy for the central tab piece of this, and maybe that's where some of this issue is coming in.

1588
02:09:14,887 --> 02:09:25,133
But you could essentially have a spreadsheet pre-made that is getting populated by whatever's coming out of the memory cards, VRIS or whatever that system is, or the LHS system.

1589
02:09:25,734 --> 02:09:29,456
And then you could take the tapes and manually enter those into a spreadsheet.

1590
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:35,079
And then you'd have two independent sets of two sheets with two sets of information.

1591
02:09:35,099 --> 02:09:37,581
Do the tapes match what came out of the machine?

1592
02:09:38,996 --> 02:09:41,296
if the answer's, is that the cross-check kind of we're talking about?

1593
02:09:41,476 --> 02:09:45,097
You need to know the joke, I think you get that one.

1594
02:09:45,437 --> 02:09:50,798
So the idea is the tally tapes and the memory cards come back to us.

1595
02:09:50,978 --> 02:09:53,119
The planner brings them back to us before the end of the night.

1596
02:09:53,739 --> 02:09:55,639
When they come in, we check them.

1597
02:09:56,439 --> 02:09:59,620
We have the memory cards, we have the tally sheets, two people initial it.

1598
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:03,220
Then when we run the results, we do the same thing.

1599
02:10:03,981 --> 02:10:06,261
Tally sheets, memory cards, results.

1600
02:10:07,588 --> 02:10:09,089
we initial it to make sure they're right.

1601
02:10:09,429 --> 02:10:12,131
If they're not correct, we have to go back and look at it.

1602
02:10:12,692 --> 02:10:18,576
And I think part of what happens is we want to give the results as much as everybody wants to get them.

1603
02:10:18,877 --> 02:10:30,645
And I think we need to set different expectations, as you've discussed, to really say, OK, so we don't want to give you wrong information and have people be upset and concerned about the results.

1604
02:10:31,106 --> 02:10:35,529
So we have to take back that time and just say, OK, this is how we're going to do it.

1605
02:10:35,549 --> 02:10:36,530
We're going to slow it down.

1606
02:10:37,128 --> 02:10:44,816
We'll have a waiting room for people to wait for the results and we'll work as a team to make sure we cross check before we release anything.

1607
02:10:45,537 --> 02:10:45,837
Heard.

1608
02:10:45,997 --> 02:10:47,219
Thank you and I appreciate that.

1609
02:10:48,256 --> 02:10:51,698
You saw that, that's a cross-reference we had here on December 9th.

1610
02:10:51,978 --> 02:10:53,718
Right, and that was really valuable to have.

1611
02:10:53,738 --> 02:10:55,819
That's exactly how we did it.

1612
02:10:55,839 --> 02:10:58,240
For those who were present, that's what we did.

1613
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:05,843
You call the number, and somebody double-check and see exactly what was the number, and call that number on another piece.

1614
02:11:06,063 --> 02:11:13,686
So that means there's three steps to verify, make good verification that the number call was the actual number.

1615
02:11:13,766 --> 02:11:13,967
Right.

1616
02:11:14,407 --> 02:11:17,608
And then I think, you know, so that makes sense in terms of getting them out.

1617
02:11:18,055 --> 02:11:39,431
I think just in terms of the other piece of it, which is making sure machines aren't zeroed out early and making sure machines are zeroed out before the day starts, because that seems to have been how we got to the point of the recount and the disparities and discrepancies between some precincts were undercount, some precincts were overcount.

1618
02:11:40,066 --> 02:11:52,655
You know, in some sense, I'm glad we did the recount because I got a hundred more votes, but you know, it's, it's, it should never, never, ever, you know, that, that, that is the other piece of this question that really, I think we need to flesh out.

1619
02:11:52,876 --> 02:11:58,800
And I think there's some in here procedurally making sure that that doesn't happen, but that's where that other piece of error can happen.

1620
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:07,646
And then, and then, you know, that's that little tally list where people can then take that and use it for, for other, say other things about it or

1621
02:12:08,527 --> 02:12:10,670
be honest and say, I'm concerned there's six things.

1622
02:12:11,110 --> 02:12:18,778
I'd like to see the recount because it, you know, it didn't change who was elected, but it changed the results of the election in a significant way.

1623
02:12:18,799 --> 02:12:20,440
100 votes is not insignificant.

1624
02:12:21,081 --> 02:12:23,023
Yes, Manager Ripley, I have one last thing when you're done.

1625
02:12:23,324 --> 02:12:28,910
Okay, so I do want to say that we were in the process of auditing the results.

1626
02:12:29,110 --> 02:12:30,011
We would have seen the

1627
02:12:30,481 --> 02:12:39,947
the blanks in the sheet much faster, but because we had the recount petition, we had to put on hold going through and auditing the results.

1628
02:12:40,707 --> 02:12:52,094
So, because we had to jump into the hoops after the 10, you know, we had to wait 10 days to get the, sorry, the recount petitions.

1629
02:12:52,835 --> 02:12:59,319
We had to wait the 10 days, and then we had to work with legal counsel in order to make sure that we were following all the protocols for the recount.

1630
02:12:59,975 --> 02:13:11,584
So we would have been able to give you more detailed and more accurate data with regards to the blanks if we'd had more bandwidth and more time and not the recount.

1631
02:13:11,644 --> 02:13:18,148
So my apologies that we weren't able to do that cross-check, but that is the reason why we weren't able to do the cross-check.

1632
02:13:19,489 --> 02:13:20,530
Got it, and I appreciate that.

1633
02:13:21,091 --> 02:13:22,392
And I appreciate the discussion.

1634
02:13:22,412 --> 02:13:28,036
I don't want to end on a little bit of a down note, but I think it really, and to me it's not so much

1635
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:38,083
I really hope that the mayor and the chief of staff are listening here when we talk about the need for additional staffing and resources for the department.

1636
02:13:39,673 --> 02:13:54,527
came to my attention this evening, people noticed we were talking about the election, that a communication went out, I'm not sure if it was with the census or not, that says offices that are on the November 2024 ballot and offices that aren't on the November 2024 ballot.

1637
02:13:54,967 --> 02:14:00,152
And it says offices items not on the November 2024 ballot, state senator and state representative.

1638
02:14:00,852 --> 02:14:03,293
And those are on the November 2024 ballot.

1639
02:14:03,753 --> 02:14:06,895
And it also has the districts are swapped, right?

1640
02:14:06,975 --> 02:14:10,436
It has the Senate district as representative, the representative district as Senate district.

1641
02:14:11,837 --> 02:14:17,319
It's not the end of the world, but it's not the level of

1642
02:14:19,227 --> 02:14:22,849
accurate information that we want to be putting out there at all times to the process.

1643
02:14:23,509 --> 02:14:39,618
And when we have four elections in a year, and then a recount on top of it, and then we're sorting through everything in the basement, and we have the new commission from the registrar, it's like, I understand the circumstances that get us to a place where an error like that happens.

1644
02:14:40,119 --> 02:14:44,161
I understand where the circumstances get us to a place where some of the errors happened in November.

1645
02:14:44,281 --> 02:14:47,783
And I understand that there's a really good faith attempt here to really try to correct them.

1646
02:14:48,243 --> 02:14:55,110
But I don't think it's fair to put up on you guys to fix everything, to say you have what you have, fix everything.

1647
02:14:55,811 --> 02:14:57,593
And so that's my call.

1648
02:14:57,613 --> 02:15:02,538
I may be stepping a little bit outside the boundaries of the role of the chair tonight with this discussion.

1649
02:15:02,779 --> 02:15:04,621
Obviously, I'm passionate about it and I've looked into it.

1650
02:15:06,062 --> 02:15:13,888
But I really, really think we need to, as part of the sit down, hear more of the details about the checks and processes we're going to put in place.

1651
02:15:13,928 --> 02:15:14,949
I hear that in good faith.

1652
02:15:15,509 --> 02:15:26,157
But the level of resources and staff support that is needed to effectively do the work of your office, and that we had prior to the transition from this model to this new model,

1653
02:15:26,697 --> 02:15:29,079
it isn't in place, and there's things that slip.

1654
02:15:29,139 --> 02:15:33,343
And now the checklist for this election, we're not at six, but now we're at one.

1655
02:15:34,043 --> 02:15:50,176
And that's just where, again, I don't, I think that to get the same answer back, and I understand that you can't appropriate new funds, but to get the same answer back, we're gonna try to hire for this position we haven't been able to hire for for a year, and we're gonna try to get more people onto the pre-election team.

1656
02:15:51,263 --> 02:15:52,745
I don't think that's a sufficient answer.

1657
02:15:53,305 --> 02:15:55,307
So I appreciate you hearing me say that.

1658
02:15:55,407 --> 02:16:03,056
I know maybe agree or disagree or can't agree or can't disagree the powers that be hear that.

1659
02:16:03,636 --> 02:16:06,740
And I hope that at least in private, they can hear it from everyone involved.

1660
02:16:08,541 --> 02:16:10,744
We are advocating for

1661
02:16:11,775 --> 02:16:13,256
to fill that part-time position.

1662
02:16:13,316 --> 02:16:15,178
And the HR department is working on it.

1663
02:16:15,418 --> 02:16:19,341
As we speak, there are five candidates to be reviewed.

1664
02:16:19,501 --> 02:16:20,982
So they are working on it.

1665
02:16:21,162 --> 02:16:21,442
OK.

1666
02:16:21,822 --> 02:16:22,483
That's good to hear.

1667
02:16:23,824 --> 02:16:26,046
Any further comments from counselors?

1668
02:16:26,426 --> 02:16:29,068
And I appreciate your deference to me on this topic.

1669
02:16:29,208 --> 02:16:30,349
Counselor, Vice President Collins.

1670
02:16:31,257 --> 02:16:31,977
Thank you, President Barris.

1671
02:16:32,017 --> 02:16:35,259
I want to again thank you for the level of depth in this conversation tonight.

1672
02:16:35,399 --> 02:16:44,964
And, you know, I know that there's always an appetite for going deeper and working together to help us better understand the workings of your office and go over

1673
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:54,885
your goings-on, you know, talking about successes as well as the problems that, you know, I know that we have a shared goal of shoring up every year.

1674
02:16:55,406 --> 02:17:02,850
And I'm glad to end this conversation or put a pin in it for now, you know, on the issue of resources and capacity.

1675
02:17:02,990 --> 02:17:09,234
And I think in our ongoing conversations, I think that we'd all, you know, benefit from taking the time when it's available.

1676
02:17:10,355 --> 02:17:11,456
Certainly I can understand that

1677
02:17:12,196 --> 02:17:14,457
November didn't go the way that any of us thought that it would.

1678
02:17:15,258 --> 02:17:16,458
And of course, that has an impact.

1679
02:17:16,498 --> 02:17:18,179
There's a limited number of hours in the day.

1680
02:17:21,281 --> 02:17:31,406
To have those conversations about the specificity that we're looking for so we can have that transparency piece, the prescription, the what would fix it, and a prescription is not a solution.

1681
02:17:31,546 --> 02:17:35,488
You know, the solution is we're going to get the prescription will be implemented.

1682
02:17:35,528 --> 02:17:39,950
And I know that that is a multi-agency effort.

1683
02:17:39,990 --> 02:17:41,091
So I'm hoping that we can

1684
02:17:43,268 --> 02:17:44,128
What was that?

1685
02:17:45,669 --> 02:17:48,030
I'm looking forward to that collaboration.

1686
02:17:48,050 --> 02:17:49,851
And thank you for your, thank you for your willingness.

1687
02:17:50,832 --> 02:17:52,253
And I appreciate all the candor.

1688
02:17:52,733 --> 02:17:53,353
I really do.

1689
02:17:53,613 --> 02:17:55,614
This is not a, it's a process.

1690
02:17:55,735 --> 02:17:58,556
It's ever evolving and there's always new ways to look at things.

1691
02:17:58,676 --> 02:17:59,617
So I do appreciate it.

1692
02:17:59,997 --> 02:18:00,977
Thank you.

1693
02:18:01,197 --> 02:18:01,898
Councilor Scarpelli.

1694
02:18:03,479 --> 02:18:06,202
I just want to say thank you, because I think that this is uncomfortable.

1695
02:18:06,702 --> 02:18:10,085
I mean, I think we all mean, we all have the same intention.

1696
02:18:10,145 --> 02:18:17,993
I think everybody here loves Medford, and there was nothing done with any ill will or intent.

1697
02:18:18,073 --> 02:18:27,322
So I think that you coming here tonight is a huge step that starts that healing in this, in the fact of those people that I told you about that really affect that.

1698
02:18:28,601 --> 02:18:29,602
No one's hiding anything.

1699
02:18:29,822 --> 02:18:36,685
You're in front of us as a commission and the commissioner and say, hey, this is what we need to do in this council.

1700
02:18:36,905 --> 02:18:44,309
Look ourselves in the mirror, like my father taught us in his Jesuit schooling, that you always look

1701
02:18:45,149 --> 02:18:51,693
at the person that you're looking at and put yourself in their shoes and say, what do you, how would you do that?

1702
02:18:51,713 --> 02:18:54,175
And make sure you understand the process.

1703
02:18:54,215 --> 02:19:03,721
So I think that that's why I'm stressing the subcommittees and sitting down and truly being part of it because, you know, even just to hear the fact that, you know,

1704
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:12,765
while we're going through the process of recount, we still don't have enough staff to still even try to do something to assist them by moving forward.

1705
02:19:12,805 --> 02:19:21,110
So I really do appreciate you coming out tonight and giving us these answers.

1706
02:19:21,150 --> 02:19:23,951
We're always looking for people to help in the elections office.

1707
02:19:24,011 --> 02:19:29,095
You know what, I would like to bounce here, Justin Singh, for the presidential election.

1708
02:19:30,376 --> 02:19:31,216
I thank you.

1709
02:19:31,676 --> 02:19:32,937
No, not that one.

1710
02:19:32,997 --> 02:19:33,757
Oh, no, not that one.

1711
02:19:33,777 --> 02:19:34,657
Not the presidential.

1712
02:19:34,677 --> 02:19:36,258
No, that's not going to be contentious at all.

1713
02:19:36,278 --> 02:19:38,359
Well, I hear they're having a blast in New Hampshire.

1714
02:19:38,379 --> 02:19:44,401
For reference, at the time, Counsel Zach, in his first term, he tried to work on the election.

1715
02:19:44,461 --> 02:19:45,221
He got thrown out.

1716
02:19:45,601 --> 02:19:45,981
I know.

1717
02:19:46,561 --> 02:19:47,102
I know, I did.

1718
02:19:47,122 --> 02:19:48,902
He wasn't the first person you threw out.

1719
02:19:48,922 --> 02:19:52,363
No, but, you know, it's like, oh, all hands on deck, and suddenly my hands are not allowed.

1720
02:19:54,104 --> 02:19:54,924
I think we get something.

1721
02:19:55,084 --> 02:19:55,985
Ah, the ultimate wisdom.

1722
02:19:57,245 --> 02:19:59,026
None of you are on the ballot in March.

1723
02:19:59,406 --> 02:20:05,528
Well, I am from Ward Committee and I'm pretty sure that means I think that was the exact situation, right?

1724
02:20:05,548 --> 02:20:08,629
It's like, oh, the very uncontested Ward Committee.

1725
02:20:10,810 --> 02:20:11,790
Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

1726
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:14,971
Any further questions, comments from councillors?

1727
02:20:17,412 --> 02:20:21,554
Anything you guys want to add or any comments from members of the public in the room or on Zoom?

1728
02:20:21,594 --> 02:20:25,355
You can raise your hand if you're on Zoom or stand if you're here in person.

1729
02:20:29,770 --> 02:20:31,451
All right, seeing none, thank you very much.

1730
02:20:32,031 --> 02:20:57,066
On the motion to refer this report to the Governance Committee to meet with Commission and staff and discuss, check in on any needs and discuss how the Council can be supportive to make sure that these issues are addressed and that resources are provided to the Elections Commission, seconded by Councilor Zaro.

1731
02:20:57,846 --> 02:20:58,727
All those in favor?

1732
02:21:00,501 --> 02:21:01,181
All opposed?

1733
02:21:02,121 --> 02:21:03,542
Motion passes, thank you very much.

1734
02:21:08,883 --> 02:21:10,764
Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business?

1735
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:14,885
All in favor of the motion of Councilor Sang, to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by?

1736
02:21:15,285 --> 02:21:15,565
Second.

1737
02:21:16,365 --> 02:21:17,946
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1738
02:21:17,986 --> 02:21:18,746
All those in favor?

1739
02:21:18,766 --> 02:21:18,906
Aye.

1740
02:21:19,206 --> 02:21:20,306
Aye, opposed?

1741
02:21:20,866 --> 02:21:21,627
Motion passes.

1742
02:21:21,647 --> 02:21:22,267
24-018.

1743
02:21:22,287 --> 02:21:24,227
President Pierce?

1744
02:21:24,947 --> 02:21:25,808
Yes, Councilor Collins.

1745
02:21:25,868 --> 02:21:26,848
I'd like to withdraw the motion.

1746
02:21:27,570 --> 02:21:30,835
on 24-018 by Councillor Collins is withdrawn.

1747
02:21:33,418 --> 02:21:35,321
Councillor, 24-019 offered by Councillor Sang.

1748
02:21:35,341 --> 02:21:36,122
Give me a second here.

1749
02:21:44,056 --> 02:21:58,447
Be it resolved by the City Council of the City of Medford, pursuant to Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 71, Section 52, that the following rates of compensation be set for members of the Medford School Committee effective on July 1, 2024, school committee member from $12,000 to $17,052.80.

1750
02:22:04,731 --> 02:22:06,172

1751
02:22:06,613 --> 02:22:08,134
School Committee Secretary from 14,400 to 19,075.

1752
02:22:08,174 --> 02:22:09,635
School Committee Chairperson from 13,200 to 18,750.

1753
02:22:09,695 --> 02:22:14,339
Be it resolved by the City Council of the City of Medford pursuant to Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 71, Section 52,

1754
02:22:28,050 --> 02:22:32,154
that the following rates of compensation be set for members of the Medford School Committee effective of July 1, 2025.

1755
02:22:32,214 --> 02:22:33,835
School committee member from $17,052.80 to $22,105.60.

1756
02:22:34,315 --> 02:22:35,416
School committee vice chair from $17,900 to $23,200.

1757
02:22:47,066 --> 02:22:48,827
School Committee Secretary from $19,075 to $23,750.

1758
02:22:48,867 --> 02:22:50,387
School Committee Chairperson from $18,750 to $24,300.

1759
02:22:50,828 --> 02:22:51,648
Fiscal impact in fiscal 2025 is $35,736.20.

1760
02:22:51,688 --> 02:22:52,989
Fiscal impact into fiscal year 2026 is $71,472.40.

1761
02:22:53,029 --> 02:22:53,469
Councillor Seng.

1762
02:22:53,489 --> 02:22:53,809
Thank you.

1763
02:23:15,703 --> 02:23:17,664
to introduce this proposal.

1764
02:23:19,045 --> 02:23:21,426
Let me give some background about how I arrived at these numbers.

1765
02:23:22,687 --> 02:23:38,236
I reached out to, I looked at what former and current school committee members have said in their statements about their thoughts on the original proposal by former President Morrell in December of last year.

1766
02:23:38,677 --> 02:23:40,858
I also reached out to various teachers,

1767
02:23:41,538 --> 02:23:46,422
and school staff to see what people were willing to compromise to.

1768
02:23:47,102 --> 02:23:59,791
And at the end of the day, I arrived at this, this proposal, which essentially increases over two years, the salary of school community members to approximately $22,100.

1769
02:24:02,272 --> 02:24:14,940
which is in line with the research I've done with Medford Teacher Association contracts over the last 25 years, going year by year, line by line, and matching their pay increases.

1770
02:24:15,941 --> 02:24:17,702
This proposal would essentially stop

1771
02:24:18,522 --> 02:24:22,645
in 2025 and so there would be no increase after that.

1772
02:24:23,266 --> 02:24:32,333
It also, in contrast to the original proposal, phases in this increase over two years instead of having it start immediately upon passage.

1773
02:24:33,494 --> 02:24:42,401
This is time, I believe, will give us a chance to finalize our financial picture and make sure it's in line with the information that we're hearing from finance staff currently.

1774
02:24:43,541 --> 02:24:44,702
It also gives us

1775
02:24:45,723 --> 02:24:58,424
a chance to start paraprofessional negotiations throughout the process to make sure that we address that part of the criticism with the original proposal.

1776
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:18,011
I have to emphasize that this is a compromise that we arrived at after engaging stakeholders, and that I believe that this is a compromise built off some logical ground, which is that of the previous MTA contract increases.

1777
02:25:19,412 --> 02:25:21,393
I believe that this is a reasonable compromise.

1778
02:25:22,454 --> 02:25:31,378
Not everyone will be happy with this, surely, and I'm sure that there are folks who would have liked this number to be higher, would have liked this number to be lower.

1779
02:25:33,058 --> 02:25:41,802
This compromise, I know, also doesn't live up to all of the ideals that we may hold both on this side of the rail and on the other side of the rail.

1780
02:25:42,563 --> 02:25:42,743
But

1781
02:25:44,861 --> 02:25:46,042
So goes compromise.

1782
02:25:46,402 --> 02:25:47,483
This is the nature of work.

1783
02:25:48,203 --> 02:25:50,905
And we must be politically responsible actors here.

1784
02:25:51,445 --> 02:25:56,528
We must also, instead of viewing this as a compromise that we can live with,

1785
02:25:57,682 --> 02:26:01,084
understand that this compromise can be a win-win if we take advantage of it.

1786
02:26:01,564 --> 02:26:11,170
If stakeholders can take advantage of it, we can lift up by lifting up one set of workers for schools, all workers for schools as well.

1787
02:26:11,711 --> 02:26:14,452
And that's why I believe that we should pass this tonight.

1788
02:26:14,673 --> 02:26:14,953
Thank you.

1789
02:26:16,069 --> 02:26:16,990
Thank you, Councillor Sang.

1790
02:26:17,670 --> 02:26:24,296
Just before we continue, I do want to note that this has been reviewed for form and the motions are worded properly.

1791
02:26:26,838 --> 02:26:33,104
Pursuant to General Law, Chapter 71, Section 52, this requires a majority vote.

1792
02:26:36,090 --> 02:26:39,271
and is not an ordinance and will be, does not require three readings.

1793
02:26:39,651 --> 02:26:40,211
Mr. President.

1794
02:26:40,492 --> 02:26:43,052
Councilor Starkley, then Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Collins.

1795
02:26:43,172 --> 02:27:00,738
Thank you, so just, I know that some information that, first I want to share, I think that one of the questions was the fees of the structure for the 2024 paraprofessional wage scale pursuant to Method Public Schools from their records of proposal.

1796
02:27:00,778 --> 02:27:04,980
So it's given the, just for a point of information that

1797
02:27:05,740 --> 02:27:08,843
the kindergarten aids right now.

1798
02:27:09,464 --> 02:27:20,455
One of the questions was if there was one, one group that one paraprofessional group that was making less than what was going to be asked that this would be this would be a question.

1799
02:27:20,655 --> 02:27:24,840
I think that they paraprofessionals stand at $20,500 with their contract ending.

1800
02:27:29,224 --> 02:27:32,567
this year, so they'll be negotiating again as we move forward.

1801
02:27:32,647 --> 02:27:41,934
So I, for one, I will applaud the effort by Councilor Sang of finding common ground.

1802
02:27:42,094 --> 02:27:44,396
I think you've done your due diligence, I will tell you.

1803
02:27:44,977 --> 02:27:53,844
I applaud that immensely for the fact that you listened and you tried to get to a resolution.

1804
02:27:54,104 --> 02:27:57,707
I will tell you I will not support it for the fact that I really think that

1805
02:27:58,948 --> 02:27:59,828
until we really know.

1806
02:27:59,848 --> 02:28:09,151
I think if this resolution and this compromise came after understanding what our budget looks like, even for a dollar, I think that I would support it wholeheartedly.

1807
02:28:09,191 --> 02:28:10,172
I will be honest with you with that.

1808
02:28:10,192 --> 02:28:16,754
I think that this is the sense of compromise that I wish that the teachers and paraprofessionals were there moving forward.

1809
02:28:16,774 --> 02:28:22,676
And I think that this gives, like you said, I think that this gives our

1810
02:28:23,709 --> 02:28:37,801
school committee and administration the same, hopefully the same type of attitude and mentality when it comes to supporting and rewarding our teachers that need it the most and that's mostly our paraprofessionals that are getting the short end of the stick right now.

1811
02:28:37,881 --> 02:28:38,501
So I think that

1812
02:28:39,582 --> 02:28:42,304
Again, like I said, I want to applaud that.

1813
02:28:42,384 --> 02:28:50,810
But at the same time, I think that not knowing our fiscal situation right now is the reason why I can't move forward with this.

1814
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:52,331
So I thank you.

1815
02:28:52,591 --> 02:28:57,875
And like, again, I'll say it again, that's a very, very well thought compromise.

1816
02:28:57,955 --> 02:29:02,158
And I'm sure that the teachers will feel that as well.

1817
02:29:02,238 --> 02:29:02,678
So thank you.

1818
02:29:06,201 --> 02:29:07,242
Thank you, Councilor Cabello.

1819
02:29:09,141 --> 02:29:09,421
Thank you.

1820
02:29:10,121 --> 02:29:13,183
It's been 24 years since a school committee has gotten a pay raise.

1821
02:29:13,343 --> 02:29:15,824
I believe that the school committee is overdue for one.

1822
02:29:16,645 --> 02:29:22,368
We need the school committee to be paid enough to ensure that enough people run so that elections are competitive.

1823
02:29:22,908 --> 02:29:30,912
We need the pay to be enough to attract people who are less wealthy, people who cannot afford to spend up to 20 hours a week doing something that

1824
02:29:31,332 --> 02:29:32,834
you know, doesn't pay or pays very little.

1825
02:29:34,116 --> 02:29:42,606
I see raising the school committee salary as a pro-democracy reform along with many other types of pro-democracy reforms that I will mention later.

1826
02:29:42,626 --> 02:29:48,893
Reforms that I have presented in communities across the country for seven years that are deeply important to me.

1827
02:29:49,934 --> 02:29:54,798
As I said last time, pro-democracy means not just people who are willing or dedicated.

1828
02:29:55,118 --> 02:30:01,582
It means having people sitting in those seats who represent, for example, the lower 50% of wage earners in our city.

1829
02:30:01,982 --> 02:30:05,465
These are not the people who usually run for or win elected office.

1830
02:30:06,986 --> 02:30:14,190
Pro-democracy reforms usually happen in the next cycle because it is not about paying the people currently sitting in those seats.

1831
02:30:14,410 --> 02:30:16,572
It is about getting diverse people to run.

1832
02:30:17,774 --> 02:30:26,181
Many cities and states have it in their laws that any change in salary for elected officials cannot go into effect within the same electoral cycle.

1833
02:30:27,602 --> 02:30:29,303
I did not look hard for these, right?

1834
02:30:29,344 --> 02:30:35,909
So just in three minutes of Google searching, Illinois and Georgia both have state laws for all municipal elected officials.

1835
02:30:36,827 --> 02:30:40,989
stating that you cannot raise the pay within that electoral cycle.

1836
02:30:41,710 --> 02:30:57,277
Even in Massachusetts, and again, no exhaustive search, Watertown and Everett both have city codes that say that any pay increase for school committees specifically must be voted on in the first 18 months of the cycle and cannot take effect until the next cycle.

1837
02:31:00,103 --> 02:31:08,973
On the question of pay parity, I tried to find examples of pay parity between school committees and city councils discussed anywhere.

1838
02:31:08,993 --> 02:31:10,215
I found almost nothing.

1839
02:31:11,236 --> 02:31:15,961
No well-known elected officials, no organizations that I've heard of or haven't heard of discussing this issue.

1840
02:31:15,982 --> 02:31:18,364
It came up for a vote in Fall River.

1841
02:31:19,125 --> 02:31:22,708
a proposal to bring the school committee pay up to the city council pay, it did not pass.

1842
02:31:23,568 --> 02:31:41,141
In Worcester, there was one school committee member who wanted for the school committee to be paid the same as city council, but that is not allowed by the city charter, which in Worcester states that the salary for members of the school committee will be equal to 50% of the salary established for members of the city council.

1843
02:31:41,502 --> 02:31:43,023
So unless they change the city charter,

1844
02:31:43,427 --> 02:31:44,268
They cannot do that.

1845
02:31:45,129 --> 02:31:51,818
And I will say that across the country, school committees getting paid 50 percent of the city council is pretty standard.

1846
02:31:52,158 --> 02:31:53,180
That doesn't make it right.

1847
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:53,981
Right.

1848
02:31:54,561 --> 02:31:55,743
But it is the norm.

1849
02:31:59,013 --> 02:32:03,654
I also tried to find anyone talking about this issue as one of parity between men and women.

1850
02:32:04,414 --> 02:32:09,915
I could not find, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I could not find anyone talking about this issue.

1851
02:32:10,996 --> 02:32:11,956
I did look up some numbers.

1852
02:32:12,136 --> 02:32:20,018
So according to the National School Boards Association, 51% of school board members are men, 49% are women.

1853
02:32:20,838 --> 02:32:25,679
We should note that this is a much higher percentage of women than in other elected bodies.

1854
02:32:26,320 --> 02:32:31,252
28% of Congress is women, 33% of state legislatures are women, 32% of city councils are women.

1855
02:32:37,825 --> 02:32:43,048
Northampton, which is a pretty progressive city, commissioned a study on compensation for elected officials in 2014.

1856
02:32:43,108 --> 02:32:45,029
That's a little while ago.

1857
02:32:45,769 --> 02:32:48,831
The end result was a recommendation that they pay their city councilors $17,000.

1858
02:32:49,111 --> 02:32:51,812
That was a raise for both city council and school committee.

1859
02:32:52,052 --> 02:32:54,374
That they pay their school committee members $9,000.

1860
02:32:54,854 --> 02:32:59,156
They have less than half the people living in Northampton as we have in Medford.

1861
02:32:59,476 --> 02:33:00,417
It was 10 years ago.

1862
02:33:00,677 --> 02:33:02,818
I don't think that we should look at those specific numbers.

1863
02:33:03,837 --> 02:33:09,801
But it is interesting to note that their commission did have a difference in pay between the city council and the school committee.

1864
02:33:10,221 --> 02:33:30,173
I am not stating that this is right, that school committees across the country are paid approximately 50%, but there appears to be nobody except for us here and in Fall River, even discussing this issue.

1865
02:33:32,605 --> 02:33:37,526
I believe without a doubt that a pay increase for the Medford School Committee is long overdue.

1866
02:33:37,546 --> 02:33:48,089
I personally believe there are many reasons why it is appropriate that pay increases for any elected officials come take effect the next cycle.

1867
02:33:48,989 --> 02:33:50,169
I would like to make a motion.

1868
02:33:50,309 --> 02:33:51,129
It's somewhat long.

1869
02:33:51,269 --> 02:33:57,031
I can email it to the clerk, the president, the vice president, or whoever is appropriate.

1870
02:33:58,775 --> 02:34:03,519
If it is possible to vote on it tonight, that would be great, but if not, that's fine.

1871
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:09,684
My motion is to send the following pro-democracy reforms to study in the Governance Committee.

1872
02:34:10,565 --> 02:34:22,916
Salaries for elected officials, public financing of elections, rank choice voting for single elected offices, allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote, and allowing non-citizen residents to vote.

1873
02:34:24,165 --> 02:34:42,980
along with that, a request that the Governance Committee prioritize the salary discussion and come to a recommendation on this issue before December 31st of 2024, so that the City Council can vote on whether to implement those salaries starting January of 2026, which is the beginning of the next electoral cycle.

1874
02:34:43,861 --> 02:34:52,588
Also a request that the Governance Committee consider the following factors in their salary recommendations, in addition to any others they deem important,

1875
02:34:53,018 --> 02:34:59,940
getting enough people to run so that elections are competitive, enabling less wealthy people to hold elected office, and gender pay parity.

1876
02:34:59,960 --> 02:35:06,723
Thank you, Councillor Callaghan.

1877
02:35:07,743 --> 02:35:15,706
Just to summarize, I think that was a motion to refer to the Governance Committee a number of democracy reforms.

1878
02:35:15,746 --> 02:35:21,508
If you have that in typed form, if you could send that to myself and to the clerk, that would be great.

1879
02:35:23,243 --> 02:35:24,483
Is there a second on that motion?

1880
02:35:27,164 --> 02:35:27,524
Second.

1881
02:35:28,264 --> 02:35:29,784
Seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1882
02:35:30,884 --> 02:35:33,305
And I will go now to Councilor Collins.

1883
02:35:34,585 --> 02:35:39,746
And by the way, that motion is a B paper, which means it's a separate paper that will be referred out.

1884
02:35:39,766 --> 02:35:41,006
It will get a new paper number.

1885
02:35:41,566 --> 02:35:42,487
And we'll go to the committee.

1886
02:35:42,607 --> 02:35:43,907
Council Vice President Collins.

1887
02:35:44,687 --> 02:35:46,327
Thank you.

1888
02:35:46,827 --> 02:35:48,128
Appreciate the discussion around this.

1889
02:35:50,999 --> 02:35:56,145
either the third or the fourth time that we've discussed this in these chambers.

1890
02:35:57,547 --> 02:36:02,833
And I, as we've said before, I appreciate the dialogue with my colleagues about this.

1891
02:36:02,853 --> 02:36:07,999
I appreciate the very many community members that we've heard from about this.

1892
02:36:10,370 --> 02:36:18,255
I withdrew my motion and I'll second Councilor Seng's motion because I believe that this is the most actionable compromise that we have on the table right now.

1893
02:36:18,796 --> 02:36:20,477
My alternative proposal went even further.

1894
02:36:20,757 --> 02:36:23,979
It would have achieved pay parity between the school committee and the city council by 2027.

1895
02:36:24,019 --> 02:36:34,746
As I've said at the beginning of all of our conversations on this topic, I really believe that pay equity between the school committee and the city council is the right thing to do.

1896
02:36:34,826 --> 02:36:35,967
And I think that somebody has to be the

1897
02:36:36,747 --> 02:36:37,789
First person to do the right thing.

1898
02:36:37,829 --> 02:36:39,753
I don't know if that'll be us.

1899
02:36:39,933 --> 02:36:41,395
I think that we need to move the ball forward.

1900
02:36:43,570 --> 02:36:51,097
As a counselor, I don't know what the, I don't know what a day in the life of a school committee member looks like, but I know a little bit about the role.

1901
02:36:51,197 --> 02:36:53,599
And I know that the role is different in every community.

1902
02:36:54,440 --> 02:36:57,163
I know a little bit about what it means in our city from our charter.

1903
02:36:58,564 --> 02:37:00,025
And I believe that our roles are equivalent.

1904
02:37:00,185 --> 02:37:02,287
I believe that the role of the school committee is mission critical.

1905
02:37:03,168 --> 02:37:05,490
I believe that there's no space for passivity in that role.

1906
02:37:05,530 --> 02:37:07,933
And that's why I believe that our role should be paid equally.

1907
02:37:08,833 --> 02:37:19,686
Um, so this proposal advances compensation for school committee members at percentages that are aligned with MTA contract increases over the past 24 years.

1908
02:37:21,107 --> 02:37:23,170
In any case, I think, you know,

1909
02:37:24,379 --> 02:37:25,500
to the headlines of this issue.

1910
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:30,245
It's been 24 years since there's been a pay adjustment for the school committee.

1911
02:37:32,527 --> 02:37:37,332
This is a one-time adjustment spread out over two years, and then it stops.

1912
02:37:37,892 --> 02:37:41,976
We've already referred to the governance committee, apart from the

1913
02:37:42,937 --> 02:37:58,145
motion that will vote on from Councilor Callahan, the recommendation to study within the concept of our, sorry, within the review of our city charter, which we'll be doing later this year, a mechanism for triggering some sort of automatic or regular evaluation of all elected salaries.

1914
02:37:58,585 --> 02:37:59,486
And I think that's important.

1915
02:38:00,655 --> 02:38:15,485
not so that the salaries necessarily go up, but I think that part of the issue here has been, since there was not any sort of regular mechanism other than the city council deigning to consider an increase, we've gone 24 years without considering it.

1916
02:38:15,665 --> 02:38:21,229
And that's why the initial proposal was for a triple-digit percentage increase, because we had so much time to make up for.

1917
02:38:24,096 --> 02:38:39,510
So with all that being said, I'm glad that we're going to have that conversation later this year so that we can continue having this conversation about how to align compensation with our goals and our values and how to promote the elected bodies that our community deserves.

1918
02:38:41,611 --> 02:38:50,479
And I'm looking forward to voting on compensation increase, one that I believe is fair and reasonable and very certainly the product of compromise tonight.

1919
02:38:50,619 --> 02:38:51,240
So thank you very much.

1920
02:38:55,339 --> 02:38:57,300
Thank you, Councillor Collins.

1921
02:38:57,521 --> 02:39:00,103
Any other comments from members of the Council?

1922
02:39:00,123 --> 02:39:19,337
All right, then I will give my comment just shortly, which is I think that it is a long overdue action, and while it does not address all of my concerns or meet all of my principles, sometimes that is what a compromise looks like.

1923
02:39:19,897 --> 02:39:20,618
I also want to add

1924
02:39:21,630 --> 02:39:29,097
We're voting on this, and then it's back to where we were, which is the Council may deign at any point to maybe consider at some point looking at this.

1925
02:39:29,578 --> 02:39:31,360
Yes, we have some motions to talk about it.

1926
02:39:31,380 --> 02:39:32,621
Yes, we have some motions this or that.

1927
02:39:33,161 --> 02:39:34,703
But that's what we're voting on.

1928
02:39:34,723 --> 02:39:38,807
We're voting on a half measure to get some of the way towards a further goal.

1929
02:39:42,998 --> 02:39:48,623
It leaves it right in the hands of the council in 20 years to let this go for 20 years and never address it again.

1930
02:39:48,643 --> 02:39:50,945
And then we're there again, but that's where we are.

1931
02:39:52,105 --> 02:40:01,913
So this will be put to rest other than the fact that we will have some discussions around the classification and compensation study, some discussions around the city charter.

1932
02:40:02,694 --> 02:40:06,677
Maybe there'll be some action that comes out of that, but this is what it is.

1933
02:40:06,797 --> 02:40:09,119
So there'll be, if this is approved,

1934
02:40:10,652 --> 02:40:18,555
raises this year in July 1 fiscal year 25 and fiscal year 26 to address 23 years of no change in compensation.

1935
02:40:19,935 --> 02:40:23,917
Given no further comment from members of the council, we'll go to members of the public.

1936
02:40:24,457 --> 02:40:27,498
You can come to the podium and give your name and address for the record.

1937
02:40:28,158 --> 02:40:29,598
You can also raise your hand on Zoom.

1938
02:40:29,638 --> 02:40:32,479
We will alternate between the podium and Zoom.

1939
02:40:32,499 --> 02:40:34,080
Name and address for the record, please.

1940
02:40:34,300 --> 02:40:36,521
Hi, Patrick Clerken, 50 Princeton Street.

1941
02:40:37,982 --> 02:40:39,743
A lot of great comments made here tonight.

1942
02:40:39,943 --> 02:40:54,233
I just wanted to add the comment that I felt like I think we've gotten significantly past this, but I think when this was first brought up by Nicole back in December, the initial argument for it.

1943
02:40:55,120 --> 02:41:17,047
was a little bit reductionistic in the sense of bringing pay parity between council and the committee, just because I understand historically the difference between men and women and that still exists to some extent, but because the committee and the council are both mixed at this point, it's a little bit comparing apples to oranges.

1944
02:41:17,807 --> 02:41:22,669
So I wanted to request if possible, just for public edification,

1945
02:41:23,909 --> 02:41:38,719
a simple diagram that compares basically what council does and what school committee does and how they should be potentially brought up to equity or not.

1946
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:42,322
Is it based on the hours worked overall?

1947
02:41:42,382 --> 02:41:44,764
Is it based on the content of the work?

1948
02:41:44,864 --> 02:41:48,466
Because it's not necessarily the same.

1949
02:41:50,706 --> 02:42:02,164
I don't know for sure what, and I think probably a lot of people in Medford don't know for sure what each of these two bodies does, and so it would be difficult to understand

1950
02:42:04,110 --> 02:42:06,952
how they could be brought up to parity or if they should be brought up to parity.

1951
02:42:07,573 --> 02:42:27,308
And I just want to add that just like when you're talking to people and you meet them for the first time and you hear their name and it goes in one ear and out the other, a lot of the times if we don't have these diagrams or simple ways to understand these things, when you just hear the information in a stream, it just goes right out the other side.

1952
02:42:27,428 --> 02:42:28,789
So anything

1953
02:42:29,710 --> 02:42:35,454
with this issue and with future issues, that's like a simple diagram or something that could be posted in a public place would really help.

1954
02:42:35,695 --> 02:42:36,355
So thank you.

1955
02:42:37,356 --> 02:42:40,578
Thank you.

1956
02:42:40,598 --> 02:42:42,319
Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium.

1957
02:42:42,339 --> 02:42:43,560
Name and address for the record, please.

1958
02:42:43,941 --> 02:42:49,505
My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this August body.

1959
02:42:50,385 --> 02:42:56,250
First of all, let me start by saying, what does this pay raise have to do with education?

1960
02:42:57,142 --> 02:42:57,842
That's number one.

1961
02:42:57,902 --> 02:43:03,745
Number two, there's no demanding from the public for any pay raise for the school committee.

1962
02:43:03,785 --> 02:43:13,849
And lastly, there's no professional city population job description pay report that even substantiates or supports what the council has alluded to.

1963
02:43:14,829 --> 02:43:25,534
The gender issue that was alleged this past December is nothing more than a sexual red herring allegation of discrimination that has no merit to the issue before us.

1964
02:43:26,494 --> 02:43:27,955
The job is what the job is.

1965
02:43:27,995 --> 02:43:29,436
The responsibility is what it is.

1966
02:43:29,456 --> 02:43:32,018
It doesn't say it has to be male or female.

1967
02:43:33,660 --> 02:43:35,061
That's the red herring to the whole thing.

1968
02:43:35,541 --> 02:43:48,591
But if this proposal were to pass, should we now compare all our municipal positions with the same amount of financial equity and equality as compared to each position, especially with those having different responsibilities?

1969
02:43:49,052 --> 02:43:54,016
Fire, police, school teachers, they all have different job duties and responsibilities.

1970
02:43:54,841 --> 02:44:01,908
But if we're looking at something that's now saying the school committee should have equity pay to that of a city councilor, well, you're setting a standard here.

1971
02:44:02,388 --> 02:44:09,215
And this standard should be compared to, right now, what is presently found in your municipal contracts.

1972
02:44:09,275 --> 02:44:13,759
Additionally, if this proposal is to pass a comprehensive review,

1973
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:28,666
should be undertaking to set a years of service pay scale to be compatible with all of the municipal employee negotiations, comparing newly elected newcomers to both the city council and the school committee at the beginning of the pay scale formula.

1974
02:44:29,046 --> 02:44:37,750
Therefore, for the new members in the council, as compared to the new members on the school committee, why should either one of you reap the benefit of the maximum pay

1975
02:44:38,630 --> 02:44:44,372
when in fact all other municipal employees start at a base pay and they go through a process.

1976
02:44:45,112 --> 02:44:52,995
So if you're looking at this equity for both and all sides, then let the council and the school committee also be put in the same type of position.

1977
02:44:56,533 --> 02:45:24,051
Okay, as such by granting the city council additional type of raise without having increasing any educational value, without having any community support for it, and without any professional city population job description report only demonstrates the power of behind the scenes internal politics, where the power of the dollar personally overpowers the needs of our public school educational needs.

1978
02:45:24,972 --> 02:45:28,474
We have surrounding communities, and I took the six surrounding communities that we have.

1979
02:45:28,674 --> 02:45:30,895
Arlington, they get paid $3,000 a year.

1980
02:45:31,275 --> 02:45:32,396
Everett, they get paid $11,500.

1981
02:45:33,036 --> 02:45:33,937
Malden, they get paid $7,000.

1982
02:45:34,917 --> 02:45:35,818
Somerville, they get paid $16,600.

1983
02:45:36,218 --> 02:45:38,519
And Methodist, they get paid $12,000.

1984
02:45:38,639 --> 02:45:43,282
Methodist is the second highest paid school committee of the surrounding areas.

1985
02:45:44,468 --> 02:45:58,580
You serve in these jobs for the quality of giving good education to the community, not for how much money or you should be paid equal to that or in excess of our total to the amount of what a city councilor makes.

1986
02:45:59,321 --> 02:46:09,449
Last December, the pay concerns for paraprofessionals, classroom assistants, custodians, substitute teachers, et cetera, were discussed, but they've yet to be addressed.

1987
02:46:09,509 --> 02:46:11,131
This hall was full with almost 200 teachers.

1988
02:46:12,938 --> 02:46:21,950
At the city council, the school committee pay raise increase without any proposal to differentiate the differences between the city council and school committee responsibilities.

1989
02:46:22,090 --> 02:46:28,117
As the gentleman just stated, showing the need such raise or pay equality has yet to be proven.

1990
02:46:29,397 --> 02:46:34,441
Therefore, at last meeting on December 12, these were the issues that were of concern.

1991
02:46:35,261 --> 02:46:58,859
A, needing additional instructional hours for students, AP classes, class size needs, athletic programming, student activities, school library resources, counseling services, school security, custodial school maintenance, after school programming, and something that's gonna creep up on you fellas, it's unprepared for migrant student educational

1992
02:46:59,219 --> 02:47:00,300
studies and support.

1993
02:47:01,381 --> 02:47:04,062
Now, these are all dollar amounts that need to be addressed.

1994
02:47:04,923 --> 02:47:24,497
And if you are going to take on the proposal that's before us over the next two years, approximately $76,000, you're taking that $76,000 away from your school department educational budget that could be used somehow to get into some of these programs, if not all of them, to some degree and a percentage of whatever it might be.

1995
02:47:25,762 --> 02:47:34,353
The pay scale for those caring for these programs was at issue, and yet as of today, nothing has been done to resolve any of the issues as presented.

1996
02:47:35,033 --> 02:47:43,043
The City Council School Committee pay raise proposal does not recognize and connect to the short and long term needs of our public schools.

1997
02:47:43,664 --> 02:48:02,166
So when and if you folks are sitting here and you're discussing these needs, and you think that the school committee should be making more money, and you have a school committee that's been around for so many years, allegedly for 20, if that's what the issue is, well then let's, what do we need to motivate and show that their need and they're worthy of it other than

1998
02:48:02,987 --> 02:48:06,188
You know, they should be making the same as in Worcester.

1999
02:48:06,568 --> 02:48:09,890
They have an audience that does say up to 50% of what a city council makes.

2000
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:12,631
But their job responsibilities may be entirely different.

2001
02:48:12,851 --> 02:48:27,776
Do you realize right now, a kindergarten assistant, if we were to follow this pay raise as proposed, a kindergarten assistant who works five days a week and is subject to everything in that classroom as every other teacher, will be making $1,000 less

2002
02:48:30,336 --> 02:48:33,597
then this pay proposal for a school committee person, okay?

2003
02:48:33,937 --> 02:48:47,183
Makes no sense at all because a school committee person doesn't have to sign in, doesn't have to check in, has no responsibility as it relates to, you know, what am I doing on a daily basis that says I'm doing something that's educationally correct for this community.

2004
02:48:48,763 --> 02:48:53,325
By granting from the city council, let's put it this way.

2005
02:48:54,906 --> 02:48:57,367
There should be some justification before you folks

2006
02:48:58,430 --> 02:49:04,293
from, and it can't be from the at present school committee because there'd be a conflict of interest because they have a financial gain from it.

2007
02:49:04,793 --> 02:49:09,036
So it's gotta be as according to the state law, the chapter is gonna come from your folks in the state council.

2008
02:49:09,836 --> 02:49:22,343
But what has this school committee done, especially with its new members that has said Medford's education is better, Medford's discipline is better, and that's seriously questioned as to what's going on up at the high school.

2009
02:49:23,439 --> 02:49:25,180
The sports programs is getting better.

2010
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:35,643
Parents are getting more involved, but also at the same time, where is the educational standard in comparison to other cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?

2011
02:49:36,283 --> 02:49:43,685
Has the school committee made such great strides that, hey, they're working together with the teachers and their organizations.

2012
02:49:44,365 --> 02:49:47,586
When you had here last week, and I know you have some new folks that are here.

2013
02:49:48,787 --> 02:49:50,787
On December 12th, there was almost 150, 175 teachers that were here.

2014
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:59,682
And they explain to you the plight of not only being in the classroom, being attacked, where their pay is.

2015
02:50:00,203 --> 02:50:06,025
Some of them have to work five years, five years before they even make $25,000 a year.

2016
02:50:06,905 --> 02:50:07,825
That's unconscionable.

2017
02:50:08,666 --> 02:50:13,908
Justin, I understand that you want to give them a pay raise, you know, but I didn't hear your logic behind it.

2018
02:50:13,928 --> 02:50:15,188
Please just direct your comments to the chair.

2019
02:50:15,228 --> 02:50:15,548
Thank you.

2020
02:50:15,929 --> 02:50:17,289
Well, he's the one, it's his resolution.

2021
02:50:17,349 --> 02:50:18,389
I know, but just direct it to me.

2022
02:50:18,650 --> 02:50:20,170
Through the chair to Councilor Sang.

2023
02:50:20,250 --> 02:50:20,630
Pardon me?

2024
02:50:21,110 --> 02:50:22,391
Through the chair to Councilor Sang.

2025
02:50:22,679 --> 02:50:26,941
Okay, through the chair, Justin, I know you wanna give them this Bay Race, okay?

2026
02:50:27,441 --> 02:50:35,164
But you haven't said anything, none of you have expressed any comment as it relates to, they deserve it for the value of what they do.

2027
02:50:35,224 --> 02:50:36,505
Can anybody explain to me,

2028
02:50:37,765 --> 02:50:45,768
If you really want to give somebody a pay raise, isn't the job description and your job duties and your employer supposed to do the review of you?

2029
02:50:46,208 --> 02:50:52,150
Now, of course they can say, the Medford taxpayer is your reviewer and you run for office and they elect you.

2030
02:50:52,250 --> 02:50:53,371
Okay, that's all well and good.

2031
02:50:54,251 --> 02:50:58,953
But the Medford taxpayer doesn't pay your salary, it's the Medford City Council according to state law.

2032
02:50:59,997 --> 02:51:04,479
So the Memphis City Council, by right, can make a great demand on this school committee.

2033
02:51:04,499 --> 02:51:07,620
If you really want to improve it, we'll look at this in two years.

2034
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:10,320
Let's see what this new school committee does over the next two years.

2035
02:51:10,801 --> 02:51:21,724
Let's just see through your intervention with the Memphis Teachers Association and from the superintendent all the way down, that everything that's taking place in all our schools, from kindergarten all the way up to the high school, has gotten better.

2036
02:51:22,004 --> 02:51:23,245
Grades have gotten better.

2037
02:51:23,925 --> 02:51:26,366
Discipline has gotten better and under control.

2038
02:51:28,174 --> 02:51:29,395
That would make a big difference.

2039
02:51:29,575 --> 02:51:32,576
And maybe people might say, hey, okay, you're working toward it.

2040
02:51:33,216 --> 02:51:44,902
But when you have a job that you don't have to sign in, check in and give any report as to what you do and why you're doing how you do it, and expect to start off at a higher rate than people who have been here for years.

2041
02:51:45,782 --> 02:51:46,743
That's just not fair.

2042
02:51:47,643 --> 02:51:58,877
And the last thing, let me just say this as it relates to that, and I told you Arlington gets $3,000, Everett gets $11,500, Malden gets $7,000, Somerville gets $16,500, and Method gets $12,000.

2043
02:51:58,977 --> 02:52:02,121
We're the second highest one of the surrounding communities.

2044
02:52:03,723 --> 02:52:04,424
A kindergarten

2045
02:52:05,609 --> 02:52:11,811
through the chair to Justin, a kindergarten teacher assistant after the second year gets $21,568.

2046
02:52:12,391 --> 02:52:28,836
That's $1,000 less than what you wanna propose to a school committee person who doesn't go to this job every day, like the kindergarten teacher goes to school every day, five days a week, and does everything that education says of that person.

2047
02:52:30,556 --> 02:52:31,897
Maybe you should have a sit down.

2048
02:52:32,912 --> 02:52:33,793
with the school committee.

2049
02:52:34,713 --> 02:52:40,918
Because they can't tell you that they want it because it would be a financial benefit to them, that would be a conflict of interest.

2050
02:52:41,578 --> 02:52:48,022
But somebody needs to understand, just because they need to get paid more, because they're not getting paid enough now.

2051
02:52:48,383 --> 02:52:50,624
Well, they're getting paid $12,000, and if they don't want it.

2052
02:52:51,545 --> 02:52:59,390
And through the chair to Mrs. Callahan, not for anything, you made the comment that you think that, you know, to get good candidates, you need to pay more.

2053
02:52:59,630 --> 02:53:01,232
I'm gonna respectfully disagree with you.

2054
02:53:01,992 --> 02:53:07,895
a good candidate is someone who wants to run for the job because they believe that better things can be done and I can do it.

2055
02:53:08,195 --> 02:53:13,357
And if I can't do it, then the people won't reelect me that salary has got nothing to do with it.

2056
02:53:14,017 --> 02:53:17,739
And the salary should not be used for your own personal gain.

2057
02:53:17,779 --> 02:53:21,501
I'm going to make $30,000 a year now more 24,000, whatever it might be.

2058
02:53:21,861 --> 02:53:23,762
And the sad part about the whole thing in conclusion,

2059
02:53:24,815 --> 02:53:32,077
If this proposal were to go through, you're taking $74,000 a year out of this Memphis School Department education budget.

2060
02:53:33,077 --> 02:53:39,478
It's bad enough now for them to work on a daily basis without having enough of the money that should be in there.

2061
02:53:39,558 --> 02:53:40,419
Now you're gonna take another $74,000.

2062
02:53:41,339 --> 02:53:44,299
And you know, where does that go?

2063
02:53:44,379 --> 02:53:46,300
How do you explain that to the Memphis taxpayer?

2064
02:53:46,860 --> 02:53:49,221
You can't explain it to me because I wouldn't buy it.

2065
02:53:49,921 --> 02:53:50,541
Because right now,

2066
02:53:51,596 --> 02:54:09,051
The Memphis School Committee is working with all they can do just to maintain their budget and to get by and to start taking more money away to give it to an elected official who does absolutely nothing to enhance or embellish or make better school education.

2067
02:54:10,595 --> 02:54:12,616
That's, it just doesn't make any sense.

2068
02:54:13,296 --> 02:54:20,399
So if I understand you correctly, I believe you said you would like to have this go and have a decision come up by the end of December of this year.

2069
02:54:20,479 --> 02:54:21,479
I believe that's what you said.

2070
02:54:22,259 --> 02:54:23,100
That would be okay.

2071
02:54:23,400 --> 02:54:26,461
But to vote on this tonight, I think it would be wrong.

2072
02:54:26,721 --> 02:54:28,202
I think it would serve no purpose.

2073
02:54:28,622 --> 02:54:32,303
And I don't think it would be good for Medford public school education.

2074
02:54:32,483 --> 02:54:33,244
That's my opinion.

2075
02:54:33,544 --> 02:54:33,824
Thank you.

2076
02:54:35,421 --> 02:54:37,683
Thank you, former Councillor Penta.

2077
02:54:37,723 --> 02:54:44,828
Just to clarify, there was a list of things in Councillor Callaghan's motion around a variety of pro-democracy reforms.

2078
02:54:45,368 --> 02:54:50,471
Quite frankly, even though there was a suggested date of a report, we may not have the answers to all of those questions by that time.

2079
02:54:50,632 --> 02:54:58,717
So I would not personally, I'm going to vote for that B paper, but to me, it is not to say there will be more.

2080
02:55:00,438 --> 02:55:05,500
I think this is gonna be the swing of the bat for a while on this question, probably for years.

2081
02:55:06,561 --> 02:55:07,781
Can I ask a question to the chair?

2082
02:55:07,901 --> 02:55:08,422
Sure.

2083
02:55:08,482 --> 02:55:09,962
Did I misunderstand Mrs. Cowell?

2084
02:55:10,283 --> 02:55:20,047
Did you say in part of your questioning there is, I think you- She listed a variety of different reforms, rank choice- All right, it was one of the things that you said you wanted illegal aliens to vote.

2085
02:55:20,887 --> 02:55:21,468
Did you say that?

2086
02:55:22,008 --> 02:55:23,248
Undocumented immigrants to vote.

2087
02:55:23,268 --> 02:55:23,809
Did you say that?

2088
02:55:24,029 --> 02:55:24,229
No.

2089
02:55:24,289 --> 02:55:24,949
Non-citizens.

2090
02:55:25,049 --> 02:55:25,830
Non-citizens.

2091
02:55:25,910 --> 02:55:26,670
Non-citizens.

2092
02:55:26,850 --> 02:55:27,110
Non-citizens.

2093
02:55:27,130 --> 02:55:28,551
So documented non-citizens.

2094
02:55:30,418 --> 02:55:32,620
Green card holders and the like, I think.

2095
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:36,984
People who have green cards.

2096
02:55:37,305 --> 02:55:38,325
Oh, okay.

2097
02:55:41,468 --> 02:55:42,890
I'm more than happy to answer any questions.

2098
02:55:45,853 --> 02:55:46,293
Thank you.

2099
02:55:46,593 --> 02:55:49,156
We have two folks on Zoom.

2100
02:55:49,256 --> 02:55:51,398
I will go to M. Paige Lieberman.

2101
02:55:51,418 --> 02:55:53,059
Name and address for the record, please.

2102
02:55:57,771 --> 02:56:01,374
So my name is Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street.

2103
02:56:02,194 --> 02:56:04,516
I really appreciate all the Councillors that have brought this forward.

2104
02:56:05,837 --> 02:56:13,102
And I especially appreciate what Councillor Callahan introduced beyond this.

2105
02:56:13,122 --> 02:56:21,647
There is one thing that was an idea that we should consider is about waiting until after an election.

2106
02:56:24,074 --> 02:56:27,255
And I think that that should apply for the same body.

2107
02:56:27,775 --> 02:56:33,096
So the city council could not continue to simply raise its salary in between elections.

2108
02:56:33,136 --> 02:56:39,277
But I'm not quite sure if it should apply when we're talking about raising the salary of a different body of the school committee.

2109
02:56:41,098 --> 02:56:47,459
But, you know, Councilor Behrs, you talked about how it may be another 24 years before this is reconsidered.

2110
02:56:48,203 --> 02:56:53,790
And so, you know, one of the questions that I and you, and this has been repeatedly referred to as a compromise.

2111
02:56:54,551 --> 02:56:59,897
And so my question is, is before this compromise was kind of hammered out.

2112
02:57:00,777 --> 02:57:10,685
Was there any degree of talking about, you know, like doing it with a call like a cost of living adjustment in the future, or, you know, tagging indexing it to the rate of inflation?

2113
02:57:11,566 --> 02:57:14,889
If that's not I hope that that can be pursued in the future.

2114
02:57:14,909 --> 02:57:21,795
And at least for the minimum wage here in Medford indexing the minimum wage to the rate of inflation.

2115
02:57:21,835 --> 02:57:22,115
Thank you.

2116
02:57:24,807 --> 02:57:25,507
Thank you, Matthew.

2117
02:57:25,927 --> 02:57:34,129
Yes, I did work with counsel and the way that the law works, it specifically has to raise the salary from one amount to another amount.

2118
02:57:34,169 --> 02:57:43,031
So you could not say it should go from 12,000 to this and then thus shall go up with an inflationary measure or some sort of other measure.

2119
02:57:43,411 --> 02:57:45,291
It has to be from one amount to another amount.

2120
02:57:45,631 --> 02:57:50,793
The only way to do what you're talking about would be to put it in the charter in some way.

2121
02:57:51,433 --> 02:57:52,613
But under the chapter,

2122
02:57:53,729 --> 02:57:54,569
71, section 40, sorry, 52.

2123
02:57:54,809 --> 02:57:57,910
And I keep misplacing that.

2124
02:57:59,470 --> 02:58:06,972
It must go from one number to another number, so you can't peg it to something such as inflation or another metric, a COLA.

2125
02:58:07,052 --> 02:58:11,793
I'm going to go to Ricky on Zoom.

2126
02:58:16,814 --> 02:58:17,094
Hello.

2127
02:58:17,474 --> 02:58:19,315
Ricky Cormier, 150 Middlesex Ave.

2128
02:58:21,926 --> 02:58:23,687
This whole idea just seems ridiculous to me.

2129
02:58:25,088 --> 02:58:27,130
You guys are creating a problem that doesn't exist.

2130
02:58:28,451 --> 02:58:30,713
Nobody cares about this except for like six of you.

2131
02:58:31,613 --> 02:58:33,535
This is just nonsense.

2132
02:58:33,775 --> 02:58:38,378
You just said the entire country, nobody else has equal pay for the city council and school committee.

2133
02:58:39,199 --> 02:58:40,600
And you guys are the only ones thinking about that.

2134
02:58:40,740 --> 02:58:41,981
It's because it's not necessary.

2135
02:58:43,782 --> 02:58:45,383
The idea is just ridiculous.

2136
02:58:46,464 --> 02:58:50,267
You guys are responsible for like 60,000 people in the city of Medford.

2137
02:58:50,911 --> 02:58:54,112
The school committee is responsible for like 6,000 students.

2138
02:58:54,973 --> 02:58:57,834
That's 10 times the amount of people you guys are responsible for.

2139
02:58:58,194 --> 02:58:59,255
So why would you get paid the same?

2140
02:58:59,275 --> 02:59:00,835
It doesn't make any sense.

2141
02:59:03,076 --> 02:59:07,238
Furthermore, you shouldn't do a job just for the money.

2142
02:59:07,538 --> 02:59:08,919
That's not why you run for an election.

2143
02:59:08,999 --> 02:59:14,221
You run for an election because you want to do it because you want to be a school committee member, not because you're trying to make an extra buck.

2144
02:59:15,402 --> 02:59:15,562
So

2145
02:59:16,437 --> 02:59:18,759
This idea is just a problem that you guys have created.

2146
02:59:18,779 --> 02:59:20,780
There's no need for compromise because there's no problem.

2147
02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:22,101
Just leave it the way it is.

2148
02:59:22,341 --> 02:59:23,442
Maybe you give them a little raise.

2149
02:59:23,542 --> 02:59:29,526
Sure that everybody deserves a raise now and then a couple thousand dollars maybe, but the double, triple their pay.

2150
02:59:30,246 --> 02:59:31,247
It's just nonsense.

2151
02:59:31,487 --> 02:59:33,629
So I hope that this gets shot down.

2152
02:59:33,809 --> 02:59:39,352
I'm sure it won't because you guys just do whatever you want, but I hope it gets shot down real quick.

2153
02:59:39,993 --> 02:59:40,273
Thank you.

2154
02:59:43,117 --> 02:59:45,639
David Scormio at the podium.

2155
02:59:46,239 --> 02:59:48,040
Mr. Navarro, name and address for the record, please.

2156
02:59:48,121 --> 02:59:51,623
William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

2157
02:59:52,103 --> 03:00:05,232
I just want to speak to this idea that, you know, when you pass this kind of thing and the change to the salary, you know, you're taking away from paraprofessionals, you're taking away from the school budget.

2158
03:00:05,252 --> 03:00:09,736
You know, it was pointed out last time that, you know, the things that happened here,

2159
03:00:10,376 --> 03:00:12,297
the day-to-day basis in terms of policy.

2160
03:00:12,337 --> 03:00:18,320
But here, I mean, the city council, that could have a really big budgetary impact every time.

2161
03:00:18,340 --> 03:00:21,561
And there's a lot of zero-sum thinking.

2162
03:00:21,962 --> 03:00:28,405
And government is where we come together, and government should be a positive something.

2163
03:00:28,425 --> 03:00:30,526
And I think this city council gets that.

2164
03:00:31,066 --> 03:00:38,910
We heard arguments earlier that if you are a refugee and you come here, that's why we can't help our veterans, can't help our homeless that are already here.

2165
03:00:39,730 --> 03:00:43,251
Sometimes we hear, if you move here, you're like a gentrifier.

2166
03:00:43,271 --> 03:00:45,391
You're displacing somebody else.

2167
03:00:45,411 --> 03:00:49,212
I think the city council is doing a good job avoiding that kind of thinking.

2168
03:00:50,312 --> 03:00:52,173
We could have more housing going up.

2169
03:00:52,193 --> 03:00:55,974
We could have more expanded tax base for businesses.

2170
03:00:56,414 --> 03:01:00,835
We can make an effort that, as a community, have a positive sum.

2171
03:01:01,435 --> 03:01:05,796
In terms of economics, not just in terms of the democratic idea.

2172
03:01:06,516 --> 03:01:11,017
But there's also the economic idea that when we come together, we can do more than we can do separately.

2173
03:01:11,037 --> 03:01:12,538
And that's what government can help us do.

2174
03:01:12,558 --> 03:01:15,739
And this city council seems to believe in that.

2175
03:01:16,299 --> 03:01:22,601
And they believe that, you know, if we need a prop two and a half, then that's something you gotta pursue, a prop two and a half override.

2176
03:01:23,141 --> 03:01:32,344
Basically, I think this city council is prepared to make sure that we're not in a zero sum kind of thing.

2177
03:01:33,424 --> 03:01:37,248
kind of situation, you know, that there is enough to go around for everybody.

2178
03:01:37,268 --> 03:01:42,833
And the City Council doesn't have the power to do that on their own.

2179
03:01:42,853 --> 03:01:50,821
And so it takes cooperation from other areas of government as well.

2180
03:01:53,735 --> 03:01:55,356
and from the residents.

2181
03:01:56,057 --> 03:01:59,359
But ultimately, I think that that's the project here.

2182
03:01:59,379 --> 03:02:10,848
And I think that's the way forward is to make sure that we are raising revenue where we can, that we can get a raise for the paraprofessionals that need it, et cetera.

2183
03:02:11,929 --> 03:02:13,610
We're a very desirable place to be.

2184
03:02:13,650 --> 03:02:14,871
People really want to be here.

2185
03:02:15,292 --> 03:02:16,252
That's our biggest asset.

2186
03:02:17,591 --> 03:02:36,551
So I think we need to recognize that we're well-situated to create wealth in a good location where people can earn money at jobs and open businesses and everything that they need to do in order to make sure we're not always in an austerity situation.

2187
03:02:36,571 --> 03:02:37,692
Thank you.

2188
03:02:37,732 --> 03:02:39,794
Thank you, Mr. Navarro.

2189
03:02:43,931 --> 03:02:45,813
On the, any further comments?

2190
03:02:45,913 --> 03:02:46,594
I'm seeing none.

2191
03:02:46,694 --> 03:02:47,314
If I can.

2192
03:02:47,515 --> 03:02:48,956
Councilor Scarpelli.

2193
03:02:50,297 --> 03:02:59,387
Just for point of information, I think that receiving emails and people understanding that just so they're not

2194
03:03:00,990 --> 03:03:03,411
misplaced or forgotten.

2195
03:03:03,471 --> 03:03:07,454
But again, school custodians have been without a contract for years.

2196
03:03:08,254 --> 03:03:11,116
Our parking department still hasn't had a contract.

2197
03:03:11,596 --> 03:03:13,737
Our inspectorate services have no contract.

2198
03:03:14,277 --> 03:03:19,960
DPW superintendents and recreation department have no contract.

2199
03:03:20,020 --> 03:03:26,264
So again, these are all Teamster positions and other

2200
03:03:28,874 --> 03:03:39,840
Other positions in the city that it's that dollar figure that's got to come from somewhere, whether we increase it $35,000 or $75,000.

2201
03:03:44,786 --> 03:03:45,787
it's going to trickle down.

2202
03:03:46,027 --> 03:04:02,214
So I just wanted to make sure that I mentioned that because I did receive emails and support of not forgetting that these very important positions are left without a contract for years.

2203
03:04:02,394 --> 03:04:02,894
So thank you.

2204
03:04:04,915 --> 03:04:05,455
Thank you.

2205
03:04:06,496 --> 03:04:07,256
Councilor Coates.

2206
03:04:09,237 --> 03:04:10,117
Thank you, President Barras.

2207
03:04:12,298 --> 03:04:13,759
Sorry, is there a song going on in the chambers?

2208
03:04:14,940 --> 03:04:15,560
I thought I heard something.

2209
03:04:16,901 --> 03:04:37,108
I've already made my thoughts on this clear in our subsequent couple of meetings, but just before I move the question, just to put a couple facts out on the table, especially since I know a lot of our deep conversation about this occurred in committee of the whole last week, but residents, I think it's easier to tune in during these regular meetings rather than committees of the whole.

2210
03:04:37,148 --> 03:04:38,869
I wouldn't want this conversation to seem truncated.

2211
03:04:39,869 --> 03:04:41,170
So just to remind folks that

2212
03:04:42,927 --> 03:04:49,890
There was a whole conversation, discussion, disagreement, predicating this conversation and vote that we're going to take tonight.

2213
03:04:51,051 --> 03:04:59,255
I said this the first time that this issue came before us, but where I'm coming from on this is really that I just completely believe that we can do more than one right thing at a time.

2214
03:05:01,136 --> 03:05:07,239
This proposal, the original proposal, which this is less than, was 0.05% of a $200 billion operating budget.

2215
03:05:14,468 --> 03:05:17,889
I think that we need to challenge ourselves to do more than one right thing at a time.

2216
03:05:17,949 --> 03:05:34,733
And I really appreciate the reminder that if we think that paying one city employee fairly is a grievance to another, then we are phrasing the question incorrectly.

2217
03:05:35,313 --> 03:05:42,015
And this has always been a tough topic to talk about because

2218
03:05:42,591 --> 03:05:46,454
We have so much work to do when it comes to paying all of our city employees fairly.

2219
03:05:47,055 --> 03:05:53,780
And I think what's been painful about this process is the knowledge that so many of those issues are unresolved.

2220
03:05:54,401 --> 03:05:56,302
And that's not okay, and it's not acceptable.

2221
03:05:56,702 --> 03:06:04,869
This is the one opportunity that this council has legally to instigate a pay increase for any city employee.

2222
03:06:05,570 --> 03:06:10,153
This is the one appropriation that we get, and it's kind of a weird quirk of our power.

2223
03:06:11,514 --> 03:06:11,935
But as

2224
03:06:12,802 --> 03:06:21,249
folks who are familiar with our work and the parameters of our jurisdiction know, when it comes to the budget and its appropriations, we get to vote yes or no, and that is it.

2225
03:06:21,529 --> 03:06:22,610
We cannot appropriate.

2226
03:06:23,751 --> 03:06:31,117
And so this does put us in this awkward position where we can instigate these compensation adjustments, and we can't do that directly for anybody else.

2227
03:06:31,657 --> 03:06:32,898
And I think for that,

2228
03:06:35,272 --> 03:06:37,834
that we do in these chambers the entire rest of the year.

2229
03:06:37,874 --> 03:06:41,657
This is a really unusual topic for us to be talking about the entire rest of the year.

2230
03:06:41,717 --> 03:07:01,194
I think we can be we can challenge ourselves to be the allies that the community deserves by supporting all other city employees and bargaining units by one vocally supporting them and standing with them and advocating for them and also by doing the bulk of the work of this council, which is doing the ordinances and the zoning and the business development work.

2231
03:07:02,011 --> 03:07:16,997
in this chambers in collaboration with the administration, in collaboration with private partners that will bring up the city's bottom line and enable us to, as swiftly as we can, roll out improved living wages for all city employees, because that is all of our goals.

2232
03:07:18,317 --> 03:07:22,999
I do not believe that this stands in the way of that goal, and that goal is not diminished by this change.

2233
03:07:23,679 --> 03:07:24,360
And that's my opinion.

2234
03:07:25,060 --> 03:07:25,640
Move the question.

2235
03:07:26,780 --> 03:07:28,521
Thank you, Councilor, Vice President Collins.

2236
03:07:28,781 --> 03:07:30,702
Mr. President, if we could be brief.

2237
03:07:31,067 --> 03:07:46,819
Yeah, just a point of information, just as a notice for this council, I think it was three, maybe five to six years ago, there was a report that came back from the Department of Revenue, Mass Department of Revenue that said, the old school thought was in the council budget, you could only decrease, but that's not true.

2238
03:07:46,959 --> 03:07:49,981
You can now make appropriations that go the other way.

2239
03:07:50,722 --> 03:07:56,587
So I think it's just something I think you really need to take into consideration as it relates to something that you might see in the budget,

2240
03:07:57,438 --> 03:08:13,886
where the old school was that you only could reduce if you wanted to save money, so there would be no way that you could transfer that money to another section, but that's not true because now you can look at certain sections within your budget as it relates to appropriating for or making something less.

2241
03:08:14,267 --> 03:08:23,892
And I think that would be very key, so let's stick to your, Councilor Collins' comment as it relates to this could be a beginning step.

2242
03:08:24,192 --> 03:08:25,833
If it's going to be a beginning step,

2243
03:08:26,753 --> 03:08:31,837
it should be a step that parallels every single municipal employee from step one.

2244
03:08:31,897 --> 03:08:39,001
Some school teachers, I believe, have 10 steps before they get to the top, but an elected official has no steps.

2245
03:08:39,082 --> 03:08:39,762
It's never been that.

2246
03:08:39,802 --> 03:08:44,705
So if you're going to put everybody into the same genre, so to speak, well then maybe

2247
03:08:45,786 --> 03:08:48,689
An elected person can maybe have five or six steps, whatever it might be.

2248
03:08:48,849 --> 03:08:55,616
Don't forget, one of the real benefits of an elected official is if you serve for 10 years or more, you get a pension.

2249
03:08:56,236 --> 03:08:58,459
You get a pension from here, okay?

2250
03:08:58,999 --> 03:09:01,361
There are some cities and towns that don't offer pensions.

2251
03:09:02,478 --> 03:09:08,402
So besides the salary, you're also getting the benefit of a pension with a minimum of 10 years.

2252
03:09:09,283 --> 03:09:16,628
So I think that really needs to be taken into consideration when you're talking about pay scales and pay raises and whether it be for the council or the school committee.

2253
03:09:17,682 --> 03:09:28,052
And one of the things that seemed to be a juggernaut in the school and the municipal side is just that particular issue, whether it's in the fire or the police department when they're in their pension areas.

2254
03:09:28,813 --> 03:09:34,859
So it's really something that serves you folks with a good benefit, school department issue.

2255
03:09:36,064 --> 03:09:48,656
school committee person, same thing as a city councilor, but you really, you just don't want to throw that aside without realizing that you're getting a benefit that a lot of cities and towns do not offer.

2256
03:09:49,536 --> 03:09:50,497
So just thought I'd let you know.

2257
03:09:51,578 --> 03:09:51,939
Thank you.

2258
03:09:53,360 --> 03:09:58,184
Unless, yes, unless there's a motion to end the debate and move the question.

2259
03:09:59,085 --> 03:10:00,226
Sounds like we have one last person.

2260
03:10:01,778 --> 03:10:03,659
Once again, Patrick Clark in 50 Princeton Street.

2261
03:10:04,099 --> 03:10:15,201
I just wanted to be simpler with what I said before, which is it basically comes down in my eyes to, if this is a question of equal pay for equal work, you have to make sure that you're comparing equal things.

2262
03:10:15,321 --> 03:10:24,064
If it was comparing a school committee that was all men and a school committee that was all women that were getting different pay, that would be one thing, but you're changing multiple variables.

2263
03:10:24,104 --> 03:10:25,564
You're comparing not just

2264
03:10:27,325 --> 03:10:32,309
men and women, mixed bodies, but you're also comparing a school committee and city council.

2265
03:10:32,749 --> 03:10:43,297
So you either have to demonstrate that it is equal work or if it's not equal work, you have to demonstrate why there should be equal pay for an equal work.

2266
03:10:43,377 --> 03:10:44,998
That's basically what I wanted to say.

2267
03:10:45,098 --> 03:10:45,378
Thank you.

2268
03:10:45,839 --> 03:10:46,199
Thank you.

2269
03:10:47,619 --> 03:11:00,367
The clerk has reminded me that a B paper would retain the same paper number, so if you do not mind, Councillor Callaghan, if we could adjust your motion to refer a new paper with a new paper number to the Governance Committee containing the motion that you sent.

2270
03:11:00,387 --> 03:11:01,047
Great.

2271
03:11:01,567 --> 03:11:02,468
Okay, thank you.

2272
03:11:02,948 --> 03:11:05,249
And the second on that was Councillor Lemming, I believe.

2273
03:11:06,470 --> 03:11:15,755
So, on that motion to refer a paper regarding several pro-democracy reforms to the Governance Committee for further consideration, seconded by Councillor Lemming.

2274
03:11:15,795 --> 03:11:16,436
All those in favour?

2275
03:11:17,461 --> 03:11:17,961
Opposed?

2276
03:11:18,261 --> 03:11:19,022
Motion passes.

2277
03:11:19,042 --> 03:11:27,406
On the main motion by Councillor Sang to approve the paper 24-019 pursuant to General Law, Chapter 71, Section 52.

2278
03:11:46,963 --> 03:11:49,084
It was motion by Councillor Seng, seconded by Councillor Collins.

2279
03:11:49,104 --> 03:11:50,124
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2280
03:11:52,665 --> 03:11:53,265
Councillor Callaghan.

2281
03:11:53,725 --> 03:11:53,885
No.

2282
03:11:57,046 --> 03:11:57,806
Vice-President Collins.

2283
03:11:58,106 --> 03:11:58,306
Yes.

2284
03:11:59,686 --> 03:12:00,387
Councillor Lozano.

2285
03:12:00,687 --> 03:12:00,907
Yes.

2286
03:12:01,947 --> 03:12:02,487
Councillor Lemming.

2287
03:12:02,747 --> 03:12:03,007
Yes.

2288
03:12:03,647 --> 03:12:04,348
Councillor Scarpelli.

2289
03:12:04,628 --> 03:12:04,788
No.

2290
03:12:05,748 --> 03:12:06,288
Councillor Seng.

2291
03:12:06,708 --> 03:12:06,908
Yes.

2292
03:12:07,428 --> 03:12:07,989
President Behrs.

2293
03:12:08,169 --> 03:12:08,429
Yes.

2294
03:12:08,449 --> 03:12:10,529
Five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes.

2295
03:12:11,850 --> 03:12:12,730
Call for participation.

2296
03:12:14,960 --> 03:12:16,681
Is there anyone who would like to participate further?

2297
03:12:16,961 --> 03:12:25,627
We've had extensive public participation, but if there's public participation on a topic we have not otherwise discussed, you may come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom now.

2298
03:12:33,072 --> 03:12:37,655
Seeing none, is there any unfinished business that any Councillor would like to address, or is there a motion to adjourn?

2299
03:12:40,202 --> 03:12:41,666
Councilor Kelly, are we not covering 2402?

2300
03:12:41,706 --> 03:12:43,611
Oh, geez, you're right.

2301
03:12:43,671 --> 03:12:44,554
I totally skipped.

2302
03:12:44,915 --> 03:12:46,459
I'm so sorry, Councilor Scarpelli.

2303
03:12:51,026 --> 03:12:52,567
No, that's totally my bad.

2304
03:12:52,607 --> 03:12:53,028
Thank you.

2305
03:12:53,268 --> 03:12:54,088
My apologies.

2306
03:12:55,109 --> 03:12:57,711
I messed up the order there.

2307
03:12:57,731 --> 03:13:03,034
24-020, resolution on city council and school committee blended salary sponsored by Councillor Scarpelli.

2308
03:13:03,054 --> 03:13:12,461
Be it resolved that the council lower its own rate of pay to a blended salary, that is the difference between the pay rate of the city council and the school committee, then follow the schedule proposed by Councillor Seng for increases in 2024 and 2025.

2309
03:13:14,622 --> 03:13:22,668
I had the opportunity to review this and look at the law, whereas the school committee salaries are subject to Chapter 71, Section 52.

2310
03:13:23,148 --> 03:13:37,878
Salaries for the Mayor and the City Council or otherwise Board of Alders, etc., are subject to Chapter 39, Section 6A, which says that the Mayor and members of the City Council shall receive for their services such salary as the City Council shall by ordinance determine.

2311
03:13:38,294 --> 03:13:45,359
No increase or reduction in such salaries shall take effect during the year in which an increase or reduction is voted, as is noted by Councillor Callaghan's research.

2312
03:13:46,159 --> 03:13:55,185
That is very different from the law around school committees, which explains why various town and city charters go to pains to try to align those two laws.

2313
03:13:55,265 --> 03:13:59,668
So under Chapter 39, Section 6a, I'm going to rule this paper out of order.

2314
03:14:06,980 --> 03:14:07,481
All those in favour?

2315
03:14:07,541 --> 03:14:08,041
All those opposed?

2316
03:14:08,061 --> 03:14:10,544
The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
