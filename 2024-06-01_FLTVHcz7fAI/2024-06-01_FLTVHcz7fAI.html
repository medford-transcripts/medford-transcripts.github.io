    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=115.598s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=117.039s">This</a>  is a resolution born out of our drive to modernize the work of our city council, which we spoke about at the last regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=126.067s">I</a>  told folks that there's a lot to look forward to when it comes to making sure that we are up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=132.012s">in</a>  our practices and in our communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=134.413s">And</a>  as a lot of residents have pointed out in the past, it can be a little bit hard to get information. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=141.915s">This</a>  is about really coordinating our strategy and making sure that there are one-stop shops for communications, while making sure that those strategies, social media, press releases, et cetera, truly do reach out to as wide an audience as possible, but also follow nonpartisan and neutral guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=160.881s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=161.661s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=162.421s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=163.302s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=171.744s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=172.965s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=173.405s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=174.405s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=175.305s">2.4-016,</a>  offered by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=179.387s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the Committee on Resident Services and Public Engagement meet to discuss recommendations for updating the City website. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=185.189s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=186.089s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=186.789s">The</a>  city website is a portal to city government for a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=194.234s">Even</a>  though we've seen a lot of improvements on the city website, I don't think it would surprise anyone to say that we could use even more updates to the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=202.96s">And</a>  so I want to call for a meeting of the Committee on Resident Services and Public Engagement with Communications Director Steve Smerdy. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=214.767s">to</a>  talk about recommendations for updating the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=217.39s">I</a>  know folks have sent me a bunch of ideas, and in particular, to update the city council part of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=224.398s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=225.4s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=227.901s">on</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=233.722s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=234.443s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=235.483s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=236.003s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="../resolutions/24-017.pdf"><font color="green">24-017</font></a> offered by Councilor Scarpelli, with the goal of keeping Medford residents informed on the process, be it resolved that the Medford City Council meet with the Medford Legislative Delegation, with General Keefe of the National Guard, and with representatives from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities to discuss a temporary shelter proposed within the City of Medford.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=256.294s">before</a>  I turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=258.476s">There</a>  was an update today from the city online from Communications Director Smriti and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=264.119s">The</a>  city has been informed by state officials that the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities will be opening its emergency overnight shelter in Medford in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=272.745s">The</a>  state is working on a contract with the provider to assist with services on site, and at the insistence of Mayor Lungo-Koehn has signed a memorandum of understanding with the city, agreeing to several specific terms identified by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=285.233s">The</a>  first no more than 75 families, or roughly 250 people, will be housed at the site for short-term shelter only. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=292.136s">Two,</a>  the duration of the stay will likely not exceed five days. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=295.938s">Three,</a>  school-age children will not enroll in Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=299.48s">At</a>  the urging of Mayor Lungo-Koehn, the state has agreed to hold a public information session prior to the opening of the shelter with the community to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=307.083s">and</a>  to give an overview of how the facility will operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=309.765s">We</a>  put in a request for next week, but the state has not given us a date and time yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=314.469s">So</a>  that is the public meeting update. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=316.211s">I</a>  will go to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=319.244s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I appreciate all the hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=323.747s">I</a>  know that City Clerk has put into making sure that we have the proper people at the table to answer any questions that the community has reached out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=334.335s">I</a>  first want to thank Representative DiNardo for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=338.938s">We</a>  realize that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=342.219s">He</a>  really doesn't have much information either, but he's here just to really listen to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=346.463s">And</a>  I really appreciate you doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=349.685s">And</a>  especially when you're talking about an issue that really concerns a lot of people and a lot of people looking for answers and really not getting many responses back from other parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=361.255s">So</a>  we appreciate you being here tonight, Representative Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=365.638s">I</a>  know that both Representative Garbally and Representative Barber <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=371.998s">We're</a>  invited, but they know that it's the same message that Representative Donato would share, and as their colleagues, I think that he's representing everyone, but this really falls into his district, which is key. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=385.748s">So</a>  I brought this forth because we did have some neighbors that had some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=391.094s">And</a>  the concerns really, you know, it goes from one extreme to another extreme. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=397.982s">One</a>  extreme is simple is that we understand and we want to be supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=401.966s">to</a>  the people that need this type of shelter at the time, but we want to make sure we're educated and everybody knows the process, especially the neighbors, the direct abutters, that they're informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=416.252s">I've</a>  received calls from people that are in the health fields that find it a little alarming that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=423.854s">What</a>  they're seeing in different neighborhoods in different states is the lack of vaccinations for the support that we're giving for the people that are in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=436.404s">So</a>  I think that there are a lot of questions that have to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=440.667s">There</a>  are a lot of questions that have to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=443.849s">Unfortunately,</a>  I think the key, what we'll hear tonight is really just people <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=449.429s">sharing</a>  what the how they feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=450.81s">I</a>  think that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=453.212s">But</a>  I also understand that truly, from what we've heard, both from the communications from the mayor's office and outside is that we really need the the landlord <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=467.281s">We</a>  need someone from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, and someone from the Mayor's Office, and most importantly, someone from the Governor's Office that's going to come in and really set up a meeting that really can answer some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=486.992s">We're</a>  hearing that it's a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=490.285s">but</a>  at the same time, we're not seeing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=492.827s">We're</a>  hearing that the mayor has put out an MOU, but it hasn't been followed through yet from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=499.05s">So</a>  there's a lot of different variables that are still left wide open. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=503.493s">And</a>  I appreciate, I think that the phone calls I got from a lot of teachers and parents from especially the McGlynn and the Roberts where they're at extended capacity right now and making sure that having <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=521.862s">to</a>  the public schools right now would be totally devastating in some of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=527.045s">So</a>  I think that, you know, the questions we have is infrastructure, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=531.266s">Do</a>  we have enough police? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=532.847s">Do</a>  we have enough fire? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=534.848s">Does</a>  the health department have enough support to make sure that everything is on the up and up at this facility? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=542.391s">So</a>  there are a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=544.052s">So</a>  like I said, Mr. President, this is really, I put this out for <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=550.034s">the</a>  residents that had some questions that can share it publicly so we can get it on the record and hopefully the governor's office can follow through with a meeting so people are notified properly and for one person <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=567.512s">mentioned</a>  that for her and her family, it's scary, not in a disrespectful thought process to the people that are going through this, but it's scary because of the organizational piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=578.757s">I</a>  think that that's where they're not understanding and not knowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=582.718s">So</a>  I know that other people want to talk, so I yield to them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=588.961s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=590.962s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Schapiro. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=591.822s">I</a>  hear from Representative Donato, and then I hear from fellow councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=595.044s">Representative</a>  Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=598.646s">Press</a>  a button.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=601.027s">First</a>  time here?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=602.088s">This</a>  is my first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=605.069s">I'm</a>  very nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=606.309s">My</a>  first time speaking in front of an audience.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=608.77s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=611.792s">It's</a>  a joke.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=613.743s">So</a>  my name is Paul Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=616.024s">I'm</a>  the state representative for the 35th Middlesex District. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=619.365s">I</a>  live at 48 Maurice Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=622.246s">And</a>  let me clarify to make sure that the members of the council know that both Representative Garber and Representative Barber acquiesced to my request, along with the state senator, that it's my district and I would be more than happy to represent <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=641.494s">the</a>  delegation here before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=645.777s">I</a>  believe that the mayor has provided a great deal of information to the members of the council as to what this situation is, and I know that there's major questions and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=658.905s">We</a>  as a delegation, and I know that the residents in the area and the mayor herself has many questions that we want to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=667.17s">The</a>  governor has the emergency power <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=670.052s">and</a>  MOU was presented to the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=674.174s">HomeServe</a>  is attempting to work with the governor and the migrants to find out what their needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=687.022s">My</a>  understanding is that there will be no children attending the schools, that this is a <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=694.775s">transitional</a>  system and a transitional place so that those children will be going to permanent shelters. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=706.424s">So</a>  it would not make sense to put a child into the McGlynn or to the Andrews or to any other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=713.769s">And</a>  then all of a sudden they'd be in <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=716.651s">Chelsea,</a>  Revere, or Maynard, and we would have to pay busing to bring those children back to our schools since they started. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=725.275s">So</a>  I think that it's important that the mayor gave you that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=729.936s">And</a>  as she said, she has set the criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=734.238s">She</a>  has been in touch with me relative to the process, making sure that I was aware <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=741.481s">since</a>  it's my district, but I was aware more important to give the rest of the information to the delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=747.444s">So</a>  there are many questions and the residents have a right to ask those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=753.307s">And</a>  the mayor is on top of it with the lieutenant governor trying to get <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=758.59s">a</a>  community meeting for the residents so that they can ask the questions, the council can ask the questions, and we can get the answers from the administration as to what is the process, how long is the process, and where <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=774.741s">Where</a>  is it going to be to make sure that the community is safe, that the residents are satisfied with the process, and that the migrants themselves are safe in that particular venue? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=789.304s">So</a>  I'm more than happy to answer any other question, but on behalf of the delegation and the mayor, I know that we've tried to keep the council abreast of what's going on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=801.175s">Thank</a>  you, Representative Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=802.196s">Yes,</a>  and I want to acknowledge we have received several communications from the mayor, including the memorandum of understanding was emailed out to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=810.781s">Some</a>  questions have been answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=812.703s">Some</a>  further questions have been generated as the process has moved along. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=816.905s">And</a>  it does seem that, at this point, the people who have the answers to those questions are from the state government. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=822.789s">And</a>  the mayor is working to bring them here for a community meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=826.191s">But</a>  the date is not certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=829.028s">At</a>  this point, that's kind of my just quick summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=831.17s">I</a>  will go to councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=833.653s">I</a>  wasn't tracking hands, but if anyone has anything they want to say or any questions they want to put on the record, then we can go to the members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=840.139s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=842.622s">I</a>  wonder, Representative Donato, if you can speak to other similar shelters in different cities that have been set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=851.987s">I</a>  know this crisis has been going on for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=855.569s">Have</a>  there been other temporary shelters very short term like this that have been set up in other places?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=862.572s">Um</a>  most of the yeah the legislature put a 7500 permanent shelter into the budget with the 250 million dollars that uh has been the shelters and unfortunately uh the 7500 shelters are now overcrowded uh and um <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=883.598s">We're</a>  working, well, the governor is working on finding permanent shelters for those individuals, and as those shelters open up, then the migrants who are in temporary shelters will be able to be accommodated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=900.501s">My</a>  understanding is there's one in Chelsea and one in Revere.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=904.562s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=906.562s">My</a>  question is about the five-day <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=911.34s">sort</a>  of ideal limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=915.384s">I</a>  think with the way that housing and bureaucracy and the way these things tend to go, my suspicion is that sometimes people will be somewhere for a little bit longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=929.236s">And</a>  my concern about that isn't that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=933.424s">the</a>  migrants will be in this shelter for longer, but that if we have presented it as such a temporary location that we're making it harder for maybe students who do need to enroll, if they end up staying for longer and they're out of school as a result for a long time, I wouldn't want to give the impression that they're blocked from attending school if they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=959.665s">stay</a>  for a while, if they're there for two or three months, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=963.706s">I</a>  don't know that that would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=965.907s">But</a>  in working with people who are trying to attain housing, often, even if you have something that's in the works, it takes a month just to roll over the next <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=977.267s">the</a>  last person to move out of somewhere, you know, like these things can kind of sometimes take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=981.289s">So</a>  I'm curious about, you may not know this, but I'm curious about Medford's understanding of how we can treat the folks that are staying there as though they're residents of Medford while they're residents of Medford.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=994.389s">It</a>  is my understanding from the mayor and the governor's office, the mayor has been in touch with the lieutenant governor on a daily basis relative to the concerns that the residents have and the concerns that the government has with regard to the migrants, that they have listened to the mayor's concern relative to a temporary shelter, and whether that's five days or seven days, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1021.768s">She</a>  does not anticipate any more than that at this particular time, and that's why she's adamant that the Lieutenant Governor is assured that we are not going to be taxing the educational system.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1036.376s">Okay,</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1037.356s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1040.138s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1040.878s">Any</a>  other comments or questions from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1043.379s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1046.343s">Thank</a>  you for being here, Representative Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1048.045s">Sorry</a>  to make you stand up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1048.946s">Feel</a>  free to say so if this is a question, but are directed to the folks at the Office of Housing and Livable Communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1055.493s">So</a>  these migrant, sorry, these temporary shelters are being set up because <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1060.267s">We're</a>  at a crisis level in terms of the lack of shelter space. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1064.969s">You</a>  mentioned the permanent shelters that are coming online to be sort of the more long-term solution to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1072.252s">Can</a>  you provide any sense of the status of the permanent shelters that are being set up?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1079.079s">Well,</a>  the permanent shelters that are being established at this particular time have been most of the hotels and motels throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1090.123s">And</a>  what they're hoping is, what the governor's, I'm assuming, what the governor's hope is, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1097.825s">as</a>  we find more housing in public housing, as there are openings in the public housing, is to extract those migrants who are in the hotels and motels, which are very difficult, bring them into the permanent housing, and then bring those who are in these temporary shelters into something that's a little more accommodating.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1123.505s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1123.865s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1124.506s">And</a>  the reason we're here in the first place is because even <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1127.571s">permanent,</a>  sorry, the longer term shelter beds in the hotels and motels, those are actually, we don't have as many beds as we used to.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1136.116s">I</a>  think the governor's indicating that there's something like 1,000 migrants a week that are anticipated in coming into the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1146.102s">So</a>  it's something that we in the legislature, the speaker and the governor and the Senate president <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1153.846s">grappling</a>  with this issue, both on the basis of the numbers of people who are coming and how to accommodate them and the potential cost in the budget.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1167.477s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1169.258s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1171.34s">And</a>  I just do want to note, I think it's good to ask questions, and Rep Tornado is here, and we'll also have the record of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1178.914s">very</a>  likely will have to direct these questions to the state officials at their public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1182.898s">So</a>  we're gathering some feedback here, but we don't have the answers or the folks who do have the answers or are working on creating the answers are not here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1191.126s">Well,</a>  you can be assured that the mayor is on top of this, the lieutenant governor on a daily basis to make sure that the residents are fully aware of what's going to go on, how it's going to happen and <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1206.48s">what</a>  is the final solution to the site.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1211.363s">Thank</a>  you, Representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1212.684s">I'm</a>  going to go to members of the public who have questions, unless there were other councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1218.329s">I'm</a>  going to go to members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1220.891s">We</a>  have some folks on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1221.811s">We</a>  have some folks here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1222.572s">I'll</a>  start at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1223.973s">Please</a>  give your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1226.155s">My</a>  name is Charlie Pagliarulo, 249 Gaston Street.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1229.437s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1230.398s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1234.482s">I</a>  want to start off by saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1236.364s">This</a>  was, according to State Representative Donato, it was a state of emergency from the governor back in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1245.511s">Am</a>  I right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1246.432s">August</a>  23rd, if I'm not mistaken? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1248.774s">Okay,</a>  state of emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1251.035s">Now,</a>  I'll get to that in a minute, but understand something, I did my research too, and every time a law, a bylaw, a rule, a regulation is written up and okayed, it usually has these words in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1264.639s">to</a>  protect the citizens of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1269.3s">State</a>  representative, am I correct in that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1273.401s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1273.861s">Sir,</a>  if you could direct your comments to me, thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1276.321s">Well,</a>  he's the one who knows, they write up the laws of the state.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1279.222s">Pursuant</a>  to the rules of the council, comments should be directed to me, whether it's Councilors or members of the public.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1283.763s">All</a>  right, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1285.643s">But</a>  my little bit of homework says to me, when it comes to definitions, this is on the state of emergency, by the way, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1295.074s">Civil</a>  Defense Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1297.28s">How</a>  about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1297.862s">Civil</a>  Defense Act, Acts 1950, Chapter 639. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1304.215s">And</a>  it says in paragraph S5, power to seize or possess personal property. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1309.319s">And</a>  I'll be quick, I won't go through the whole thing, but I'll get to the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1312.981s">Because</a>  of the existing possibility of occurrence, whatever that might be, it goes on to say, to preserve the lives and property of the people of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1323.589s">And</a>  I'll go on to another one, paragraph S5A, and I'll go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1329.673s">Governor</a>  may employ every agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1333.297s">as</a>  you go forward, to protect the lives and property of its citizens and to enforce the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1342.202s">That's</a>  us and nobody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1347.566s">And</a>  nobody else, that's us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1351.448s">Now,</a>  I wanna ask out loud, what is the emergency? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1357.085s">Is</a>  it health? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1358.686s">Do</a>  we have a COVID problem anymore? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1360.448s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1361.849s">We're</a>  cautious, but there's no emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1364.732s">Is</a>  it civil unrest? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1366.473s">Are</a>  there riots? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1368.295s">Is</a>  there political upheaval? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1370.917s">Is</a>  there military action?

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1726.294s">My</a>  name is Lorna Wilkerson, MD, MS, member of the fellow American of College of OB-GYN. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1733.376s">I</a>  would like to thank the person who just spoke for his absolutely excellent presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1742.335s">I</a>  would like to say that I have not only taken care of many of the illegal refugees who are coming into Boston right now as a physician, but I am the daughter of an immigrant. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1756.43s">I</a>  am the great granddaughter of a slave. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1760.285s">I</a>  am shocked and appalled after living in Medford for 26 years, paying my taxes, and never once coming to the city council complaining of anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1771.833s">That</a>  the members of this hardworking community are treated like they are knuckleheads by this city council and by this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1780.66s">There</a>  is no way <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1782.779s">When</a>  we are told coming to this meeting that this is already set in February 26, we will be coming with the shelter, which by the way, the address has never been given to the rest of this community without our input. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1800.509s">I</a>  will say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1803.191s">I</a>  cannot say the hospital, but currently right now as a physician, there are in a hospital in the city, two cases of tuberculosis that are the type that are resistant to medication. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1820.687s">I</a>  would like to say that in Newton, where there is a shelter, where <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1826.302s">A</a>  colleague of mine kept a family that came in with a child that was sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1832.105s">She</a>  became sick and was sick for three months with pneumonia. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1838.069s">We</a>  are not looking as a physician, and I have presented information to the Councilor, where tuberculosis and various other diseases, not just my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1851.897s">are</a>  coming into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1853.599s">Do</a>  you know that children cannot stay in shelters in this city, in this country, for more than three months? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1859.424s">And</a>  we have thousands of children that are coming into the city, it's not from me, it's from the federal government, with untreated tuberculosis. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1869.012s">Does</a>  anybody here tell me how many patients can come into the Department of Health of the City of Medford a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1877.87s">I</a>  know that you're saying that there's no children coming in, but there are people coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1881.773s">Who's</a>  going to take care of the pregnant women coming in with various diseases? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1886.637s">We</a>  have schizophrenia coming into this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1889.919s">Is</a>  there anybody here who's going to take care of the many women coming here who are immigrants, illegal aliens who are being raped and abused? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1899.187s">Do</a>  we have a domestic violence program that's going to take care of these people? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1903.635s">I'm</a>  just saying this is a middle class town that is totally unprepared for the various issues from the aliens that I have taken care of working in a federally funded health center for the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1918.846s">And</a>  I cannot say how disappointed and shocked I am, A, by how this council seems to be totally unprepared for what's coming to it, and B, let me just say as a Medford citizen for a quarter of a century, how the previous member who spoke of his family and how hard they worked to come here was treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1941.018s">It</a>  took my mother 15 years to become a legal citizen of this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1946.821s">And</a>  when she died a month ago at the age of 98, she could still speak the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1951.923s">How</a>  many people coming in here respect this country like she did? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1956.325s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1957.326s">That's</a>  my time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1958.126s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1964.989s">Any</a>  other residents like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1966.43s">Any</a>  other comments from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1969.532s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1972.295s">Thank</a>  you so much, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1974.036s">Representative</a>  Donato, sorry, another question for you, if you're willing to speak to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1978.619s">In</a>  the couple weeks since the mayor started circulating information about this temporary shelter, I've heard from a number of residents who have asked, you know, obviously folks are coming here because they're in this crisis situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1989.705s">How</a>  can we as Medford residents help these folks who might be coming temporarily into our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1994.128s">And</a>  I know, again, this might be one of the many questions <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1996.343s">That</a>  can only be answered by our partners at the state level, but is there anything you can share about folks that here in Medford can have on their radar about how to help out?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2004.06s">The</a>  only thing I can share is that the mayor has done everything in her power to deal with the state administration to see that the migrants are treated, they're in a safe place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2020.007s">But</a>  like I have indicated from the beginning, it's very difficult since the administration has not given full information to both the mayor and to the delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2032.472s">And</a>  until <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2034.395s">until</a>  they come in, have the public meeting so that the residents can understand and the members of the city government and the state government can understand what the process is, then all we can do is wait for that particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2048.587s">But</a>  I can assure you that the delegation and in particular, the mayor is on top of it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2054.652s">Understood,</a>  Representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2055.533s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2055.833s">And</a>  I think it's very clear that the bottleneck here is at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2058.716s">So</a>  thank you for the updates that you're able to provide.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2061.998s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2065.014s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please, and you have five minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2067.116s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2067.576s">Nate</a>  Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2070.158s">I</a>  am an abutter of this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2072.12s">The</a>  address is 400 Riverside Ave for the public that wants to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2077.024s">And</a>  I am not satisfied with how the mayor has communicated information to the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2082.369s">Mr.</a>  Merritt, if you could direct your comments to me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2084.25s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2084.951s">Through</a>  the chair, I am not satisfied how the mayor has communicated information to the neighbors and the neighborhood and the abutters of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2094.338s">If</a>  this was the Locust Street project again, right, this council hired an attorney because the Zoning Board of Appeals dropped the ball, didn't even have a public meeting, violated public meeting law, and the mayor was part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2113.974s">She</a>  understood that the residents had a right to information. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2117.697s">But</a>  I only hear things when I come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2119.578s">So</a>  I brought my wife with me tonight, who is an immigrant, and to all the Facebook keyboard warriors out there that want to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2127.104s">She's</a>  first generation American. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2130.247s">I'm</a>  a grandchild of immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2132.248s">I</a>  don't have a problem with immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2134.31s">I</a>  do have a problem with the way that all the information has been communicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2138.533s">This</a>  project started in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2143.171s">And</a>  there's been nothing officially published until I came here and started asking questions to get them on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2149.733s">And</a>  thank you that you all as a body are willing to entertain this, but the mayor is not publishing anything except one Facebook post. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2156.654s">And</a>  that's on set. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2160.755s">That</a>  is not a way you communicate information and especially to gain information from your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2167.617s">She</a>  hasn't talked to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2169.477s">She</a>  hasn't talked to my neighbors that I'm on the phone with right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2173.143s">So</a>  no, I don't think she's got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2176.004s">You</a>  know, she does not have a handle on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2178.426s">And</a>  honestly, I don't think you do either. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2181.968s">I</a>  care about safety of my kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2184.389s">And</a>  again, for all the keyboard warriors out there that live up in the ivory tower in the hills of this community, you don't live where I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2193.033s">Wegmans</a>  has a police guard every night, obviously because it's so safe and they're not worried about any crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2201.667s">But</a>  yet New York City, which has one of the most fantastic police forces in the world, you had a Venezuelan migrant in a shelter stabbed by other Venezuelan migrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2213.435s">Bullets</a>  fly through windows, bullets fly through siding, and it's my house that could potentially be a target with my two little kids at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2222.081s">So</a>  yeah, I got concerns because it's my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2226.604s">Is</a>  anyone in this council within view of this building at 400 Riverside Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2230.947s">Just</a>  posing the question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2233.449s">Anyone?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2236.651s">Ma'am?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2238.192s">Justin?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2239.093s">Direct</a>  your comments to me, Mr. Mayor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2240.794s">Okay,</a>  through you to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2243.936s">I'd</a>  like to hear an affirmative or a negative, quite honestly, from all the members.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2248.119s">We're</a>  happy to hear your comment, but our address is a public record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2252.242s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2254.23s">And</a>  so it's a simple yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2255.852s">I</a>  think that's fair.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2259.376s">I</a>  think you know the answer to the question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2260.758s">The</a>  answer is no. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2261.779s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2262.46s">So</a>  I am concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2264.722s">The</a>  neighbors are concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2267.168s">So</a>  if they can't find more housing, this is temporary five days until you just said, there's no housing available. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2274.49s">So</a>  then what? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2275.79s">What</a>  is preventing actually the children from being enrolled in school? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2278.79s">Because</a>  how does the city stop it when the state law says that they have to be allowed to enroll in community? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2286.112s">These</a>  are, I think, some critical questions we need answers to in the utopian ideal situation, all's well and they move away in five days. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2294.114s">How</a>  long is this gonna go on for? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2295.334s">How</a>  many years? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2298.707s">There</a>  are some legitimate concerns, public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2301.348s">How</a>  are we gonna address that, even for the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2304.85s">Trash</a>  and garbage and logistical things like that that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2311.053s">We</a>  have some questions, but apparently now it's a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2314.254s">So</a>  the train's gonna roll over us and you have zero way to influence it, is what I just heard tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2320.677s">That's</a>  unsat. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2322.238s">Madam</a>  Mayor, that's unsat. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2325.439s">I'm</a>  looking forward to the community meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2328.26s">I</a>  think you're gonna have some neighbors that are very concerned, and I hope this council can help us, at least like they tried to do during the Locust Street project. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2337.289s">So,</a>  who's gonna pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2338.89s">I</a>  mean, there's a lot of questions to get answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2342.573s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2345.942s">I</a>  appreciate you bringing this forward because this was started by a community member like yourself that had an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2350.605s">So</a>  I think we all feel the same pain of the lack of lack of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2355.908s">And</a>  I think that that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2359.076s">And</a>  we'll relay this to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2360.617s">I</a>  think we'll put it in a form of motion that when we do have this meeting, that the information is put out the robocall for all the residents in that neighborhood for at least to get those questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2372.564s">Because</a>  I think that one thing we all share are these same questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2378.226s">You</a>  know, we understand the situation that we're in that we're put in, but I think the biggest biggest concerns right now is getting the answers to the questions that we have so we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2389.41s">And</a>  this is the big problem with what you see in most communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2392.592s">When</a>  there isn't transparency, there isn't lack of there is a huge lack of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2398.41s">communication.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2399.731s">But</a>  this is truly coming from, you know, the state level, where I think that, you know, looking at the governor's office and making sure that they hear us and they that that meeting when that meeting does come, come to fruition, that the message is sent loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2414.9s">It's,</a>  it's, it's, you know, this is this is an issue immigrations of <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2420.576s">It's</a>  a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2421.316s">It's</a>  a bigger issue than we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2423.417s">That's</a>  why I know Mr. Pagliarulo brings up good points in the sense that this is a federal issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2428.478s">We're</a>  a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2430.279s">And</a>  it's not fair to the families that are brought here either. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2433.139s">I've</a>  had the fortune of coaching a lot of these young people that are forced to come into our country because they don't have anything else, and they thrive in our country, and they try to make it <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2447.256s">make</a>  it through as legal as possible to make sure they want to be American citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2452.122s">So</a>  it's a hurdle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2454.185s">We</a>  understand on every level. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2455.947s">But</a>  with this situation that we're talking about right now with the Riverside issue, there are a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2461.654s">And</a>  something that I'm going to stand strong on, we don't have the infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2466.88s">That</a>  has to be stressed to the governor through the MOU. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2469.081s">This</a>  be stressed that the mayor, we don't have the infrastructure in place to house number of families and people for more than what they're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2480.543s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Lazzaro bringing that question up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2483.844s">And</a>  there is a state law that says that truly, I've talked to teachers today, talked to teachers from both the McGlynn and the Roberts that called me about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2491.105s">St.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2491.285s">George,</a>  we truly don't have <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2494.046s">it's</a>  we're filled to capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2495.948s">And</a>  with the lack of support that they have in the special needs department, it's it would magnify things to a degree that we could never recover from our kids will not recover from, you know, so you bring a lot of good points, you know, trash health department being involved, the police making sure how do we how do we police that area that a friend on on zoom talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2517.745s">health</a>  concerns and vaccinations and making sure that people that are coming into our country, listen, we can't come into the schools, our kids can't enter schools without being vaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2526.369s">So</a>  if they're coming into this, into the housing, we're the United States of America, we should be able to vaccinate <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2533.427s">these</a>  young people that are coming in and make sure they're as healthy as possible if they're going to be in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2539.432s">So</a>  there's a lot of pieces that we all share. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2541.594s">I</a>  think that, you know, it's not something that this council is for or against. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2547.078s">We</a>  just provided, we wanted to provide an avenue so people can come up and talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2551.502s">It's</a>  not, this isn't you against us, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2553.944s">I</a>  think that we've got to find the middle ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2556.025s">We</a>  got to find the process to make sure the communication <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2560.629s">and</a>  the answers are met from everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2563.771s">We</a>  feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2564.952s">We</a>  all have the same questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2566.072s">I</a>  mean, you know, just because we're city councils don't mean that, doesn't mean that we have the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2569.915s">You've</a>  seen it a thousand times in different formats. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2571.816s">So,</a>  you know, I appreciate you bringing this forward because I think that that's what this, that's what a good community is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2577.979s">There's</a>  an issue, community member steps up, city council step in when they're not being heard and we share, we give that avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2584.763s">So</a>  I appreciate that and understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2587.645s">We</a>  feel the same way you do in the sense of getting the word out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2591.548s">Whether</a>  you're for it or against it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2593.129s">The</a>  truth of the matter is we need a line of communication so everybody feels safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2598.313s">Whether</a>  you live in the hills or whether you live right on Riverside Ave, these are big concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2603.938s">Because</a>  like you said, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2605.319s">It's</a>  not just people that are, you know, the same people that are moving in with these health issues, vaccine issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2610.424s">They're</a>  going to be shopping at Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2612.286s">They're</a>  going to be playing in the parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2613.707s">They're</a>  going to be, you know, in our libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2615.729s">We,</a>  that possibly, so it's making sure that we have everything in place to make sure that we're giving them the best opportunity to thrive while they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2622.635s">So</a>  I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2624.157s">I</a>  just want to let you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2625.058s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2632.032s">Thank</a>  you for your comment there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2634.336s">And</a>  I guess just to the for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2638.689s">I</a>  don't think I'm a bigot. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2640.25s">I'm</a>  just a neighbor who's concerned and I have neighbors, you know, that are, you know, fellow neighbors that are concerned in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2647.232s">And</a>  this can directly impact and people like, Oh, what do you mean trash? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2650.713s">What</a>  do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2651.053s">Whatever.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2651.573s">I</a>  find shopping carts in my yard all the time to begin with, I'd be happy to take them to some other person's address. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2657.935s">right</a>  and load them up in my truck and return them that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2660.256s">It's</a>  silly things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2661.556s">But</a>  also, like I said, in New York, I'm not making this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2664.797s">This</a>  is on the news that there were people getting stabbed and I don't I'm sorry, I don't want that in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2669.738s">So</a>  how do we fix it? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2671.138s">And</a>  if someone says, Oh, we're going to detail a state police officer at this building every day, then okay, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2676.359s">That's</a>  a potential solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2678.0s">But</a>  without any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2680.236s">to</a>  get in front of it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2681.576s">Are</a>  we just going to sit there and wait for all the problems to boil up? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2684.217s">I've</a>  heard from a reliable source that, for instance, that the state has had to train certain migrant communities, that it's not okay to sit there and grope a woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2691.94s">Because</a>  culturally, that's okay from where they're coming from, but it's not okay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2696.201s">So</a>  I mean, there are some serious issues that don't necessarily fall into the optimum narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2702.583s">that</a>  we really need to address it for the good of everyone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2705.565s">So</a>  think of what people want, you know, of me, but this is why I'm Bruce America, far from a bigot, you've come up here and spoken in favor of many different issues, and it didn't matter what the issue was. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2717.29s">So</a>  I think that if that's, if that's the Facebook army that's out there, that's that you don't have to we got just to just erase it, because, you know, you've come in, you've come 1000 times to this podium, and support of many different people didn't matter what <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2731.437s">whatever</a>  color they are, race they are, whatever gender they are, you're always there to support people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2736.92s">So,</a>  I think that that should be mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2739.801s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2741.522s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2741.862s">We're</a>  going to go to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2743.403s">Jacqueline.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2750.575s">My</a>  name is Jacqueline Cervone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2752.236s">I'm</a>  an 18 Powderhouse Terrace in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2754.677s">I</a>  am a Massachusetts registered nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2758.519s">I</a>  share the same health concerns as Lorna and many of you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2764.702s">You</a>  know, people are talking about their ancestors coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2767.283s">My</a>  grandparents came from Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2769.784s">came</a>  through Ellis Island, had to be quarantined for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2775.927s">People</a>  were treated for illnesses and vaccinated with whatever they had at the time for vaccinations, and had to be cleared medically before they came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2784.87s">So</a>  that's obviously a huge concern of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2788.151s">I'm</a>  also aware of the TB cases that are popping up in Massachusetts now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2795.663s">But</a>  the other issue is, and I agree with what everyone has said, you know, we pay our taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2802.147s">I</a>  can't even get the cedar to come and cut a branch off a tree that's leaning on my wires to my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2810.412s">But</a>  we can house these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2815.425s">see</a>  there are homeless people in Medford, there are homeless single mothers, there are homeless veterans, and what do we do for them? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2822.967s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2823.627s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2824.828s">But,</a>  you know, and I understand there are people in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2828.709s">I'm</a>  sure many of those people are wonderful people, I get that, but I think <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2832.95s">our</a>  own people need to be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2837.454s">I</a>  find it but it sounds like this is a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2839.836s">So,</a>  you know, you can hear us out, and everything, but it sounds like what no matter what we say, this is going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2847.043s">But</a>  my question is, so this building that they're going to be housed in, it's right now a vacant building, from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2857.292s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2858.833s">There's</a>  a</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2861.479s">It's</a>  a vacant office building, it's not a hotel.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2864.261s">Okay,</a>  so they're going to completely furnish this, completely overhaul the plumbing, completely furnish the kitchens, the bedrooms, et cetera, for a five-day visit? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2876.21s">That</a>  sounds a little suspect to me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2878.993s">I</a>  don't think we have the answers to that question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2882.315s">I'm</a>  sorry, I didn't hear you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2883.336s">I</a>  said I don't believe we have the answers to that question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2886.536s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, does that make sense to you, Mr. Bears, that you would completely furnish this place with multiple, you know, I assume the offices are gonna be little apartments for families and whoever's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2898.308s">To</a>  go through all of that for five days, I just have a hard time believing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2906.351s">I</a>  actually a hotel would be make more sense because there's already beds, there's already food, there's bathrooms, there's things like that, but to completely furnish an entire building for how many migrants did you say were coming? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2920.004s">Like</a>  250 or something?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2923.307s">That's</a>  what the mayor's statement says. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2925.369s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2925.83s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro for a second, Councilor Lazzaro has a comment.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2929.353s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2930.672s">of</a>  information I spoke with the mayor's office they are they're doing some plumbing retrofitting and they will have bathrooms smart bathrooms built and I believe what happens is it'll be five days <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2946.653s">her</a>  sort of family, and then they'll cycle through and it'll be the next group that will come in, it wouldn't be just open for five days, and then.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2953.799s">Oh,</a>  so, so it's going to be several groups at five day intervals. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2958.402s">So</a>  it's not just five days, it's going to be five days at a time for different groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2963.686s">So</a>  it's going to be more than five days for us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2966.128s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2968.263s">So</a>  let's, I think we should just step back, and there's a few facts here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2971.744s">So</a>  number one, this is a private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2974.464s">The</a>  state is making an agreement with this private property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2978.105s">So</a>  that's the arrangement here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2979.846s">The</a>  mayor has secured a bit of understanding, but this is an agreement between the state and a private property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2986.067s">The</a>  state is paying for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2987.988s">State</a>  government is paying for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2990.228s">And</a>  as councilors are set, the building will have to meet certain basic standards, such as the plumbing code. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2998.217s">The</a>  issue here is that the more permanent shelters, such as empty hotels, motels, and other structures, have hit their maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3007.768s">And</a>  these are going to be temporary places for people to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3010.631s">I</a>  think a few weeks ago, if people were reading the news, they were using the empty conference rooms at the Department of Transportation headquarters to house people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3018.78s">So</a>  this is meant to be a better solution than using empty conference rooms to house people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3024.31s">And</a>  I think if folks are also watching the news, they would know that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3029.67s">Governors</a>  and leaders of states on the border have decided to weaponize this issue and start shipping people to other states for political purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3038.375s">So</a>  that is another reason that we're seeing this influx where there may be other places that could certainly handle this, but the leaders have chosen to kind of try to go against federal immigration policy and best practices.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3054.722s">Um,</a>  well, I mean, what goes against our constitution and the law is the open border, but I don't, I'm not meaning to disrespect anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3064.326s">You</a>  know, people have a right to a home into a clean bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3067.307s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3068.948s">I</a>  understand that there's going to be people, families with children. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3072.169s">I</a>  respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3073.09s">I</a>  understand that my concerns are health. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3077.401s">And</a>  all of these people aren't going to be nice little families. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3079.983s">Let's</a>  face it, we've seen a lot of fentanyl pouring over the border. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3083.605s">We've</a>  seen, you know, a lot of child trafficking happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3088.708s">It's,</a>  it's, it's concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3090.269s">It's</a>  concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3091.53s">You</a>  know, I would love to think that they're going to be just a lot of nice families that are just looking for a better life. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3098.215s">But</a>  that's not the reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3100.016s">So</a>  I do have concerns about health and safety.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3104.824s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3105.524s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3106.205s">And</a>  the state has said that these will be families and also folks who are in these facilities have been processed legally through the immigration authorities at the federal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3115.952s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3116.392s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3119.874s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3120.114s">I'd</a>  like to thank everybody who has come forward to speak so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3124.377s">And</a>  I appreciate Pete and I appreciate that everybody sees this as a place where they can <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3129.94s">to</a>  express their thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3131.301s">I'd</a>  just like to bring up one point that's been coming up in a couple of different public comment periods, which has been the safety issue specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3143.865s">Safety</a>  concerns can stem from several different things when it comes to <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3148.587s">violent</a>  crime specifically, which I think was a sentiment in a few public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3154.008s">I</a>  did some reading this past week, which is influencing my own thinking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3158.689s">I'd</a>  just like to share it, which was a paper that was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2020 comparing crime rates between undocumented immigrants, legal immigrants, and native-born US citizens in Texas. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3173.651s">So</a>  it's one study, but I think it's pretty relevant to this, which <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3178.632s">You</a>  can go through the whole thing online if you'd like, but the significant section says, despite its centrality to public and political discourse, we lack even basic information on fundamental questions regarding undocumented immigrants and crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3192.419s">This</a>  stems largely from data constraints going beyond existing research. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3196.541s">The</a>  authors in this study utilize data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, which checks and records the immigration status of all arrestees throughout the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3206.185s">Contrary</a>  to public perception, we observe considerably lower felony arrest rates among undocumented immigrants compared to legal immigrants and native-born U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3214.89s">citizens</a>  and find no evidence that undocumented criminality has increased in recent years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3219.652s">Our</a>  findings help us understand why the most aggressive <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3222.994s">immigrant</a>  removal programs have not delivered on their crime reduction promises and are unlikely to do so in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3229.416s">While</a>  the news does report on unequal rates about crimes that happen in immigrant communities versus everywhere else, I think it is important to keep in mind what the scientific research says. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3241.679s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3244.259s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3244.92s">I'm</a>  going to let Jessica Taddeo</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3250.779s">Hello,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3251.899s">Jessica</a>  Taddeo, 50 Feldsview Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3254.08s">in</a>  Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3256.041s">I</a>  first and foremost want to thank Councilor Lemingng for bringing those statistics forward because this was actually something I would like to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3266.305s">I</a>  wasn't planning on speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3267.826s">I</a>  actually didn't join the meeting until a bit after it started, but I have been on long enough to <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3275.109s">be</a>  appalled by some of the comments that I'm hearing and if you hear my voice shaking a little bit it's because I am really emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3282.813s">I</a>  grew up in Medford and I went off to college in Rhode Island telling everyone how grateful I was to receive an education where I was sympathetic towards people's backgrounds and lived experiences and had a great <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3298.081s">experience</a>  being in such a diverse community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3301.764s">And</a>  I am so saddened hearing the way that some of my neighbors are talking about people who are coming to this country for the same reasons that their relatives did. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3313.934s">I</a>  work in my mother's school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3315.535s">She</a>  works in Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3316.276s">It's</a>  a majority-minority school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3318.198s">A</a>  lot of the kids don't even speak English. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3320.64s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3322.361s">I'm</a>  just now thinking about how some of these families staying in these temporary homes could go to the Mississaugas or the Roberts and have their first experience in a classroom and have a really positive one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3332.866s">And</a>  that experience wouldn't be afforded to them if the federal government, the state of Massachusetts didn't set up or at least develop an infrastructure for housing migrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3343.37s">I</a>  don't think it's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3345.832s">for</a>  people to sit here and, you know, discuss the nitty-gritty logistics of whether or not the apartments are going to be furnished. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3353.658s">Like,</a>  these families deserve a roof over their head, and if Medford can play a part in making sure that can happen, then we should all, we should all without a doubt be in support of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3366.673s">When</a>  I hear talk of crime and safety and disease, and those words are being used in the context of talking about immigrants from non-white countries, that's not just a racist dog whistle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3378.976s">That</a>  is something that makes me uncomfortable, knowing that somebody in my neighborhood feels that way about someone who just wants to come here for a better life. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3389.138s">And</a>  so, like I said, if Medford can play any part in making that happen, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3393.797s">whether</a>  or not they communicated the initiative poorly or not, I think we have a moral obligation to these families who want to come to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3402.583s">If</a>  we can provide them a roof over their head and a place to learn and a place to be happy, then who are we to say no to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3409.508s">So</a>  I just encourage members of the community to be really mindful about how they're talking about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3416.472s">And</a>  I encourage them to do a little more reading about the actual statistics of trafficking, drugs, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3424.369s">And</a>  all of the rhetoric, the way that we talk about migrants, like, please, I encourage you to look at multiple news sources because some of the facts that I'm hearing are nothing but falsities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3435.819s">And</a>  so just that's all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3439.943s">And</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3443.496s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3449.06s">I</a>  think that again, I think we're missing the point here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3451.842s">I</a>  think that what the biggest concern is communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3455.364s">I</a>  think the biggest concern and what people are saying are valid valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3460.968s">If</a>  it's offensive, I can understand that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3462.829s">I</a>  can understand how some people might feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3465.011s">But</a>  they're legitimately valid points when you're talking about, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3471.593s">Are</a>  we communicating enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3472.834s">Is</a>  it transparent enough to understand that if we're allowing this to happen, are we giving the support to help these families thrive? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3482.536s">So</a>  I think some of these questions like, are they being vaccinated? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3485.696s">That's</a>  not just for protection for the people that are in our community, but for the people that are gonna be in the same area with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3495.017s">So</a>  it is a legitimate question that when I reached out to different communities like Cambridge, like Revere, these are the same questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3504.028s">Again,</a>  I don't want to cloud this as being something that was really racist or this should be failed, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3511.696s">I'm</a>  a first-generation American. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3513.178s">My</a>  father and mother came through Ellis Island. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3515.781s">I</a>  understand the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3518.304s">I</a>  work with kids that are from Lynn, same type of children. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3523.49s">And</a>  I understand what they go through every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3526.553s">And</a>  I feel their pain and I work for them every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3528.956s">But</a>  at the same time, with this situation, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3531.579s">Let's</a>  not muddy the water and understand something very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3534.323s">This</a>  is just about communication, making sure that not only our citizens have the answers they want to be protected, but also let's not forget the people that are coming into these houses and understand to make sure that we're doing the right thing for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3549.96s">So</a>  I think it goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3551.3s">I</a>  don't think it's just this shouldn't be pitted again. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3553.461s">Like</a>  I said earlier, this isn't something that one against the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3556.342s">This</a>  is something that we need more information to be distributed to all parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3563.443s">To</a>  make sure that we're making sure we're taking care of not only the visitors that are here, but also the residents that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3570.356s">And</a>  I think that like, from what I heard from the most part, from the phone calls, the emails, and people that are coming to this podium, it's really not understanding why they're not being heard or why the messages are being sent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3582.559s">So</a>  I thank Representative Donato for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3586.04s">I</a>  understand the mayor has sent multiple messages about not truly knowing or getting the answers that they need, but that's why having that meeting with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3595.802s">Is</a>  it a done deal? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3597.699s">I've</a>  heard it was to and then I heard it wasn't because nothing signed yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3601.541s">But</a>  again, the council bear said this is an issue that it's coming directly from a landlord and the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3612.787s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3614.005s">What</a>  we're hearing is our political leaders don't have the power to get that information out that we need yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3623.407s">So</a>  like I said, I'm hoping that with getting this meeting out and all the parties are understanding, because I'm sure Representative Donato is going to go back to the state level and they're going to hear what Medford's saying and forward against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3636.709s">And</a>  I think that we need to have that meeting that really answers these big questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3641.67s">And</a>  again, it's not just, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3643.51s">you</a>  know, for the last caller, it's the last person on zoom, it's, it's not just to protect our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3648.254s">The</a>  truth of the matter is, it's really protecting those young, especially the children that are in that in that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3654.699s">Because</a>  no one's giving them any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3656.32s">And</a>  listen, for someone that's worked in this field, and worked with this demographic for the last 1520 years, 30 years, I understand how difficult it is for these families, and what they're going to be going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3669.07s">But</a>  I would hate to say that we're rushing this process through just to say we house them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3676.437s">That</a>  doesn't do people any good either. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3679.54s">We</a>  have to make sure we're protecting their safeties as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3682.563s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3685.466s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3686.487s">I'm</a>  going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3688.069s">Eileen,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3694.78s">My</a>  name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3700.645s">And</a>  I just would like to say that I really appreciated both Councilor Scarpelli's remarks and Jessica Taddeo's remarks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3713.215s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Scarpelli that information is essential. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3719.111s">And</a>  I think it's possible that a lot of details are just being worked out now in the state and that, you know, when they make a final decision, then then possibly we'll get to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3734.401s">But,</a>  you know, I think, Councilor Scarpella, you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3739.344s">You're</a>  overlooking some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3743.945s">some</a>  of the fear and animosity and stereotyping that we have heard tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3750.635s">And</a>  it just goes against all the <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3755.831s">statements</a>  about how welcoming a city that Medford is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3762.217s">And</a>  it's just so uncharitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3764.54s">You</a>  know, I taught English to immigrants for about 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3771.767s">About</a>  half of our population, these were adults, were undocumented. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3777.032s">And</a>  their stories were heart-rending. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3780.115s">And</a>  very few people understand what these people have gone through. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3787.24s">You</a>  do, Councilor Scarpelli, and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3791.343s">And</a>  I wish you would communicate to your constituency a little bit more of what you understand, because it really is upsetting listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3804.178s">you</a>  know, propaganda from the right wing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3809.704s">And,</a>  you know, this is primarily a Christian city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3813.889s">What</a>  about the Good Samaritan and all that, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3817.593s">Don't</a>  you want to help people? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3819.695s">And</a>  yeah, we have to make sure they get the healthcare they need because yeah, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3824.761s">They're</a>  going to be among us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3826.742s">And</a>  we don't want to get any kind of diseases. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3829.743s">So</a>  that means we have to take care of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3833.265s">God</a>  has placed them here in our community, whether we like it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3838.527s">And</a>  we need to take care of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3840.968s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3843.89s">Thank</a>  you, Eileen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3844.77s">Is</a>  there anyone else who hasn't spoken yet who would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3851.687s">All</a>  right, and I saw a couple people who had already spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3853.752s">I'll</a>  go, Mr. Merritt, if we could, you know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3855.876s">I'll</a>  keep it short.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3856.457s">Yeah,</a>  I don't think we're going to solve federal immigration policy tonight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3859.203s">No,</a>  but I did want to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3862.324s">something</a>  that Councilor Lemingng had mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3866.208s">I</a>  appreciate statistics, I'm a scientist also, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3869.511s">So</a>  definitely some mind meld there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3872.713s">That</a>  said, my particular home is probably the outlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3878.639s">And</a>  again, this is directly across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3880.641s">So</a>  this is where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3882.362s">When</a>  my wife was pregnant with my oldest child, just a few years ago, we had someone break into our house <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3890.404s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3891.305s">Not</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3892.146s">And</a>  the only thing that saved her from getting hurt was me putting a door in front of that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3898.273s">Medford</a>  PD was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3899.454s">They</a>  came over the detectives, you know, did their thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3903.458s">I</a>  scared the person away. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3905.581s">And</a>  they eventually caught up with them down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3907.463s">Okay,</a>  that's a terrible thing to happen to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3912.865s">This</a>  is where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3914.246s">Not</a>  only that, during that incident, I found out from Medford PD that, oh, yeah, we arrested someone under your porch a couple years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3922.273s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3922.573s">When</a>  the officers are familiar with my backyard, because they've had to come in and find people, I think it was shoplifters or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3931.141s">This</a>  isn't about race. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3933.939s">My</a>  concerns are literally because number one, there's crime in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3937.622s">It's</a>  a real thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3938.822s">The</a>  businesses that are there actually are concerned about, like there's a lot of mechanic shops and so on and so forth, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3946.027s">Vehicles,</a>  I'm sure you've heard like a legitimate thing where people were cutting off Cadillac converters for cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3952.151s">I</a>  mean, there's real things that are happening in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3956.414s">So</a>  I'd love to hear from the police chief <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3959.281s">right,</a>  what the actual crime is by zone to help give you some real data to work from. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3966.028s">But</a>  I'm going off my personal experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3967.709s">So</a>  now there were two, two crimes committed, literally in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3975.477s">Right,</a>  like I said, Wegmans has a police officer for a reason, not because they want to go spend money. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3981.821s">And,</a>  you know, like I said, it's great when the police can show up at your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3985.962s">But</a>  at the same time, what happens if it's one of my kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3988.302s">Who</a>  am I blaming? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3989.283s">Who</a>  am I suing? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3990.143s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3991.563s">If</a>  we don't protect our people here first. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3996.104s">So</a>  that's where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=3997.204s">It's</a>  I don't care what your race or any of that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4001.305s">I</a>  really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4002.205s">But</a>  I also know when you have like the Occupy Wall Street, when you've had a lot of clusters of people in places that aren't homes, they're not built for homes, bad things can happen to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4014.073s">So</a>  I'm a concerned dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4016.735s">I'm</a>  okay to say that, but I'd rather not have statistics thrown in my face and say, oh, you know, you're just a, you know, you're just a right wing nut job. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4025.021s">No,</a>  I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4026.502s">I'm</a>  a concerned dad where already bad things have happened in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4031.125s">That's</a>  my concern.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4034.788s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4036.129s">I</a>  mean, I just wanna say, I think we can also appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4039.923s">There's</a>  outliers, and then there's statistical averages. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4042.285s">And</a>  outliers aren't part of statistical averages. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4045.126s">And</a>  we're individual people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4046.928s">But</a>  on average, if we're talking about crime in the city, crime is down massively in the last 25 years in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4052.811s">And</a>  that's what the statistics that the police chief provides to us annually show. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4056.974s">It</a>  doesn't mean that crime doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4058.415s">It</a>  just means that the number of crimes is down. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4060.456s">And</a>  on average, it's a much safer community than it was even maybe 10 years ago when someone was under your porch. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4069.366s">five</a>  years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4070.827s">I'm</a>  going to go to Lorna Wilkerson. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4073.31s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4073.45s">Wilkerson,</a>  you've already spoken once, so if you could try to keep the comments short and direct, and then we will move on the question as amended.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4093.683s">Just</a>  a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4095.084s">This</a>  is a private homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4097.586s">Is</a>  this private homeowner benefiting from tax from the citizens of this city?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4105.932s">Just</a>  a quick question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4107.333s">This</a>  is a private homeowner.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4110.075s">Our</a>  understanding is that the state is signing a contract with this private property owner to rent the property for the purposes that the state would like to rent it for. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4117.961s">The</a>  property owner pays taxes to the city.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4124.602s">So</a>  this individual is going to be able to make a decision that's going to affect the entire citizenry of this town?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4135.445s">That</a>  is how private property owners have that right, yes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4140.426s">And</a>  the City Council is okay with this?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4144.228s">City</a>  Council cannot violate the Constitution and take private property without due process, and I don't think we want an eminent domain in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4150.969s">I</a>  don't think we have the money to do so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4153.812s">Oh,</a>  no, it's quite the opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4155.393s">I'm</a>  not asking about eminent domain. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4157.594s">I'm</a>  concerned that this citizen can affect 56,000 other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4163.598s">And</a>  in turn, as had been discussed before, that the state could take the property from the members of this town if they can't fit enough people who are immigrants into appropriate shelters. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4181.067s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4185.436s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, to request a robocall to the neighbourhood once the date and time and location of the public meeting is scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4195.3s">Is</a>  there any further comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4198.902s">Is</a>  there a second on the amended motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4201.243s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4202.683s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4204.044s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4204.464s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4208.366s">We</a>  do have the election report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4210.327s">I</a>  know this went a little—could we maybe take that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4214.431s">Motion</a>  to suspend the rules and take <a href="../resolutions/23-474.pdf"><font color="green">23-474</font></a>.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4219.735s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Collins to suspend the rules to take paper <a href="../resolutions/23-474.pdf"><font color="green">23-474</font></a>, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4224.218s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4225.138s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4225.559s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4226.079s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4230.754s">2023</a>  Municipal Election Process Errors and Accountability Report, and I believe the longer motion I don't have in front of me right now, but this was requesting both a written report and that the Elections Manager and Elections Commission join us at this meeting to discuss the 2023 election, what issues and errors were identified, and what process improvements will be made going forward to address them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4251.42s">And</a>  I will turn this over to Manager Ripley, Elections Manager Ripley.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4259.86s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4260.4s">Thank</a>  you for inviting me before you to discuss the election of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4266.243s">I</a>  submitted to you the after action report that was presented in the agenda packet last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4273.487s">I'm</a>  happy to answer any questions you might have about the after action report and any other questions you might have about pertaining to the election.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4285.253s">Any</a>  questions or comments from members of the council regarding the after action report? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4290.253s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4296.196s">Thank</a>  you for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4297.657s">I</a>  know it took some time, but this is obviously a very bothersome situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4304.641s">The</a>  way the process was handled in many different levels was very alarming to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4313.476s">Like</a>  the lack of communication was alarming to us, but I see some of the protocol in place that I'm reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4322.219s">I</a>  find it a little alarming where the biggest thing as we went through this process and how difficult it was and the concerning issues that we saw, probably the biggest thing that affected me personally is how many people <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4341.9s">mentioned</a>  to me long time voters said they would never ever vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4348.706s">in</a>  a local election again, by the way, the optics looks now, there was nothing wrong, I guess that everything came out that you did the refill, there was a recall or recount for for numbers, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4363.132s">It</a>  wouldn't nothing would change. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4364.652s">It</a>  wasn't this this conspiracy theory that was out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4368.334s">But</a>  what I do know is what I saw firsthand and what I heard firsthand election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4375.056s">And</a>  what I do want to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4377.262s">we</a>  do moving forward is making sure that people that are involved in the election process, whether it be your office, our commissioners, whether it's our poll workers, or whether it's people that are working the polls, and that's where I'm going to come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4392.747s">You</a>  have people that exercise their rights <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4396.263s">to</a>  go and work polls, and I'm reading the criteria, and I've been doing this since I was a little kid, neighboring communities, and understand that this is a process that's legally in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4410.372s">And</a>  there's something even here that says that what people don't understand, what I'm speaking is poll workers, people that don't know that are watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4419.997s">candidates</a>  have an opportunity to build a team to make sure they're working their team to most efficient process to make sure they get their voters out on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4435.626s">So</a>  people work very hard to set up these teams that at each polling location, they had what's called the poll watcher. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4446.013s">And</a>  a poll watcher would sit in an approved area by law, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4450.751s">they</a>  would, I know that it said that they're not to provide a chair or table, we understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4458.076s">We</a>  have here that this is the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4461.438s">This</a>  is where we wanna help people feel comfortable and understand the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4465.441s">And</a>  there's this part here that says they're not to sit down, even if they bring their own chairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4473.066s">That's</a>  something I would question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4476.049s">Okay,</a>  I think that's terrible for the fact that it's exactly why we're here tonight for these little things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4483.331s">The</a>  understanding of educating our workers, the process of the new pads. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4489.092s">Now,</a>  what we trained, because I was part of one of these teams, they were trained, the poll workers were trained to understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4498.454s">As</a>  a person comes in, they're asked for their ID or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4504.895s">They</a>  were then asked for their name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4509.197s">Then</a>  they would say their name and they would repeat back their name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4513.64s">What</a>  we saw firsthand though, because I was there, what I saw was it would say, they would show their ID and then they'd go right through. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4522.765s">It</a>  wasn't repeated in some cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4524.826s">In</a>  some other cases, their names were given but they weren't repeated back. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4531.263s">So</a>  the whole format was a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4534.905s">The</a>  way that poll workers that volunteered to come out, the way they were treated was horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4542.853s">So</a>  as we're moving forward to this process, now, whatever the process is, if it's just putting out the markers, where to stand on election day, because we didn't do that this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4555.581s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4555.761s">I</a>  don't know, but we didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4557.402s">So</a>  we had people at different locations moving anywhere they wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4561.525s">And</a>  you had some areas with some aggressive poll managers that are coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4567.169s">I</a>  forgot what we call them, but, and then we had other areas that we didn't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4570.631s">So</a>  it was inconsistencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4572.495s">So</a>  the process in total, I'm reading this, and I'll be honest with you, I'm not truly satisfied because when some of these issues occurred with the ballots and who got what ballots and the misprinting of the ballots, we as a council found it to be a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4591.705s">We</a>  said, quote unquote, that perception is reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4596.055s">And</a>  if we need to do anything, please, let's work as a team to figure out a way, whether it's approving money, whether it's hiring people, whether it's getting people educated, we didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4604.738s">Instead,</a>  we just ran with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4606.679s">And</a>  it was exactly what we were afraid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4609.64s">It</a>  was a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4611.502s">It</a>  was completely a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4613.483s">Then</a>  the process moves forward with people getting ballots that they shouldn't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4618.406s">Then</a>  we have, we've corrected that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4620.207s">Then</a>  there was some ballots that, you know, that had the wrong dates and we corrected that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4624.13s">And</a>  then, then we go to the election day and there were multiple issues with people not understanding the process and how people were treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4632.635s">Then</a>  you move after the election process and understanding that there were legal documents that were sent out saying, for instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4642.793s">The</a>  mail-in ballots will be tabulated here at City Hall and posted at eight o'clock at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4649.376s">That</a>  was never done. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4651.136s">Questions</a>  that people have asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4652.637s">We</a>  talked about when it stopped, polling stops at eight, the voting stops at eight, and 8.30 things will be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4659.84s">Well,</a>  we didn't get posts, we didn't realize the final numbers until one o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4666.175s">So</a>  these are all legitimate issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4668.358s">And</a>  I read through this report, and it sounds great, but I think it needs more substance. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4673.985s">I</a>  think it needs more, I think the biggest part right now, especially when we talk about the election day, is the education and the fact that the poll workers <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4685.638s">are</a>  valued. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4687.319s">And</a>  if we have to find that if value is by by expense, for those important dates, then we should find whatever we need to make sure financially they're valued. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4697.963s">So</a>  we get more people interested in this council talk about, you know, what we're going to talk about in a minute about a rate pay raise for school committee and saying we'll get better candidates if we pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4708.848s">But</a>  let's find a way to make sure that we're putting everything in place so the March elections, we don't have the issues we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4716.912s">Because</a>  like I said, I hate the fact that we had to feed into the narrative of what we saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4726.857s">And</a>  some of these issues are concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4729.958s">I</a>  still, I don't like the fact, this is part of the election process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4734.701s">And</a>  poll watchers, and I know for sure, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4738.24s">because</a>  I'm married to one of them, that some of these people are angels, and the way they were treated, and the way that when we were then presented to explain to them the laws of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4751.834s">that</a>  we had and then being treated the way they were was appalling to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4757.976s">And</a>  what we did was not only did we let questions and let perception become reality, the biggest concern I had right now was we lost good people that dedicated their voting rights to this community every time we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4775.541s">And</a>  we have to find a way as a team <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4778.254s">to</a>  do is to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4778.574s">Commission</a>  your office in this council, the mayor's office to make people feel confident that they should come out to vote that their vote does count that if they're part of the process of a <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4796.491s">they're</a>  given every right that they're supposed to be given to the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4800.152s">And</a>  at the same time, educate the people so they understand the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4804.513s">So</a>  again, I hate to be harsh because I tell you what, when I say love, I love some of your commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4813.734s">I</a>  go way back with the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4815.195s">There's</a>  no way to blame here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4817.015s">But</a>  I think my frustration came, especially right after the election, was the lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4823.274s">and</a>  the lack of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4824.538s">And</a>  so, you know, here we are, January. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4830.166s">the</a>  20th and we're talking about the report that was passed in and I think that this is a good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4837.148s">But</a>  for this councilor, I would recommend that we start a subcommittee, Mr. President, with this process that we meet with both commissioners and the elections office to make sure that this council is working, working step by step to make sure you're getting everything you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4855.575s">So</a>  we don't have the lack of <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4858.996s">the</a>  lack of employees downstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4861.817s">We</a>  saw it firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4863.017s">We</a>  know it's not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4864.558s">We</a>  know that it's a it's an undermanned process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4869.02s">But</a>  we're saying if this is the council, we our our strength is making sure that we vote on a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4876.414s">And</a>  we're working hand in hand with the commission and the elections office that we're working through this all the way through the budget season to make sure that we're staffing a staff that's gonna give it the respect it deserves moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4892.037s">Because</a>  I think this was, there were a lot of concerning issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4895.458s">And</a>  again, it's someone that's built up a lot of sadness and anger for the simple fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4905.16s">people</a>  that were there, people that dedicated themselves to the election process, and people that just came out to vote have now found themselves not wanting to do that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4914.746s">And</a>  to me, that is a disgrace and it's sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4918.528s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4920.109s">Chancellor</a>  Schrapp, I think you, just to clarify, you wanted a motion that we, me and the Governance Committee, we continue to continue to review the <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4931.793s">updates</a>  and reforms listed in this report and check in on them in advance of the March election and afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4941.478s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4943.739s">Meet</a>  with the Elections Commission.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4964.684s">It's</a>  the commission's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4965.425s">It's</a>  the election, the election department's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4968.227s">This</a>  is something that if we really want ownership of this, we all have to have ownership in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4972.511s">And</a>  I think that, you know, we don't, I take blame in it myself because, you know, we let that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4978.217s">We</a>  let that office go down to one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4982.688s">We</a>  saw the mistakes, so is that okay, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4988.653s">Yeah,</a>  I got emotional and governance committee meet with commission and staff to check in and make sure that their needs are met relative to the, yep, got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4999.042s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Callahan, Councilor Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5004.338s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5005.158s">So,</a>  when I was reading this after action report, I assumed that it would include some explanation of the things that had gone wrong, and why they had gone wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5017.744s">And</a>  I, I just don't see anything like that in here I see a lot of things like, you know, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5024.082s">As</a>  Councilor Scarpelli said, we often have these results by 9pm, and yet we didn't have the results until 1 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5033.371s">And</a>  rather than any sort of explanation of why that happened, it says all ballots must be counted on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5039.482s">The</a>  tabulation facility will post the tabulated tapes in the same method as the individual precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5043.766s">Unofficial</a>  results will be released once, like there is nothing in here that explains what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5049.05s">So</a>  my first question is perhaps I misunderstood what this report was supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5053.895s">So</a>  I'd like to ask what the report was supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5057.258s">And</a>  I think it would be incredibly helpful to have some sort of understanding of what it was that actually went wrong because I don't see that in here at all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5067.034s">I</a>  will look for the original motion language. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5068.895s">If</a>  you have anything else you want to say, I can go to Vice President Collins and get back to you with the Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5074.939s">Thank</a>  you, President Pierce. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5076.7s">Manager</a>  Ripley, commissioners, thank you so much for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5078.822s">I</a>  appreciate the diligence and effort gone into the after action report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5083.165s">I</a>  appreciate my fellow councilors' comments on this so far, and I think that my initial observations from the report follow the same trends. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5092.813s">really</a>  appreciate that this is kind of a comprehensive overview of the beginning to end of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5098.235s">But</a>  I agree, I think that, you know, for myself as one Councilor, I was hoping for kind of that diagnosis of, you know, these issues that we raised before the election, on election day, after the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5112.079s">You</a>  know, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5114.386s">Everybody</a>  can relate to, you know, when you're looking at something that didn't go the way that you wanted it to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5119.888s">You</a>  have to start out, okay, what exactly, what were we shooting for? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5124.349s">Didn't</a>  quite happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5125.569s">You</a>  need to know the why. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5126.63s">We</a>  need to know the why. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5128.07s">None</a>  of this is personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5130.271s">But</a>  as Councilors, as electeds, as representatives, as a community, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5135.272s">if</a>  we're going to have faith that our three very consequential elections this year, which are going to see much higher turnout probably than the one in November did, if we can trust and tell the community to trust that those are going to go as well as we know that we can, we need to know exactly why, exactly what we're going to do differently than what we did in November in the lead up to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5156.398s">So,</a>  you know, for example, you know, I appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5162.881s">For</a>  example, under election preparation, you're noting every part of that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5167.765s">You</a>  mentioned at this point in time, we have destroyed all old supplies from the state, talking about the information sheet that was sent in and mail-in ballots that referenced an election in 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5177.532s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5178.393s">For</a>  example, I would love to see <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5180.498s">or</a>  maybe talk about in subcommittee, if that's a more reasonable timeline for this, what is our policy for when old elections materials are destroyed or removed from the office so that we know they will never be put in a ballot for which they're irrelevant, that kind of procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5199.448s">You</a>  know, similarly, I know one of the issues that I was hearing the most about on election day was the interfacing of wardens and voters at the polls around things like voter guides or how people were checked in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5215.044s">Totally</a>  heard that most of the wardens did a fine job, you know, did the role that they were hired to perform. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5223.831s">You</a>  know, this is one of the areas of the city where we really have to strive for perfection because voting rights are inalienable and we have to <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5235.706s">It's</a>  just essential that everybody has the full accessibility to their vote and everything that comes along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5243.231s">So</a>  this is why this has been a project for us to deliberate on this and meet on this and want to go over this to make sure that we're all entering into a resilient election year together. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5255.638s">And</a>  I think that the interfacing between the poll workers and those going to the polls, that is an issue where we have to, again, we have to strive for perfection every single time because it's a voter enfranchisement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5266.369s">It's</a>  a confidence issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5269.389s">I</a>  know on the issue of staffing, that's one that we brought up when we raised this paper to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5276.793s">And</a>  among our questions and directives, it's not just for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5279.695s">And</a>  again, I really thank you for the detail you've put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5283.137s">We</a>  also had a motion to the administration to say, clearly there's a staffing need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5287.86s">There's</a>  a demonstrated, there's an articulated staffing need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5290.321s">We</a>  wanna know how we can help expedite that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5292.843s">I</a>  think this council is pretty young. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5295.704s">The</a>  previous council was unified in saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5299.056s">the</a>  election department needs staff, let's get it staffed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5303.604s">But</a>  if we need to dial down on that to get specific on <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5307.318s">here's</a>  exactly what we need in the next budget cycle for a fully staffed elections department. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5312.862s">Let's</a>  have those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5314.504s">If</a>  we need to get specific about here's how many wardens and poll workers that we had for the November, 2023 election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5321.569s">And</a>  it was a little thin and we know that turnout is going to be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5325.712s">So</a>  here's what we need to shoot for. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5327.093s">And</a>  let's talk about and communicate and make public the plan for getting to that number as close as we can to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5333.498s">I</a>  think that these are conversations that would really behoove us to go over publicly, you know, for our edification and again for that project of reestablishing some of the confidence that has been lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5347.803s">And</a>  ideally, hopefully to, you know, add to the efforts of advertising the poll worker positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5359.284s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's motion to continue this conversation in a subcommittee of the government's committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5365.352s">I</a>  think that that will really help us to flesh out some of the additional detail and specific next steps that we'd like to see beyond this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5373.863s">And</a>  again, I thank you for your time and for all your hard work all year

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5481.533s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5484.055s">I</a>  think my thoughts are in line with the councilors who have spoken already. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5490.521s">I</a>  want to first thank you all for putting together this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5494.425s">I</a>  know oftentimes we request reports and they kind of go into the ether to have an <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5500.811s">I</a>  think, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5501.051s">Pretty</a>  thorough report back is helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5503.452s">Um</a>  that being said, you know, there's still some questions that we have that aren't necessarily settled in this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5510.256s">It</a>  might be better and wiser to, um to meet and subcommittee about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5514.778s">Um</a>  that way we can give you all time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5517.259s">We</a>  can come up with our list of, um of more specific questions that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5529.488s">I</a>  think to restore that confidence, it's helpful to have some document as kind of like a guide for someone who doesn't know how elections are run. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5542.037s">I</a>  think reading this part of the gap in terms of what we're perceiving and maybe what the intention was comes from the fact that you all just understand how elections are run. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5554.685s">And</a>  so there are basic underlying <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5558.848s">I</a>  think underlying steps, procedures that are just very obvious to the Elections Commission that aren't very obvious to us as residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5568.572s">And</a>  so I think we can work together to think through what those questions might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5576.696s">Something</a>  in my mind is the question of central tabulation, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5583.337s">and</a>  what seems like a shift from an old system where we used to count at polling booths to now this mixed system where we have some votes, some ballots counted at polling locations, some ballots counted here as a central tab. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5597.648s">I</a>  think further clarification on what determines what's counted where, why have we made that decision versus why have we changed this new system would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5609.037s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5612.349s">There</a>  are outstanding questions I've heard from constituents about even though the numbers ultimately did add up, a lot of these numbers were found on different sheets. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5623.239s">And</a>  so why was that the case? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5625.621s">How</a>  can we make sure going forward that the sheets that are published by the city <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5630.546s">the</a>  numbers all add up and are final. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5634.829s">I</a>  think some over the last few election cycles, some residents have been a little confused as to why we're giving an update at 9 p.m., let's say, and another update, a final update at 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5647.779s">instead</a>  of doing it in one complete batch. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5650.381s">I</a>  think these are just some of the larger questions that residents might have that you might know the answers to that maybe are <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5658.647s">a</a>  bit evidence to you all but not as evident to us and would be helpful to uh to have in a report or to talk about in the South.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5665.131s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5668.573s">Councilor</a>  Lemingng. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5670.954s">We</a>  appreciate that there's not enough staff working in the elections department and that the folks on the commissions are <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5680.64s">I'm</a>  a member of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5681.74s">I'm</a>  largely there as volunteers of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5684.001s">So</a>  that is that is an issue, and I have sympathy for the, uh, lack of capacity to complete the work required for all the elections that you need to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5695.783s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5697.203s">I</a>  do sympathize with what Councilor Callahan said about the expectations for the report in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5710.009s">If</a>  I were a person that knew nothing about the election and I read this report, I don't think I would be able to recount events and all the issues that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5719.815s">My</a>  idea with what a complete detail-oriented report would be is if I could have that being somebody who knew nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5731.143s">In</a>  order to know everything that happened on the election, you would have to have <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5738.527s">This</a>  report, you'd have to have a number of different posts on the Internet, and you'd have to talk to a number of different people to find all the details, notwithstanding things that have already been mentioned by my colleagues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5751.631s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5754.741s">That</a>  is what I was expecting and that is what I would like to see because it's important to know in details all of the issues that you experienced and all of the ways that you are potentially lacking support, which may have caused these issues to come up to begin with so that we can then try to fix them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5776.33s">So</a>  that is... <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5781.672s">That's</a>  all I'd like to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5783.053s">Thank</a>  you very much for coming out here tonight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5788.895s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lemingng. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5790.916s">Any</a>  further comments from Councilors?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5792.756s">Just</a>  one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5794.017s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5794.797s">I</a>  think Councilor Lemingng brought something up that I had as a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5799.439s">I</a>  think that we have two commission members that have done yeoman's work and gone above and beyond, and we see you two everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5809.203s">You're</a>  everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5810.632s">And</a>  that brings me to the question that I had that we talked about even during the process with the school committee and looking at commissions and boards that we feel that are that important that we have to look at it in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5824.381s">So,</a>  one question I brought up was everybody knows who the two of you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5832.196s">But</a>  I asked for a report to say, what is the attendance record for the other members on the commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5838.378s">Because</a>  I think that's important also, just for the fact that if two people are doing the job that realistically a commission of five or seven, we really need dedicated people that, hey, we heard so many people say this so many issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5853.484s">Well,</a>  then put up a shut up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5856.095s">And</a>  these are the opportunities that we have in our community that come and help the commission and be part of that commission and be part of the commission all in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5864.722s">It's</a>  a volunteer position, you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5866.343s">And</a>  for the most part, I've seen the commission, these two members of the commission, very active everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5875.931s">But</a>  for the most part, most other people don't know who the other commissioners are, unless it's election day or they have to be in a certain spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5886.294s">And</a>  I think that's a problem as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5888.615s">And</a>  I think that's something that I'll be bringing forward myself because I think that in the totality of commissions and boards that we have in our community, and who's responsible for putting them into place or what they <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5901.679s">their</a>  weight, their responsibilities of weight, whether it's financial or whether it's weight other ways, maybe, maybe it's, we look at our assessor and say, maybe there's a tax break for residents that have these backgrounds, that we can bring people that are qualified to really support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5918.524s">You</a>  know, it's no different than, you know, we have commissions right now that we have nothing in place right now that we have commissions and other boards that don't even live in the city anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5927.166s">And</a>  that's something I'll look forward to meeting with and try to change those. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5930.487s">But</a>  I think that's another concern that I have that in totality, this isn't, this is something that we need more, more effort and more support to in every level. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5945.53s">So</a>  I wanted to share that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5947.531s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5950.387s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Stroud. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5951.288s">Was</a>  that a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5953.069s">Was</a>  there a motion in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5955.071s">You</a>  had the previous one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5955.812s">Was</a>  there a further motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5957.313s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5959.295s">Attendance?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5959.695s">In</a>  committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5961.597s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5995.745s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5996.225s">And</a>  I think if we look at the governance committee, this is on there already as well for the next several months for us to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6006.272s">I</a>  have some questions, but I will wait since we've heard from everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6009.334s">I</a>  will go to you guys since my colleagues have had a chance to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6012.096s">If</a>  you have anything you'd like to say this time or any questions you'd like to answer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6019.534s">Yeah,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6020.214s">My</a>  name is Henry Mullen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6021.515s">I'm</a>  a member of the Election Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6024.617s">That</a>  will be room 102 here in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6027.738s">I</a>  live in 8 Temple Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6030.319s">One</a>  of the key thing you look, the report you receive was strictly done by election manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6035.842s">That</a>  was something we designed to be done right after the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6040.124s">Am</a>  I happy to be standing in front of you today talking about election? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6043.606s">Hell</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6044.667s">Most</a>  of you knows it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6046.327s">Yes,</a>  the council asked for <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6050.054s">and</a>  a voice message for attendance, we have that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6054.638s">What</a>  I put together is something totally different based on what I'm observing, it's what I can offer with the department to say, we need to get our process better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6065.906s">But</a>  the night of the election, what took place wasn't there, no one saw it coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6072.391s">Suddenly</a>  you have five precinct, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6076.496s">that</a>  zero back in, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6079.237s">Let</a>  me explain it so people understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6082.037s">Once</a>  you shut the tabulator down, until the memory cards are removed, don't touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6090.079s">Any</a>  attempt will be to zero back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6093.28s">That's</a>  the reason we lost it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6094.46s">But</a>  I do thank you, Councilor Zak, at the time who reached out to me, at the time was Vice President, now President, who reached out to me as a gentleman, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6105.883s">what</a>  you observe and we share it, you know, politely, we work it out, and we end up, whether it takes long, when I hear people say, you gotta have it by 830, by 930, there's no specific time for an official result. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6121.593s">It</a>  will be fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6122.353s">That</a>  night, I was standing right here, I was so happy it was gonna be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6126.356s">But</a>  I'm gonna share something with you where I said, that's mostly <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6134.309s">I</a>  said it before, not here, but in many other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6139.054s">Irregularities</a>  in election, they will be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6143.779s">It</a>  doesn't matter how much you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6145.241s">Somebody</a>  is going to do a dumb mistake, it's going to cause a lot of problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6149.245s">Because</a>  anytime you have human interaction, they're subject to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6153.71s">But</a>  what I did, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6155.211s">That</a>  night, I said, we need to identify and investigate irregularities that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6162.993s">We</a>  put together the evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6165.114s">We</a>  tried to do everything we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6166.855s">One</a>  of the things we haven't done for the first time in Medford, we did it, but we didn't really exceed on it because we had other things that prevented. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6175.137s">We</a>  put together a survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6177.318s">because</a>  the people you want, people stalking from the side and say, this didn't go wrong, this didn't go right, this was supposed to be, the people who's gonna tell us what's right, what's wrong, are the people who work the polls. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6189.901s">I</a>  used to be a poll worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6191.641s">I</a>  worked every, from inspector to clerk, from clerk to warden, I end up being here, but it's not by choice, but by love. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6201.641s">We</a>  put that, if we put that survey together, that will allow us to find out from our poll workers, okay, to find out what didn't work for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6211.469s">Then</a>  we can come back to the manager and say, this is where we need to adjust. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6216.253s">We</a>  didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6217.314s">Why</a>  didn't we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6218.715s">Because</a>  immediately after that, we were challenged by a recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6223.138s">The</a>  recount took away everything we wanted to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6227.061s">And</a>  we're still trying to do, because if you look at it right now, excluding today, we 41 days left until the next election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6234.964s">And</a>  I'm not saying, I'm talking about on the day of election, I'm not including early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6240.866s">I'm</a>  not including the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6242.747s">We</a>  have a lot of work that we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6246.388s">We</a>  need just like one thing I heard today, it's established. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6251.894s">an</a>  independent investigation, a group of people who can really work together, not a group of people who's going and solve together. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6258.379s">Because</a>  then I tell you, I've been living here for 55 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6263.447s">maybe</a>  not all of you knows me, most of you knows me, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6267.189s">That</a>  name means something in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6269.691s">If</a>  it doesn't mean in Medford, it means something in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6272.353s">First</a>  time in my life, I'm receiving threatened call, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6276.375s">First</a>  time, I said that to you, you know, try to say it, not as a Councilor, but as a friend, I said, this is what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6283.7s">At</a>  one point, for me to go to my wife, I said, I gotta return a lawyer, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6289.423s">That's</a>  unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6290.664s">Not</a>  in the city of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6292.304s">But</a>  like I told people, I'm already a dead man. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6294.485s">You</a>  think I care? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6295.346s">I</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6295.946s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6296.406s">Because</a>  I'm closer to dying than living. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6298.848s">So,</a>  that doesn't scare me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6300.388s">I'm</a>  going to continue to display what I say in twenty twenty. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6304.69s">My</a>  love for the city of Method is what guide me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6307.712s">Not</a>  my hate. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6309.232s">We</a>  say we review voter registration and eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6313.815s">When</a>  somebody is calling me and <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6319.44s">a</a>  ballot by mail and I didn't apply and then when I come to City Council uh office, election office and said, hey, uh Josh told me, okay, they didn't apply for vote by mail and they receive it and then they pull out the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6336.005s">That's</a>  a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6337.066s">That's</a>  an insult, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6338.706s">Because</a>  your application is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6341.067s">So,</a>  that means you submitted that application. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6343.628s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6349.218s">process</a>  need to be changed and irregularity need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6354.32s">What</a>  really messed me up is the the you saw how we did the recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6359.421s">The</a>  recount was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6360.461s">You</a>  were really involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6361.662s">We</a>  we we we did an excellent job that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6364.803s">That</a>  day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6365.683s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6366.523s">But</a>  the thing is that what we need at that didn't change the process too long and I guarantee I I was on the phone <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6377.264s">The</a>  result on the night of election was at one o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6380.687s">I</a>  have it stamped here, 12.01. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6384.71s">You</a>  and I are standing with a group of other candidates standing in the hallway, okay, and we're going over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6391.476s">I</a>  have it here to prove. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6393.058s">So</a>  these are the things I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6394.899s">Here</a>  on this side of the rail, you guys elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6400.504s">You</a>  are elected, you're representing me, every single one of you, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6404.989s">Some</a>  of you used to be my friend, maybe I don't have it anymore, it's okay, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6409.694s">I</a>  wasn't made to make friends, I was made to serve the city of Method, which I'm doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6415.259s">The</a>  thing I'm trying to do, words are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6417.742s">There</a>  are things that are being said here on this side. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6421.385s">That's</a>  a brand new council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6422.426s">I'm</a>  not blaming you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6423.667s">You</a>  all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6425.188s">I</a>  interact with every single one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6428.471s">The</a>  thing is, the words are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6430.713s">But</a>  tonight, what I had in mind is not what I have to talk about because of what I heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6436.257s">If</a>  we can sit down together, we can work better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6439.02s">We</a>  can do better things, just like we did on election night. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6443.183s">Okay,</a>  two phone calls came to me and said, Henry, something is wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6448.188s">I</a>  said, I'm looking at it, something is wrong with it, but I don't know what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6452.032s">Now,</a>  I'm pressuring the guy who did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6453.974s">At</a>  one point, I sat and requested SLOG, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6459.36s">Now,</a>  most of you probably don't know what everything has a backlog, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6464.124s">So</a>  I requested <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6466.317s">from</a>  the expert, I will call him the expert, okay, who was helping us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6472.121s">I</a>  said, something is wrong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6473.943s">Those</a>  numbers doesn't match to me, but I don't know what's wrong with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6478.146s">So</a>  we challenge him in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6481.408s">brought</a>  down, think about, you know, getting the owner of the company to come here, all dressed up, whatever he was partying to, we broke that, we say, you gotta come here, he came here and did it for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6493.953s">But</a>  now we have a better process, but perhaps the process we put in place, when we sit in that meeting, you're talking about, we can share with you as a group, then you realize, you say, well, they're proactive, they're not really reactive, they're proactive, something to, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6509.56s">went</a>  wrong, and this is what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6511.341s">By</a>  the time we get it, we should have the, when I heard people said the in-house early voting should be posted by certain times. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6521.364s">That's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6522.545s">Early</a>  voting is incorporated into the tabulation to come up with the unofficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6528.187s">That's</a>  how it works.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6530.447s">If</a>  I can, to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6531.828s">Miller.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6533.468s">I</a>  will provide, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6535.356s">the</a>  commissioner with the letter that was sent to the candidate that that morning, what there was said that the votes will be tallied here and posted at eight o'clock.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6545.483s">I</a>  will get that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6546.303s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6546.964s">I</a>  appreciate that, which is okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6548.885s">So</a>  that may be, but the thing we're trying to do, enhancing transparency and monitoring the process is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6557.791s">In</a>  order for us to do something, we need everybody together to work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6561.694s">And</a>  I will appreciate that will be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6563.216s">But</a>  see, the point I'm trying to get here, it says, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6568.487s">We</a>  need to establish a better control. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6571.468s">For</a>  instance, we're looking, we talk about poll observer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6574.409s">I</a>  heard that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6575.609s">There's</a>  a law, and I said it too many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6578.63s">I</a>  work almost, I mean, we have 18%. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6581.611s">I</a>  think this cycle of election, I did maybe five, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6585.612s">Not</a>  like I did 16 the last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6588.473s">But</a>  the thing is, I told the warden, listen, the people that are observers, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6593.655s">They're</a>  Medford people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6595.115s">They're</a>  friends of Medford people. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6597.016s">You</a>  are the official, you can treat them better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6600.116s">Because</a>  I give them example, I say, as the law said, you're a police officer, it says 25, because I catch you doing 35 doesn't mean I gotta give you a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6609.138s">The</a>  law say I give you a ticket, but the law say I can say, hey, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6613.099s">Slow</a>  down, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6614.219s">Go.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6614.859s">So</a>  it's the same thing we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6617.44s">You</a>  have something you brought here, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6619.8s">the</a>  council which was really reasonable, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6623.761s">What</a>  do you do before election? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6626.321s">I</a>  think we talked about that either yesterday or today and we've been talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6630.322s">You</a>  go to the site just like you saw us doing here on recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6634.443s">We</a>  marked everywhere you're going to be sitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6637.543s">This</a>  is where the candidate can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6639.663s">This</a>  is where 150 feet where your sign can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6643.264s">This</a>  is where the observer don't be sitting but <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6649.605s">Training</a>  is, we know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6652.706s">We</a>  haven't have the time to conduct training. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6656.046s">Already,</a>  between that report, there's a place, I believe, it's in your report, that says we don't have to try to train clerk and warden twice prior to an election, inspectors at least once or twice prior an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6670.209s">Because</a>  we're dealing with people my age. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6672.629s">If</a>  you do something with them three months prior to the event, they forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6677.95s">If</a>  you do it a week, two weeks prior to the event, then remember, not everybody is sharp like Henry is, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6684.439s">But</a>  that's the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6685.7s">The</a>  law is complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6687.242s">So</a>  with that, I will lay it over and wait for the invitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6691.128s">We</a>  can sit down and have a conversation because what took place <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6695.396s">on</a>  November 2023 is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6699.979s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6700.64s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6701.14s">Because</a>  we need to work with the police to tell them, hey, if I need you, I need to call you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6706.604s">We</a>  need to establish a better communication with the warden. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6710.847s">Call</a>  the warden if I need, I need to get you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6713.629s">But</a>  this is the thing that we're missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6715.71s">If</a>  you're calling someone and tell them what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6718.732s">Can</a>  you imagine somebody <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6722.935s">We're</a>  going to sue you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6724.236s">We're</a>  going to sue the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6726.397s">You</a>  know, for election, that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6728.699s">So</a>  I need to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6730.64s">We</a>  need to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6731.941s">Until</a>  we start doing that, we're still going to get the same mess, regardless. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6735.703s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6736.284s">We</a>  have to change the process to produce different results. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6740.226s">And</a>  I will rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6741.487s">I</a>  don't want to question a little bit more of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6743.828s">I</a>  look forward to whatever you guys have.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6746.31s">Thank</a>  you, Henry. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6747.211s">And</a>  Chairman Loren, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6748.892s">Thank</a>  you, Manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6749.672s">Thank</a>  you, Member DiBenedetto, for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6753.117s">You</a>  have one more thing?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6754.357s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6755.098s">The</a>  most important thing I have to say, right, is the fact tonight we were supposed to come here and present you with the election calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6764.861s">Election</a>  calendar for 2024 has to be shared with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6770.943s">We</a>  sent it to law. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6773.626s">because</a>  we were directed by the state to send to our law department to review to make sure we're in compliance, which we all normally do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6781.071s">So</a>  if we had to keep it, what we're gonna do, once we get the go, the green light will probably electronically get it to you guys, yeah, that whatever mean to the clerk office, and then post it on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6794.88s">But</a>  the most important thing that we're facing right now, less than two days ago, we get the confirmation <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6802.939s">One</a>  of our polling location, which is walking court, will not be eligible in this cycle of election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6813.005s">So</a>  we need to relocate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6815.887s">We're</a>  talking about something like 2,600 voters that we have prior to March 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6825.069s">even</a>  before March 5th, because we don't have early voting, to tell them, okay, where to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6832.215s">And</a>  we haven't, we're gonna relocate them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6836.098s">That's</a>  the only place in Medford we can relocate that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6840.081s">We</a>  cannot go to Tufts, because Tufts doesn't anymore give us the room that we will normally need, and that a different polling location. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6850.97s">We</a>  cannot send them to American Legion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6854.433s">We're</a>  facing parking issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6860.05s">Uh,</a>  the only place is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6861.811s">So,</a>  we working with, we look at the, what's the church name, Wellesley? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6866.453s">We</a>  look at Wellesley Church, because the ramp at Wellesley Church, on Winthrop corner of uh, what's the name?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6872.997s">Dearborn.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6873.557s">Dearborn,</a>  corner of Dearborn. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6875.398s">See,</a>  she knows that, that, that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6877.579s">So,</a>  there has a ramp there, I believe the ramp was built by the city, but I checked the ramp, it's no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6886.004s">It's</a>  not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6886.424s">We</a>  will have to do that all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6889.007s">It</a>  will be a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6890.088s">So</a>  I see no other alternative to bring it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6892.771s">And</a>  we wanted to share that with you guys, because if we had to wait as of tomorrow's 41 days, we will have to wait until February 6th, which is your next meeting to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6903.401s">That</a>  would be too long.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6905.183s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6906.544s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6907.665s">I</a>  will come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6908.857s">to</a>  my comments about the report, just specifically on the call to election and the approval of polling places, if you could share. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6915.519s">My</a>  understanding is that we do have to approve those as the council pursuant to state law, even with the transition from the registrar system to the elections commission system. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6923.341s">If</a>  that is not true, if you could send me the KP law opinion that says that, just so we have that on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6930.143s">One</a>  quick question on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6931.566s">Did</a>  you ask about around Breed Memorial Hall at the corner of Winthrop and Boston Avenue as a possibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6938.241s">It's</a>  a tough stone building.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6940.27s">That's</a>  how it took. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6941.651s">Because</a>  the first place we looked was the old library. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6944.775s">You</a>  know where we had the library temporarily on 200 Boston Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6948.238s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6948.618s">That</a>  was the first place where Elizabeth Grady. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6951.601s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6952.162s">We</a>  look at that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6953.303s">It's</a>  all gonna, that whole section is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6956.606s">I</a>  even went to look at the corner of North Street and Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6960.63s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6960.75s">You</a>  see that place where they had the chair repair and all these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6964.554s">I</a>  tried to get, we've been working for years to see if we can even find the owner and see if we can rent that place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6970.796s">We</a>  couldn't get it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6971.616s">And</a>  Tufts wouldn't make the Breed Hall available? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6976.137s">Not</a>  enough parking.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6977.878s">Tufts</a>  is another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6979.478s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6980.379s">We</a>  attempted, we reached out to Rocco. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6983.82s">The</a>  place we would have had would have been Gauntlet, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6986.44s">Which</a>  is underneath. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6988.241s">You</a>  want to talk about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6991.182s">Come</a>  on, you can't.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6994.632s">Hi,</a>  Aaron Benedetto 21 Dearborn Street, so I know they are very well that's my word. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7001.74s">Really</a>  City Hall is our best location based on availability of parking ADA compliance <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7009.369s">and</a>  just generally available for all people to come and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7014.83s">I</a>  know it's a little further than some of the other places you have, but we have vetted those places and they are not as accommodating as we need either for the reasons I stated before.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7026.133s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7026.573s">Yeah,</a>  totally. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7027.573s">And</a>  the only reason I ask this question is the first time we've been before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7030.474s">So,</a>  you know, just want to make sure we get, and I think we all agree in a timely manner, and you mentioned the time clock on this one, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7038.47s">calls</a>  to election or notification, whatever the legal opinion is that what this council's action needs to be, of course, we will do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7045.352s">But</a>  we do want to get it in a way where we can ask the questions and just ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7049.292s">I</a>  know you guys work hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7050.373s">I'm</a>  sure you've vetted it all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7052.373s">And</a>  my guess is we'll be able to go back to Walkley when the construction is complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7055.934s">Which</a>  may take years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7057.674s">In</a>  a couple of years, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7059.474s">Until</a>  further notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7060.895s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7063.749s">All</a>  right, back to some of the report, and I hear there's the motion to continue having detailed discussions to really get into the nitty gritty of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7072.374s">I</a>  will say, I think the point of Councilor Callaghan of saying, you know, it's one thing to have the after action report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7079.518s">It</a>  sounds like this was something you were going to do no matter what that was the plan for the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7084.18s">I</a>  think we requested something a little bit on top of that, which is kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7087.922s">a</a>  call and response, you know, if there was something that was identified as an issue, name what the issue was, you know, kind of what your office, how you interpreted the issue, what your definition of it was, and then what your response was. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7100.749s">And</a>  I think that would have helped new councillors, an average resident who may not have all the context, to better understand, okay, this event happened, here's what we're doing now to make sure this event doesn't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7112.616s">And</a>  so that's just what I want to put out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7115.805s">And</a>  I appreciate in the communications privately and tonight that we've had open and honest and direct. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7123.71s">This</a>  is how we're feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7125.272s">Henry,</a>  very clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7126.833s">I</a>  don't think this is about friends and not friends anymore or anything personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7131.536s">We</a>  are all friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7132.376s">I</a>  think we're all friends of elections in different ways as well, having participated in them, all of us, in many different ways, including this last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7142.063s">So,</a>  but I think that spirit of radical candor is the most, maybe in your office, is the most, needs to be the most radically honest of any office, because it is the office that allows them from which flows all of the rest of us to do the work that we do and the legitimacy of our city government, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7162.019s">And</a>  it's when these, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7166.846s">minor</a>  mistakes or irregularities or issues or things that we want to say, when you have a couple of them build up, then you have people calling and threatening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7177.111s">And</a>  I'm sure you've experienced that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7178.892s">And</a>  then you have people calling illegitimacy on the whole process and calling for recounts when recounts may not be necessary given the margins and the races, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7188.557s">So</a>  it's being so open as to say, even though it is probably counter to every instinct that we may have, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7196.601s">We</a>  made a mistake being so open, like not just we made a mistake, but we made this mistake at 7.41 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7202.706s">and</a>  13 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7203.766s">And</a>  here were the three people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7205.768s">And</a>  then here's the process that we're putting in, because if we have that radical candor, if we have that deep transparency, it undermines bad faith arguments. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7215.995s">that</a>  are made in that longer run. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7218.256s">And</a>  I think we all agree on that, but I just think that's why we're taking it so seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7221.977s">And</a>  I think the other piece of taking it so seriously is we moved to this new system recently, and it's different than it was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7228.419s">So</a>  there are three things, kind of three things in the report I just want to lift up, and it sounds like we'll have further discussions on it, but the first one is the staffing and resources question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7237.601s">And</a>  I read here, you know, one big challenge was not having enough regular staff members to assist with the amount of work when prepping for the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7243.933s">The</a>  Election Commission is working to address this by hiring additional pre-election team members and working with HR to hire the open part-time election staff position. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7251.079s">I</a>  think that is, you know, that's an answer to the question of staffing and resources, but I also think it's an answer that we have heard before. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7258.565s">And</a>  I understand that your office doesn't set the budget or make appropriations, but I think, you know, we've had this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7265.39s">We</a>  had this discussion November 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7267.031s">We've</a>  had this discussion in private. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7269.312s">there</a>  used to be several more full time staff working on elections in the city than there are now is the replacement of those staff members with temporary, you know, pre election team members. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7280.177s">Is</a>  that sufficient? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7281.397s">Is</a>  this part time position which because of its structure has gone unfilled for a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7285.96s">Is</a>  that sufficient? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7287.28s">I</a>  think this council would say <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7289.201s">This</a>  answer is we can't have the same answer to the question when this was the answer last time and it didn't produce the results intended. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7296.446s">So</a>  how can we sit down as well with you guys and with the mayor's team to say, OK, how can we build something where there's a full time position where we can get it filled? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7305.772s">Or</a>  and maybe it's not a full time that it's always in the elections office. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7310.135s">I</a>  know for a fact that there are offices around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7313.317s">building</a>  who would appreciate a little bit of extra support at different times of the year, and maybe half of the year that's in your office, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7319.219s">So</a>  kind of trying to think through those unique solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7322.0s">So</a>  I'm hoping that's somewhere we can go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7326.081s">The</a>  second piece for me, I know I discuss this often, was the training. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7331.823s">And</a>  Henry mentioned it, you mentioned in the report, there's need for more training, there's need to update the training. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7338.245s">Pursuant</a>  to our issue, you know, the issue that we raised on election day around the <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7343.347s">checklists</a>  being brought into the polls. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7344.949s">I</a>  see that is addressed here in here, so I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7348.452s">I</a>  think maybe one other thing to put in the training is just make sure that all of the election workers are reading the Voter Bill of Rights that the Secretary of State's office puts out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7357.621s">I</a>  think that's a valuable piece of something that has already been created separately that can answer some of those training questions, but I think it <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7365.729s">To</a>  me, it's like, hey, look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7367.771s">This</a>  is a list of what voters are allowed to do and not do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7370.653s">It</a>  protects them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7371.493s">It</a>  protects you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7372.794s">And</a>  that's just a level of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7376.337s">The</a>  third thing for me is back to the tabulation of unofficial results. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7382.021s">And</a>  I really think this is part of that radical candor is setting fair expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7391.704s">both</a>  for you and for everyone else in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7394.387s">If</a>  a letter went out that said these things will be posted by 8.30, that's now an expectation that's been set. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7401.393s">And</a>  if that expectation goes unfulfilled, then people are going to say that expectation went unfulfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7406.858s">So</a>  I think being really clear, and I see in here, we're going to add this cross-check process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7413.445s">I</a>  have a question about that in a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7415.366s">We</a>  are, you know, we're going to post the tabulator tapes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7418.847s">I</a>  have a quick question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7420.368s">I</a>  mean, it seems like there's more going into this than that has happened in November 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7425.77s">There</a>  was also the partial release in November 22 that was corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7429.171s">So</a>  it's it is a persistent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7432.212s">But</a>  I think the communications from the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7434.853s">maybe</a>  pulling back on over promising. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7437.335s">I</a>  don't, sometimes I have the problem of sitting in this chair and over promising is something that I would just suggest and put out there because I think that's where, you know, it adds another ticker, another check on that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7452.188s">And</a>  now if we have one issue with the ballot and an issue with the observer and an issue with the voter checklist, and then you have an issue with the <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7459.114s">expectation</a>  being set that results should be available at a certain time, then you can have people who are not acting in good faith take that list of things and turn it into a whole hullabaloo, which is what we experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7471.287s">I</a>  have two specific questions and then one further thing I want to get into. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7477.645s">In</a>  terms of the central tabulation facility, we'll post the tabulator tapes in the same method as the individual precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7484.57s">Does</a>  that mean that there would be 16 tapes at central tab, or one tape would be posted at central tab?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7491.355s">So</a>  central tabulation can print a 8.5 by 11 report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7496.118s">Everything</a>  is on the report, so it's one report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7498.5s">It</a>  wouldn't be separate tapes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7500.141s">OK,</a>  it would not be separate tapes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7501.362s">And</a>  I just think, you know, same method as the individual precincts, I might be expecting <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7506.317s">a</a>  thin ticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7507.358s">It's</a>  just those kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7508.619s">I</a>  just want to be setting that expectation, clearly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7511.241s">But</a>  simple tabulation will provide you with a number of votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7515.085s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7515.745s">Number</a>  of votes, like in conversation you and I had, that's what we look at early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7522.911s">We</a>  had <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7525.691s">put</a>  by mail, and we have two different entry forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7529.815s">So,</a>  when you take that, you add them, but the part that is missing, and I want people to really understand that, and it's a learning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7539.826s">We</a>  have the tips that are printed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7543.083s">They</a>  have numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7544.544s">That's</a>  what your observer look and call your campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7548.886s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7549.366s">That's</a>  what they used to report. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7551.347s">That</a>  came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7552.888s">One</a>  come with the counters, one down with the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7559.191s">Now,</a>  the part that really aggravate me and we miss that is when you take the memory card, you read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7567.711s">Let's</a>  say we do 100 quotes for the first read, for read number one, whatever is the precept. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7575.475s">When</a>  you read card number two, if the number was 100, and when you read card number two, the number is still 100, guess what happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7585.1s">You</a>  read nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7587.383s">You</a>  see the scenario? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7588.844s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7589.064s">So</a>  because that was zero, so when we read the last five, and they have nothing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7595.867s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7596.288s">Now,</a>  it was smart that night for one of the, being that time we were talking, everybody was talking, I add your number minus seven, what seven one you didn't add. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7609.535s">When</a>  I pressured the gentleman, he had an issue, then one of our commissioners said, we got the tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7616.508s">It's</a>  at the tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7619.349s">At</a>  the tip, then we come up with the 13,300 something instead of 10,400 something. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7625.63s">But</a>  while he was doing that, instead of people to appreciate it, and I think it could have been the wrong place to do it right here in face of everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7633.471s">Because</a>  whatever you do, you're cheating, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7636.692s">But</a>  he or she was investigating to find out what missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7642.173s">Immediately</a>  you take the total number from the tip, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7647.045s">and</a>  reduce the total number of the unofficial account, the first unofficial account that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7653.353s">We're</a>  missing a lot of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7655.145s">close</a>  to 3,000 foot, yeah, that's what you have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7658.107s">So</a>  that part, we know how to fix that going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7661.93s">And</a>  when we sit with you and say, this is what, and I had nothing to do with it, I will give her all the credit for putting it together and explain it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7671.836s">Just</a>  today, we're talking about acid, there's only one part missing, okay, that we need to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7677.38s">So</a>  that way, when you get it, you're not getting from one source only, you get it from everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7682.443s">So</a>  at the end, it's like balancing a check. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7685.225s">I</a>  think that's what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7686.486s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7687.386s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7688.427s">So</a>  let me clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7689.988s">The</a>  central tabulation is a high-speed scanner, just like the tabulators. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7695.091s">It's</a>  one scanner. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7696.391s">So</a>  it's all the wards and precincts, but it's one scanner. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7699.753s">So</a>  the report comes out as one report, whereas the individual tabulators, it's the individual wards and precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7707.578s">So</a>  I hope that clarifies a little bit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7709.719s">So</a>  you would have essentially 16 <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7711.843s">Ticker</a>  strips. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7713.304s">18,</a>  sorry, because we have the two A's now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7716.985s">And</a>  then you would have one from the central tabulate, and all of the precincts would be combined on that one?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7722.648s">You</a>  can see them individually.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7723.749s">You</a>  can see them individually, but if you want a sheet of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7725.87s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7726.23s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7726.55s">And</a>  I think that's the kind of thing, you know, just setting that expectation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7728.471s">This</a>  is what you should be seeing when it's all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7733.513s">The</a>  other piece that it sounds like, and this was going to be kind of my suggestion, it sounds like maybe you've already gone down this road, and I understand that you've been talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7739.335s">is</a>  that cross-check, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7741.176s">Like</a>  to me, if you have the memory cards and you have the tapes, you know, and maybe it's not as easy for the central tab piece of this, and maybe that's where some of this issue is coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7754.887s">But</a>  you could essentially have a spreadsheet pre-made that is getting populated by whatever's coming out of the memory cards, VRIS or whatever that system is, or the LHS system. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7765.734s">And</a>  then you could take the tapes and manually enter those into a spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7769.856s">And</a>  then you'd have two independent sets of two sheets with two sets of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7775.099s">Do</a>  the tapes match what came out of the machine? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7778.996s">if</a>  the answer's, is that the cross-check kind of we're talking about?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7781.476s">You</a>  need to know the joke, I think you get that one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7785.437s">So</a>  the idea is the tally tapes and the memory cards come back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7790.978s">The</a>  planner brings them back to us before the end of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7793.739s">When</a>  they come in, we check them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7796.439s">We</a>  have the memory cards, we have the tally sheets, two people initial it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7800.82s">Then</a>  when we run the results, we do the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7803.981s">Tally</a>  sheets, memory cards, results. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7807.588s">we</a>  initial it to make sure they're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7809.429s">If</a>  they're not correct, we have to go back and look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7812.692s">And</a>  I think part of what happens is we want to give the results as much as everybody wants to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7818.877s">And</a>  I think we need to set different expectations, as you've discussed, to really say, OK, so we don't want to give you wrong information and have people be upset and concerned about the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7831.106s">So</a>  we have to take back that time and just say, OK, this is how we're going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7835.549s">We're</a>  going to slow it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7837.128s">We'll</a>  have a waiting room for people to wait for the results and we'll work as a team to make sure we cross check before we release anything.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7845.537s">Heard.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7845.997s">Thank</a>  you and I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7848.256s">You</a>  saw that, that's a cross-reference we had here on December 9th.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7851.978s">Right,</a>  and that was really valuable to have.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7853.738s">That's</a>  exactly how we did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7855.839s">For</a>  those who were present, that's what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7858.8s">You</a>  call the number, and somebody double-check and see exactly what was the number, and call that number on another piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7866.063s">So</a>  that means there's three steps to verify, make good verification that the number call was the actual number.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7873.766s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7874.407s">And</a>  then I think, you know, so that makes sense in terms of getting them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7878.055s">I</a>  think just in terms of the other piece of it, which is making sure machines aren't zeroed out early and making sure machines are zeroed out before the day starts, because that seems to have been how we got to the point of the recount and the disparities and discrepancies between some precincts were undercount, some precincts were overcount. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7900.066s">You</a>  know, in some sense, I'm glad we did the recount because I got a hundred more votes, but you know, it's, it's, it should never, never, ever, you know, that, that, that is the other piece of this question that really, I think we need to flesh out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7912.876s">And</a>  I think there's some in here procedurally making sure that that doesn't happen, but that's where that other piece of error can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7919.42s">And</a>  then, and then, you know, that's that little tally list where people can then take that and use it for, for other, say other things about it or <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7928.527s">be</a>  honest and say, I'm concerned there's six things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7931.11s">I'd</a>  like to see the recount because it, you know, it didn't change who was elected, but it changed the results of the election in a significant way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7938.799s">100</a>  votes is not insignificant. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7941.081s">Yes,</a>  Manager Ripley, I have one last thing when you're done.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7943.324s">Okay,</a>  so I do want to say that we were in the process of auditing the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7949.11s">We</a>  would have seen the <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7950.481s">the</a>  blanks in the sheet much faster, but because we had the recount petition, we had to put on hold going through and auditing the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7960.707s">So,</a>  because we had to jump into the hoops after the 10, you know, we had to wait 10 days to get the, sorry, the recount petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7972.835s">We</a>  had to wait the 10 days, and then we had to work with legal counsel in order to make sure that we were following all the protocols for the recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7979.975s">So</a>  we would have been able to give you more detailed and more accurate data with regards to the blanks if we'd had more bandwidth and more time and not the recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7991.644s">So</a>  my apologies that we weren't able to do that cross-check, but that is the reason why we weren't able to do the cross-check.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7999.489s">Got</a>  it, and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8001.091s">And</a>  I appreciate the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8002.412s">I</a>  don't want to end on a little bit of a down note, but I think it really, and to me it's not so much <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8010.29s">I</a>  really hope that the mayor and the chief of staff are listening here when we talk about the need for additional staffing and resources for the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8019.673s">came</a>  to my attention this evening, people noticed we were talking about the election, that a communication went out, I'm not sure if it was with the census or not, that says offices that are on the November 2024 ballot and offices that aren't on the November 2024 ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8034.967s">And</a>  it says offices items not on the November 2024 ballot, state senator and state representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8040.852s">And</a>  those are on the November 2024 ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8043.753s">And</a>  it also has the districts are swapped, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8046.975s">It</a>  has the Senate district as representative, the representative district as Senate district. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8051.837s">It's</a>  not the end of the world, but it's not the level of <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8059.227s">accurate</a>  information that we want to be putting out there at all times to the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8063.509s">And</a>  when we have four elections in a year, and then a recount on top of it, and then we're sorting through everything in the basement, and we have the new commission from the registrar, it's like, I understand the circumstances that get us to a place where an error like that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8080.119s">I</a>  understand where the circumstances get us to a place where some of the errors happened in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8084.281s">And</a>  I understand that there's a really good faith attempt here to really try to correct them. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8088.243s">But</a>  I don't think it's fair to put up on you guys to fix everything, to say you have what you have, fix everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8095.811s">And</a>  so that's my call. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8097.613s">I</a>  may be stepping a little bit outside the boundaries of the role of the chair tonight with this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8102.779s">Obviously,</a>  I'm passionate about it and I've looked into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8106.062s">But</a>  I really, really think we need to, as part of the sit down, hear more of the details about the checks and processes we're going to put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8113.928s">I</a>  hear that in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8115.509s">But</a>  the level of resources and staff support that is needed to effectively do the work of your office, and that we had prior to the transition from this model to this new model, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8126.697s">it</a>  isn't in place, and there's things that slip. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8129.139s">And</a>  now the checklist for this election, we're not at six, but now we're at one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8134.043s">And</a>  that's just where, again, I don't, I think that to get the same answer back, and I understand that you can't appropriate new funds, but to get the same answer back, we're gonna try to hire for this position we haven't been able to hire for for a year, and we're gonna try to get more people onto the pre-election team. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8151.263s">I</a>  don't think that's a sufficient answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8153.305s">So</a>  I appreciate you hearing me say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8155.407s">I</a>  know maybe agree or disagree or can't agree or can't disagree the powers that be hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8163.636s">And</a>  I hope that at least in private, they can hear it from everyone involved.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8168.541s">We</a>  are advocating for <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8171.775s">to</a>  fill that part-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8173.316s">And</a>  the HR department is working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8175.418s">As</a>  we speak, there are five candidates to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8179.501s">So</a>  they are working on it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8181.162s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8181.822s">That's</a>  good to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8183.824s">Any</a>  further comments from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8186.426s">And</a>  I appreciate your deference to me on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8189.208s">Councilor,</a>  Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8191.257s">Thank</a>  you, President Barris. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8192.017s">I</a>  want to again thank you for the level of depth in this conversation tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8195.399s">And,</a>  you know, I know that there's always an appetite for going deeper and working together to help us better understand the workings of your office and go over <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8206.26s">your</a>  goings-on, you know, talking about successes as well as the problems that, you know, I know that we have a shared goal of shoring up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8215.406s">And</a>  I'm glad to end this conversation or put a pin in it for now, you know, on the issue of resources and capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8222.99s">And</a>  I think in our ongoing conversations, I think that we'd all, you know, benefit from taking the time when it's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8230.355s">Certainly</a>  I can understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8232.196s">November</a>  didn't go the way that any of us thought that it would. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8235.258s">And</a>  of course, that has an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8236.498s">There's</a>  a limited number of hours in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8241.281s">To</a>  have those conversations about the specificity that we're looking for so we can have that transparency piece, the prescription, the what would fix it, and a prescription is not a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8251.546s">You</a>  know, the solution is we're going to get the prescription will be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8255.528s">And</a>  I know that that is a multi-agency effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8259.99s">So</a>  I'm hoping that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8263.268s">What</a>  was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8265.669s">I'm</a>  looking forward to that collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8268.05s">And</a>  thank you for your, thank you for your willingness.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8270.832s">And</a>  I appreciate all the candor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8272.733s">I</a>  really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8273.613s">This</a>  is not a, it's a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8275.735s">It's</a>  ever evolving and there's always new ways to look at things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8278.676s">So</a>  I do appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8279.997s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8281.197s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8283.479s">I</a>  just want to say thank you, because I think that this is uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8286.702s">I</a>  mean, I think we all mean, we all have the same intention. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8290.145s">I</a>  think everybody here loves Medford, and there was nothing done with any ill will or intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8298.073s">So</a>  I think that you coming here tonight is a huge step that starts that healing in this, in the fact of those people that I told you about that really affect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8308.601s">No</a>  one's hiding anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8309.822s">You're</a>  in front of us as a commission and the commissioner and say, hey, this is what we need to do in this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8316.905s">Look</a>  ourselves in the mirror, like my father taught us in his Jesuit schooling, that you always look <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8325.149s">at</a>  the person that you're looking at and put yourself in their shoes and say, what do you, how would you do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8331.713s">And</a>  make sure you understand the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8334.215s">So</a>  I think that that's why I'm stressing the subcommittees and sitting down and truly being part of it because, you know, even just to hear the fact that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8345.0s">while</a>  we're going through the process of recount, we still don't have enough staff to still even try to do something to assist them by moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8352.805s">So</a>  I really do appreciate you coming out tonight and giving us these answers.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8361.15s">We're</a>  always looking for people to help in the elections office.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8364.011s">You</a>  know what, I would like to bounce here, Justin Singh, for the presidential election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8370.376s">I</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8371.676s">No,</a>  not that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8372.997s">Oh,</a>  no, not that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8373.777s">Not</a>  the presidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8374.677s">No,</a>  that's not going to be contentious at all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8376.278s">Well,</a>  I hear they're having a blast in New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8378.379s">For</a>  reference, at the time, Counsel Zach, in his first term, he tried to work on the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8384.461s">He</a>  got thrown out.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8385.601s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8386.561s">I</a>  know, I did.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8387.122s">He</a>  wasn't the first person you threw out.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8388.922s">No,</a>  but, you know, it's like, oh, all hands on deck, and suddenly my hands are not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8394.104s">I</a>  think we get something. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8395.084s">Ah,</a>  the ultimate wisdom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8397.245s">None</a>  of you are on the ballot in March.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8399.406s">Well,</a>  I am from Ward Committee and I'm pretty sure that means I think that was the exact situation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8405.548s">It's</a>  like, oh, the very uncontested Ward Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8410.81s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8411.97s">Any</a>  further questions, comments from councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8417.412s">Anything</a>  you guys want to add or any comments from members of the public in the room or on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8421.594s">You</a>  can raise your hand if you're on Zoom or stand if you're here in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8429.77s">All</a>  right, seeing none, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8432.031s">On</a>  the motion to refer this report to the Governance Committee to meet with Commission and staff and discuss, check in on any needs and discuss how the Council can be supportive to make sure that these issues are addressed and that resources are provided to the Elections Commission, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8457.846s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8460.501s">All</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8462.121s">Motion</a>  passes, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8468.883s">Is</a>  there a motion to revert to the regular order of business? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8470.784s">All</a>  in favor of the motion of Councilor Tseng, to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8475.285s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8476.365s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8477.986s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8478.766s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8479.206s">Aye,</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8480.866s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="../resolutions/24-018.pdf"><font color="green">24-018</font></a>.

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8595.703s">to</a>  introduce this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8599.045s">Let</a>  me give some background about how I arrived at these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8602.687s">I</a>  reached out to, I looked at what former and current school committee members have said in their statements about their thoughts on the original proposal by former President Morell in December of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8618.677s">I</a>  also reached out to various teachers, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8621.538s">and</a>  school staff to see what people were willing to compromise to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8627.102s">And</a>  at the end of the day, I arrived at this, this proposal, which essentially increases over two years, the salary of school community members to approximately $22,100. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8642.272s">which</a>  is in line with the research I've done with Medford Teacher Association contracts over the last 25 years, going year by year, line by line, and matching their pay increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8655.941s">This</a>  proposal would essentially stop <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8658.522s">in</a>  2025 and so there would be no increase after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8663.266s">It</a>  also, in contrast to the original proposal, phases in this increase over two years instead of having it start immediately upon passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8673.494s">This</a>  is time, I believe, will give us a chance to finalize our financial picture and make sure it's in line with the information that we're hearing from finance staff currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8683.541s">It</a>  also gives us <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8685.723s">a</a>  chance to start paraprofessional negotiations throughout the process to make sure that we address that part of the criticism with the original proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8699.72s">I</a>  have to emphasize that this is a compromise that we arrived at after engaging stakeholders, and that I believe that this is a compromise built off some logical ground, which is that of the previous MTA contract increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8719.412s">I</a>  believe that this is a reasonable compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8722.454s">Not</a>  everyone will be happy with this, surely, and I'm sure that there are folks who would have liked this number to be higher, would have liked this number to be lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8733.058s">This</a>  compromise, I know, also doesn't live up to all of the ideals that we may hold both on this side of the rail and on the other side of the rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8742.563s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8744.861s">So</a>  goes compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8746.402s">This</a>  is the nature of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8748.203s">And</a>  we must be politically responsible actors here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8751.445s">We</a>  must also, instead of viewing this as a compromise that we can live with, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8757.682s">understand</a>  that this compromise can be a win-win if we take advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8761.564s">If</a>  stakeholders can take advantage of it, we can lift up by lifting up one set of workers for schools, all workers for schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8771.711s">And</a>  that's why I believe that we should pass this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8774.673s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8776.069s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8777.67s">Just</a>  before we continue, I do want to note that this has been reviewed for form and the motions are worded properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8786.838s">Pursuant</a>  to General Law, Chapter 71, Section 52, this requires a majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8796.09s">and</a>  is not an ordinance and will be, does not require three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8799.651s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8800.492s">Councilor</a>  Starkley, then Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8803.172s">Thank</a>  you, so just, I know that some information that, first I want to share, I think that one of the questions was the fees of the structure for the 2024 paraprofessional wage scale pursuant to Method Public Schools from their records of proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8820.778s">So</a>  it's given the, just for a point of information that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8825.74s">the</a>  kindergarten aids right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8829.464s">One</a>  of the questions was if there was one, one group that one paraprofessional group that was making less than what was going to be asked that this would be this would be a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8840.655s">I</a>  think that they paraprofessionals stand at $20,500 with their contract ending. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8849.224s">this</a>  year, so they'll be negotiating again as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8852.647s">So</a>  I, for one, I will applaud the effort by Councilor Tseng of finding common ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8862.094s">I</a>  think you've done your due diligence, I will tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8864.977s">I</a>  applaud that immensely for the fact that you listened and you tried to get to a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8874.104s">I</a>  will tell you I will not support it for the fact that I really think that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8878.948s">until</a>  we really know. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8879.848s">I</a>  think if this resolution and this compromise came after understanding what our budget looks like, even for a dollar, I think that I would support it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8889.191s">I</a>  will be honest with you with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8890.192s">I</a>  think that this is the sense of compromise that I wish that the teachers and paraprofessionals were there moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8896.774s">And</a>  I think that this gives, like you said, I think that this gives our <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8903.709s">school</a>  committee and administration the same, hopefully the same type of attitude and mentality when it comes to supporting and rewarding our teachers that need it the most and that's mostly our paraprofessionals that are getting the short end of the stick right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8917.881s">So</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8919.582s">Again,</a>  like I said, I want to applaud that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8922.384s">But</a>  at the same time, I think that not knowing our fiscal situation right now is the reason why I can't move forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8930.87s">So</a>  I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8932.591s">And</a>  like, again, I'll say it again, that's a very, very well thought compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8937.955s">And</a>  I'm sure that the teachers will feel that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8942.238s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8946.201s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8949.141s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8950.121s">It's</a>  been 24 years since a school committee has gotten a pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8953.343s">I</a>  believe that the school committee is overdue for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8956.645s">We</a>  need the school committee to be paid enough to ensure that enough people run so that elections are competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8962.908s">We</a>  need the pay to be enough to attract people who are less wealthy, people who cannot afford to spend up to 20 hours a week doing something that <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8971.332s">you</a>  know, doesn't pay or pays very little. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8974.116s">I</a>  see raising the school committee salary as a pro-democracy reform along with many other types of pro-democracy reforms that I will mention later. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8982.626s">Reforms</a>  that I have presented in communities across the country for seven years that are deeply important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8989.934s">As</a>  I said last time, pro-democracy means not just people who are willing or dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8995.118s">It</a>  means having people sitting in those seats who represent, for example, the lower 50% of wage earners in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9001.982s">These</a>  are not the people who usually run for or win elected office. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9006.986s">Pro-democracy</a>  reforms usually happen in the next cycle because it is not about paying the people currently sitting in those seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9014.41s">It</a>  is about getting diverse people to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9017.774s">Many</a>  cities and states have it in their laws that any change in salary for elected officials cannot go into effect within the same electoral cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9027.602s">I</a>  did not look hard for these, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9029.344s">So</a>  just in three minutes of Google searching, Illinois and Georgia both have state laws for all municipal elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9036.827s">stating</a>  that you cannot raise the pay within that electoral cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9041.71s">Even</a>  in Massachusetts, and again, no exhaustive search, Watertown and Everett both have city codes that say that any pay increase for school committees specifically must be voted on in the first 18 months of the cycle and cannot take effect until the next cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9060.103s">On</a>  the question of pay parity, I tried to find examples of pay parity between school committees and city councils discussed anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9068.993s">I</a>  found almost nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9071.236s">No</a>  well-known elected officials, no organizations that I've heard of or haven't heard of discussing this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9075.982s">It</a>  came up for a vote in Fall River. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9079.125s">a</a>  proposal to bring the school committee pay up to the city council pay, it did not pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9083.568s">In</a>  Worcester, there was one school committee member who wanted for the school committee to be paid the same as city council, but that is not allowed by the city charter, which in Worcester states that the salary for members of the school committee will be equal to 50% of the salary established for members of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9101.502s">So</a>  unless they change the city charter, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9103.427s">They</a>  cannot do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9105.129s">And</a>  I will say that across the country, school committees getting paid 50 percent of the city council is pretty standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9112.158s">That</a>  doesn't make it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9113.7s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9114.561s">But</a>  it is the norm. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9119.013s">I</a>  also tried to find anyone talking about this issue as one of parity between men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9124.414s">I</a>  could not find, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I could not find anyone talking about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9130.996s">I</a>  did look up some numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9132.136s">So</a>  according to the National School Boards Association, 51% of school board members are men, 49% are women. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9140.838s">We</a>  should note that this is a much higher percentage of women than in other elected bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9146.32s">28%</a>  of Congress is women, 33% of state legislatures are women, 32% of city councils are women. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9157.825s">Northampton,</a>  which is a pretty progressive city, commissioned a study on compensation for elected officials in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9163.108s">That's</a>  a little while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9165.769s">The</a>  end result was a recommendation that they pay their city councilors $17,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9169.111s">That</a>  was a raise for both city council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9172.052s">That</a>  they pay their school committee members $9,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9174.854s">They</a>  have less than half the people living in Northampton as we have in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9179.476s">It</a>  was 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9180.677s">I</a>  don't think that we should look at those specific numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9183.837s">But</a>  it is interesting to note that their commission did have a difference in pay between the city council and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9190.221s">I</a>  am not stating that this is right, that school committees across the country are paid approximately 50%, but there appears to be nobody except for us here and in Fall River, even discussing this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9212.605s">I</a>  believe without a doubt that a pay increase for the Medford School Committee is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9217.546s">I</a>  personally believe there are many reasons why it is appropriate that pay increases for any elected officials come take effect the next cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9228.989s">I</a>  would like to make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9230.309s">It's</a>  somewhat long. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9231.269s">I</a>  can email it to the clerk, the president, the vice president, or whoever is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9238.775s">If</a>  it is possible to vote on it tonight, that would be great, but if not, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9244.06s">My</a>  motion is to send the following pro-democracy reforms to study in the Governance Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9250.565s">Salaries</a>  for elected officials, public financing of elections, rank choice voting for single elected offices, allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote, and allowing non-citizen residents to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9264.165s">along</a>  with that, a request that the Governance Committee prioritize the salary discussion and come to a recommendation on this issue before December 31st of 2024, so that the City Council can vote on whether to implement those salaries starting January of 2026, which is the beginning of the next electoral cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9283.861s">Also</a>  a request that the Governance Committee consider the following factors in their salary recommendations, in addition to any others they deem important, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9293.018s">getting</a>  enough people to run so that elections are competitive, enabling less wealthy people to hold elected office, and gender pay parity.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9299.96s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9307.743s">Just</a>  to summarize, I think that was a motion to refer to the Governance Committee a number of democracy reforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9315.746s">If</a>  you have that in typed form, if you could send that to myself and to the clerk, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9323.243s">Is</a>  there a second on that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9327.164s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9328.264s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Lemingng. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9330.884s">And</a>  I will go now to Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9334.585s">And</a>  by the way, that motion is a B paper, which means it's a separate paper that will be referred out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9339.766s">It</a>  will get a new paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9341.566s">And</a>  we'll go to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9342.607s">Council</a>  Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9344.687s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9346.827s">Appreciate</a>  the discussion around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9350.999s">either</a>  the third or the fourth time that we've discussed this in these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9357.547s">And</a>  I, as we've said before, I appreciate the dialogue with my colleagues about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9362.853s">I</a>  appreciate the very many community members that we've heard from about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9370.37s">I</a>  withdrew my motion and I'll second Councilor Tseng's motion because I believe that this is the most actionable compromise that we have on the table right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9378.796s">My</a>  alternative proposal went even further. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9380.757s">It</a>  would have achieved pay parity between the school committee and the city council by 2027. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9384.019s">As</a>  I've said at the beginning of all of our conversations on this topic, I really believe that pay equity between the school committee and the city council is the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9394.826s">And</a>  I think that somebody has to be the <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9396.747s">First</a>  person to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9397.829s">I</a>  don't know if that'll be us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9399.933s">I</a>  think that we need to move the ball forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9403.57s">As</a>  a Councilor, I don't know what the, I don't know what a day in the life of a school committee member looks like, but I know a little bit about the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9411.197s">And</a>  I know that the role is different in every community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9414.44s">I</a>  know a little bit about what it means in our city from our charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9418.564s">And</a>  I believe that our roles are equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9420.185s">I</a>  believe that the role of the school committee is mission critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9423.168s">I</a>  believe that there's no space for passivity in that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9425.53s">And</a>  that's why I believe that our role should be paid equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9428.833s">Um,</a>  so this proposal advances compensation for school committee members at percentages that are aligned with MTA contract increases over the past 24 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9441.107s">In</a>  any case, I think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9444.379s">to</a>  the headlines of this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9445.52s">It's</a>  been 24 years since there's been a pay adjustment for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9452.527s">This</a>  is a one-time adjustment spread out over two years, and then it stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9457.892s">We've</a>  already referred to the governance committee, apart from the <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9462.937s">motion</a>  that will vote on from Councilor Callahan, the recommendation to study within the concept of our, sorry, within the review of our city charter, which we'll be doing later this year, a mechanism for triggering some sort of automatic or regular evaluation of all elected salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9478.585s">And</a>  I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9480.655s">not</a>  so that the salaries necessarily go up, but I think that part of the issue here has been, since there was not any sort of regular mechanism other than the city council deigning to consider an increase, we've gone 24 years without considering it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9495.665s">And</a>  that's why the initial proposal was for a triple-digit percentage increase, because we had so much time to make up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9504.096s">So</a>  with all that being said, I'm glad that we're going to have that conversation later this year so that we can continue having this conversation about how to align compensation with our goals and our values and how to promote the elected bodies that our community deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9521.611s">And</a>  I'm looking forward to voting on compensation increase, one that I believe is fair and reasonable and very certainly the product of compromise tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9530.619s">So</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9535.339s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9537.521s">Any</a>  other comments from members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9540.123s">All</a>  right, then I will give my comment just shortly, which is I think that it is a long overdue action, and while it does not address all of my concerns or meet all of my principles, sometimes that is what a compromise looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9559.897s">I</a>  also want to add <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9561.63s">We're</a>  voting on this, and then it's back to where we were, which is the Council may deign at any point to maybe consider at some point looking at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9569.578s">Yes,</a>  we have some motions to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9571.38s">Yes,</a>  we have some motions this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9573.161s">But</a>  that's what we're voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9574.723s">We're</a>  voting on a half measure to get some of the way towards a further goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9582.998s">It</a>  leaves it right in the hands of the council in 20 years to let this go for 20 years and never address it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9588.643s">And</a>  then we're there again, but that's where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9592.105s">So</a>  this will be put to rest other than the fact that we will have some discussions around the classification and compensation study, some discussions around the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9602.694s">Maybe</a>  there'll be some action that comes out of that, but this is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9606.797s">So</a>  there'll be, if this is approved, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9610.652s">raises</a>  this year in July 1 fiscal year 25 and fiscal year 26 to address 23 years of no change in compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9619.935s">Given</a>  no further comment from members of the council, we'll go to members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9624.457s">You</a>  can come to the podium and give your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9628.158s">You</a>  can also raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9629.638s">We</a>  will alternate between the podium and Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9632.499s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9634.3s">Hi,</a>  Patrick Clerken, 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9637.982s">A</a>  lot of great comments made here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9639.943s">I</a>  just wanted to add the comment that I felt like I think we've gotten significantly past this, but I think when this was first brought up by Nicole back in December, the initial argument for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9655.12s">was</a>  a little bit reductionistic in the sense of bringing pay parity between council and the committee, just because I understand historically the difference between men and women and that still exists to some extent, but because the committee and the council are both mixed at this point, it's a little bit comparing apples to oranges. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9677.807s">So</a>  I wanted to request if possible, just for public edification, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9683.909s">a</a>  simple diagram that compares basically what council does and what school committee does and how they should be potentially brought up to equity or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9699.72s">Is</a>  it based on the hours worked overall? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9702.382s">Is</a>  it based on the content of the work? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9704.864s">Because</a>  it's not necessarily the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9710.706s">I</a>  don't know for sure what, and I think probably a lot of people in Medford don't know for sure what each of these two bodies does, and so it would be difficult to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9724.11s">how</a>  they could be brought up to parity or if they should be brought up to parity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9727.573s">And</a>  I just want to add that just like when you're talking to people and you meet them for the first time and you hear their name and it goes in one ear and out the other, a lot of the times if we don't have these diagrams or simple ways to understand these things, when you just hear the information in a stream, it just goes right out the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9747.428s">So</a>  anything <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9749.71s">with</a>  this issue and with future issues, that's like a simple diagram or something that could be posted in a public place would really help. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9755.695s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9757.356s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9760.598s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9762.339s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9763.941s">My</a>  name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9770.385s">First</a>  of all, let me start by saying, what does this pay raise have to do with education? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9777.142s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9777.902s">Number</a>  two, there's no demanding from the public for any pay raise for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9783.785s">And</a>  lastly, there's no professional city population job description pay report that even substantiates or supports what the council has alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9794.829s">The</a>  gender issue that was alleged this past December is nothing more than a sexual red herring allegation of discrimination that has no merit to the issue before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9806.494s">The</a>  job is what the job is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9807.995s">The</a>  responsibility is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9809.456s">It</a>  doesn't say it has to be male or female. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9813.66s">That's</a>  the red herring to the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9815.541s">But</a>  if this proposal were to pass, should we now compare all our municipal positions with the same amount of financial equity and equality as compared to each position, especially with those having different responsibilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9829.052s">Fire,</a>  police, school teachers, they all have different job duties and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9834.841s">But</a>  if we're looking at something that's now saying the school committee should have equity pay to that of a city councilor, well, you're setting a standard here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9842.388s">And</a>  this standard should be compared to, right now, what is presently found in your municipal contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9849.275s">Additionally,</a>  if this proposal is to pass a comprehensive review, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9854.56s">should</a>  be undertaking to set a years of service pay scale to be compatible with all of the municipal employee negotiations, comparing newly elected newcomers to both the city council and the school committee at the beginning of the pay scale formula. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9869.046s">Therefore,</a>  for the new members in the council, as compared to the new members on the school committee, why should either one of you reap the benefit of the maximum pay <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9878.63s">when</a>  in fact all other municipal employees start at a base pay and they go through a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9885.112s">So</a>  if you're looking at this equity for both and all sides, then let the council and the school committee also be put in the same type of position. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9896.533s">Okay,</a>  as such by granting the city council additional type of raise without having increasing any educational value, without having any community support for it, and without any professional city population job description report only demonstrates the power of behind the scenes internal politics, where the power of the dollar personally overpowers the needs of our public school educational needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9924.972s">We</a>  have surrounding communities, and I took the six surrounding communities that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9928.674s">Arlington,</a>  they get paid $3,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9931.275s">Everett,</a>  they get paid $11,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9933.036s">Malden,</a>  they get paid $7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9934.917s">Somerville,</a>  they get paid $16,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9936.218s">And</a>  Methodist, they get paid $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9938.639s">Methodist</a>  is the second highest paid school committee of the surrounding areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9944.468s">You</a>  serve in these jobs for the quality of giving good education to the community, not for how much money or you should be paid equal to that or in excess of our total to the amount of what a city councilor makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9959.321s">Last</a>  December, the pay concerns for paraprofessionals, classroom assistants, custodians, substitute teachers, et cetera, were discussed, but they've yet to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9969.509s">This</a>  hall was full with almost 200 teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9972.938s">At</a>  the city council, the school committee pay raise increase without any proposal to differentiate the differences between the city council and school committee responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9982.09s">As</a>  the gentleman just stated, showing the need such raise or pay equality has yet to be proven. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9989.397s">Therefore,</a>  at last meeting on December 12, these were the issues that were of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9995.261s">A,</a>  needing additional instructional hours for students, AP classes, class size needs, athletic programming, student activities, school library resources, counseling services, school security, custodial school maintenance, after school programming, and something that's gonna creep up on you fellas, it's unprepared for migrant student educational <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10019.219s">studies</a>  and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10021.381s">Now,</a>  these are all dollar amounts that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10024.923s">And</a>  if you are going to take on the proposal that's before us over the next two years, approximately $76,000, you're taking that $76,000 away from your school department educational budget that could be used somehow to get into some of these programs, if not all of them, to some degree and a percentage of whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10045.762s">The</a>  pay scale for those caring for these programs was at issue, and yet as of today, nothing has been done to resolve any of the issues as presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10055.033s">The</a>  City Council School Committee pay raise proposal does not recognize and connect to the short and long term needs of our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10063.664s">So</a>  when and if you folks are sitting here and you're discussing these needs, and you think that the school committee should be making more money, and you have a school committee that's been around for so many years, allegedly for 20, if that's what the issue is, well then let's, what do we need to motivate and show that their need and they're worthy of it other than <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10082.987s">You</a>  know, they should be making the same as in Worcester. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10086.568s">They</a>  have an audience that does say up to 50% of what a city council makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10090.19s">But</a>  their job responsibilities may be entirely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10092.851s">Do</a>  you realize right now, a kindergarten assistant, if we were to follow this pay raise as proposed, a kindergarten assistant who works five days a week and is subject to everything in that classroom as every other teacher, will be making $1,000 less <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10110.336s">then</a>  this pay proposal for a school committee person, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10113.937s">Makes</a>  no sense at all because a school committee person doesn't have to sign in, doesn't have to check in, has no responsibility as it relates to, you know, what am I doing on a daily basis that says I'm doing something that's educationally correct for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10128.763s">By</a>  granting from the city council, let's put it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10134.906s">There</a>  should be some justification before you folks <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10138.43s">from,</a>  and it can't be from the at present school committee because there'd be a conflict of interest because they have a financial gain from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10144.793s">So</a>  it's gotta be as according to the state law, the chapter is gonna come from your folks in the state council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10149.836s">But</a>  what has this school committee done, especially with its new members that has said Medford's education is better, Medford's discipline is better, and that's seriously questioned as to what's going on up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10163.439s">The</a>  sports programs is getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10165.76s">Parents</a>  are getting more involved, but also at the same time, where is the educational standard in comparison to other cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10176.283s">Has</a>  the school committee made such great strides that, hey, they're working together with the teachers and their organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10184.365s">When</a>  you had here last week, and I know you have some new folks that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10188.787s">On</a>  December 12th, there was almost 150, 175 teachers that were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10193.2s">And</a>  they explain to you the plight of not only being in the classroom, being attacked, where their pay is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10200.203s">Some</a>  of them have to work five years, five years before they even make $25,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10206.905s">That's</a>  unconscionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10208.666s">Justin,</a>  I understand that you want to give them a pay raise, you know, but I didn't hear your logic behind it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10213.928s">Please</a>  just direct your comments to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10215.228s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10215.929s">Well,</a>  he's the one, it's his resolution.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10217.349s">I</a>  know, but just direct it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10218.65s">Through</a>  the chair to Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10220.25s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10221.11s">Through</a>  the chair to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10222.679s">Okay,</a>  through the chair, Justin, I know you wanna give them this Bay Race, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10227.441s">But</a>  you haven't said anything, none of you have expressed any comment as it relates to, they deserve it for the value of what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10235.224s">Can</a>  anybody explain to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10237.765s">If</a>  you really want to give somebody a pay raise, isn't the job description and your job duties and your employer supposed to do the review of you? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10246.208s">Now,</a>  of course they can say, the Medford taxpayer is your reviewer and you run for office and they elect you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10252.25s">Okay,</a>  that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10254.251s">But</a>  the Medford taxpayer doesn't pay your salary, it's the Medford City Council according to state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10259.997s">So</a>  the Medford City Council, by right, can make a great demand on this school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10264.499s">If</a>  you really want to improve it, we'll look at this in two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10267.68s">Let's</a>  see what this new school committee does over the next two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10270.801s">Let's</a>  just see through your intervention with the Medford Teachers Association and from the superintendent all the way down, that everything that's taking place in all our schools, from kindergarten all the way up to the high school, has gotten better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10282.004s">Grades</a>  have gotten better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10283.925s">Discipline</a>  has gotten better and under control. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10288.174s">That</a>  would make a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10289.575s">And</a>  maybe people might say, hey, okay, you're working toward it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10293.216s">But</a>  when you have a job that you don't have to sign in, check in and give any report as to what you do and why you're doing how you do it, and expect to start off at a higher rate than people who have been here for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10305.782s">That's</a>  just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10307.643s">And</a>  the last thing, let me just say this as it relates to that, and I told you Arlington gets $3,000, Everett gets $11,500, Malden gets $7,000, Somerville gets $16,500, and Method gets $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10318.977s">We're</a>  the second highest one of the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10323.723s">A</a>  kindergarten <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10325.609s">through</a>  the chair to Justin, a kindergarten teacher assistant after the second year gets $21,568. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10332.391s">That's</a>  $1,000 less than what you wanna propose to a school committee person who doesn't go to this job every day, like the kindergarten teacher goes to school every day, five days a week, and does everything that education says of that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10350.556s">Maybe</a>  you should have a sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10352.912s">with</a>  the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10354.713s">Because</a>  they can't tell you that they want it because it would be a financial benefit to them, that would be a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10361.578s">But</a>  somebody needs to understand, just because they need to get paid more, because they're not getting paid enough now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10368.383s">Well,</a>  they're getting paid $12,000, and if they don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10371.545s">And</a>  through the chair to Mrs. Callahan, not for anything, you made the comment that you think that, you know, to get good candidates, you need to pay more. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10379.63s">I'm</a>  gonna respectfully disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10381.992s">a</a>  good candidate is someone who wants to run for the job because they believe that better things can be done and I can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10388.195s">And</a>  if I can't do it, then the people won't reelect me that salary has got nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10394.017s">And</a>  the salary should not be used for your own personal gain. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10397.779s">I'm</a>  going to make $30,000 a year now more 24,000, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10401.861s">And</a>  the sad part about the whole thing in conclusion, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10404.815s">If</a>  this proposal were to go through, you're taking $74,000 a year out of this Medford School Department education budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10413.077s">It's</a>  bad enough now for them to work on a daily basis without having enough of the money that should be in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10419.558s">Now</a>  you're gonna take another $74,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10421.339s">And</a>  you know, where does that go? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10424.379s">How</a>  do you explain that to the Medford taxpayer? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10426.86s">You</a>  can't explain it to me because I wouldn't buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10429.921s">Because</a>  right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10431.596s">The</a>  Medford School Committee is working with all they can do just to maintain their budget and to get by and to start taking more money away to give it to an elected official who does absolutely nothing to enhance or embellish or make better school education. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10450.595s">That's,</a>  it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10453.296s">So</a>  if I understand you correctly, I believe you said you would like to have this go and have a decision come up by the end of December of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10460.479s">I</a>  believe that's what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10462.259s">That</a>  would be okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10463.4s">But</a>  to vote on this tonight, I think it would be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10466.721s">I</a>  think it would serve no purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10468.622s">And</a>  I don't think it would be good for Medford public school education. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10472.483s">That's</a>  my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10473.544s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10475.421s">Thank</a>  you, former Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10477.723s">Just</a>  to clarify, there was a list of things in Councilor Callaghan's motion around a variety of pro-democracy reforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10485.368s">Quite</a>  frankly, even though there was a suggested date of a report, we may not have the answers to all of those questions by that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10490.632s">So</a>  I would not personally, I'm going to vote for that B paper, but to me, it is not to say there will be more. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10500.438s">I</a>  think this is gonna be the swing of the bat for a while on this question, probably for years.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10506.561s">Can</a>  I ask a question to the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10507.901s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10508.482s">Did</a>  I misunderstand Mrs. Cowell? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10510.283s">Did</a>  you say in part of your questioning there is, I think you- She listed a variety of different reforms, rank choice- All right, it was one of the things that you said you wanted illegal aliens to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10520.887s">Did</a>  you say that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10522.008s">Undocumented</a>  immigrants to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10523.268s">Did</a>  you say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10524.029s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10524.289s">Non-citizens.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10525.049s">Non-citizens.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10525.91s">Non-citizens.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10526.85s">Non-citizens.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10527.13s">So</a>  documented non-citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10530.418s">Green</a>  card holders and the like, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10532.64s">People</a>  who have green cards.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10537.305s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10541.468s">I'm</a>  more than happy to answer any questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10545.853s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10546.593s">We</a>  have two folks on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10549.256s">I</a>  will go to M. Paige Lieberman. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10551.418s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10557.771s">So</a>  my name is Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10562.194s">I</a>  really appreciate all the Councilors that have brought this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10565.837s">And</a>  I especially appreciate what Councilor Callahan introduced beyond this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10573.122s">There</a>  is one thing that was an idea that we should consider is about waiting until after an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10584.074s">And</a>  I think that that should apply for the same body. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10587.775s">So</a>  the city council could not continue to simply raise its salary in between elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10593.136s">But</a>  I'm not quite sure if it should apply when we're talking about raising the salary of a different body of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10601.098s">But,</a>  you know, Councilor Bears, you talked about how it may be another 24 years before this is reconsidered. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10608.203s">And</a>  so, you know, one of the questions that I and you, and this has been repeatedly referred to as a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10614.551s">And</a>  so my question is, is before this compromise was kind of hammered out. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10620.777s">Was</a>  there any degree of talking about, you know, like doing it with a call like a cost of living adjustment in the future, or, you know, tagging indexing it to the rate of inflation? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10631.566s">If</a>  that's not I hope that that can be pursued in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10634.909s">And</a>  at least for the minimum wage here in Medford indexing the minimum wage to the rate of inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10641.835s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10644.807s">Thank</a>  you, Matthew. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10645.927s">Yes,</a>  I did work with counsel and the way that the law works, it specifically has to raise the salary from one amount to another amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10654.169s">So</a>  you could not say it should go from 12,000 to this and then thus shall go up with an inflationary measure or some sort of other measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10663.411s">It</a>  has to be from one amount to another amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10665.631s">The</a>  only way to do what you're talking about would be to put it in the charter in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10671.433s">But</a>  under the chapter, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10673.729s">71,</a>  section 40, sorry, 52. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10674.809s">And</a>  I keep misplacing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10679.47s">It</a>  must go from one number to another number, so you can't peg it to something such as inflation or another metric, a COLA. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10687.052s">I'm</a>  going to go to Ricky on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10696.814s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10697.474s">Ricky</a>  Cormier, 150 Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10701.926s">This</a>  whole idea just seems ridiculous to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10705.088s">You</a>  guys are creating a problem that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10708.451s">Nobody</a>  cares about this except for like six of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10711.613s">This</a>  is just nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10713.775s">You</a>  just said the entire country, nobody else has equal pay for the city council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10719.199s">And</a>  you guys are the only ones thinking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10720.74s">It's</a>  because it's not necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10723.782s">The</a>  idea is just ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10726.464s">You</a>  guys are responsible for like 60,000 people in the city of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10730.911s">The</a>  school committee is responsible for like 6,000 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10734.973s">That's</a>  10 times the amount of people you guys are responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10738.194s">So</a>  why would you get paid the same? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10739.275s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10743.076s">Furthermore,</a>  you shouldn't do a job just for the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10747.538s">That's</a>  not why you run for an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10748.999s">You</a>  run for an election because you want to do it because you want to be a school committee member, not because you're trying to make an extra buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10755.402s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10756.437s">This</a>  idea is just a problem that you guys have created. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10758.779s">There's</a>  no need for compromise because there's no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10761.2s">Just</a>  leave it the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10762.341s">Maybe</a>  you give them a little raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10763.542s">Sure</a>  that everybody deserves a raise now and then a couple thousand dollars maybe, but the double, triple their pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10770.246s">It's</a>  just nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10771.487s">So</a>  I hope that this gets shot down. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10773.809s">I'm</a>  sure it won't because you guys just do whatever you want, but I hope it gets shot down real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10779.993s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
