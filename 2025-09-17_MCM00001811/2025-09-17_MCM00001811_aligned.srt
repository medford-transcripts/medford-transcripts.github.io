Thank you all for being here tonight.

31
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:06,139
We have some.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,763
Preliminary business to take care of and then the best majority of the discussion will be about the proposals that we received.

33
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,063
It will.

34
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:27,116
Before we do that, the next thing on the agenda is the approval of the August 11th committee meeting minutes.

35
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:29,297
Is there a motion to approve?

36
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:30,398
Motion to approve.

37
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:32,259
Motion to approve by Member Okade.

38
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,659
Second.

39
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,320
Second by Dr. Pelosi.

40
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:38,501
Okay, I will call the roll.

41
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:39,442
Jenny Graham, yes.

42
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:40,522

43
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:41,862
Dr. DeLucia, yes.

00:02:57,286 --> 00:02:59,026
Emily Lazzaro, yes.

51
00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:02,047
Nicole Morrell, absent.

52
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:25,317
12 the affirmative, 0 in the negative, 2 abstention, 2 absent.

53
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,461
Oh, no, 11, sorry.

54
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:45,339
Okay, item number three, we actually are welcoming two new members to the building committee.

55
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:52,300
So, as you all know, Dr. Cushing has taken a job in Beverly as the superintendent of schools there.

56
00:03:53,121 --> 00:04:00,942
He was a voting member of the committee, and he has been replaced by Ken Lord, who has joined Bedford as the chief operating officer.

57
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:05,095
And Dr has also joined the team.

58
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:06,400
She is our.

59
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:20,470
yourselves at all, it can become like wheels of experience in this space.

60
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,191
So it might be nice for everyone to hear.

61
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,071
Sure.

62
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:29,833
So this is a little deja vu.

63
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:33,114
So it's been really interesting for me.

64
00:04:33,194 --> 00:04:36,715
I'm excited to participate in this project.

65
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:40,997
I've been involved in technology for over 30 years.

66
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:43,177
So it's probably six years.

67
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:00,958
Welcome both of you.

68
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:05,400
If there's anything that happens along the way and you're like, what are you all talking about?

69
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,642
Please feel free to stop us and ask because we're happy to answer.

70
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:11,904
So welcome.

71
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:14,725
And if there's things you need, just let me know.

72
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,822
Tracy can you hear me okay?

73
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:40,005
I can hear Jenny okay but I could not hear Ken and Dr. Talbot at all.

74
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:47,268
So everyone just use your teacher voice and let's see how it goes.

75
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,448
Tracy just keep us

76
00:05:53,052 --> 00:06:14,610
will do thank you um item number four is approval of the august 2025 opium invoice um so i'm going to turn that over to matt you would like to walk us through what's here uh yeah so this is just our our third invoice uh last meeting we were

77
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:20,808
So this is a continuation of our OPM services for the month of August.

78
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,189
It's our refund on sum of $25,000.

79
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:31,173
We don't have any additional sub-consultants or other reimbursement costs at this point.

80
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:32,954
It's very straightforward.

81
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,577
Any questions for Ken?

82
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:42,880
Is there a motion to approve the invoice?

83
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,382
Motion to approve by Ken, seconded by Luke.

84
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:53,785
I will call the roll.

85
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:54,665
Jenny Graham?

86
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:55,126
Yes.

87
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:56,267
Mayor Longo Kern?

88
00:06:56,307 --> 00:06:56,607
Yes.

89
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:58,088
Dr. Galussi?

90
00:06:58,148 --> 00:06:58,428
Yes.

91
00:06:58,548 --> 00:06:59,489
Marta Cabral?

92
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:08,715
We're absent for now.

93
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,096
Libby Brown?

94
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:10,456
Yes.

95
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,197
Marissa Desmond?

96
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:12,618
Yes.

97
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:13,678
Maria Dorsey?

98
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:13,758
Yes.

99
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:17,282
Okay, welcome Maria.

100
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:18,763
Thank you.

101
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:20,863
Brian Hilliard.

102
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:20,943
Yes.

103
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:22,284
Tracy Keene.

104
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:23,144
Yes.

105
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,705
Emily Lazaro.

106
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:26,325
Yes.

107
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:28,585
Nicole Morrell.

108
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:30,146
She's on her way.

109
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:33,927
Aaron Olopade.

110
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:34,367
Yes.

111
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:35,427
Luke Pricer.

112
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:35,887
Yes.

113
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:36,848
Joan Bowen.

114
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:37,308
Yes.

115
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,148
Pam Lord.

116
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:38,568
Yes.

117
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:45,730
So that is 13 in the affirmative, two absent, motion passed.

118
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:58,682
Okay, so we're going to move on to the meat of the meeting and hopefully it will be a meeting by the time we're done here.

119
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:10,975
As you all know, we got 4 proposals from designers and the goal for tonight is for myself for the mayor and for Dr Lucy to really

120
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:13,948
questions.

121
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:15,750
We are not ranking.

122
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,211
We cannot rank.

123
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:18,952
We cannot do that.

124
00:08:19,272 --> 00:08:20,313
We should not do that.

125
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:26,157
All of these four folks are watching us either now or in the future.

126
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:36,804
And the MSBA is really explicit about not wanting us to be talking in terms of ranking favorites, et cetera.

127
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,706
So what we tried to do was

128
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,821
Give you all a set of questions to think about and they're up on the screen there.

129
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:51,862
So what I would like for us to just go.

130
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:55,283
1 proposal at a time and go through these questions.

131
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:58,564
I think we're really interested in hearing from all of you.

132
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:02,664
We're sensitive to the fact that we are 3 of 13 votes.

133
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:07,825
So we have our work cut out for us when we go to designer selection next week.

134
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:09,586
However.

135
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:26,157
You know, there's a lot of collective experience at this table and we want to hear from from all of you from from your lenses, from your impressions of the proposals that were shared and that will help us get ready for that for that meeting.

136
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:28,899
And there's 2 meetings.

137
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:38,045
1 is where we will talk about all of the proposals and then the 2nd meeting where there will be a short list of some kind.

138
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:42,049
interview to accept the DSP.

139
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:53,772
So the questions that we did want to talk about with all of you and I'm thinking we should just take them one at a time so that we give everybody equal shape.

140
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,373
What did you like about the proposal compared to others?

141
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:01,134
What stuck out as advantageous?

142
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:04,295
What did you dislike about a particular proposal as

143
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:08,812
advantageous?

144
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:13,701
And then what questions would you have for this applicant about their proposal?

145
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:15,665
So those are the three questions

146
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,583
Let's start with DLR.

147
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:30,105
I couldn't find any of it.

148
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:30,886
Okay, hold on.

149
00:10:30,926 --> 00:10:35,129
We're going to do one question at a time so that everybody can stick with us.

150
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:38,511
Okay, so let's everyone has DLR's proposal.

151
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:44,656
Okay, so this proposal is from DLR in collaboration

152
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:04,668
And then, Will, can you keep track of who is raising their hand online?

153
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,729
It's a little hard for us to see.

154
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,810
What do we like about this proposal?

155
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,824
I like that they have experience working together.

156
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:33,850
I recently had a large project that took it, and I think that bloody shows really strong design skills.

157
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,733
So I think that's the example of the fact that they're a successful team.

158
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:38,154
Great.

159
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:39,194
Anyone else?

160
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:56,610
I like that they were pretty explicit in their stuff.

161
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,831
Everything can move on.

162
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,173
Let's do that, shall we?

163
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:02,394
Anybody else?

164
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:08,098
Thoughts, questions about what you liked?

165
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,851
Any questions online, Will?

166
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,392
I'm seeing.

167
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:20,333
OK.

168
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:25,396
What did you dislike about the DLR proposal as compared to others?

169
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:30,199
Or what did you view as being less advantageous, or less than advantageous?

170
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,401
Well, less advantageous, yeah.

171
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,823
I can find evidence that it's not sincere.

172
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:39,205
I can see that it's important.

173
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:44,590
Yeah.

174
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,974
It's certainly a consultant.

175
00:12:51,856 --> 00:13:01,803
But the prime contractor team seems to have a bigger experience base spread across the country.

176
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:07,027
And also, even to the US territories.

177
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:10,889
I haven't dealt with as much of that case.

178
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:27,608
I also thought the relatively large full-time employee account, about 5.5, was less advantageous than a 10-year team.

179
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:34,972
So it's true that it's tough to get that full-time account for a 10-year team.

180
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:40,275
You also have a very high consultant fee.

181
00:13:51,420 --> 00:14:03,786
I've seen that people are having a hard time hearing us.

182
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:19,873
So Emily, so far the comments in the less advantageous category are that this group is light on experience with MSBA, that they seem to have a relatively large headcount, and that there are two

183
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:29,227
That's what we've covered so far, just for those of you trying to listen here.

184
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,090
speak loudly for the crowd.

185
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:48,531
I meant to speak up earlier, but then I got distracted looking at the paper.

186
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:54,692
But I actually think the fact that it's two firms is actually something that could be seen as advantageous.

187
00:14:54,732 --> 00:15:06,214
You have a lot of different voices, and you get to take the expertise of each of those firms and leave behind the things that the firms aren't as good at.

188
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:11,535
So I think looking at them as one entity, it's not on us to figure out how that firm

189
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:19,808
how they're going to, like, who's going to be in charge of this part of design, who's going to be in charge of that part of the design.

190
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:31,434
Having worked on both sides of projects where I've been either the architect of record or the design architect, all of this would be hammered out between two firms in advance.

191
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:33,335
Skipping ahead a little,

192
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:42,733
proposal, how are they going to handle these things?

193
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:54,096
They have extensive experience working together already, which leads me to believe that they already have this process in their minds of how they're going to handle it.

194
00:15:55,137 --> 00:16:05,980
And so I think it is actually very advantageous to take a firm that's really rooted in the programming and analysis, and then a firm that's really rooted in

195
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:12,201
really good design and bringing them together to create one super team.

196
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:15,263
Thanks, Marissa.

197
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,246
Will, is there anybody online who's got their hand up?

198
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:25,430
All the members of the, oh, Marissa, Maria Dorsey.

199
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,452
Maria?

200
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:37,119
Hi, from an educational angle, I had the feeling that this group, their focus was more on

201
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:41,589
CTE than on the classrooms, as opposed to the other groups.

202
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:51,178
A lot of them, the others were either on equal footing or had a strong sense of what the needs of the classroom are with CTE combined.

203
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:57,103
This one, I felt that they were, they had a leaning, more leaning towards the shops.

204
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,585
So that was just my impression on what I read.

205
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:03,228
Thanks, Maria.

206
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:05,630
Is anybody else online?

207
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:13,953
Anybody else?

208
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:14,333
Ryan?

209
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:24,659
I think one of the things I feel is a little bit advantageous is that they're prime candidates, I think.

210
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:35,286
So a little bit of a problem there that we don't know how it turned out and how that can manifest itself.

211
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:40,749
So for those of you online, the comment was that they're like sort of

212
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:45,623
prime example for us is still a work in progress, and it's not yet complete.

213
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:48,203
So we don't know how it turned out.

214
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:49,664
Luke?

215
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:57,305
When I looked at all the consultants, I didn't find a library consultant.

216
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:00,186
I didn't find a lab consultant.

217
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:02,366
I didn't find a school consultant.

218
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:04,946
I didn't find a landscape consultant.

219
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:26,929
Is that typical?

220
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:32,351
Matt and Jen, can you talk a little bit about what is typical in terms of how teams get put together?

221
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:36,153
So they need to provide consultants.

222
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:52,383
One of the questions that we received after the walkthrough was whether or not a pool consultant is required or not.

223
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:55,766
It's not something that we asked that it was required.

224
00:18:55,826 --> 00:19:03,653
They can certainly include one, so I think we need one for our Canada pool consultant and the resident pool consultant.

225
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:18,202
So that's typically, and I can pull up the sub-spreadsheet of where I found everybody, just to make sure that they didn't fall off.

226
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,362
I do think they did.

227
00:19:19,662 --> 00:19:23,824
Some of them are maybe a little hard to find, next to some of these.

228
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:27,965
But I'll take a look and see what it is.

229
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:34,167
Sometimes they have in-house experience, so they look to themselves for those categories.

230
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:39,875
That makes it a little less clear.

231
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:42,736
Let me do that.

232
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:48,778
For the CTK experience, for example, they have somebody else that says they're a CTK.

233
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:51,299
So that answers every question, but for some.

234
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:59,923
So it sounds like the teams will not necessarily look at this because of how they come together.

235
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:00,543
Is that right?

236
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:00,983
Right.

237
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:01,383
OK.

238
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:02,384
Thanks.

239
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:06,028
Other not advantageous things?

240
00:20:15,077 --> 00:20:20,643
Also, a lot of the projects that they're looking at, the student count is really low.

241
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:56,017
So just so you know, this is the spreadsheet that we're required to fill out for the MSBA.

242
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:56,918
This is all there.

243
00:20:56,938 --> 00:20:58,738
You can see them here.

244
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,949
I did have a question.

245
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:39,119
Lucy and her team.

246
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:53,408
I feel like what I hear about vocational is that what we think of as vocational in Massachusetts is quite different than what vocational looks like in other places in the country.

247
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:57,731
Can you respond to that from a programming perspective?

248
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:00,613
Because a lot of their vocational experience seem to be

249
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:23,426
Yes, and I think that we're in a unique situation where we are a comprehensive high school, we're not a single vocational school, so all of our programs are Chapter 74, which means that there are requirements and regulations pertaining to

250
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:30,930
Content that we provide our students the number of hours that they have in shop as well as for their academics.

251
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:37,834
And then the number of hours that they are doing in the industry fields, whatever that may be to go to the shop.

252
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:48,219
And I know that we are to expand our programming and that some of the vocational programming standards have recently been increased.

253
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:50,540
A lot of what

254
00:22:52,626 --> 00:23:19,147
I would just say that from the lens of me reviewing a lot of these proposals would be looking at that experience that the firm does have with the CTE programming that is aligned and parallel to Medford, not a standalone CTE school, but one that's comprehensive, that at this time has full Chapter 74 shops.

255
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:29,631
and wants a space that is unique and brings with it a lot of flexibility.

256
00:23:31,092 --> 00:23:31,972
Do you need more detail?

257
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:33,513
No, I'm good, thank you.

258
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:41,577
I just wanted to, not being in that world, understand, is it the same everywhere or is it different?

259
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:42,057
So, thank you.

260
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:47,780
I also would say, maybe also for me, I do not have

261
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,602
a lot of MSBA experience coming into this project.

262
00:23:52,662 --> 00:24:12,390
So I think for someone like me, reading these proposals, I found it very difficult to get a true understanding from the visuals of this based on the clarity of the image, the detail or lack

263
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:24,163
It was really hard for me to get a true understanding as to what the vision was for the proposals.

264
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:36,288
Third question, what question would you ask this applicant about their proposal?

265
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:41,850
Obviously that we haven't already talked about, but a question she would ask.

266
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:44,477
Okay.

267
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:08,961
Questions?

268
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:09,282
Libby?

269
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:12,864
I think I'd ask just how frequently do they expect to meet physically?

270
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:14,865
Because it's awesome for those who are not local.

271
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:20,089
So they might be flying in or doing remote meetings, just how often do they meet?

272
00:25:25,453 --> 00:25:28,775
That's right, this was the team that was not terribly local, is that right?

273
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:30,597
Yeah, Libby's local.

274
00:25:30,957 --> 00:25:32,598
Okay, some of them are local.

275
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:33,359
Awesome.

276
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:39,139
What other questions would we have for DLR?

277
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:24,369
For those of you at home wanting some more information on their cluster design concept.

278
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,310
Other questions for DLR?

279
00:26:57,402 --> 00:27:05,706
What did we like about Perkinsville?

280
00:27:05,846 --> 00:27:06,186
Luke?

281
00:27:06,266 --> 00:27:07,447
I like the big wood.

282
00:27:09,388 --> 00:27:12,109
I like the big wood.

283
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:12,949
I like the big wood.

284
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:14,230
I like the big wood.

285
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,210
I like the big wood.

286
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,300
I like that they included a

287
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:59,096
estimated timeline for the various modules, including this design, as well as the cost-incentive for house-wide construction.

288
00:28:00,436 --> 00:28:09,601
Certainly more to it, but I'd like them to do the effort.

289
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:12,863
Things people liked about Irvingsville, Aaron?

290
00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:14,064
I liked that they tried

291
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:28,521
had a kind of central space in between the additional renovating space today, the first kind of slideshow, trying to incorporate the idea that this is an opportunity for the community to be involved in that, as well as outdoor learning spaces.

292
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:35,988
We're learning a lot now that there's a huge benefit to having that available space for students and teachers to kind of get outside the classroom from time to time.

293
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:39,792
So to be able to incorporate that and have that be used as a shared space with the community

294
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:53,034
I like the way you put the geofederal right in the picture.

295
00:28:57,314 --> 00:29:02,595
Overall, I think the students are very clear, the graphics are very clear.

296
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:09,036
This gives me hope for and faith for our team for how we can move forward as a student community.

297
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:11,677
And I just think that there's some great clarity

298
00:29:17,358 --> 00:29:20,699
I also like the idea that we take into account interdisciplinary learning.

299
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:23,501
That's not just about CTE but about all partners.

300
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:55,278
So for those of you online so far we we've heard the likes include

301
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:21,284
Students experience working with left field, that Salem High School is ongoing and ahead of us, that they took a stab at a timeline, that they're prioritizing community space, outdoor learning, geothermal.

302
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,266
Their messaging was quite clear.

303
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:36,779
They are not splitting their team with other projects like Salem, and they are focused on interdisciplinary learning, just so that you, in case you all were having a hard time hearing.

304
00:30:56,248 --> 00:31:03,791
When we were doing the tour, there were lots of questions about those kinds of things.

305
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:17,115
And we really tried to paint a picture for everybody who is here that there are some interesting spaces in this building that we should be looking at to say, is this worth preserving?

306
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:25,658
Or is it not for some reason, but that was one of the spaces we talked about wanting explicitly to be able to evaluate

307
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:37,420
Does it stay, does it goes what happens that also included the gym because it's quite big and it includes some of the CT spaces as well.

308
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:44,203
So that certainly seems reflected in their design as well in terms of how they were trying to serve.

309
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,579
I'm going to answer that question in a bit.

310
00:32:36,383 --> 00:32:38,485
things that seem less advantageous.

311
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:50,736
So to the point of the importance of this area, there aren't a lot of CTEs.

312
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,239
And their team also,

313
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:07,470
didn't seem to have lots of vocational experience.

314
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,411
Am I remembering that correctly?

315
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:19,914
I'm sorry.

316
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:27,876
I'm so sorry.

317
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:39,593
I'll just make it a point that I saw two consultants sort of talking about that.

318
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:50,142
Marissa, I think kind of splitting this question into the next one.

319
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:57,348
For some of the firms that have less experience in CTE, a question for that would be how

320
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,824
that you think would be beneficial to help CTE.

321
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:19,551
Things like performing arts and just like fine art have a lot of details and explicit requirements similar to CTE.

322
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:28,838
I mean, not the same things, obviously, but like the same, just like nonsense stuff that you don't necessarily need in a regular classroom, like that type of experience.

323
00:34:33,187 --> 00:34:40,513
I think this one, that their experiences span beyond public schools and beyond high schools.

324
00:34:41,273 --> 00:35:00,707
And while it might answer the question to you, while that may not be a negative, there were other design teams where their experiences are strictly educational spaces.

325
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:01,128
Week 12.

326
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:23,441
in Medford with a very unique site and the possibilities of being able to do something maybe different in here.

327
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:29,723
Other things we thought were the last advantageous

328
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:48,585
Okay, what questions do you have for this firm?

329
00:35:52,149 --> 00:36:01,757
Questions for all firms, especially this one is what experience they have in renovating jibs, or CTE, or anything else for that matter.

330
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:05,561
Do all firms have experience in some sort of solar

331
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:10,486
Other questions?

332
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:56,996
in the building, what their thinking is with that, so I can get some clarity on what their vision would be and how that kind of plays into the work we're doing, which is well, but that's perspective-appropriate, because they clarify everything else, so.

333
00:36:57,296 --> 00:36:59,679
Thank you.

334
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,443
Other questions?

335
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:15,587
Two down, two to go.

336
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:18,708
I'm gonna do AI3 next.

337
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:21,889
Happens to be one right in front of me.

338
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:35,393
Okay, what did we find advantageous about AI3?

339
00:37:44,276 --> 00:37:50,059
Great.

340
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:59,605
I did.

341
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:05,189
I like the innovative way they looked at underground parking, but also a separate club.

342
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:13,294
If that's something that we're going to continue to have, like have that separate for the community schools, you know?

343
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:20,934
do you have examples of bids on your budget?

344
00:38:20,954 --> 00:38:22,876
That's your question.

345
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:23,716
You can dream, right?

346
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:26,758
I just am really in love with the use of wood inside the building.

347
00:38:26,798 --> 00:38:28,460
So there's that.

348
00:38:56,645 --> 00:39:03,227
knowledge that we're on a hill, so I think some of the designs were trying to kind of lay it all at the same level.

349
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:12,229
But I think this one, I think it gave the site the opportunity to use multi-level construction builds, either for the additional, like additional renovations or complete construction.

350
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:17,090
So I think it's an interesting way to kind of consider what the vision would look like and how it would be useful.

351
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:26,094
I wouldn't have to founder a firm, because I don't have 75% of this company.

352
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:28,336
I serve some of the charge.

353
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:35,942
A smaller project with a contractor team, a smaller consulting team.

354
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:48,932
the founder and partner of the integral project.

355
00:39:49,132 --> 00:39:51,794
So I thought that was a good presentation.

356
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:52,815
They're a task force.

357
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:55,397
They have worked with and blessed with.

358
00:39:56,938 --> 00:40:06,746
So they're just people involved in a larger scene, which I'm quite interested in.

359
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:18,651
This is a very large lot.

360
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:23,975
It's 40 acres by 60 acres.

361
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:32,842
And if you look at the pictures of these various high schools, you can see the aesthetics vary quite a lot.

362
00:40:33,242 --> 00:40:36,565
So they're very capable of executing a stock.

363
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:48,004
Watertown is home to the City of Spring, their schools are at Tarim and Rosewood.

364
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:25,906
I would say what I think is very advantageous about AI3 is that, as you mentioned previously, during the tour, I felt like this proposal captured a lot of what we have said in our profile as well as what was mentioned on the tour.

365
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:35,109
So they were very specific to call out some details about how we want to make sure we have a collaborative space for teachers and staff.

366
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:55,640
how different options for how the learning environment can be stacked while maintaining some of the CTE spaces and how they can be creative, to Aaron's point about using the scope of our band, I just felt like they were listening and

367
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:07,519
For those of you online, I'm going to give you a quick rundown of what has been said, if you all can hear me okay.

368
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:08,060
Thumbs up?

369
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,320
Okay.

370
00:42:23,828 --> 00:42:25,529
So here's the list that I've captured.

371
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:28,229
They've done six CTE projects.

372
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,270
They have an in-house CTE expert.

373
00:42:31,991 --> 00:42:37,953
They had creative ideas around underground parking at a separate aquatic center.

374
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:43,494
They've identified bids that are under budget, which is exciting.

375
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:50,116
Their aesthetic design appeals to more than one person in the room.

376
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:51,877
They sort of

377
00:42:52,611 --> 00:43:06,520
Worked with our on the Hill idea rather than trying to plan it as well as the founder being directly involved in the project and a tighter stack of consultants.

378
00:43:08,142 --> 00:43:11,804
So, hopefully less tension and more cohesion on the team.

379
00:43:12,444 --> 00:43:19,009
They have worked with left field before the watertown building that's set to open in the spring is a net 0 building.

380
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:27,049
And that they were very clearly listening to the tour and the kinds of things that we were talking about that were important.

381
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,211
Like an expedited time.

382
00:43:29,612 --> 00:43:30,853
Like an expedited time.

383
00:43:30,873 --> 00:43:33,375
And overall, their clear commitment to

384
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,250
public input.

385
00:43:42,011 --> 00:43:46,453
So that's what's been going on here in case you all have been having a hard time hearing us.

386
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:51,275
Are there any likes from the group on the phone that you wanted to share?

387
00:43:51,295 --> 00:44:03,221
I see a comment from Maria.

388
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,542
They have a strong focus on integrating CTE in the classroom.

389
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:07,062
Thanks, Maria.

390
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:13,093
Jenny, this is Tracy.

391
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:24,898
I just listed because you may have already gone through this, but I've listed 4 questions that I think should be asked to each consultant and I just dropped them in the chat.

392
00:44:24,918 --> 00:44:26,299
Okay, great.

393
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:30,461
I will grab those out at the end.

394
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:36,424
Were there things that we saw about this presentation that were not advantageous?

395
00:44:49,547 --> 00:44:54,429
on the team, I didn't see very much diversity in the group, which is always a little concerning to me.

396
00:44:55,189 --> 00:45:07,694
Obviously, they will talk about involving the community, but not having any diversity on your team is problematic, I think, sometimes.

397
00:45:07,754 --> 00:45:10,035
Thank you.

398
00:45:15,397 --> 00:45:16,738
It's kind of contagious to me.

399
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:25,358
consultant or an expert.

400
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,601
Other things that were not advantageous?

401
00:45:35,403 --> 00:45:47,509
This is a little bit personal, but I think just compared to other firms, their designs just feel a little bit leaning towards an entry line and something that was over-elevated towards not higher education, but

402
00:45:49,638 --> 00:45:50,239
So, go back.

403
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:51,540
Flush that out a little bit.

404
00:46:02,545 --> 00:46:06,327
Colors, just materials, chaos, it's not a thing.

405
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:09,228
When you get to a high school level, things get a little more refined.

406
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:14,290
It's just a personal opinion, and sometimes things skew a little bit too far.

407
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:17,571
Fun and silly, that's better for kids.

408
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:20,512
You have narrow labels.

409
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,513
Narrow labels.

410
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:26,995
Other, not advantageous.

411
00:46:29,296 --> 00:46:53,151
For those of you on the phone, the two that came up is that the team is not very diverse in its composition, and then that the design leans towards younger children rather than towards young adults and almost adults, nearly adults, which gives me a little bit of a heart attack, personally, with two kids in this building now.

412
00:46:53,531 --> 00:46:56,353
OK, what questions would we have for AI equity

413
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:07,216
It may be the way they structure their team, but they're a person they call project manager.

414
00:47:07,256 --> 00:47:09,577
So they have 25% of their time available for the project.

415
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:11,377
Now, they have other people that have more.

416
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:15,178
So it might just be that that person isn't doing the same manager job that someone else is.

417
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:18,519
But I always wanted to be very, very clear about who's doing what.

418
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:24,241
If someone's going to get 25%, that means that those tasks are being done by someone else.

419
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:25,801
OK.

420
00:47:25,821 --> 00:47:27,102
Other questions?

421
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:51,950
So the only question I have as I'm looking at them, so the school that you'll design, compared to the other two, the amount of space in their brain for student learning in general, seems visually smaller than the other two suggested designs.

422
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:56,633
So we're trying to make them understand where the space is going a little bit.

423
00:48:03,749 --> 00:48:04,409
Thank you, guys.

424
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:04,849
OK, cool.

425
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:05,150
Thank you.

426
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,050
I retract my question.

427
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,331
So the question I'm going to ask is whether it will

428
00:48:23,112 --> 00:48:29,756
on top of the glass back in the city.

429
00:48:29,856 --> 00:48:33,418
That makes pretty fun sense.

430
00:48:33,518 --> 00:48:38,841
It will allow you to fabricate a new structure.

431
00:48:40,081 --> 00:48:43,984
I'll say that pushing the money on, that's not a good thing.

432
00:48:44,084 --> 00:48:49,587
I'm talking about, there's a lot of space on these streets that I guess are probably

433
00:48:53,989 --> 00:49:07,817
Yeah, and I do think whoever works with us, I think the first thing we'll do is tell them everything we hate about what was in their proposal, so that when they start thinking about what else it is that they want to hear.

434
00:49:08,938 --> 00:49:18,523
So just because something was not in a proposal that got selected doesn't mean we can't be like, we actually did really like this thing that this other editor did, and tell us about that.

435
00:49:18,603 --> 00:49:19,464
So I think that's a good thing.

436
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:37,315
There's many reasons to rule things out on the site, like in terms of timing, and landscape, and ledge, and all the other things that could be going on, that they just may have some perspective on.

437
00:49:37,335 --> 00:49:38,515
So we can put that on the same questions.

438
00:49:41,257 --> 00:49:44,618
There are questions for, were we talking about AI3s?

439
00:49:44,638 --> 00:49:46,519
I had a question about that.

440
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:57,770
Nobody in any of their thoughts thought about addressing the entry, the traffic entry.

441
00:49:58,171 --> 00:49:59,992
Everybody just maintained one driveway.

442
00:50:00,012 --> 00:50:03,995
And I know that that was like a big thing that we all talked about already.

443
00:50:04,856 --> 00:50:08,499
So I think the question would be, why?

444
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:09,259
Why?

445
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,183
And if you have thought about something, what would it be?

446
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:16,225
That's actually a great question.

447
00:50:16,345 --> 00:50:19,387
It was like a lot to take all of this in and be like,

448
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,592
Now, which one am I in?

449
00:50:22,632 --> 00:50:23,472
Where is it?

450
00:50:24,012 --> 00:50:25,793
All the pieces and parts were hard to keep track of.

451
00:50:25,873 --> 00:50:44,084
So, an additional thing was that the driveway that is incredibly long to pass through the property, which I think has to be helpful for conveying the product.

452
00:50:48,503 --> 00:51:09,679
Yeah, yeah, I mean, they all definitely addressed a lot of things on site and slow, so there wasn't just like one way in for everybody, one way out for everybody, once you get into almost the road, but I think the like, road coming in is what needs to also be addressed.

453
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:10,980
Right.

454
00:51:12,421 --> 00:51:14,123
The other questions about AI, great.

455
00:51:25,023 --> 00:51:26,564
What did we like?

456
00:51:34,768 --> 00:51:40,531
Well, I really like that they had an all-on solar memory service.

457
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:52,111
Okay, what else, Ken?

458
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:56,853
It felt like a really cohesive proposal, like all of the parts

459
00:52:16,017 --> 00:52:17,218
We're cohesive with the artworks.

460
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:21,020
It didn't feel like they just grabbed things from here and there and put them together.

461
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,121
It all was well thought out.

462
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:32,888
I thought the choice of agency as a landscape architect was smart, because that's what our comprehensive master plan would say.

463
00:52:32,988 --> 00:52:36,130
It's not the same person that's a landscape architect, but the firm.

464
00:52:36,731 --> 00:52:37,651
I don't want to jinx it.

465
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:49,431
I appreciate the fact that the concepts are still pretty open.

466
00:52:50,631 --> 00:52:53,211
I carry a lot of weight with it.

467
00:52:53,231 --> 00:52:54,972
So it's interesting as a conversation going.

468
00:52:55,952 --> 00:53:00,853
I like that the concepts are pretty open.

469
00:53:00,933 --> 00:53:02,373
It's getting things going.

470
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:06,694
It's a lot to work through.

471
00:53:06,794 --> 00:53:12,675
I appreciate that they're specific and generic at the same time.

472
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:19,023
information doesn't have a

473
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:34,423
just an engineering design background, I was wanting just a little bit more detail as to where this is headed.

474
00:53:34,443 --> 00:53:37,985
So I guess that's a double-edged sword.

475
00:53:38,005 --> 00:53:43,449
I honestly think some of these are better than some of the past experience.

476
00:53:43,629 --> 00:53:43,729
Yes.

477
00:53:48,674 --> 00:54:02,559
It's a long process, so this is... I like that they have a lot of disabled projects at a wide range of price points.

478
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:25,305
I like that for their one of their design plans, their site's actually a continuum of discovery.

479
00:54:25,405 --> 00:54:28,451
It's like this growing experiential learning opportunity.

480
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:30,154
So the whole, again, they kind of try to

481
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:51,976
what we want to accomplish in the next few years.

482
00:54:52,216 --> 00:55:01,158
I really like the side cut view on the bottom.

483
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:04,319
Because I also really like it.

484
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,460
It just gave me so much information.

485
00:55:13,755 --> 00:55:14,736
Any more likes?

486
00:55:15,037 --> 00:55:20,843
I know it's hard to separate them.

487
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:24,687
Okay on to things that are less advantageous.

488
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:57,944
This is all pretty flat, like the top floor at the very beginning is really just, it's only like one or two floors up across the very steep grade, and so that makes it wonderful.

489
00:56:04,552 --> 00:56:08,634
So, what's the plan there?

490
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:13,435
Is it just not going to budge down?

491
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:22,058
So, I'm a little confused by how flat things actually are.

492
00:56:22,158 --> 00:56:26,720
But I'm just counting the stories.

493
00:56:36,153 --> 00:56:39,936
Or it's probably something like 25, or whatever.

494
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:42,578
Something like that.

495
00:56:42,598 --> 00:56:46,061
When I look at them like this, they just look like pancakes.

496
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:46,982
Other dislikes?

497
00:56:47,022 --> 00:56:47,162
Luke?

498
00:57:11,754 --> 00:57:20,058
Certainly, I don't feel like we've let them from talking to us, but certainly

499
00:57:33,905 --> 00:57:41,171
And I saw some evidence of that actually materializing in their estimated schedule.

500
00:57:41,672 --> 00:57:45,215
Certainly, I compare it to Perkins-Wilson.

501
00:57:45,655 --> 00:57:50,740
They're not exactly honest about this, but you can tell where the science-based tests result.

502
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:53,162
So I was just looking at that.

503
00:57:54,443 --> 00:58:00,969
and it seems to be maybe six to eight months after inducting.

504
00:58:02,991 --> 00:58:10,158
So that's been treated as such, but I only bring it up because it sort of reinforces the concern that I have.

505
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:15,123
They have these ongoing, large documents that may take away from

506
00:58:16,268 --> 00:58:31,060
For the folks on the phone, I'll just do a quick recap so that we can make sure you're still with us.

507
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:36,384
For advantages, they have done three CTE programs very recently.

508
00:58:36,884 --> 00:58:38,665
They've got Whole Hog on solar.

509
00:58:40,126 --> 00:58:42,448
They have the largest in-house team.

510
00:58:44,178 --> 00:58:47,541
They, their proposal was cohesive from beginning to end.

511
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:52,605
They do have some sub consultants who were involved in conference plans.

512
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:54,427
So they would have a connection to that.

513
00:58:55,588 --> 00:58:57,309
Their concepts seem very open ended.

514
00:58:57,329 --> 00:59:01,013
They had a wide range of projects in terms of price points.

515
00:59:01,053 --> 00:59:01,473
So that felt.

516
00:59:04,304 --> 00:59:09,154
And then on the dislike side, so far, we have some questions about, like,

517
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:42,512
clarification about that, and then that they are simultaneously doing Wakefield and Lexington at different phases, but there are shared resources in this proposed team that also are working on Lexington, and Lexington is going to be a monster of a project based on what it's a very, very large high school.

518
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:47,135
Lexington yes, they do.

519
00:59:47,175 --> 00:59:47,615
They did.

520
00:59:48,236 --> 00:59:52,098
They did put a visual in their proposal about.

521
00:59:52,118 --> 00:59:58,823
I think, trying to tell us that the timing, the phasing of our project versus Lexington was different.

522
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:01,145
I think that's what this visual was trying to tell us.

523
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:07,030
I actually had some questions much like Luke about doesn't this sound like it's longer.

524
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:13,915
So I think that visual just probably needs some clarification questions list.

525
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:16,691
Anything from the folks online?

526
01:00:30,677 --> 01:00:44,167
between those big old moves, but sometimes it's harder to get all the program programming into those spaces, and it gets too much into constraints.

527
01:00:44,928 --> 01:00:50,852
And some of the other projects, some of the other proposals, aren't getting in their space, they just chip each other.

528
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:52,233
Other dislikes?

529
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:27,307
To me, one of their designs seems like a lot of walking for a student to come upstairs.

530
01:01:27,347 --> 01:01:29,008
Respectfully.

531
01:02:05,804 --> 01:02:11,610
I don't want us to do this at the beginning of the afternoon.

532
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:15,655
I don't want that five more minutes in class.

533
01:02:15,695 --> 01:02:17,336
Nobody wants the five minutes?

534
01:02:17,356 --> 01:02:18,338
So that is a concern.

535
01:02:18,878 --> 01:02:25,065
And then my question was going to be, it'll come back.

536
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:44,223
So I'm just wondering, is Leftfield allowed to suggest questions for us, having worked with some of them or not worked with Leftfield?

537
01:02:44,623 --> 01:02:50,506
Are there questions you think we should be asking, or are you allowed to say that?

538
01:02:50,526 --> 01:03:00,690
I think a lot of the questions that are coming up are along the lines of what we typically ask, and who we think does various project to project, designer to designer, projects on the stage.

539
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:04,432
So the questions seem to vary from what I've heard here, I think.

540
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:10,722
The questions that are being asked are very good.

541
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:38,783
with these design and collection panels.

542
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:44,347
And the questions are going to be asked across the board of all firms.

543
01:03:44,808 --> 01:03:48,571
So it won't be specific to one proposal or one architect.

544
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:52,153
It will be questions in relation to the project.

545
01:03:53,354 --> 01:03:56,377
Let me follow up to that.

546
01:03:56,417 --> 01:04:00,520
You said, so I know originally, if I believe, please correct me, the thought was to get

547
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,472
Do you think the idea is too narrow for you to interview?

548
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:08,914
It'll be those three voices on the panel.

549
01:04:08,934 --> 01:04:11,276
So they will decide if they want to be in it.

550
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:12,237
It might be all four.

551
01:04:12,317 --> 01:04:14,579
If they want to see it all.

552
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:35,834
You have this kind of discussion.

553
01:04:35,934 --> 01:04:41,716
Relatively close to today, but more to a few days ago.

554
01:04:41,756 --> 01:04:42,816
But that would be that.

555
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:44,477
At the end of that meeting.

556
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:58,664
but there will be a ranking with all of the DSP members.

557
01:04:59,484 --> 01:05:11,711
And at that point, if they see there's two better squad runners, and the other one starts ranking so far below, they might just pick two, where everybody has the same field ranking.

558
01:05:11,731 --> 01:05:16,194
I have a question.

559
01:05:16,434 --> 01:05:21,977
This question asks me, what's a two-body carbon reduction for post-design and body?

560
01:05:26,653 --> 01:05:27,473
It's on page 71.

561
01:05:27,713 --> 01:05:33,715
It's on page 71 and on page 72.

562
01:05:33,835 --> 01:05:35,415
Along with the pictures.

563
01:05:35,635 --> 01:05:37,055
It's on the top right corner.

564
01:05:37,115 --> 01:05:42,476
Oh, it's like a little pie chart.

565
01:05:54,336 --> 01:05:58,838
the energy that it takes to put into the materials.

566
01:05:58,898 --> 01:06:07,102
But I think what this is saying, my chart is the proposed design, body carbon is 20% less than my typical project.

567
01:06:07,122 --> 01:06:09,643
So say that the body carbon reduction is green, 20%.

568
01:06:10,203 --> 01:06:11,284
So bigger green is good.

569
01:06:11,624 --> 01:06:13,885
Bigger green is better, yeah.

570
01:06:13,905 --> 01:06:15,366
But that's not, that's good.

571
01:06:15,446 --> 01:06:19,048
I went through use of sustainable materials, like certified wood.

572
01:06:19,588 --> 01:06:21,869
I guess I was confused by the carbon design.

573
01:06:37,232 --> 01:06:41,256
Other questions that we would want to be asking?

574
01:06:48,122 --> 01:07:01,334
And then I think, are there other questions that we feel like, that you're feeling like you would want to ask of all of the potential proposals?

575
01:07:09,398 --> 01:07:18,808
spend a lot of schedule on home training and self-education.

576
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:44,696
questions on behalf of your experience, because I know some call that out that they don't have experience doing that in their previous projects.

577
01:07:49,038 --> 01:07:49,298
John?

578
01:07:49,418 --> 01:07:56,021
My biggest thing that I do is about storage and places to put supplies and things of that nature.

579
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:18,985
Are there any questions online about either SMMA or maybe the field overall?

580
01:08:19,706 --> 01:08:21,446
Questions you'd want to be asking everybody?

581
01:08:21,466 --> 01:08:21,526
Yes.

582
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:33,012
Oh, I'm capturing them right now.

583
01:08:33,252 --> 01:08:33,952
I do have a question.

584
01:08:43,888 --> 01:08:44,468
Yeah, so.

585
01:09:06,498 --> 01:09:11,422
Oh, sorry, sorry about this, but how is parking need forecasted?

586
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:30,276
Is there anything in your design that would change the parking need, or is that like a... The question was from a parking need perspective, is that a formula, or how is that determined, and how does that integrate into their design?

587
01:09:32,465 --> 01:09:34,406
How does that get determined on these projects?

588
01:09:35,186 --> 01:09:38,188
A lot of it will just be through discussions.

589
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:43,350
They can go, we currently have what's desired.

590
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:44,650
And it's not working.

591
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:50,333
That way, they will have a specific number of ED spots that they have.

592
01:09:50,453 --> 01:09:52,174
And it's just a discussion.

593
01:09:59,942 --> 01:10:09,611
So yeah, there's no real MSBA won't say, like, no, you don't need that kind of money.

594
01:10:10,352 --> 01:10:10,712
Okay.

595
01:10:10,732 --> 01:10:12,053
Got it.

596
01:10:13,735 --> 01:10:18,499
Other questions for vendors?

597
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:19,540
Hello?

598
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,023
If you can identify the concepts, which

599
01:10:26,023 --> 01:10:32,969
which concepts would absolutely require blasting, and which would absolutely- Blasting?

600
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:33,630
Blasting.

601
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:34,250
Blasting.

602
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:36,212
I said blasting.

603
01:10:36,272 --> 01:10:39,855
I'm like, that's not a word I know.

604
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:48,002
I just remember there being some issues with- Oh yeah, there is.

605
01:10:48,022 --> 01:10:49,484
My bones rattle twice a day.

606
01:10:49,504 --> 01:10:53,107
So there are concepts that absolutely require blasting.

607
01:11:07,246 --> 01:11:16,468
Other questions?

608
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:27,571
One thing that's come up with this kind of difficulty in my office is that for towns that have adopted the stretch code, the MAP stretch code, sorry, energy code, it's been something I'll make sure they're engineering or ready for.

609
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:32,652
So, or they maybe need an extra consultant to help them navigate that.

610
01:11:33,173 --> 01:11:34,453
But it's pretty ambitious.

611
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:38,323
I think we're going to stop at this.

612
01:11:48,148 --> 01:11:48,569
Anything else?

613
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:55,052
All right, well, I think we have our work cut out for us.

614
01:11:56,973 --> 01:12:02,736
So the first designer selection panel meeting is next week, this Thursday.

615
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:09,679
And we will know once the meeting is over what our finalists are.

616
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:12,302
Is that correct?

617
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:23,212
And so we will let you all know what the outcome of that meeting is so that you're aware of what's coming next.

618
01:12:26,655 --> 01:12:28,657
And then on October 6, we will

619
01:12:30,294 --> 01:12:34,237
we'll interview and then we will know during that meeting who the selection is.

620
01:12:34,657 --> 01:12:37,319
Okay, we'll let you go to the top right corner.

621
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:39,020
Okay.

622
01:12:39,381 --> 01:12:40,922
So, are the interviews in person?

623
01:12:41,422 --> 01:12:41,902
Oh, sorry.

624
01:12:41,922 --> 01:12:44,264
So, are the interviews in person?

625
01:12:45,165 --> 01:12:46,146
Everything is virtual.

626
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:49,728
We can, as members of the public, we can join.

627
01:12:50,028 --> 01:12:52,530
We can request a link ahead of time.

628
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:53,871
We do, probably.

629
01:12:55,032 --> 01:12:58,975
We can collect a list if there's anybody who would like to participate.

630
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,081
they usually ask us in advance for that list.

631
01:13:05,123 --> 01:13:07,864
So we'll send out an email if you want that information.

632
01:13:10,346 --> 01:13:11,306
I did have one thing.

633
01:13:11,406 --> 01:13:12,227
Sure.

634
01:13:13,928 --> 01:13:19,071
Like you just said, the first DSV meeting on the 25th was on the 23rd originally.

635
01:13:19,712 --> 01:13:23,294
The MSDA did from the 23rd to the 25th.

636
01:13:23,874 --> 01:13:30,158
We had originally scheduled a committee meeting for the 23rd just to kind of sync up and talk

637
01:13:30,903 --> 01:13:39,226
the first CSPA, but that happened now that it's on the 22nd, so I don't think we necessarily need to be on the 24th.

638
01:13:39,386 --> 01:13:52,711
But I wanted to just let everybody know that there was a slight schedule change for the MSBA, so that meeting on the 24th will be on that same day.

639
01:13:59,776 --> 01:14:08,364
want to schedule that or just wait until the October meeting, which I think is quite late in the month, so I can maybe get that on the move.

640
01:14:08,985 --> 01:14:11,767
But I just wanted to kind of see what people saw.

641
01:14:11,828 --> 01:14:14,350
Maybe we see if we can look that up.

642
01:14:28,841 --> 01:14:29,941
send out an update.

643
01:14:29,961 --> 01:14:31,702
Is there a motion to adjourn?

644
01:14:31,802 --> 01:14:32,282
Second.

645
01:14:33,383 --> 01:14:33,503
Okay.

646
01:14:33,523 --> 01:14:36,684
I will call the roll.

647
01:14:38,285 --> 01:14:42,827
Jenny Graham, yes.

648
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:58,460
Yes.

649
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:58,640
Yes.

650
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:58,920
Yes.

651
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,380
Yes.

652
01:14:59,400 --> 01:14:59,480
Yes.

653
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:21,199
Joan Bowen.

654
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:21,660
