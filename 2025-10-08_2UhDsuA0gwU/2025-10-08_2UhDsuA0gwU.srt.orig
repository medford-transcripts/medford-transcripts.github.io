1
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:46,687
you

2
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:36,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's eat.

3
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:06,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, welcome.

4
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:07,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everybody.

5
00:23:07,682 --> 00:23:10,362
[SPEAKER_05]: We are here, sorry, hold on.

6
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:20,165
[SPEAKER_05]: We are here for the Public Health and Community Safety Committee meeting, October 8th, 630.

7
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:23,286
[SPEAKER_05]: We are here to discuss two items.

8
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:24,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to take

9
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:32,913
[SPEAKER_05]: the second item first, because we have some staff from the health department here to talk about it.

10
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:36,835
[SPEAKER_05]: 25-139, resolution to assist Medford residents in accessing social services.

11
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:47,260
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was a resolution, just makes me feel safer to have this closer to me.

12
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,662
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a resolution Councilor Sang and I put forward

13
00:23:53,282 --> 00:24:17,273
[SPEAKER_05]: just as a mechanism to speak about what resources are available to Medford residents who may be facing fewer social services because of cuts at the federal level, or possibly state level, depending on other cuts and how they trickle down.

14
00:24:17,894 --> 00:24:18,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So if,

15
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:27,799
[SPEAKER_05]: folks from the health department wouldn't mind coming up or actually well, I'll give counselors a chance to speak first.

16
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:35,981
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody has anything they'd like to discuss and counselor saying does and now I will remind myself how to work this system.

17
00:24:37,782 --> 00:24:46,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And Thank you.

18
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:47,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that worked.

19
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

20
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:50,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Chair Lozaro.

21
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Councilor Collins, hold on.

22
00:24:57,546 --> 00:25:07,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing that some people can't find the password to this.

23
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:13,453
[SPEAKER_05]: People are not being able to access the Zoom meeting.

24
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:15,814
[SPEAKER_05]: People can't find the password for the Zoom.

25
00:25:15,954 --> 00:25:16,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it on the...

26
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:24,724
[SPEAKER_06]: where can that be found if you're not in the chambers?

27
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:28,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the agenda.

28
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,867
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on the agenda.

29
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:30,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

30
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:31,708
[SPEAKER_05]: After the call-in number.

31
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:32,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

32
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:41,513
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the agenda for this committee meeting, there's listed written out is the Zoom link, and then it says call-in number.

33
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:44,875
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after the call-in number, it says star 744745.

34
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:52,739
[SPEAKER_05]: and that 744745 is the password.

35
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

36
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,101
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be the password for the Zoom.

37
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it seem like people are, like that is working?

38
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll communicate that to the person who texted me.

39
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:12,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I think going forward, we should find a place to make that more obvious.

40
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:13,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

41
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:13,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for the interruption.

42
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:14,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I would agree with you.

43
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:18,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I feel like in the past, we didn't have a password for the Zooms at all.

44
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:18,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

45
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:22,975
[SPEAKER_05]: When Zach had to change the- He had to change the permissions?

46
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:25,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Zoom and all that changed the permissions.

47
00:26:25,578 --> 00:26:25,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

48
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,520
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to work on this.

49
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,442
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually maybe something we should talk about in-

50
00:26:30,643 --> 00:26:37,970
[SPEAKER_05]: regular meetings or just administratively, but apologies to everybody who's having trouble accessing the Zoom.

51
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:42,334
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make sure everybody who wants to attend the meetings is able to attend them.

52
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:43,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sorry about that.

53
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Seng, are you ready to speak on that?

54
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:57,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have too much to say because I think you covered it.

55
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Chair Al-Azharo for sponsoring this with me.

56
00:27:02,432 --> 00:27:04,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the Health Department for showing up for this item.

57
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:14,626
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of residents are facing some real difficulties, especially with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, whatever it's called, thing.

58
00:27:15,787 --> 00:27:25,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cuts that they're making to the federal government's making, especially to Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA subsidies, which affect the Medicare exchange as well.

59
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:35,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just a chunk of the numerous cuts that have been made that have this trickle-down effect that

60
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,769
[SPEAKER_02]: that affect our residents locally.

61
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:53,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking that we could use this meeting as a way to really assess what the city is seeing on the ground and to ideate about ways that we could help out as a council, ways that City Hall can do more on this issue.

62
00:27:56,696 --> 00:27:57,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

63
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:57,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so

64
00:28:02,228 --> 00:28:09,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to invite our health department staff to talk about a few of the resources that are available.

65
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:15,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the health department does a lot for a lot of our residents that are especially vulnerable.

66
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:20,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And there may be some people that find their

67
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:24,166
[SPEAKER_05]: in a position of further vulnerability right now.

68
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:35,234
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have the director of the health department, Marianne O'Connor here, Catherine Dengra, who does outreach and I forget your title, I'm sorry.

69
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:35,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on up.

70
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:40,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jason Stone, who is our social services coordinator.

71
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:41,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Marianne.

72
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, let me turn on your mic.

73
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:46,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one is that?

74
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:48,183
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that one called?

75
00:28:50,785 --> 00:28:50,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Nine.

76
00:28:54,936 --> 00:28:55,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it have to?

77
00:28:55,477 --> 00:28:56,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you touch?

78
00:28:57,338 --> 00:29:01,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you touch the one with a little?

79
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:03,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it shows the person.

80
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

81
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:08,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good.

82
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:09,150
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, thank you.

83
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the resolution.

84
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:12,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for inviting us.

85
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:13,774
[SPEAKER_08]: We do support

86
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:23,101
[SPEAKER_08]: folks in Medford in a variety of ways, there's a variety of ways that they can reach out to us with any needs or concerns they have.

87
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:36,810
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the multilingual resource line that's manned, and if they can't speak English they can leave a message in their own language, and then we can have that interpreted and passed on to the appropriate person for service.

88
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:52,300
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do have Catherine and Jason with me here Catherine does an amazing amount of work in the Office of Prevention and Outreach, we have, as you are aware, the connectors and the liaisons, they each have kind of unique roles, but they all

89
00:29:53,301 --> 00:29:55,843
[SPEAKER_08]: are kind of our ears and eyes out into the community.

90
00:29:56,344 --> 00:30:03,369
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the ones bringing concerns back to us, letting us know what's going on, where gaps in services are, where needs are.

91
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:11,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Jason is constantly caring for and seeing folks from the City of Medford.

92
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:15,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, there's a variety of ways you can meet up with Jason.

93
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:16,800
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in the library.

94
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,461
[SPEAKER_08]: He's here.

95
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:29,131
[SPEAKER_08]: He has also gets referrals from the multi service multilingual resource line of folks a lot of times just walk into City Hall and asked to see Jason.

96
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:37,719
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean there's a beautiful presentation that Catherine actually just did this week for the kind of a summary of what all of the.

97
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:52,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Programs and services and events we've done over the last year with the connectors and liaison so be at your next meeting if you'd like to see that presentation, I think it's very eye opening and the amount of work that's being done and the outreach that's being done.

98
00:30:53,169 --> 00:31:00,573
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have our Hispanic day coming up this weekend festival on Saturday afternoon.

99
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:03,375
[SPEAKER_08]: from three to five.

100
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:18,615
[SPEAKER_08]: So but we've done Brazilian day we've done a winter preparedness last year, we've done back to school nights and bags and we're planning on doing winter preparedness again this November which was a huge success last year gave up coats and hats and

101
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:20,157
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of resources.

102
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:23,378
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm going to let them, and we have seen an uptick.

103
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:37,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, obviously, it's been very steady, but we have seen a slow but increase over the last several months in requests that are coming in, both through the multilingual resource line and just with the work that Jason is doing.

104
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:43,048
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see the calls that he's getting and the needs that are out there, basic needs, housing.

105
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:53,219
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's necessary so Catherine wants to start and give an overview of the connectors and their work and the liaisons and their work.

106
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Then if you have any questions at the end, we'll be happy to take them.

107
00:32:02,126 --> 00:32:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, good evening.

108
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:14,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, my name is Catherine Dingren I'm the manager of the Office of Outreach and Prevention, and I am fortunate enough to get to work with the community outreach team the Medford connects team.

109
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:22,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to talk a little bit about that team how they function, and how they are assisting our most vulnerable residents.

110
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:30,641
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really fortunate that the Medford connects program is funded through the MVP grant the bar foundation.

111
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:41,850
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is fully grant a fully grant funded initiative, and we are doing a lot of great work that a lot of people across the state are looking at on how we're supporting our residents.

112
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just gonna talk a little bit about how that functions.

113
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:57,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And really the Medford Connects team is not just our internal outreach team where consisting of our connectors and liaisons, but all of our city partners across the city.

114
00:32:57,802 --> 00:33:03,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So nonprofits, the libraries, the schools, people really doing this work.

115
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:08,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And we work in teams to collaborate and address problems that are coming across.

116
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:14,613
[SPEAKER_04]: our plate, a lot of which that are highlighted by, as Marion said, our connectors and liaisons.

117
00:33:14,753 --> 00:33:18,816
[SPEAKER_04]: We see this happening, so we bring that to the team and say, how can we address this?

118
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:27,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So as everyone knows, you probably have seen those blue flyers that have our connectors and liaisons on them.

119
00:33:28,021 --> 00:33:34,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a team of 12, no, yeah, 12 connectors and liaisons.

120
00:33:34,906 --> 00:33:48,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And really the idea is they're building resilience and equity through collaboration, and they have their connector themes and language themes, and our city partners as I said play a vital role.

121
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:58,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So the goal is twofold, to expand and strengthen supportive services for residents and to nurture and grow our community networks.

122
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:01,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like we're doing a really good job of that.

123
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will also send you our Medford Conducts newsletter so you can see some of that work.

124
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:25,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in the last three months alone we've served over 1000 residents, so not just with large scale events like the Brazilian day but through one on one enrolling people in mass health, connecting people to Jason our social services coordinator our liaisons and connectors

125
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:26,477
[SPEAKER_04]: love Jason.

126
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:32,701
[SPEAKER_04]: He works really closely with them and problem solving through simple cases and complicated cases.

127
00:34:33,702 --> 00:34:35,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've really increased our collaborations.

128
00:34:35,803 --> 00:34:39,626
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always looking at different organizations that we can partner with.

129
00:34:39,726 --> 00:34:44,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So recently we realized we wanted to expand more with the AAPI community.

130
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:48,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So we partnered with Greater Malden Asian American Community Coalition.

131
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:49,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're a partner of ours.

132
00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:55,856
[SPEAKER_04]: They help us with translations they're helping us bridge those connections so we're building those partnerships, all the time.

133
00:34:56,716 --> 00:35:04,080
[SPEAKER_04]: So our connectors we have six of those and they work within six different themes so we have an immigrant support and ESL.

134
00:35:05,424 --> 00:35:19,881
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an older adults and disability connector we have a team in young families connector we have a financial security connector, a food systems connector and climate equity connector so those are our six connectors.

135
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:29,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have our six language-based community liaisons.

136
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:45,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to give you a highlight of, I'm just gonna show one thing that each connector is doing to give you a sense of the different things, well, maybe two things, but like our financial security connector is really looking at how do we build the capacity of our residents to, you know, cause that's what everyone's struggling with.

137
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:47,120
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I pay for my groceries?

138
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,341
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I pay for my rent?

139
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:54,435
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're doing things like the other night we hosted the library, a pop-up admissions event with Bunker Hill.

140
00:35:54,796 --> 00:35:58,859
[SPEAKER_04]: We had it translated in multiple language or interpreted in multiple languages.

141
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:03,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really to connect people to education and opportunities.

142
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:12,048
[SPEAKER_04]: We've hosted financial literacy workshops that were very well attended and we've done a lot of collaboration with local businesses.

143
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:17,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're working closely with our economic and development office to build those strategies.

144
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:21,248
[SPEAKER_04]: our ESOL and immigrant support.

145
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:28,095
[SPEAKER_04]: That is really another place where we see our community connectors, our community partner agencies coming together.

146
00:36:28,175 --> 00:36:40,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So those meetings consist of the schools, the libraries, the Welcome Project, the Housing Authority, several different organizations that are providing ESOL classes, where we're taking a look at

147
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:55,112
[SPEAKER_04]: where are the gaps in services, where are their wait lists, and people can call the multilingual line and get connected to an ESOL class, because we know the higher English capacity someone has, the higher chance they are to get a job and build that financial security.

148
00:36:55,212 --> 00:37:03,575
[SPEAKER_04]: So those meetings we just had one this morning are wonderful, and we're doing great work with the connections there.

149
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:20,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Our older adult connector is doing a lot of great things she's developing a are you okay program where we have younger seniors who are going to be checking in on older seniors who are homebound a lot of them through our housing authority and things like that because we know that that's a

150
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:24,506
[SPEAKER_04]: huge driver of health inequalities is social isolation.

151
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:26,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're figuring out strategies to that.

152
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:36,894
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working with the senior center to rebrand the senior center so more diverse people see the senior center as a place that they want to go to.

153
00:37:37,295 --> 00:37:42,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also looking at bringing younger seniors there because we did an assessment of what people perceived at the senior center.

154
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:46,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been great and stay tuned for our launching.

155
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,242
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have billboards and all sorts of things.

156
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:53,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have our food systems connector.

157
00:37:53,425 --> 00:38:02,670
[SPEAKER_04]: They host a meeting of all of our different food partners in the area between the Mystic Market and all the different food security.

158
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're talking about where are the gaps?

159
00:38:06,873 --> 00:38:08,854
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we seeing at the local pantries?

160
00:38:08,994 --> 00:38:10,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are the barriers?

161
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:15,418
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're talking with the team to figure out, do we need to get things translated?

162
00:38:15,478 --> 00:38:17,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we need to break down some of the myths?

163
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,207
[SPEAKER_04]: interpreting what are the cuts at the state level and how they're impacting our residents' pockets.

164
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:33,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're, you know, and we're trying to promote things like the YMCA's Mystic Market has new food lockers that are available so people don't feel safe going to the

165
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:36,279
[SPEAKER_04]: they could, you know, go to the locker.

166
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:42,764
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are lots of great options for our people, and we're really trying to communicate where the gaps are.

167
00:38:42,784 --> 00:38:46,507
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do food deliveries to homebound and lots of other things.

168
00:38:46,627 --> 00:39:00,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have our climate resilience initiatives where our climate connector is working on things with seniors, things with students, and really looking at, because we know climate events impact our most vulnerable first.

169
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:01,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at,

170
00:39:01,979 --> 00:39:08,176
[SPEAKER_04]: all the recent climate events that have happened over the country, most vulnerable, are most deeply impacted.

171
00:39:08,277 --> 00:39:09,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're doing a lot there.

172
00:39:10,536 --> 00:39:20,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And then our family and youth engagement connector is doing things from working with the PTOs to get more parents involved in the PTOs and supports the PTOs.

173
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:32,566
[SPEAKER_04]: We heard from the schools that a lot of people needed backpacks and haircuts and stuff so that we hosted a back to school event here where people got free school supplies got haircuts, we had well over 200

174
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:37,433
[SPEAKER_04]: people come through and get connected to resources.

175
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:46,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's another one where Head for Family Network, the public schools, we all come together and we work to identify challenges and come up with strategies.

176
00:39:48,711 --> 00:40:03,070
[SPEAKER_04]: We, and also the other great thing we do with the clerk's office is our welcome baby initiative where people come into the clerk's office to get a birth certificate, and then they're directed upstairs to our office where they get a bag of

177
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:20,067
[SPEAKER_04]: of free supplies and diapers and then they also get resources from here's where the wake offices here are some postpartum resources here's where the Medford family network is here's where the moon and back bookstore is so it's great resources that we connect people to.

178
00:40:21,232 --> 00:40:35,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And then switching over to our liaisons, they are language-based liaisons, so we have Arabic, English-speaking BIPOC, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, our relationship with GMAC, and Haitian Creole.

179
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:42,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And those liaisons support the work of the connectors, but they're doing the one-on-one work with residents.

180
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:43,037
[SPEAKER_04]: They might be

181
00:40:44,437 --> 00:40:46,398
[SPEAKER_04]: having open hours at the library.

182
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:51,221
[SPEAKER_04]: They might be doing here at City Hall doing mass health applications.

183
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:54,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really working one-on-one with residents.

184
00:40:54,243 --> 00:41:02,929
[SPEAKER_04]: They're often teaming up with Jason or our recovery coach Chris to assist residents who call the multilingual line or need other help.

185
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:05,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're also kind of telling the whole group of connectors and

186
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:11,054
[SPEAKER_04]: and all of our city partners, here's what we're hearing, here's what we need more of.

187
00:41:11,154 --> 00:41:13,976
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really kind of coming together to strategize.

188
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So our liaisons do great things.

189
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:25,304
[SPEAKER_04]: We have great, Stacy, our connector works with the West Medford Community Center and we host the cultural events.

190
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:32,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we have this coming up this Saturday where we have our Hispanic cultural event where people feel like the city really welcomes, you know,

191
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,913
[SPEAKER_04]: all cultures and that they get connected to resources that are cultural specific.

192
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:40,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is something that we do.

193
00:41:40,695 --> 00:41:43,237
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're looking at health equity issues too.

194
00:41:44,577 --> 00:41:47,379
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really proud of the work that we're doing.

195
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:52,623
[SPEAKER_04]: We're constantly looking to hear ideas from the community on what could work next.

196
00:41:53,003 --> 00:41:59,907
[SPEAKER_04]: So upcoming on the horizon, as Marianne said, our winter preparedness event, we're working with Mass Hire to do some pop-up

197
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:05,189
[SPEAKER_04]: job fairs and job application sessions.

198
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:08,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot more on the horizon.

199
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:13,070
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to turn it over to Jason who can talk about the great work he does.

200
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:15,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

201
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:20,912
[SPEAKER_05]: One quick question about the event that's coming up on Saturday, the Hispanic Heritage event.

202
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:21,672
[SPEAKER_05]: What time is that?

203
00:42:22,232 --> 00:42:25,633
[SPEAKER_04]: That is from three to five, right here at City Hall.

204
00:42:25,653 --> 00:42:25,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

205
00:42:26,624 --> 00:42:28,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it outside or is it in the chambers?

206
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:30,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside, because October, we weren't sure.

207
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:31,167
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

208
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:32,007
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

209
00:42:32,227 --> 00:42:32,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

210
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:38,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

211
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason Stone, social services coordinator here at City Hall.

212
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:44,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have gone first, because I can't follow that.

213
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:54,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's easiest to start maybe by having you guys ask what you want to know about my position, and then I can kind of narrow down from there.

214
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:57,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you being here.

215
00:42:58,004 --> 00:43:05,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that your work is dependent on who comes to you and what they're looking for.

216
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:17,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you could give us a little summary of a typical day and why you host office hours at the library and why somebody might end up

217
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:19,585
[SPEAKER_05]: coming to you.

218
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:20,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

219
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:26,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Every day is a little bit different, which is one of the things that I love about being centrally located in City Hall.

220
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:30,384
[SPEAKER_03]: The office hours at the library started

221
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:39,695
[SPEAKER_03]: My predecessor here at City Hall in this position did office hours at the library for a while, and it seemed like a great idea.

222
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:44,898
[SPEAKER_03]: As accessible as I think City Hall is, sometimes some people just feel comfortable being at the library.

223
00:43:44,938 --> 00:43:46,059
[SPEAKER_03]: They're familiar with the library.

224
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:59,948
[SPEAKER_03]: They might be using the library for resources anyway, and we were finding that the research staff, the reference staff at the library, were getting a lot of inquiries from people that they didn't necessarily know how to handle.

225
00:43:59,968 --> 00:44:01,609
[SPEAKER_03]: They can help people research things, but

226
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:07,953
[SPEAKER_03]: as they're not social service trained or social workers, they didn't necessarily know where to ask them.

227
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:17,760
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do office hours at the library every Wednesday, 10 to 12, study room one, which is the one on the left, and every day is a little bit different.

228
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It took a while, I think, to get people used to the fact that I was there,

229
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,941
[SPEAKER_03]: But I stay pretty busy when I'm down there now.

230
00:44:27,161 --> 00:44:32,262
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of what I encounter there is requests for housing.

231
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:42,526
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the inquiries that I get from residents in general are housing related because of the cost of housing, because of falling behind in rent, because of falling behind in utilities.

232
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:50,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have accessed services that are available for financial assistance for those programs previously.

233
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:54,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them didn't know that there were financial assistance programs available.

234
00:44:56,499 --> 00:44:59,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we do a lot of problem solving with how to help people

235
00:45:00,343 --> 00:45:01,044
[SPEAKER_03]: fill in the gaps.

236
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:08,269
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a lot of, I would say, behavioral health questions come up recently.

237
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,774
[SPEAKER_03]: We obviously have three great, well now two great clinicians at the Medford Police Department.

238
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:25,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously sometimes people don't want to necessarily go to the police department or reach out to a clinician at the police department, so sometimes they'll reach out here and then we'll collaborate amongst ourselves.

239
00:45:26,944 --> 00:45:34,912
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of what will come up now and has started to come up already is heating assistance applications.

240
00:45:35,352 --> 00:45:39,356
[SPEAKER_03]: The federal heating assistance season for where we live opens November 1st.

241
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,557
[SPEAKER_03]: The application portal opened October 1st.

242
00:45:42,759 --> 00:45:44,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We partner with ABCD.

243
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,424
[SPEAKER_03]: We fall under their catchment, ABCD out of Malden, for fuel assistance.

244
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:55,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Their portal is live and it can be cumbersome to navigate if you have never navigated it before.

245
00:45:55,847 --> 00:46:02,649
[SPEAKER_03]: The ABCD staff are very welcoming to our folks, but some of our folks don't want to go to Malden, they'd rather come here.

246
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:07,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've done a couple of heating assistance applications.

247
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:13,479
[SPEAKER_03]: already this season and the application portal opened October 1, so I expect that there will be a lot more of that to come.

248
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:25,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Charbel, who's one of our, the Medford Connects team members as well, did office hours at the library on Saturdays through last heating season as well, so if people are only available on weekends.

249
00:46:26,755 --> 00:46:35,889
[SPEAKER_03]: They could meet with Charbel at the library on Saturdays, it sounds like we're probably going to do that again we haven't solidified the schedule yet, but he's open to it the library is open to it.

250
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is hugely, hugely beneficial.

251
00:46:41,697 --> 00:46:50,284
[SPEAKER_03]: a large number of the individuals that come to my office, as I mentioned before, are behind on a lot of bills.

252
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:53,466
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some that there aren't financial assistance programs out there for.

253
00:46:54,106 --> 00:47:02,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, there are ways to access through National Grid and through ABCD funding to help make up the gaps, at least.

254
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:07,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could go through a list of examples of cases.

255
00:47:11,356 --> 00:47:37,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you mind if I ask, when people come looking for assistance with housing, I know that Medford doesn't have an office of housing stability and do you, that ends up falling to the health department and housing is a healthcare issue because lack of it results in healthcare outcomes and it's a basic,

256
00:47:39,394 --> 00:47:42,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Shelter is a basic requirement for your health.

257
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:50,691
[SPEAKER_05]: But what sort of resources are you able to connect Medford residents to?

258
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:54,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it all non-profit or is it external to Medford?

259
00:47:55,353 --> 00:48:02,659
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have the best luck with is collaborating with other community agencies, nonprofits, particularly housing families and ABCD.

260
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:14,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Housing families runs, their legal staff runs a housing task force every Monday that I meet with, my counterpart in Malden meets with.

261
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:15,990
[SPEAKER_03]: They have staff attorneys there.

262
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,913
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the outreach teams from ABCD are there.

263
00:48:19,353 --> 00:48:33,345
[SPEAKER_03]: The housing advocates from ABCD are there and anybody from the communities, Malden Medford, they do take some Everett but it's usually Malden Medford, can present cases there and we sort of triage them.

264
00:48:34,466 --> 00:48:41,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's folks who need rental assistance, sometimes it's folks who need legal representation because they're low income and they're being evicted.

265
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:51,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we try to, between myself and the two agencies, sort of collaborate on how to best triage those cases.

266
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:55,418
[SPEAKER_03]: There are legal aids available through Housing Families.

267
00:48:56,399 --> 00:48:59,800
[SPEAKER_03]: There is rental assistance available through ABCD.

268
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:05,543
[SPEAKER_03]: There are housing workshops available in now English and Haitian Creole at ABCD in Malden.

269
00:49:06,703 --> 00:49:10,125
[SPEAKER_03]: So between myself and then the two partner agencies,

270
00:49:10,665 --> 00:49:12,526
[SPEAKER_03]: were able to triage a lot of cases.

271
00:49:12,926 --> 00:49:19,608
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say that that task force has seen a tremendous uptick in cases in the last, let's say, four months.

272
00:49:20,848 --> 00:49:27,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Where there were weeks where we would have one or two cases, I think this Monday we had like 12 new cases.

273
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that's just for Malden-Medford.

274
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:31,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's mostly folks who are

275
00:49:32,898 --> 00:49:38,743
[SPEAKER_03]: In the early processes of being evicted, usually, sometimes they've gotten notices to quit.

276
00:49:38,783 --> 00:49:39,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they haven't.

277
00:49:39,663 --> 00:49:40,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they've got court dates.

278
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:41,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they haven't.

279
00:49:43,386 --> 00:49:49,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, for whatever reason, they won't be able to go back to the place that they've been living, so they need to find a new place.

280
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:54,475
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've got kids in the local schools here, so that certainly adds an extra wrinkle to it.

281
00:49:55,136 --> 00:49:58,678
[SPEAKER_03]: So between us, we try to triage those cases

282
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:07,227
[SPEAKER_03]: help them access the emergency assistance through DTA, the emergency assistance housing when possible.

283
00:50:09,028 --> 00:50:13,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks find that system tricky to navigate on their own, so we help them as best we can.

284
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:23,635
[SPEAKER_03]: did an application with an individual yesterday over the phone with the DTA office because she just doesn't have luck going in in person, and that can happen sometimes.

285
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:33,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And some folks aren't very comfortable using the computer to do those applications, so we'll use mine, or we'll sit down together at the library and walk through an application that way.

286
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:42,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do a lot of, I try to tell folks that I am not your counselor and or therapist and or like clinical social worker.

287
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:45,963
[SPEAKER_03]: It is my goal to help you do those things but not to do them for you.

288
00:50:46,403 --> 00:50:52,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'll do them with you and Chris sort of has this mentality and this approach to his recovery cases too.

289
00:50:52,364 --> 00:50:56,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris Zuma, our recovery coach, is like we'll do the work with you but we're not going to do it for you.

290
00:50:56,965 --> 00:50:57,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we'll walk

291
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:02,507
[SPEAKER_03]: side-by-side with you and help you to the finish line, but you'll be the one to cross the finish line.

292
00:51:03,508 --> 00:51:08,851
[SPEAKER_03]: So I try to instill upon people that I'll do these things with you.

293
00:51:09,991 --> 00:51:12,332
[SPEAKER_03]: You might not have a scanner, so sure, come to my office.

294
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:19,956
[SPEAKER_03]: You can scan your paperwork here, upload it to whatever assistance portal it is that you're trying to upload to, and do it that way.

295
00:51:21,377 --> 00:51:26,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Because those things are only sustainable if people know how to access them, if people feel comfortable accessing them.

296
00:51:29,562 --> 00:51:40,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if there is something like a one pager or if there is a simple sort of direct

297
00:51:41,867 --> 00:52:04,645
[SPEAKER_05]: visual aid or a pathway online where if somebody needed what's the best way for people to find out how to access resources that the city can offer or just where to find out about what the health department is doing to help people who may need to find out about what you're doing.

298
00:52:04,945 --> 00:52:08,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the health department will have an updated website.

299
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:13,232
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that now exists is a little cumbersome to navigate.

300
00:52:13,352 --> 00:52:29,386
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a new website through the city's website, but the health department will have its own updated website that will be much more streamlined, much easier to find a lot of this information and find who to contact for whichever information.

301
00:52:29,466 --> 00:52:31,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So it does exist in theory online right now.

302
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:40,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I tend to tell folks that the easiest way is to either call me or call the multi-language resource line and we'll get you to whoever you need to be connected to.

303
00:52:41,335 --> 00:52:42,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

304
00:52:42,795 --> 00:52:49,356
[SPEAKER_05]: One other question that I have is, what was it?

305
00:52:50,656 --> 00:52:54,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about, it's gone.

306
00:52:56,417 --> 00:53:00,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Do counselors have questions for Jason while he is up here?

307
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:02,834
[SPEAKER_05]: What was my question?

308
00:53:02,874 --> 00:53:03,575
[SPEAKER_05]: It was good.

309
00:53:03,595 --> 00:53:06,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't remember.

310
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:08,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sang, one second.

311
00:53:10,465 --> 00:53:10,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

312
00:53:10,765 --> 00:53:15,987
[SPEAKER_02]: These questions aren't necessarily for Jason, but you might know some things about them.

313
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:19,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And if Marianne or Catherine want to fill in, feel free to.

314
00:53:21,488 --> 00:53:31,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've touched upon some of these already, but I was wondering what kind of services are most in demand from us right now in City Hall?

315
00:53:32,271 --> 00:53:35,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And going along hand in hand with that question, what kind of issues?

316
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:37,993
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned housing and heating assistance.

317
00:53:39,613 --> 00:53:44,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any really popular areas of need that we're seeing from residents?

318
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:47,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass health is always a huge one.

319
00:53:48,897 --> 00:53:58,642
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're here, our liaison, Maralea Barroso, she's here every Monday and every Wednesday doing walk-in mass health applications.

320
00:53:59,342 --> 00:54:01,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And she is always busy.

321
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:05,184
[SPEAKER_03]: She is never not usually backed up with one or two people waiting for her.

322
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:11,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I am also a MassHealth application counselor, so I can certainly do them in a pinch.

323
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:19,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Maralea knows that system inside and out, so it's easier usually for her to do them rather than to have me fumble through it.

324
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:27,903
[SPEAKER_03]: So MassHealth is always, and especially with open enrollments coming up, MassHealth is always going to be a popular one.

325
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:32,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Food insecurity is also another one, like trying to do SNAP applications.

326
00:54:36,063 --> 00:54:38,906
[SPEAKER_03]: probably second to Mass Health.

327
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are easy enough to do.

328
00:54:40,668 --> 00:54:43,290
[SPEAKER_03]: The DTA system is easy enough to navigate.

329
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:51,718
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you've never navigated it before, and your only other experience is going to the office, some people are put off by that.

330
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,324
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll come and seek out our services, my services.

331
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:15,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, health insurance, food security assistance, and housing, like the milieu of things that are housing, like the umbrella of things that are housing, whether it's like rental assistance or eviction or finding a new place to live.

332
00:55:15,805 --> 00:55:18,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are probably one, two, and three anyway.

333
00:55:20,249 --> 00:55:23,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's certainly been an uptick, I would say.

334
00:55:23,951 --> 00:55:35,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's an uptick in people being nervous about what's going to happen with those services if they've already got them, whether it's Medicare or MassHealth or SNAP benefits.

335
00:55:36,998 --> 00:55:45,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And we share a lot of those same anxieties that they do, because, I mean, truth be told, we just don't know yet how things are going to shake up.

336
00:55:46,085 --> 00:55:51,149
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we just sort of proceed as we have proceeded until told otherwise.

337
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll still do the same SNAP applications.

338
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:58,094
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll still do the same MassHealth applications, because those systems haven't necessarily changed yet.

339
00:55:58,574 --> 00:56:00,696
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that we're waiting for the other shoe to drop.

340
00:56:03,596 --> 00:56:04,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that answered the question.

341
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:06,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's very helpful.

342
00:56:06,918 --> 00:56:15,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, um, this is kind of echoing chair was our last point about the one pagers and the FAQ sheets.

343
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:18,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I've had some constituents years ago reach out.

344
00:56:20,108 --> 00:56:21,089
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't speak English.

345
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:31,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really helpful to have the, I think it was a housing stability notification ordinance one sheet, or two, I think it was a two-pager.

346
00:56:32,817 --> 00:56:35,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It was already translated into Chinese so they could use it.

347
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:43,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was easy, it was really helpful for us to have resources like that to point to constituents, to hand to constituents.

348
00:56:43,945 --> 00:56:47,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I also know there are a lot of folks who kind of just inquire online.

349
00:56:47,728 --> 00:56:50,210
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they go online and they look

350
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:52,803
[SPEAKER_02]: out what's available there, and then they kind of stop.

351
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:58,886
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's nothing that's easily accessible, they won't even really reach out to us.

352
00:56:58,986 --> 00:57:03,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes we meet them on the doors or at community events, and they'll ask us in person.

353
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:08,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, I just wanted to lend my voice and support for that idea.

354
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:17,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's also a bigger effort than just you guys, because it requires updating the city website, making those things more prominent as well.

355
00:57:17,215 --> 00:57:18,715
[SPEAKER_02]: But just food for thought.

356
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:39,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Catherine mentioned, and feel free to chime in too, gaps that might exist in city services right now, things that we could do more on, reaching out to community members, hearing back from them about, you know, what gaps we need to fill essentially.

357
00:57:39,085 --> 00:57:43,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering what those gaps were from your perspective as city staff.

358
00:57:46,725 --> 00:57:59,686
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interesting question to answer, because so many of the resources that are available are state or regional and they're not Medford specific right so for folks to access Social Security for folks to access.

359
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:06,354
[SPEAKER_03]: mass health for folks to access SNAP benefits.

360
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:12,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless they are computer savvy, they're not physically going to a place to access those services here.

361
00:58:12,782 --> 00:58:16,586
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to go to Malden, they have to go into the city, they have to go to Chelsea, etc., etc.

362
00:58:16,987 --> 00:58:19,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's tough to sort of

363
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:35,621
[SPEAKER_03]: frame what the actual gaps in those services are, aside from, I mean, we can have the discussion about affordable housing, like that, like, obviously, if we had a lot more affordable housing, then there would be a lot more affordable housing available for people who are having housing crises.

364
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:43,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And so taking that part sort of out of this conversation, like the services that are available

365
00:58:45,172 --> 00:58:49,734
[SPEAKER_03]: we're really just sort of coaching them through how to access them in a different community.

366
00:58:50,575 --> 00:58:53,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Streamlining the services, providing transportation if we need to.

367
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:57,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Transportation is always a barrier for some of our folks.

368
00:58:57,798 --> 00:59:06,162
[SPEAKER_03]: For recovery purposes, we try to do things so that they can get transportation to recovery groups, to recovery centers, to detoxes, et cetera, et cetera.

369
00:59:06,723 --> 00:59:10,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to sort of extrapolate that on the whole, like some of the community development block grant funding

370
00:59:11,745 --> 00:59:19,971
[SPEAKER_03]: is used to help some of our folks get transportation to the services that don't exist in Medford specifically, but that are still theirs to access.

371
00:59:22,652 --> 00:59:29,517
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, we're not ever going to have a system where everybody accesses all of those services in their own community.

372
00:59:29,777 --> 00:59:31,559
[SPEAKER_03]: You're always going to have to go somewhere.

373
00:59:31,579 --> 00:59:39,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I don't necessarily know outside of the obvious affordable housing and affordable health care.

374
00:59:40,105 --> 00:59:45,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of those things, it's tough to sort of pin down what the gaps are.

375
00:59:50,112 --> 00:59:55,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I only know what is in front of me and who comes to my door and into my email into my phone.

376
00:59:55,515 --> 01:00:12,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So certainly hearing from like, if folks from the outreach teams, from the liaisons and the connectors, as they hear about, Hey, there should be X, Y, and Z service, then like that prompts that discussion as it would, if we heard from city council about, Hey, is there a service for X, Y, and Z?

377
01:00:12,184 --> 01:00:17,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, but I don't necessarily know because I haven't been asked the question yet a lot.

378
01:00:19,455 --> 01:00:21,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did you have a follow up?

379
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,561
[SPEAKER_02]: No, go ahead.

380
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:27,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I think that makes a lot of sense.

381
01:00:28,204 --> 01:00:28,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

382
01:00:29,772 --> 01:00:32,833
[SPEAKER_02]: municipalities are constrained in what they can offer.

383
01:00:33,993 --> 01:00:37,394
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's helpful to know that there's a lot of that.

384
01:00:37,414 --> 01:00:43,296
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned transportation, and I was wondering if you guys have been in contact with the transportation working group.

385
01:00:43,836 --> 01:00:46,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a working group in City Hall on it.

386
01:00:46,617 --> 01:00:51,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I was involved in it really early on, but I've kind of run out of time to work with them on it.

387
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:57,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, some combination of myself and Catherine and Marianne have been involved in that.

388
01:00:58,163 --> 01:00:59,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, great.

389
01:00:59,764 --> 01:01:16,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I guess, maybe this is maybe more of a question for Marianne but I was wondering what we can do as a city council to make sure that you guys have the support you need to carry out these services that in helping the residents.

390
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:18,439
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk.

391
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be curious about a future budget, you know what, what

392
01:01:22,201 --> 01:01:24,843
[SPEAKER_02]: we could help with in terms of advocating.

393
01:01:26,584 --> 01:01:33,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Also any policy changes, things that we could do, ways that we could help you reach out and communicate to constituents as well.

394
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:36,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Very broad bucket of questions, but yeah.

395
01:01:36,871 --> 01:01:38,772
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually was the question I couldn't remember.

396
01:01:41,014 --> 01:01:43,556
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate Councilor Sang bringing that up.

397
01:01:43,596 --> 01:01:49,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, like how, what sort of support can we offer to either get the message out to residents or

398
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:58,223
[SPEAKER_05]: amplify your work or back up the kind of things that you're doing?

399
01:01:58,263 --> 01:02:10,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've been talking about an Office of Housing Stability for a few years, but that would require a lot more larger scale changes and budget maneuvering.

400
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:18,357
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the meantime, what kind of support can we bring to the table?

401
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that might be a Marianne and Catherine question.

402
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I approach these things always as the micro.

403
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:29,979
[SPEAKER_03]: So I work individually with people where they're at, at their houses, encampments, et cetera, et cetera.

404
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:37,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm much more comfortable being on the ground doing the micro and have no real conception of the macro.

405
01:02:37,807 --> 01:02:38,507
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll back up.

406
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:42,290
[SPEAKER_08]: They said it's amazing.

407
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:48,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, you know, just having us here this evening to talk about this and and putting it out there.

408
01:02:52,499 --> 01:03:00,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Really getting the word out that we do do this work, we have this here in Medford and like Jason said the problem is Medford is basically a social service desert.

409
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:05,411
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have people, WIC is in here, you know, they're not here, so people have to travel.

410
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:15,319
[SPEAKER_08]: So, in making that easier for folks by hopefully you know as being able to intervene somewhat or help them with transportation or get them where they need to go.

411
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think just echoing that right now this is totally grant funded.

412
01:03:19,844 --> 01:03:22,066
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't have to worry about that for a couple of years.

413
01:03:22,946 --> 01:03:28,612
[SPEAKER_08]: But who knows if we don't get refunded and who knows where funding is going to go in the next few years anyways.

414
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:36,899
[SPEAKER_08]: That will be something to talk about at a later date as far as, you know, sustainability of what we're doing.

415
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:51,953
[SPEAKER_08]: But I really just getting out there getting the word out there and I love the idea of flies we are working on a food security file of similar to what you talked about that will have every location I was data, how when we're.

416
01:03:53,353 --> 01:03:56,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe doing that for some of the other services.

417
01:03:56,554 --> 01:04:19,320
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a nice fly with Jason and Christmas based on it too we could, you know, maybe get that out there more at the new website will be helpful but like you said a lot of people on computer savvy so just getting it out there and if you have community events or if you're in the area like helping push this out for us because we are doing the work and I and people really need it so yeah, thank you.

418
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:24,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, is all of the work that you've described tonight funded by private grants?

419
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:27,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Jason is on city budget.

420
01:04:28,258 --> 01:04:28,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

421
01:04:28,859 --> 01:04:38,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Catherine's on city budget, but the liaisons, the connectors, the programming and the work that we do is all funded through grant MVP.

422
01:04:40,128 --> 01:04:41,269
[SPEAKER_05]: So, right.

423
01:04:42,149 --> 01:04:53,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not, they're not in the budget of the city, not in any of the community liaisons, the connectors, all of the fuel assistance work that you mentioned the food.

424
01:04:56,717 --> 01:05:04,364
[SPEAKER_08]: support like so the fuel assistance is just the work that Jason and, you know, as far as again helping with applications, we don't.

425
01:05:04,765 --> 01:05:05,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

426
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:12,011
[SPEAKER_08]: But, but yeah, the, the work with the community partners and stuff this all into the MVP.

427
01:05:12,732 --> 01:05:26,875
[SPEAKER_08]: It's how this whole thing was born through this grant idea, the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Grant, through the state, who they really like the work we're doing and asking us to help them duplicate some of this work across the state.

428
01:05:27,096 --> 01:05:31,437
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is substantial funding that we have because of the work we're doing.

429
01:05:31,497 --> 01:05:33,857
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that's because it's innovative.

430
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:35,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's and it's unique.

431
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:39,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's important to note, I think that

432
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:42,780
[SPEAKER_05]: not everybody does it that way.

433
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And also that you noticed that it was something that we really needed.

434
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:53,749
[SPEAKER_05]: We needed to be able to connect people because we don't have a lot of that available in Medford already.

435
01:05:56,051 --> 01:06:06,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing I want to mention is that there are ways to build up accessibility of social services in a community that

436
01:06:06,687 --> 01:06:36,120
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't exactly what we do, but as like an extension of things that we can do, like making changes to our zoning code, making it easier to have commercial development in different parts of the city, making it easier to build affordable housing in different parts of the city, all of that can relieve some of the pressure on vulnerable populations that are currently, when support systems like what

437
01:06:36,631 --> 01:06:46,138
[SPEAKER_05]: we describe in this resolution start to fall apart and are not guaranteed, we can change some of those things.

438
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:52,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And restrictive zoning codes make it a lot harder.

439
01:06:52,703 --> 01:06:57,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the reasons why that strategy was being deployed.

440
01:07:00,788 --> 01:07:01,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a note.

441
01:07:02,542 --> 01:07:03,322
[SPEAKER_05]: point of information.

442
01:07:03,342 --> 01:07:07,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, does anybody else have anything they'd like to add?

443
01:07:07,445 --> 01:07:08,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor saying?

444
01:07:08,165 --> 01:07:10,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I number one.

445
01:07:10,306 --> 01:07:12,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really, really want to underscore what you just said.

446
01:07:13,247 --> 01:07:27,055
[SPEAKER_02]: That a lot of the work that we can do as a city council to address the big issues that we've been talking about tonight, especially with housing come through these other reforms that Aren't necessarily discussed it in this committee.

447
01:07:27,855 --> 01:07:30,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that happened in other city council committees and other efforts.

448
01:07:31,457 --> 01:07:31,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Um

449
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:37,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and in zoning reform, housing reform really is that big ticket item.

450
01:07:37,854 --> 01:07:42,976
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to solve everything, but it's going to make a huge dent in helping our residents.

451
01:07:44,116 --> 01:07:47,078
[SPEAKER_02]: But back to questions, just a few short questions.

452
01:07:47,098 --> 01:07:48,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know when the MVP grant runs out?

453
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:50,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Next year.

454
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,520
[SPEAKER_08]: We have another year with it.

455
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,220
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

456
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any sense of whether that grant is going to continue?

457
01:07:57,802 --> 01:07:58,602
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to reapply.

458
01:07:59,511 --> 01:08:02,155
[SPEAKER_08]: there is another round opening, so we will be reapplying.

459
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

460
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:09,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess the... Now it's my turn for something to slip my mind.

461
01:08:09,864 --> 01:08:14,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Vice President Collins has another comment.

462
01:08:17,577 --> 01:08:18,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

463
01:08:18,197 --> 01:08:26,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just a note because Councillor Seng and Chair Lazaro have addressed many of the questions that are on my mind tonight.

464
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I think we're getting static.

465
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:27,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

466
01:08:31,002 --> 01:08:32,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Really appreciate this discussion.

467
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:37,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, I couldn't thank you three and your team enough for the work that you do every day for our community.

468
01:08:38,004 --> 01:08:38,824
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.

469
01:08:38,844 --> 01:08:46,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I really love meetings like this where we get to Zoom out and hear about everything that you do on a truly day-to-day basis because it is so striking.

470
01:08:47,847 --> 01:08:54,869
[SPEAKER_06]: just how much you were able to help the community members in Medford with truly a very small and scrappy team.

471
01:08:54,929 --> 01:09:13,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And my greatest wish would be able to clone each and every one of you, but it really does lead me to reflect on just how much more we could do if the operating budget allowed for more social service coordinators and the grant funding were to increase and we could bring more of these functions into our operating budget and that reliably renewable funding over time, which I know is a shared goal.

472
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:22,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that this is a conversation that I know we've had meetings like this before.

473
01:09:22,077 --> 01:09:27,784
[SPEAKER_06]: We've kind of had like broad updates on the work on the scope of the MVP grant before, for example.

474
01:09:28,705 --> 01:09:30,628
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think this is a really important thing for us to do.

475
01:09:31,388 --> 01:09:37,470
[SPEAKER_06]: every term every year maybe even by annually because we're speaking to hearing about the micro issues that come into your offices.

476
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:49,614
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to know the great work that's going on and what you're able to connect people with the resources that are in the community that you are doing the work of making sure people know about and can access and can access on their own in the future.

477
01:09:53,245 --> 01:10:21,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it in a sense sets up kind of a table of contents for our work on the council for what are the policy issues that we really should be using our particular jurisdiction to advocate for throughout the term for those things that can only really start to turn at the state level or those things that we really can start to adjust at the local level, things like land use, housing production that will over time, over a lot of time, not enough to help the people who are getting evicted right now or in dire need of affordable housing right now and can't find it in Medford.

478
01:10:22,404 --> 01:10:25,685
[SPEAKER_06]: but to set the scope of what are the problems that we really need to work on this term.

479
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:30,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So in five years, there's fewer people that walk in the door looking for affordable housing, they can't find it.

480
01:10:31,586 --> 01:10:38,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it really helps us frame how can we be using our voice as a council to advocate for those state level policy changes as well.

481
01:10:39,008 --> 01:10:43,929
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think you all are holding both at the same time, all the time, the micro and the macro.

482
01:10:43,949 --> 01:10:46,750
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's really useful for us to have that discussion in this forum.

483
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:47,570
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

484
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:48,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

485
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:49,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

486
01:10:49,952 --> 01:11:00,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And just an open invitation, the community liaisons and the connectors meet here on Wednesday evenings at five I know you've been to talk with them.

487
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:09,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're, you're welcome anytime to come to one of the meetings here the work they're doing or bring concerns to them or just listen to them and see what they're hearing in the community.

488
01:11:11,269 --> 01:11:17,893
[SPEAKER_08]: community agencies come in and educate them as to what they do, so then they can spread the word as well in their communities.

489
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:24,938
[SPEAKER_08]: So open invitation, just like Catherine know, if you'd like to come on a Wednesday evening, feel free to do so.

490
01:11:25,318 --> 01:11:35,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoyed attending that meeting and the food assistance connector is somebody that I used to work with at the Malden Warming Center.

491
01:11:37,445 --> 01:11:38,686
[SPEAKER_05]: and she still volunteers sometimes.

492
01:11:38,726 --> 01:11:41,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a great group of people.

493
01:11:42,008 --> 01:11:48,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And I learned while I was there about the Native American celebration that was happening like that next week at the senior center.

494
01:11:48,352 --> 01:11:50,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was an incredible event.

495
01:11:51,434 --> 01:11:55,697
[SPEAKER_05]: There are so many awesome events that the city is putting together.

496
01:11:55,717 --> 01:12:02,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just think that program, the connectors and the liaisons are so interesting and so cool.

497
01:12:03,842 --> 01:12:04,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sang.

498
01:12:06,919 --> 01:12:07,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

499
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:08,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to keep you guys too long.

500
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:09,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys work so hard.

501
01:12:09,962 --> 01:12:18,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just have, you know, I keep having ideas and questions that keep popping up in my head, but I'll be very quick with them.

502
01:12:18,509 --> 01:12:28,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I was curious with the multilingual hotline, when someone calls in, let's say using like Haitian, for example, and there's someone that we don't, haven't reached out to before.

503
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,679
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know, we don't have them in our network.

504
01:12:30,919 --> 01:12:34,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious, like, is there a way to get them added to our network?

505
01:12:34,622 --> 01:12:35,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that's something.

506
01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:42,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they leave a question and what do you... Yeah, let's say they leave a question.

507
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that our city staff can help with.

508
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:54,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a way to connect them or make sure they are in that network with their community liaisons to make sure that we keep expanding our community liaison connections?

509
01:12:55,529 --> 01:12:56,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, absolutely.

510
01:12:56,530 --> 01:13:01,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Because those calls are answered by our community liaisons and connectors.

511
01:13:01,514 --> 01:13:05,417
[SPEAKER_08]: So they do the outreach themselves to these people and explain who they are, what they do.

512
01:13:06,592 --> 01:13:09,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So they get direct responses from, great.

513
01:13:10,573 --> 01:13:16,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also curious about like programming for things like clinics and like the pop-ups.

514
01:13:17,235 --> 01:13:18,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious how they come about.

515
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:20,615
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we determine what is programmed?

516
01:13:21,796 --> 01:13:34,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there ways for, like, are we gauging kind of what residents want or is it more like different community organizations exist, they reach out to us and it becomes a good opportunity to have that programming.

517
01:13:35,222 --> 01:13:41,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So the old, the structure of the MVP was actually created out of somewhat of a needs assessment and talking to the community.

518
01:13:42,271 --> 01:13:49,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how those topics were chosen around financial stability, food insecurity, help me out.

519
01:13:52,310 --> 01:14:05,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Youth and family, so that's kind of how those, so that's the way that, and then we're in those communities, so the youth and teens are talking to the youth and teens and figuring out what's needed, what's more.

520
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:10,972
[SPEAKER_08]: The financial stability is out there talking about what's needed, the ESOL.

521
01:14:12,216 --> 01:14:16,359
[SPEAKER_08]: big thing that keeps coming up as jobs, jobs jobs with the SOL folks.

522
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:19,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where that's coming from with our connection to mass hire.

523
01:14:20,221 --> 01:14:24,144
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of where we get the information from and then move forward accordingly.

524
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,894
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really, really helpful for us to know.

525
01:14:27,895 --> 01:14:44,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was curious, are there any programs that are not, I think programs maybe is a strong word, but any ways that of helping people out that exist in other municipalities around us that maybe we haven't had the bandwidth for so far?

526
01:14:45,126 --> 01:14:45,847
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

527
01:14:47,485 --> 01:14:54,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we get creative, so we try to do, even if we don't have the services here.

528
01:14:55,553 --> 01:15:03,480
[SPEAKER_08]: A good example is our Haitian community and Catherine can come up and talk, our Haitian community was talking about a lot of anxiety that's out there right now.

529
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:10,387
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of stresses that they're having, and the need for some mental health support so we reached out to Cambridge Health Alliance.

530
01:15:11,067 --> 01:15:21,593
[SPEAKER_08]: and they did a wonderful program for that mental health kind of first aid for the Haitian community a couple of weeks back, and it was really well received, and we're gonna follow up on that.

531
01:15:23,034 --> 01:15:37,223
[SPEAKER_08]: So we kind of reach out to, because again, even healthcare-wise, right, we don't really have a hospital, we don't have a system here in Medford anymore, so we have to reach out to Melrose-Wakefield, or to Winchester, to CHA, outside of our folks.

532
01:15:37,643 --> 01:15:39,384
[SPEAKER_08]: But we bring them in if we have to.

533
01:15:43,226 --> 01:15:44,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's all I have.

534
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:46,770
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have more, I'll email.

535
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,332
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are super easy to reach.

536
01:15:49,613 --> 01:15:55,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to thank you all for your hard work, for coming here tonight, taking so many questions from us.

537
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:59,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to presume that other counselors don't have questions.

538
01:16:00,773 --> 01:16:08,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your thorough presentations, for letting our residents, I know there are folks online tonight too, letting our residents see everything that we're doing.

539
01:16:09,378 --> 01:16:10,358
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really impressive.

540
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:15,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do want to impress upon residents that Medford is a leader when it comes to a lot of these issues.

541
01:16:15,641 --> 01:16:17,122
[SPEAKER_02]: The state is looking at us as a leader.

542
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:22,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank the community liaisons and our connectors as well for their hard work.

543
01:16:23,826 --> 01:16:25,287
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very difficult times, very

544
01:16:25,846 --> 01:16:30,910
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so much to do as we kind of have gathered from your comments.

545
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:32,170
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more.

546
01:16:32,611 --> 01:16:35,953
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more work to be done than anyone has capacity for.

547
01:16:36,033 --> 01:16:37,915
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys still touch to it.

548
01:16:37,935 --> 01:16:38,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate that.

549
01:16:39,155 --> 01:16:39,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

550
01:16:39,956 --> 01:16:41,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having appreciate it.

551
01:16:43,218 --> 01:16:43,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

552
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:48,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Um uh, if counselors are there any other comments from counselors?

553
01:16:48,662 --> 01:16:51,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see one hand on zoom for public comment.

554
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:54,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I will, uh,

555
01:16:57,111 --> 01:16:59,072
[SPEAKER_05]: go to Zoom for public comment.

556
01:16:59,652 --> 01:17:02,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I will ask Steve.

557
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:03,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve, go ahead.

558
01:17:04,314 --> 01:17:04,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

559
01:17:05,635 --> 01:17:06,675
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Steve Schnapp.

560
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:09,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 36 Hillside Ave.

561
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:12,357
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a 15-year Medford resident.

562
01:17:13,478 --> 01:17:18,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Also graduated Boston University School of Social Work, 1981, with an MSW.

563
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:22,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to express my deep appreciation for the health department.

564
01:17:23,962 --> 01:17:26,803
[SPEAKER_00]: for this work, as several counselors have stated.

565
01:17:26,823 --> 01:17:29,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with this kind of work.

566
01:17:29,605 --> 01:17:30,505
[SPEAKER_00]: It is difficult.

567
01:17:30,745 --> 01:17:43,090
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become increasingly difficult, and I think the members, the staff of the health department are doing a tremendous job, and it's greatly appreciated.

568
01:17:44,488 --> 01:18:01,279
[SPEAKER_00]: One other comment I would make is I have heard candidates for the City Council and their supporters on a number of occasions complain that the City Council is spending too much time on national issues.

569
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:06,923
[SPEAKER_00]: It is clear from the testimony that members of the Health Department have given

570
01:18:08,265 --> 01:18:25,096
[SPEAKER_00]: that what's happening at the federal level with Medicaid, SNAP, and other programs, and what looks like will be even more severe cuts, have a direct impact on the most vulnerable citizens in our community.

571
01:18:26,277 --> 01:18:34,263
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to pay attention to what's going on at the national level, and I really appreciate the council's efforts to address that.

572
01:18:35,201 --> 01:18:42,343
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate the health department's hard work in the face of a very difficult situation.

573
01:18:42,883 --> 01:18:43,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

574
01:18:46,784 --> 01:18:48,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

575
01:18:48,204 --> 01:18:53,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I see one more public comment from Jennifer.

576
01:18:53,926 --> 01:18:55,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Jennifer, name and address for the record, please.

577
01:18:57,827 --> 01:18:59,007
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Jennifer Yackel.

578
01:18:59,087 --> 01:19:00,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I live at 16 Monument Street.

579
01:19:00,807 --> 01:19:03,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to express my appreciation for these presentations.

580
01:19:04,089 --> 01:19:10,832
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very, very illuminating for me to learn about the wealth of services that we have here in Medford.

581
01:19:10,972 --> 01:19:25,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel very reassured and I commend the work that you're doing and very much, very much appreciate it.

582
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so much needed at this time for reasons that Steve Schnapp has referred to also.

583
01:19:32,662 --> 01:19:34,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So just thank you very much.

584
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:38,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jennifer.

585
01:19:41,146 --> 01:19:46,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing no other public comment, do we have a motion on this paper?

586
01:19:46,468 --> 01:19:52,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we could keep it in committee, just to keep the paper, motion to keep the paper, I can't speak.

587
01:19:53,431 --> 01:19:59,814
[SPEAKER_02]: A motion to keep the paper in committee, just so if we want to bring it back up ever in the future, we can do it.

588
01:19:59,874 --> 01:20:00,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sounds good.

589
01:20:00,614 --> 01:20:01,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a second?

590
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:08,445
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Sang to keep the paper and committee seconded by Councilor Collins.

591
01:20:08,465 --> 01:20:09,125
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor?

592
01:20:09,366 --> 01:20:09,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

593
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:10,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

594
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:11,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

595
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:15,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all for being here so much.

596
01:20:15,312 --> 01:20:15,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Really appreciate it.

597
01:20:17,162 --> 01:20:19,843
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one other item on the agenda tonight.

598
01:20:20,203 --> 01:20:27,166
[SPEAKER_05]: It is 25-138, resolution to hold immigration enforcement accountable to Medford residents.

599
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:40,550
[SPEAKER_05]: This was another resolution Councilor Seng and I brought forward regarding immigration enforcement that has been active in Medford.

600
01:20:41,771 --> 01:20:44,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was some,

601
01:20:46,588 --> 01:20:55,875
[SPEAKER_05]: community involvement around attempting to support family members of people who were arrested by ICE.

602
01:20:57,136 --> 01:21:07,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had the thought that we would like to help people access community support in a more direct way.

603
01:21:08,824 --> 01:21:10,745
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we

604
01:21:12,713 --> 01:21:13,853
[SPEAKER_05]: looked into this further.

605
01:21:14,153 --> 01:21:28,038
[SPEAKER_05]: We initially thought we should send it to committee, talk more about what resources were available to family members and dependents of people who may be arrested by immigration enforcement, and they were the breadwinner.

606
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:36,261
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an example of somebody who was disabled and couldn't work and couldn't,

607
01:21:37,952 --> 01:21:44,175
[SPEAKER_05]: pay legal fees to get her partner supported after the arrest.

608
01:21:45,795 --> 01:21:50,257
[SPEAKER_05]: How can our community help show up for their neighbors, and how can we connect them.

609
01:21:52,743 --> 01:22:10,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an effort to help community members who are in similar situations more directly, and also to look into discussing issuing Freedom of Information Act requests to ICE about those arrests.

610
01:22:10,716 --> 01:22:15,360
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will turn it over to Councilor Sang, whose mic is already on.

611
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:16,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yep.

612
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:16,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

613
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:33,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I, my prepared remarks will largely echo what chair Lazarus said, um, it's clear to us that the federal overreach on when it comes to immigrations enforcement.

614
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:41,527
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcing out of state values on our city is threatening the safety and rights of our neighbors here in Medford.

615
01:22:42,127 --> 01:23:00,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, we are meeting to address an important consequence of that, that problem that many of those who are who have been abducted or deported, are breadwinners for their families, and without them, their dependents need help.

616
01:23:01,166 --> 01:23:07,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, I had wanted to use this meeting to identify the more specific challenges that we are seeing on the ground.

617
01:23:09,088 --> 01:23:17,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that part of our job as a city council is as a connector, especially between nonprofits and different community groups.

618
01:23:18,491 --> 01:23:26,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that spirit, to learn more about what folks are seeing on the ground, I reached out to Medford residents who are members of Luce,

619
01:23:27,768 --> 01:23:34,553
[SPEAKER_02]: LUCE is a grassroots organization that's been conducting neighborhood watches and providing mutual aid to residents.

620
01:23:37,014 --> 01:23:53,966
[SPEAKER_02]: LUCE has let me know that families need a lot of help with lawyers' fees, attorneys' fees, and connecting to attorneys on the ground, particularly in states that family members are being taken to, the main two being New York and Louisiana.

621
01:23:54,634 --> 01:24:04,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially what often happens is once someone is nabbed off the street in Medford, they're taken to Burlington, the ICE facility in Burlington, for processing.

622
01:24:04,503 --> 01:24:18,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And then very quickly, oftentimes within 24, 48 hours, they're being shipped off to New York, where there's a larger facility, or Louisiana, where there is a large facility and the circuit court is much more conservative.

623
01:24:20,863 --> 01:24:40,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Families, Luces let me know that families also need rental assistance and logistical support, like with errands, running errands, or oftentimes there are cars that are left on the street after an individual is taken away and the parking fines pile up.

624
01:24:40,314 --> 01:24:43,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And the families can't afford for the cars to be towed as well.

625
01:24:44,016 --> 01:24:45,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's become a problem.

626
01:24:46,729 --> 01:24:54,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And Luz could use help from counselors to get connected to community groups and community members on the ground.

627
01:24:55,413 --> 01:24:59,474
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, we just need more help identifying the families that need help.

628
01:25:01,355 --> 01:25:10,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we know of a solid number of individuals that have been taken, we know of these cases, there are more out there that

629
01:25:11,329 --> 01:25:14,995
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to know about, who we want to be connecting to.

630
01:25:15,676 --> 01:25:24,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And to that effect, I'd be interested in following Boston's lead in submitting FOIA requests seeking the names of those that have been detained or deported in our community.

631
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:38,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I also know that some counselors and community members are already thinking of different concrete ways to support families that are realistic, that preserve people's privacy and safety in these efforts.

632
01:25:39,908 --> 01:25:48,673
[SPEAKER_02]: In our discussions as a council, I also want to impress on everyone the importance of sensitivity, given everything that's happening in privacy.

633
01:25:50,621 --> 01:26:07,450
[SPEAKER_02]: As for the next steps, I was thinking, as a council, our members could provide ideas about what kind of resources the council would like to collect, what kind of problems we're seeing on the ground, and reach out to community groups and members who might be interested in helping, just privately.

634
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:12,032
[SPEAKER_02]: But using this meeting as a coordinating time for coordination.

635
01:26:13,726 --> 01:26:26,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd also motion to request that the city solicitor look into submitting FOIA requests on the city's behalf to seek the names of those who have been detained or deported along the lines of what the city of Boston is doing.

636
01:26:26,652 --> 01:26:30,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to vote on that after, but after discussion.

637
01:26:31,815 --> 01:26:32,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

638
01:26:35,096 --> 01:26:36,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

639
01:26:36,937 --> 01:26:37,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Not...

640
01:26:40,834 --> 01:26:46,438
[SPEAKER_05]: not making names of people who would be in need of assistance public is really important.

641
01:26:46,738 --> 01:27:07,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're limited in what we can offer as city councilors in public meetings, but it did feel appropriate to bring this forward to reiterate our clear stance on

642
01:27:11,645 --> 01:27:23,185
[SPEAKER_05]: how important it is that we believe that our community can act in a positive way to take care of our residents when they are in need because of something that happened.

643
01:27:24,565 --> 01:27:32,331
[SPEAKER_05]: based on an action of immigration enforcement, and that our community will step forward and take care of people that need to be cared for.

644
01:27:34,072 --> 01:27:40,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Do any other councilors have a comment, or is there a second on Councilor Sang's motion?

645
01:27:41,117 --> 01:27:42,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

646
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:46,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair Lozero.

647
01:27:46,913 --> 01:27:47,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be happy to second.

648
01:27:48,174 --> 01:27:53,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to reaffirm what yourself and other councilors have been saying in this meeting.

649
01:27:53,416 --> 01:28:06,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this is, we're in a time where it's as important as ever to be taking stock of what resources are available to our residents, making those stronger.

650
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:26,624
[SPEAKER_06]: and more widespread and better communicated to the community with every channel that we have, making sure that the city is getting in contact and able to find everybody in the community who's in need of assistance, in need of support, who may not be connected to our supportive systems yet as a baseline.

651
01:28:26,644 --> 01:28:34,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would also say that I think that now more than ever, it's so important for the city of Medford and the mayor's administration to be doing whatever it can to collaborate with other regions

652
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:53,479
[SPEAKER_06]: that are also, sorry, other municipalities in the region that are also weathering this crisis with local resources to see what we can do to collaborate and share resources and share response to federal actions, which will make all of our local responses that much stronger and better for our residents.

653
01:28:53,719 --> 01:28:57,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

654
01:28:58,082 --> 01:28:58,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

655
01:29:00,343 --> 01:29:02,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other comments from councillors?

656
01:29:04,385 --> 01:29:04,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none,

657
01:29:05,563 --> 01:29:11,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have one public comment on Zoom that I will take now.

658
01:29:11,113 --> 01:29:16,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

659
01:29:17,192 --> 01:29:19,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Muneer Jumanis, Three Summit Road.

660
01:29:20,494 --> 01:29:26,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the work of this city council in addressing this issue.

661
01:29:27,817 --> 01:29:38,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering if it's possible, I'm not sure whether you have the authority to do this, but I'm wondering whether it's possible to establish some kind of a fund

662
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:46,634
[SPEAKER_01]: in the city that even folks can contribute to, to support these families.

663
01:29:47,722 --> 01:30:01,991
[SPEAKER_01]: and also hope possibly with the help of the community liaisons who seem to be working hard to support various community members in Medford.

664
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:11,397
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I appreciate your work on this and I'm interested in what you think this, whether this could be done.

665
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:12,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

666
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:15,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

667
01:30:17,104 --> 01:30:18,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go to Councilor Sang.

668
01:30:20,419 --> 01:30:21,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Munir.

669
01:30:21,419 --> 01:30:23,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's an interesting idea.

670
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:26,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I've definitely heard it from residents before as well.

671
01:30:28,143 --> 01:30:29,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something we would have to look into.

672
01:30:32,565 --> 01:30:35,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think there are just a lot of the logistics with it.

673
01:30:35,826 --> 01:30:47,652
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have to look at privacy and perhaps doing it through private community actors is the best way to do it, but something to be looked into in the future and to be discussed in private.

674
01:30:49,538 --> 01:30:53,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I can also say that, uh, the.

675
01:30:55,461 --> 01:30:58,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Organization Councilor saying mentioned, um.

676
01:30:59,463 --> 01:31:02,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I believe take up a, uh.

677
01:31:03,765 --> 01:31:07,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Go fund me for a resident in Medford who needed

678
01:31:17,807 --> 01:31:39,011
[SPEAKER_05]: networks that are happening now that because of the position that the city may be in, there are other avenues, but the Medford as a community has been trying to take care of each other.

679
01:31:39,492 --> 01:31:44,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's important and nice to recognize.

680
01:31:44,152 --> 01:31:46,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate your comment.

681
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second on Councilor Sang's motion?

682
01:31:52,753 --> 01:31:54,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Collins.

683
01:31:55,616 --> 01:31:56,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sang's motion.

684
01:31:56,396 --> 01:31:57,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you repeat what it was again, please?

685
01:31:58,318 --> 01:31:59,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

686
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:00,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

687
01:32:03,468 --> 01:32:18,913
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion is to request that the city solicitor look into submitting FOIA requests on the city's behalf to seek the names of those that have been detained or deported along the lines of what the city of Boston is doing.

688
01:32:19,494 --> 01:32:21,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

689
01:32:22,695 --> 01:32:24,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Collins.

690
01:32:24,495 --> 01:32:25,256
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

691
01:32:25,276 --> 01:32:25,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

692
01:32:26,436 --> 01:32:26,896
[SPEAKER_05]: All opposed?

693
01:32:27,236 --> 01:32:28,076
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

694
01:32:30,037 --> 01:32:30,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

695
01:32:30,697 --> 01:32:32,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Councilor Sang.

696
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:32,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?

697
01:32:32,699 --> 01:32:33,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

698
01:32:33,259 --> 01:32:45,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I mean I think we heard from the public commenter tonight, Moonier, and over the last few weeks, there have been different ideas that have been circulating around with private residents.

699
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:51,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I think it's best to talk about these ideas when they're fully fledged and feasible.

700
01:32:53,558 --> 01:33:01,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should keep this paper in committee so that we can have that time to flush out these ideas and then bring those ideas to the council if need be.

701
01:33:01,803 --> 01:33:05,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would motion to keep this paper in committee and adjourn.

702
01:33:08,266 --> 01:33:11,068
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councillor Singh, seconded by Councillor Lemming.

703
01:33:11,088 --> 01:33:12,249
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favour?

704
01:33:12,689 --> 01:33:12,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

705
01:33:13,189 --> 01:33:13,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

706
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:15,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

707
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:16,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
