[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules.

21
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:45,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, number the rule number 33 to take paper.

22
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:46,948
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can find the number of it here.

23
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:56,638
[SPEAKER_08]: One four dash seven three two.

24
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:03,573
[SPEAKER_13]: 14-732 on the motion to take that paper under rule number 33 being suspended.

25
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:04,313
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

26
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:05,553
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

27
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:06,113
[SPEAKER_13]: The ayes have it.

28
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Item 14-732.

29
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:14,316
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the allocation of the property tax fiscal year 2015 in city council, December 9th, 2014.

30
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,877
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was tabled.

31
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,058
[SPEAKER_13]: It is back before the Medford city council.

32
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:24,159
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the tax rate that was tabled last week.

33
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. O'Neill.

34
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,074
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are four separate votes that the city council has to take on this particular matter.

35
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:40,478
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully someone has a motion to sever all the votes than when they are taken.

36
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. O'Neill.

37
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:45,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

38
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:54,569
[SPEAKER_04]: We are once again appearing before the honorable body tonight for the purpose of holding the, uh,

39
00:01:55,813 --> 00:02:02,077
[SPEAKER_04]: We already held a public hearing to discuss the following items concerning the allocation of the fiscal year 2015 property tax.

40
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:06,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2015.

41
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:17,047
[SPEAKER_04]: By selecting the minimum residential factor, a percentage of the total tax levy will be shifted from the residential taxpayer to the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

42
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:24,432
[SPEAKER_04]: This results in a lower tax rate for residential properties and a higher tax rate for commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

43
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:27,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Historically, the council has chosen the minimum residential factor.

44
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:37,786
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is once again, the council choice, the minimum residential factor is a decimal 0.899216 number two to adopt an open space discount.

45
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:41,327
[SPEAKER_04]: This does not apply in the city of Medford, but a no vote is required.

46
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:43,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Three to adopt a residential exemption.

47
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:44,488
[SPEAKER_04]: If it dropped it,

48
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:50,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Owner-occupied residential properties may receive an exemption of up to 20% of the average residential value.

49
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:58,899
[SPEAKER_04]: This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the tax liability from the owner-occupied residential properties to non-owner-occupied properties.

50
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Since this shift causes a higher residential tax rate.

51
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,163
[SPEAKER_04]: A number of owner-occupied properties would see an increase in their tax bills.

52
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:09,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four, to adopt a small commercial exemption.

53
00:03:09,785 --> 00:03:20,172
[SPEAKER_04]: If adopted, small commercial properties, housing, and business employing ten or less people and valued at less than a million dollars in value may receive an exemption of up to 10% of their assessed value.

54
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:28,694
[SPEAKER_04]: This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the commercial industrial tax levy from these eligible properties to other commercial and or industrial properties.

55
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:37,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Since this shift causes a higher commercial and industrial tax rate, all commercial industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills.

56
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:45,077
[SPEAKER_04]: As part of the hearing, it is the duty of the Board of Assessors to notify the council of any excess levy capacity, fiscal year 2015 excess levy capacity.

57
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:53,927
[SPEAKER_04]: is projected to be $57,657.67, Mr. President.

58
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:56,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. O'Neill.

59
00:03:57,068 --> 00:03:59,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Questions and or motions?

60
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:03,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Which item?

61
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,910
[SPEAKER_13]: We have four papers before us.

62
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

63
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:10,731
[SPEAKER_13]: One paper, four different questions on number one.

64
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:15,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Shall we take these questions?

65
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:16,713
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to.

66
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:23,065
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of approval to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2015.

67
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:27,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

68
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:29,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Camuso.

69
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:38,410
[SPEAKER_22]: I also have a resolution that I'd like to take in conjunction with setting the tax rate under motions, orders, and resolutions, paper 14-784.

[SPEAKER_13]: You looking to do the levy?

127
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:21,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Reducing the tax levy.

128
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:24,825
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the budget that was passed by four members of this council in June.

129
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:33,172
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's going to be a million dollars in cuts or the mayor has to submit a certified letter stating that he wants to appropriate a million dollars or your amount under free cash.

130
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,373
[SPEAKER_22]: I 100% disagree.

131
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:37,156
[SPEAKER_22]: There has been in 2012, I just want to let the taxpayers know in 2012,

132
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:47,130
[SPEAKER_22]: $2,475,075 was put into our free cash account from the budget.

133
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,493
[SPEAKER_22]: In 2013, $1.883,685,000 was put into free cash from the budget.

134
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:51,674
[SPEAKER_22]: 2014, we have $945,322.

135
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:53,875
[SPEAKER_22]: That's monies that you nor I knew we were voting for

136
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:14,421
[SPEAKER_22]: at any given June, because almost all of us have been here for the last few years.

137
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:27,391
[SPEAKER_22]: I, as one counselor, did not vote back in 2012 to put $2.5 million to overtax the people $2.5 million to be able to increase our free cash account.

138
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:29,652
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, do I believe in savings?

139
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:30,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

140
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:32,675
[SPEAKER_22]: But $2.5 million in 2012, $1.883 million in 2013,

141
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,846
[SPEAKER_22]: and almost a million dollars in 2014.

142
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:42,027
[SPEAKER_22]: That is something I did not vote on.

143
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:44,948
[SPEAKER_13]: So I completely disagree with you.

144
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:46,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information.

145
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:48,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Councillor Knight.

146
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:55,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe just a couple of weeks ago, we did appropriate $1.2 million in free cash for a community improvement initiative.

147
00:06:56,112 --> 00:07:00,113
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do think that some of this money that came in has been voted on and has been voted to be spent.

148
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:04,015
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been spent on equipment, safety issues,

149
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,021
[SPEAKER_08]: and a number of resolutions that this council actually sent forward to the administration.

150
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:08,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

151
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:10,302
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, absolutely.

152
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:10,902
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree with you.

153
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:12,943
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, counselor night, 100%.

154
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:20,808
[SPEAKER_22]: The issue with that is we still have over between six and 8 million in our free cash account.

155
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:30,713
[SPEAKER_22]: We have millions in our water and sewer retain earning accounts, which I, you know, I believe has to do with overtaxing over overcharging.

156
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:31,895
[SPEAKER_22]: higher rates.

157
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:36,838
[SPEAKER_22]: We also have money in our TV3 franchise fee, which we are charging our cable rate payers.

158
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:39,299
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to give the people a break.

159
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,200
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is something that we obviously cannot vote on each year.

160
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,921
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think this is the year to do it.

161
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:47,863
[SPEAKER_22]: We have numerous amounts of reserves.

162
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,243
[SPEAKER_22]: The people are hurting.

163
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:51,704
[SPEAKER_22]: We hear it in e-mails and phone calls all the time.

164
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:58,988
[SPEAKER_22]: This is something that we can afford to do, considering that we put 2.5 — between a million and 2.5 million into free

165
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:01,746
[SPEAKER_22]: free cash from the last three budgets.

166
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor Dela Russo.

167
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:13,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Could the assessor or the Ms.

168
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:18,295
[SPEAKER_19]: Baker explain to us how we find ourselves in this predicament with money left over?

169
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:28,464
[SPEAKER_28]: So I believe you wanted to know how the free cash is being generated?

170
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:29,984
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, please.

171
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:40,386
[SPEAKER_28]: As we discussed last week, the bulk of the generation of free cash is coming from excess local receipts that come in over and above what we budgeted.

172
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:45,167
[SPEAKER_28]: In fiscal 12, the local receipts came in $1,364,000 over what we budgeted.

173
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:47,128
[SPEAKER_28]: In fiscal 13, they came in $1,592,000, almost $1,006,000 over what we budgeted.

174
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,741
[SPEAKER_28]: And in 2014, they came in $861,000 of what we budgeted.

175
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:06,264
[SPEAKER_28]: In each of those years, the bulk of the excess money came in as a result of motor vehicle excise payments.

176
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:11,685
[SPEAKER_28]: We have no knowledge of what is going to come in from motor vehicle excise payments.

177
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:15,186
[SPEAKER_28]: So we cannot budget more than what we collected in the prior year.

178
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,827
[SPEAKER_28]: Each of those years that came in,

179
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,226
[SPEAKER_28]: excessively higher, much higher than we budgeted.

180
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:23,209
[SPEAKER_28]: Like in 2013, they came in $700,000 over.

181
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:27,332
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe the reason for this is that people are leasing new cars.

182
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:30,375
[SPEAKER_28]: Therefore, their excise payments are much higher than they were.

183
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:35,780
[SPEAKER_28]: At some point, a lot of people are going to have new cars, and it'll start coming down.

184
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,124
[SPEAKER_28]: Unless they keep releasing newer cars, then it'll stabilize.

185
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:44,208
[SPEAKER_28]: I think there's a recent blip in that category.

186
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:54,080
[SPEAKER_28]: We also got a little bit of extra money from Medicaid due to a change in the formula of the federal government allowing us to recoup some capital costs related to the

187
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,581
[SPEAKER_28]: Medicaid program.

188
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:58,742
[SPEAKER_28]: That, again, is not something that's going to be repeated all the time.

189
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:00,203
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just happened a couple of times.

190
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:04,806
[SPEAKER_28]: So many of these things are not recurring events, and they're not something we can budget.

191
00:10:05,446 --> 00:10:07,407
[SPEAKER_28]: And possibly, they will go down.

192
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,108
[SPEAKER_28]: There's no way to predict that.

193
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:12,570
[SPEAKER_28]: So we've been the beneficiary of some good fortune in the recent years.

194
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,771
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's not necessarily that that's going to increase.

195
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:18,253
[SPEAKER_28]: We have not historically turned back budget money.

196
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:20,194
[SPEAKER_28]: Last year, we only turned back $122,000 of budget money.

197
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:20,895
[SPEAKER_28]: The budgets are being spent.

198
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:28,610
[SPEAKER_28]: And those are the budget levels are lowest, as far as I know.

199
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,512
[SPEAKER_28]: As far as I think, they're barely adequate to meet the budget needs of the city.

200
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:39,474
[SPEAKER_28]: If you look around, you can see the staffing in all the offices, including DPW, is very low.

201
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:48,538
[SPEAKER_28]: So I don't think that the fact that we generated in the last two years this level of surplus, I'm not sure that we can guarantee it's going to continue.

202
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:51,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of further information, Mr. President.

203
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of further information, Councilor De La Ruza.

204
00:10:53,583 --> 00:11:02,479
[SPEAKER_19]: Has there been in recent years ever a time when we haven't generated a budget surplus or surplus due to other incomes to the city?

205
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:07,853
[SPEAKER_28]: Just it was only a few years ago that we had a free cash deficit.

206
00:11:07,873 --> 00:11:10,934
[SPEAKER_28]: It was only in 2010 we had a free cash deficit of $500,000.

207
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:15,695
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's not that many years ago that we were in diastrates.

208
00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:22,697
[SPEAKER_28]: It doesn't take much for one year for a receipt to not come in as projected that you fall into hard times.

209
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:29,179
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why you need to have surpluses, I mean, reserves around.

210
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:30,759
[SPEAKER_22]: If I may.

211
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:31,540
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a long-hold claim.

212
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,840
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Camuso.

213
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:35,234
[SPEAKER_22]: If I may, Ian, I agree with you.

214
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:41,239
[SPEAKER_22]: We do need a surplus, but I don't know, I can't, what the total is.

215
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:45,982
[SPEAKER_22]: 13 million surplus, I think, is gonna be enough.

216
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:48,964
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I think this would be the year we could give the taxpayer a break.

217
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:51,906
[SPEAKER_28]: But the water and sewer surplus can only be sent to water and sewer problems.

218
00:11:52,426 --> 00:11:55,969
[SPEAKER_28]: You and all the members of the council are certainly aware of all the flooding issues we've had and the problems.

219
00:11:55,989 --> 00:12:00,552
[SPEAKER_28]: There's numerous programs that need to be done in the water sewer area, so the water and sewer surplus

220
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:05,105
[SPEAKER_28]: is probably barely adequate to meet the needs of what they had.

221
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:12,928
[SPEAKER_28]: The Water and Sewer Department and the city engineer has been very successful in getting grants on the MWRA to take care of some of our needs.

222
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:17,871
[SPEAKER_28]: So we haven't had to dip into the water and sewer retainer as much as we thought we might.

223
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,912
[SPEAKER_28]: So I don't know how long those programs will continue either.

224
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:27,175
[SPEAKER_28]: But the work that needs to be done in the water sewer infrastructure is going to continue.

225
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:47,007
[SPEAKER_28]: And the level of reserves we have, although seems a lot, we all know what the unfunded liability is in the pension, millions of dollars, and we all know what the unfunded liability is in the OPEB, the post-retirement reserves, which we have not funded at all.

226
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:55,594
[SPEAKER_28]: We are one of the few, one of the few cities and towns that has not funded anything to an OPEB trust fund for the after retirement benefits.

227
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:58,049
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in a clarification.

228
00:12:58,089 --> 00:12:58,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta.

229
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:06,013
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though we know that, but this administration has been there for 27 years and they haven't put a dime on the table to get into funding that unfunded liability.

230
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:12,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you and I had our conversation and I put a resolution on here, we could stop by putting 500,000 a year out of our free cash.

231
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:13,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a drop in the bucket?

232
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:14,619
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a beginning.

233
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing with the beginning, he hasn't done anything.

234
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:19,989
[SPEAKER_06]: The administration has done nothing to reduce that fund.

235
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:21,070
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about the OPIP?

236
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

237
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:28,937
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, we haven't—we haven't funded anything in that, and we've only—only—I would say only in the last two years we've had enough money in free cash that we could consider funding that.

238
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:35,142
[SPEAKER_28]: But we—but our obligation to the pension liability has increased dramatically.

239
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:38,325
[SPEAKER_28]: It's now $10 million a year to fund the pension system.

240
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:54,758
[SPEAKER_28]: And the Prop 2.5 level that was set in 1980 was set at a level that the framers who set it assumed we could meet our obligations before health insurance started escalating exponentially.

241
00:13:55,338 --> 00:14:02,080
[SPEAKER_28]: So trying to meet the obligation of the city, only going up 2.5%, is a difficult task.

242
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,522
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think having this level of free cash, which is low in comparison to many, many places,

243
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:12,820
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a testament to what we've done as far as trimming the budgets.

244
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:26,468
[SPEAKER_28]: And each year when the budget gets presented, you know, it's looked at very closely and trying to be kept down at a level that's easy to meet, easier to meet.

245
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Councillor Lungo-Kern, you have the floor.

246
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:30,250
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councillor Camuso.

247
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,691
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for your explanation, Anne.

248
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:37,615
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, what about in our tax receipt recap, motor vehicle excise?

249
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:48,173
[SPEAKER_22]: under-budgeted that account in June by, or from the results in June, by $600,000, but then we kept it at the same figure for 2015.

250
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:50,295
[SPEAKER_22]: Are we assuming that?

251
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:57,344
[SPEAKER_28]: No, we, well, that figure, motor vehicle exercise, is budgeted at exactly what we collected last year.

252
00:14:59,336 --> 00:15:01,999
[SPEAKER_28]: That figure in column A is the actual receipts.

253
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:13,249
[SPEAKER_28]: And we cannot budget any higher than that unless we can prove to the Department of Revenue that we have a reason to expect that we will collect more than that.

254
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:20,056
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, the fact that last year we collected more than we budgeted is fortuitous, but not anything we could have predicted.

255
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,618
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, there's nothing we can predict that would show that.

256
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,600
[SPEAKER_22]: So do you have what we budgeted for last year?

257
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:26,028
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have that number.

258
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:26,368
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

259
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:28,570
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, it was $582,000 less than that.

260
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:28,970
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me see.

261
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:28,970
$5,302,000.

262
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,310
[SPEAKER_22]: $5,302,000 last year.

263
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:29,691
[SPEAKER_22]: And we collected $5,682,000.

264
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:30,311
[SPEAKER_28]: Each year, we only

265
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:55,378
[SPEAKER_28]: budget what we get.

266
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:04,744
[SPEAKER_22]: But I thought that was under-budgeted by $600,000, then we only increased it by $300,000, so we're still under-estimating.

267
00:16:06,485 --> 00:16:08,287
[SPEAKER_28]: What are you saying?

268
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:13,070
[SPEAKER_28]: When I asked the last committee of the whole meeting— We budgeted exactly what we received.

269
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:23,983
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but that doesn't make sense compared to the questions I asked last Tuesday, which, you know, I wrote down your answers.

270
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:27,925
[SPEAKER_22]: You said it was about $600,000 more.

271
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,126
[SPEAKER_12]: We under-budgeted.

272
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:29,126
382.

273
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:31,227
[SPEAKER_28]: The previous year was 682.

274
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,888
[SPEAKER_28]: In 2014, it was 382 or over.

275
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:40,691
[SPEAKER_22]: Either way, I mean, I think I'm well aware we need reserves.

276
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:43,592
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think reserves obviously are

277
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:51,260
[SPEAKER_22]: But to the point we're at now, I think we can chip away at this tax rate that we have.

278
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,202
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we can chip away and help the people, whether it's a little bit each year until we get to, you know, to a point.

279
00:16:57,242 --> 00:17:05,145
[SPEAKER_22]: But the average homeowner is going to see an increase of, the average two-family home is going to see an increase of almost $400 for the year.

280
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:07,946
[SPEAKER_22]: Average three-family, over $500.

281
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:10,247
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's going to take a toll on people.

282
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:11,767
[SPEAKER_22]: It's going to take a toll on renters, too.

283
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:14,028
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, this, it's just, I'm

284
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:18,749
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm coming from a place where, you know, I'm not just thinking city budget.

285
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:19,929
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to think of the people too.

286
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:21,450
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to think of it all collectively.

287
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:30,112
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like, you know, I'd like to get the input of my fellow counselors, but I think it's, this is the year that we should start doing it.

288
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Caravello, then Council on Night.

289
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:34,353
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

290
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:35,454
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have a question.

291
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:36,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

292
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,200
[SPEAKER_21]: Taking.

293
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,901
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

294
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:04,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

295
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:14,140
[SPEAKER_04]: For you, Mr. President, that would reduce it 12 cents on the residential tax rate, bring it down to 45, 68, 31 cents.

296
00:18:20,302 --> 00:18:21,103
[SPEAKER_04]: On the single family?

297
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:23,344
[SPEAKER_04]: At a million dollars?

298
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:25,525
[SPEAKER_04]: We bring it down 11.58.

299
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:34,751
[SPEAKER_22]: point of information, the tax levy is going up by over $3 million, so bring it down a third, almost a third.

300
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:34,751
45.68.

301
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Councillor Knight.

302
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:56,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.

303
00:18:57,216 --> 00:18:58,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information.

304
00:18:58,316 --> 00:18:59,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Councillor Lungo-Kerr.

305
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:05,040
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think it speaks volumes to where this council's at and where we want to go moving forward.

306
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:21,129
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, taxing to the max at the 2.5% when you put in sometimes $2.5 million, which I consider being overtaxed, I mean, you're sending the message to not only the people but also the corner office that, you know, maybe we should look at our budget in June a little bit more closely.

307
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,860
[SPEAKER_22]: think there can be cuts.

308
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,261
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we can still make cuts and add to our police department and our DPW force.

309
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,981
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I believe it can be done.

310
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,982
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just a matter of having four people that want to be able to do it.

311
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:39,703
[SPEAKER_13]: There were four members of the council that approved the budget and I was not one of them, so I can't speak to that.

312
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:45,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penta, I'm sorry, Councilor Knight, then Councilor Penta.

313
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I just think back to 2001 and

314
00:19:51,658 --> 00:20:01,865
[SPEAKER_08]: All of us that have been involved in government since that time continuously hear from the Massachusetts Municipal Association about the need to restore local aid funding back to pre-2001 levels.

315
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:04,227
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a new administration coming in.

316
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,848
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a new governor coming to Beacon Hill.

317
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:13,553
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the governor who was the chairman of, he was the secretariat of administration and finance, and he was the architect of the nine C cuts that came into place.

318
00:20:14,073 --> 00:20:15,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we really need to be careful.

319
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:17,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe now isn't the time.

320
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:19,637
[SPEAKER_08]: We had eight years of the same administration and we knew what to expect.

321
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:20,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we don't.

322
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:22,305
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a new administration coming in.

323
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:27,547
[SPEAKER_08]: The administration historically has supported nine C cuts to local aid after a budget's been passed, Mr. President.

324
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:41,251
[SPEAKER_08]: This makes me nervous, makes me very nervous to reduce the tax, to chip away at our free cash, not have reserves in the bank, and then be later on down the road, see something like this happen at the state level.

325
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:47,013
[SPEAKER_08]: We might be really put in a precarious position down the road if, in fact, this agenda item goes through.

326
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:52,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I see this a little bit different.

327
00:20:53,139 --> 00:21:00,225
[SPEAKER_06]: We had $7.9 million, I believe, in free cash a couple of weeks ago, two or three weeks ago.

328
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:06,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the mayor came in here with his particular pet projects for which the council has never advised or asked on any one of them.

329
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:09,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

330
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:18,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe that the council every week makes recommendations to the mayor as to what projects we'd like to see funded, as to what steps we'd like to see the government move, and as to what direction we'd like to see certain initiatives take.

331
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:20,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

332
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:36,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I believe that the mayor came in with his pet projects that took money from free cash and reduced it by $1.2 million, and then took another amount of money as it relates to where he would want to go.

333
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:45,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, to make a bottom line to the whole thing is, for some reason or other, we've accumulated surpluses in two very large areas that belong to the taxpayers.

334
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:47,551
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is in the water and sewer account.

335
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:49,632
[SPEAKER_06]: The second one in here is in the free cash account.

336
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, as Ann Baker has alluded to, maybe we've been fortunate over the past few years, whether they be the car excise tax.

337
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:58,744
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in our conversations, again, you talked about Medicaid, too.

338
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:02,186
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some reimbursements back from them for which we didn't expect.

339
00:22:02,226 --> 00:22:07,369
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's helped us out in our issue of having a free cash surplus for whatever it might be.

340
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:19,295
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is no projects that are pending that are coming here now before the council asking for council input as it relates to whether it be the police station, whether it be putting more police personnel on.

341
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:36,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to flip to all of that, isn't it interesting, during this past budget, the school committee wound up with $2 million more this year than they did last year, and they went out and hired a whole bunch of more new people, for which the council was never asked of anything on the council's side of adding on to this budget, or any things to be included.

342
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:44,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad I voted for the budget, because I voted for the budget to get rid of the $800,000 and the water and sewer that, unmercifully, the taxing the ratepayers in this community of.

343
00:22:45,492 --> 00:22:49,754
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, sticking to this, I don't see any problem taking the million dollars out, and I'll tell you the reason why.

344
00:22:50,294 --> 00:23:01,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe next year we won't have the opportunity to do it, but there is nothing before me on this table right now that's telling me there is such a major project that needs to be done that we need that surplus, because that surplus has been there over and over.

345
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:02,954
[SPEAKER_06]: for the past few years.

346
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been getting over and over for the past few years.

347
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:08,097
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to keep it in there to keep our bond rating up.

348
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:14,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, where's our bond rating going at the expense of the ratepayers each and every year getting an increase in their taxes?

349
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Councilor Caviello, you just asked a question on that single-family house.

350
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:21,723
[SPEAKER_06]: It's $48 you would save, correct?

351
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:24,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the present tax rate, he'd be paying over what?

352
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:25,284
[SPEAKER_06]: $150 some odd.

353
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:29,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And for a two-family house, Ed, and a three-family house.

354
00:23:29,846 --> 00:23:31,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Figure that out and see how much they'd get.

355
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:39,358
[SPEAKER_06]: It may not be much, but at least you're telling the taxpayers of this community for once, after 27 years, they're not getting a tax rate increase.

356
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:41,078
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the money.

357
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:43,459
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not taking all the money.

358
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:44,519
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the money.

359
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councillor DelaRusso.

360
00:23:48,920 --> 00:24:00,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Through the Chair, to Madam Baker or Mr. O'Neill, did tax increases begin historically in Medford only 27 years ago, or were they something that

361
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:05,169
[SPEAKER_19]: one could assume would happen every year in years previous to 27 years ago.

362
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:14,313
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, well, I've been working in municipal government for about 30 years in different cities and towns, and I've never seen a tax rate go down.

363
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:16,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

364
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:20,135
[SPEAKER_06]: With all due respect, Anna, I've seen it in the city of, I've seen it in the city of Somerville.

365
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:21,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen it in the city of Everett through the years.

366
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Tax rates have either gone down or been stabilized.

367
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:25,094
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not the issue.

368
00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:33,127
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the fact of the matter, we've had a plentiful amount of new development here in the city of Medford through the years, a plentiful amount of development.

369
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:38,015
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were told when stations landing came in, that was going to be the panacea of new tax growth in this community.

370
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,150
[SPEAKER_06]: which would set the base.

371
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gone up and up and up.

372
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:56,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And since then, we've had four major developments of housing in this community, whether it be at Wellington Circle, whether it be on the Mystic Valley Parkway, whether the new one that's being proposed opposite the train station, or whether the new one down the street at the end of station, not stations landing opposite where the Tufts Boathouse is.

373
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,101
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not the point.

374
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:02,163
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact of the matter is, we're not taking the last penny in the free cash account.

375
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:13,085
[SPEAKER_06]: If what Councilor Longo-Kern is alluding to, averaging out the last three years to take out a million dollars or 899,000, whatever it might be, it still leaves you with a balance in excess of $6 million.

376
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:17,608
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to say one thing relative to the permits and the growth in the city.

377
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:21,951
[SPEAKER_28]: Each year when we do local receipts, permits is a component of local receipts.

378
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:31,937
[SPEAKER_28]: And each year when we look at what we've taken in the previous year, if we have seen a big project on the horizon, we have increased the permit

379
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:34,834
[SPEAKER_28]: the permits expected in those years.

380
00:25:35,495 --> 00:25:42,678
[SPEAKER_28]: And generally, so the permit fees have contributed to reducing the tax rate, because we've always taken those into consideration to the extent that we know them.

381
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:45,620
[SPEAKER_28]: And generally, those large projects have many years in the planning.

382
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,421
[SPEAKER_28]: So we do have an idea when those things are coming in.

383
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,202
[SPEAKER_28]: And they have been incorporated into the tax rate.

384
00:25:50,222 --> 00:25:52,263
[SPEAKER_28]: So you have seen the results of those permit fees.

385
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:56,285
[SPEAKER_06]: But the higher assessments that Mr. O'Neill's proposing comes up to $3,805,800,926.

386
00:26:00,755 --> 00:26:03,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And in this year, in the budget, you have a new capital growth expansion of $999,941.

387
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:10,420
[SPEAKER_06]: That means the budget from last year to this year is expected in growth to increase by $4,805,867.

388
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:22,156
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the council is alluding to is if you knock off a million of that money by taking it out of your free cash and giving the homeowners a break.

389
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:22,957
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

390
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:27,641
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not saying take the whole thing out, but there is money there to give these people a break.

391
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:37,669
[SPEAKER_06]: You're getting new growth in revenue and you're getting new growth and business and you're having two more new buildings come on next year and that'll be more new taxes.

392
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:38,690
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

393
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,333
[SPEAKER_06]: To say that, you know, we tax each and every year is symptomatic.

394
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:46,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if it's symptomatic, you know, we're all going to die someday, and that's symptomatic, too.

395
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:54,303
[SPEAKER_06]: But government can do something to help people rather than abuse them by saying, give me more money, give me more money, give me more money.

396
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:56,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only way you can give them more money is tax them to death.

397
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:59,368
[SPEAKER_28]: I really take exception to the term of abusing them.

398
00:26:59,388 --> 00:27:03,672
[SPEAKER_28]: I think the city, the administration is trying to run the city and create a

399
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,522
[SPEAKER_28]: a lifestyle in the city of Medford and a lifestyle that's a pleasant place to live.

400
00:27:08,822 --> 00:27:14,585
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think the tax rate is a reasonable tax rate in aligned with all the other communities around us.

401
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:15,905
[SPEAKER_28]: It's very low in comparison.

402
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:19,627
[SPEAKER_28]: And I just, I just would not like to hear that word that we're abusing taxpayers.

403
00:27:20,768 --> 00:27:24,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks and then Councilor Caravaglio, Vice President Caravaglio.

404
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,191
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

405
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:32,033
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank my Councilor colleague Councilor Longo Kern for bringing this up tonight.

406
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:40,893
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we hear the terminology, especially in this particular tax season, that we hear the words free cash all the time.

407
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:45,238
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've had so many people stop me and say, where does the city get free cash?

408
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,440
[SPEAKER_17]: How does that work?

409
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:53,087
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, when I explain to them that it's nothing more than the taxpayer's money,

410
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:59,880
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, all of a sudden, a light bulb goes off in their head, and they say, well, why isn't this coming back to me?

411
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,882
[SPEAKER_17]: If you have free cash laying around, why doesn't this filter back to the taxpayers?

412
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,464
[SPEAKER_17]: And the same can be said with free cash, as we're talking about tonight.

413
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:15,867
[SPEAKER_17]: The surplus in the water and sewer enterprise account, we all realize you need a rainy day fund to pay for projects.

414
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:21,629
[SPEAKER_17]: For instance, the big rainstorm, many residents were impacted with the flooding.

415
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:34,787
[SPEAKER_17]: But to have excessive amounts of $6, $7, $8 million, in my opinion, and I think you're hearing it from some of the councilors, is about time that we finally go back to the taxpayer and say, you know what?

416
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,849
[SPEAKER_17]: It's time for an early Christmas gift this year.

417
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:44,914
[SPEAKER_17]: And it may seem like a small thing to save $45 for a single family or whatever it may be.

418
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:52,330
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think it speaks volumes to how this administration and how the city feels about the taxpayers.

419
00:28:53,071 --> 00:29:02,976
[SPEAKER_17]: And at some point, we're going to be looking at having reserves that you're not going to be able to explain why they're so large.

420
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:05,397
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know you're going to disagree with that.

421
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:18,051
[SPEAKER_17]: But we've seen an escalation since the new water meters of reserves that build up from deficits to now multi-million dollars in surpluses in the water and sewer account, which is great.

422
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:21,353
[SPEAKER_17]: But at what point do we stop building those reserves?

423
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:28,876
[SPEAKER_17]: And the way I see it is, you know, the city shouldn't have their hand in the taxpayer's pocket constantly.

424
00:29:29,582 --> 00:29:33,344
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, we should provide ample services to the residents.

425
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:38,066
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, we want to have a city that's moving forward, but to what extent?

426
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:41,187
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's the question that I have.

427
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:44,709
[SPEAKER_17]: And we never hear any talk about new growth.

428
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:56,654
[SPEAKER_17]: We never hear any talk about the revitalization of Method Square, which I may add has been under works by this administration for the past 25 years.

429
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:01,403
[SPEAKER_17]: The plan needs to be dusted off.

430
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:08,406
[SPEAKER_17]: We have three parcels of land in the downtown business district that's owned by the city of Method.

431
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:13,789
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know many other communities that can brag about that, but we have that in our community.

432
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:28,096
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're not taking advantage of these particular pieces of property that are being underutilized and can bring additional taxes in, and not from the beleaguered rate payer that's currently paying the bill right now.

433
00:30:29,135 --> 00:30:31,996
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we talked about surplus water and sewer.

434
00:30:32,256 --> 00:30:35,317
[SPEAKER_17]: We talked about free cash, cable franchise fees.

435
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:43,499
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't had a community cable access station in almost two years, but we're all paying a franchise fee right now.

436
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:53,882
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor has hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting in an account with the earmark to provide local community access, and it's not currently being used.

437
00:30:54,664 --> 00:31:06,255
[SPEAKER_17]: Does every franchise payer out there that's paying their franchise fee on their cable bill, whether you have Verizon or Comcast, do they deserve a break from this fee that's not being used for its purpose?

438
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:07,396
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe so.

439
00:31:08,337 --> 00:31:10,279
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would support this tonight.

440
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:24,451
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the million dollars will leave the surplus well primed to pay for anything that comes up, any emergencies or anything that needs to be done.

441
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:35,275
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it sends a message to the taxpayers of this community that, yes, if there are surpluses, you too will benefit in the surplus.

442
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:38,196
[SPEAKER_17]: And after all, it's your money.

443
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:41,793
[SPEAKER_17]: I will support this tonight, and I thank my colleague for bringing it up.

444
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:43,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councillor.

445
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:47,954
[SPEAKER_13]: One question for, and this is to move the conversation forward.

446
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:50,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Councillor Langel-Kern has an amendment to the original paper here.

447
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:59,998
[SPEAKER_13]: If the million dollar request is approved, where is the million dollars going to come to fund the budget that's currently in place?

448
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:04,519
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be certified free cash if the mayor submitted it, or would it be cuts?

449
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,800
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not sure I followed your question.

450
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,260
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you say it again?

451
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:17,822
[SPEAKER_13]: If Councillor Lungo-Kern's motion is approved to cut the levy by $1 million, where will that be made up from?

452
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:19,643
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll just come out of free cash.

453
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:24,245
[SPEAKER_13]: But that would have to be submitted by the mayor requesting us to take the free cash.

454
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,906
[SPEAKER_28]: This is just a request that would go to the council.

455
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:33,488
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not sure what the procedure would be for the mayor to... Well, maybe the question should be for the city solicitor then.

456
00:32:34,258 --> 00:32:44,300
[SPEAKER_13]: The request before us would basically be to cut the levy by $1 million and ask the mayor to submit a paper back to the council for certified free cash for that amount.

457
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that correct?

458
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:50,201
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor's input, actually this would normally, this type of thing would normally originate with the mayor.

459
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:50,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

460
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:51,661
[SPEAKER_18]: That's my question.

461
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:54,162
[SPEAKER_18]: So which makes this a little bit different.

462
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:57,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, I'm trying to follow this, just watching it.

463
00:32:58,002 --> 00:33:00,563
[SPEAKER_18]: This is what you're talking about the tax rate right now.

464
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:02,593
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, the levy.

465
00:33:03,054 --> 00:33:05,755
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to get voted on after the main paper.

466
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:13,917
[SPEAKER_13]: But if it goes through, the only way to fund that million dollars would be through either cuts or certified free cash.

467
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:15,658
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of clarification.

468
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:18,739
[SPEAKER_22]: That could be your opinion of what has to happen.

469
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:25,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Most likely, this budget is going to have another million dollars in free cash, as it's shown the last four years.

470
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,482
[SPEAKER_22]: So there wouldn't necessarily be cuts.

471
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:31,023
[SPEAKER_22]: We just might not be adding to the free cash account for this year.

472
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:32,544
[SPEAKER_22]: That is big.

473
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:38,168
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I've tried to say we shouldn't tax to the max for the last six years, wringing my head every June and December.

474
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,130
[SPEAKER_22]: When it comes December, they tell me I have to do it in June.

475
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:47,915
[SPEAKER_22]: I finally, you know, we finally figured it out, how much money is going into free cash, that we're overtaxing the taxpayers.

476
00:33:48,335 --> 00:33:52,418
[SPEAKER_22]: So most likely, we have at least a million dollars from this budget that's going to go into free cash.

477
00:33:52,738 --> 00:34:00,744
[SPEAKER_22]: So basically, we're not going to be putting, I mean, if things have gone, or more than a million, so if things are going the way they've gone the last five, six, seven years,

478
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:04,345
[SPEAKER_22]: We're just not going to be adding as much to free cash.

479
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:05,786
[SPEAKER_13]: We're sending the message.

480
00:34:05,806 --> 00:34:07,908
[SPEAKER_13]: What happens if it's 2010, though, when we were negative $500,000?

481
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:11,430
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going to be like 2010 with Director Burke.

482
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:15,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, with all due respect, we have a new governor that they're looking at 9C cuts right now.

483
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:15,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of clarification.

484
00:34:15,994 --> 00:34:16,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of clarification.

485
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:18,135
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

486
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:18,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me turn you on.

487
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:19,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, Councilor.

488
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:20,997
[SPEAKER_06]: On that 2010, Mr. President, it was $544,000.

489
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:21,718
[SPEAKER_06]: We're sitting on $7,594,000.

490
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:22,979
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a huge difference, even

491
00:34:30,387 --> 00:34:32,488
[SPEAKER_06]: even if you did go into the negative field next year.

492
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:33,869
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about this year.

493
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:36,511
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got $7,594,000.

494
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:37,732
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of money.

495
00:34:37,752 --> 00:34:40,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're only talking about taking a million out.

496
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:40,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Counselor.

497
00:34:41,474 --> 00:34:42,615
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Caraviello.

498
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:43,675
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

499
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:50,160
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, we voted on earlier this year to cut the tax rate $600,000 for the water, correct?

500
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,641
[SPEAKER_21]: The water and sewer rate.

501
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:53,402
[SPEAKER_21]: For the water and sewer?

502
00:34:53,562 --> 00:34:55,103
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, you cut the water and sewer rate.

503
00:34:55,323 --> 00:34:57,184
[SPEAKER_21]: We cut the water and sewer rate, $600,000 or so.

504
00:34:57,724 --> 00:34:58,725
[SPEAKER_21]: Where did that money come from?

505
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:01,348
[SPEAKER_21]: have we decided where that money has come from yet?

506
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:02,469
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you actually cut the budget.

507
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:02,769
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

508
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:08,312
[SPEAKER_28]: And when you cut the budget, the effect of that was to cut the potential rate because you cut the budget.

509
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:11,094
[SPEAKER_21]: So we've already cut our budget $600,000 this year.

510
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:15,317
[SPEAKER_28]: This would not be a budget point of clarification.

511
00:35:15,877 --> 00:35:23,843
[SPEAKER_06]: It might seem that way, but the Water and Sewer Commission just came out with their new rate structure, which is picking up during the course of the year, the difference for which this council voted for it, which is $800,000.

512
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:25,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It was $800,000.

513
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:28,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caviello, Vice President Caviello was correct.

514
00:35:28,183 --> 00:35:31,644
[SPEAKER_13]: The budget that was approved was not the mayor's original number.

515
00:35:31,664 --> 00:35:38,608
[SPEAKER_21]: We voted to cut the budget $600,000 in June, or whatever we voted for.

516
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:46,452
[SPEAKER_21]: A few weeks ago, you made a suggestion that we put $500,000, which I supported, into the unfunded liabilities.

517
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,033
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a million three already.

518
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,795
[SPEAKER_05]: That's up to the mayor.

519
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,863
[SPEAKER_21]: We have an underfunded liability in the city of a large amount of money.

520
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:08,748
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, like I said, the free cash is not always going to be there.

521
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we're all asking for a police station too, which is on the horizon, hopefully.

522
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:19,176
[SPEAKER_21]: A police station is a major priority in this community.

523
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:24,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of clarification, Councilor.

524
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,097
[SPEAKER_22]: A point of information on that.

525
00:36:25,157 --> 00:36:28,399
[SPEAKER_22]: If we can be guaranteed that savings is going to go towards a new police station.

526
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,019
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't say that.

527
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,641
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but that's not going to happen.

528
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:37,165
[SPEAKER_22]: He said it's going to be at least seven years, probably until we stop planning, another 15 years before we get a police station under that watch.

529
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:40,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

530
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:44,390
[SPEAKER_08]: That's only provided that the gentleman's there for another 15 or seven years.

531
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:49,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think every two years, everybody has the opportunity to, if they see fit, seek one of our office.

532
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,976
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they feel as though the city's going the proper course,

533
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:54,913
[SPEAKER_08]: or an improper course, they have every right to do that.

534
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:55,693
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

535
00:36:55,713 --> 00:37:00,455
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think right now, the issue before us is whether or not it's a good idea for us to reduce the tax levy by a million dollars.

536
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:03,036
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the real issue that's before us.

537
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:07,117
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a new governor coming in who has already said he's looking for cuts.

538
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:11,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Councillor Knight.

539
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:21,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the new governor just recently in the press has also discussed the idea of requiring municipalities to establish rainy day funds in order for

540
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,268
[SPEAKER_08]: them to maintain strong financial footing.

541
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:28,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Caravaglio.

542
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:35,813
[SPEAKER_21]: Unfortunately, Mr. President, our city is becoming a popular city and popularity costs money.

543
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:37,974
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

544
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:39,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Penta.

545
00:37:39,654 --> 00:37:40,175
[SPEAKER_15]: What does that mean?

546
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:42,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Huh?

547
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,577
[SPEAKER_06]: What does popularity mean?

548
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:46,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

549
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:49,252
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion for approval on the floor.

550
00:37:49,412 --> 00:37:51,053
[SPEAKER_06]: As you're referring to an administration.

551
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:54,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very hard community.

552
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:57,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, real estate wise, real estate wise.

553
00:37:57,196 --> 00:38:05,500
[SPEAKER_06]: And well, we, you know, we just got through talking about the state legislature passing a budget and they passed the budget knowing there was a $325 million deficit in the budget.

554
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that to me doesn't make them look like they're very,

555
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:12,779
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a lot of brains up there to figure out that they have a $325 million budget.

556
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:14,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Rep Donato's doing a fine job in my eyes.

557
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,180
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not talking about Representative Donato.

558
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,801
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about the state legislature.

559
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:19,521
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Rep Donato and his colleagues.

560
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:19,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

561
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:20,681
[SPEAKER_06]: That's in your opinion.

562
00:38:20,902 --> 00:38:21,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Bottom line is this.

563
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:22,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't have your cake and eat it.

564
00:38:24,162 --> 00:38:25,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a cake on the table here do you?

565
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:26,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week.

566
00:38:26,643 --> 00:38:27,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week.

567
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:27,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

568
00:38:27,383 --> 00:38:27,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring it in.

569
00:38:28,244 --> 00:38:36,106
[SPEAKER_06]: The bottom line to the whole thing is if you're astute as to what you're doing here and your local government and making sure that you're taking care of the taxpayers the best you can,

570
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:38,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a borderline issue for you?

571
00:38:38,103 --> 00:38:38,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it is.

572
00:38:38,923 --> 00:38:39,564
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it isn't.

573
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:45,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Because right now I feel comfortable in saying yes to getting rid of a million dollars because we're not down to the ground zero.

574
00:38:45,707 --> 00:38:48,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not at 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 4 million, 5 million.

575
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,530
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at $6.2 million left.

576
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:53,872
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that being said, I've got no problem with it.

577
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:57,594
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think any taxpayer out there would have a problem with it either because there's nothing.

578
00:38:57,883 --> 00:39:06,670
[SPEAKER_06]: before this podium, before this council, of a great magnitude that needs this money to be spent, other than the unfunded liability for the pensions and the OPED.

579
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:10,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And we haven't seen anything from the mayor, and that's been at his desks since September.

580
00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:12,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Penta, I disagree with you.

581
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:15,637
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I see tons of projects in the city.

582
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:17,338
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, where are they in front of us?

583
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:18,699
[SPEAKER_21]: You met on one tonight.

584
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Our school department, our school repairs,

585
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:25,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It was you, Councilor Caviello, on your first term.

586
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:34,247
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in the beginning of your second year of your first term, you produced a paper that said the school department was $1,200,000 in debt, and they haven't done anything to correct it.

587
00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:35,748
[SPEAKER_06]: But they just hired $2 million.

588
00:39:35,888 --> 00:39:40,132
[SPEAKER_21]: And I still advocate having these schools fixed.

589
00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:44,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Imagine if this city was paying the taxes on those schools.

590
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:50,380
[SPEAKER_21]: We were fortunate that through the funding of the government,

591
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:57,362
[SPEAKER_21]: The citizens of the city paid a minimal rate for $100 million with the schools.

592
00:39:59,163 --> 00:39:59,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

593
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:01,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Vice President.

594
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:11,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think it's apparent by the debate and dialogue that there are many options that we as a council and we as a city have for the utilization of the so-called certified free cash.

595
00:40:12,968 --> 00:40:16,650
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if we don't have any certified free cash, then we can't do anything.

596
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,231
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that those reserves are very important to the fiscal stability

597
00:40:20,782 --> 00:40:21,782
[SPEAKER_08]: of the city of Medford.

598
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:24,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that those reserves are something that we need to build up.

599
00:40:24,323 --> 00:40:25,343
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need to move away from them.

600
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:26,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to be ahead of the curve.

601
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:28,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's something that we can all agree on.

602
00:40:28,784 --> 00:40:29,744
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to be ahead of the curve.

603
00:40:29,784 --> 00:40:32,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a lot of uncertainty coming up in the next four years.

604
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:37,786
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a new administration coming in that historically has supported making cuts to local government, Mr. President.

605
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:40,266
[SPEAKER_08]: And for that reason and that reason alone, I'm voting against this resolution.

606
00:40:40,586 --> 00:40:40,846
Thank you.

607
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:41,586
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

608
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,627
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion for the first question before us.

609
00:40:45,335 --> 00:40:57,024
[SPEAKER_13]: is to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2015 by selecting the minimum residential factor, which the council has historically chosen this before us.

610
00:40:57,564 --> 00:41:07,511
[SPEAKER_13]: If this is, once again, the council's choice, the minimum residential factor is 0.899216 on the motion of Councilor De La Russo for approval.

611
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,593
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk will call the roll.

612
00:41:11,675 --> 00:41:13,176
[SPEAKER_13]: He has a different paper that's going to come up.

613
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:16,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Your paper is item 14-784.

614
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:20,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor, we'll run this meeting.

615
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:27,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you call the roll, please?

616
00:41:29,284 --> 00:41:31,225
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been a ruling of the chair requested.

617
00:41:32,466 --> 00:41:34,307
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk will call the roll on the ruling of the chair.

618
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:38,474
[SPEAKER_05]: The ruling of the chair is being doubted.

619
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:41,496
[SPEAKER_05]: An amendment always precedes the main motion.

620
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:43,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me turn this on so the people at home can see your behavior.

621
00:41:43,697 --> 00:41:44,998
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you should hear it.

622
00:41:45,018 --> 00:41:47,600
[SPEAKER_13]: The amendment precedes the main motion, Mr. President.

623
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:47,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

624
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Know your rules of order.

625
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:49,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, councillor.

626
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk will call the roll on the paper.

627
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,204
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been before us for a week.

628
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:59,667
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not, uh, it's not, it's not, section 22 is not available.

629
00:41:59,707 --> 00:42:00,808
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk will call the roll on this.

630
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:08,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caravaglia, before the motion is called.

631
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:19,549
[SPEAKER_21]: Before we call, maybe could we have an interpretation from the city solicitor before we put some guidance on the city solicitor before we move on with this?

632
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:27,152
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, parliamentary matters are ruled on by the chair and it's part of parliamentary procedure to have the chair challenged.

633
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:28,852
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's not a legal question.

634
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:34,955
[SPEAKER_18]: The second issue, and I'm kind of just speculating here on what's going on, but the second thing is,

635
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:43,295
[SPEAKER_18]: As to section 22, section 22 applies whenever an ordinance, order, or resolution can take all of its readings in one sitting or one night.

636
00:42:43,836 --> 00:42:48,578
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's kind of a safety valve to stop something from being buffaloed through.

637
00:42:48,878 --> 00:42:54,261
[SPEAKER_18]: But as I understand this paper, although I wasn't here, it was before the council last week and tabled at that time.

638
00:42:54,881 --> 00:42:57,023
[SPEAKER_18]: So section 22 can only be invoked once.

639
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,264
[SPEAKER_18]: And it has been, as I understand it.

640
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:04,028
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, but the chair rules on that.

641
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:05,149
[SPEAKER_18]: You've challenged the chair.

642
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:06,730
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a, there's a process for that.

643
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:06,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Yup.

644
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:15,096
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the challenge of the chair, we have a gentleman that would like to speak on this.

645
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:18,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, sir.

646
00:43:19,238 --> 00:43:21,560
[SPEAKER_27]: Robert Capucci at 71 Evans street.

647
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,982
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

648
00:43:24,022 --> 00:43:24,362
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

649
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:29,568
[SPEAKER_27]: City Councilors, a few things that came up tonight I have to speak about.

650
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:32,490
[SPEAKER_27]: Just I'll try to be as brief as possible.

651
00:43:33,491 --> 00:43:33,691
[SPEAKER_27]: Ms.

652
00:43:33,952 --> 00:43:39,937
[SPEAKER_27]: Baker, who spoke and didn't, liked the term abuse used by Councilor Penta.

653
00:43:41,198 --> 00:43:51,106
[SPEAKER_27]: Those of us that are living in providing you with all these excess funds, Massachusetts is seventh on the list of most moved out of states.

654
00:43:51,606 --> 00:43:53,548
[SPEAKER_27]: We are highest per capita

655
00:43:54,045 --> 00:43:58,588
[SPEAKER_27]: out of any other state in the nation as the highest tax state.

656
00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:07,034
[SPEAKER_27]: Through the chair to Councilor Knight, he wants to talk about a new administration coming in with historic cuts.

657
00:44:07,054 --> 00:44:10,836
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the first time Charlie Baker will be governor of Massachusetts.

658
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:12,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

659
00:44:12,978 --> 00:44:23,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I referred to Mr. Baker in his role as Secretary of the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, at which time the administration underneath Governor Romney, I believe,

660
00:44:23,776 --> 00:44:37,807
[SPEAKER_08]: made unprecedented cuts under section 9c of the general laws, allowing them to cut local aid after the state budget has been passed, which left cities and towns in a very, very precarious position because they had already budgeted based upon figures that were provided to them.

661
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:49,496
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I'm a little concerned about the uncertainty of what his ideology will be, coupled with the fact that he publicly came out and supported the idea

662
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:58,576
[SPEAKER_08]: of local municipalities establishing rainy day funds, and this possibly being a requirement, would lead me to believe that this is something that he's going to keep his eyes on, Mr. President.

663
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:06,018
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, two points, Councilor Penta, excuse me, Councilor Camuso to Councilor Knight through the chair.

664
00:45:07,258 --> 00:45:12,820
[SPEAKER_27]: We've just had eight years of the Patrick administration who has already cut aid to cities and towns.

665
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:18,305
[SPEAKER_27]: this city was still able to create the $7 million surplus under that.

666
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:25,972
[SPEAKER_27]: Governor Patrick has repeatedly blamed the federal government for his having to cut aid to cities and towns.

667
00:45:27,453 --> 00:45:32,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Another point I would like to make is, what was the other part of what you said?

668
00:45:33,794 --> 00:45:37,957
[SPEAKER_08]: recently in the press, he's come out and spoke about the need for a rainy day fund in municipalities.

669
00:45:37,977 --> 00:45:44,521
[SPEAKER_27]: The citizens of Medford who are paying these taxes, we'd like to have some rainy day funds in our pockets.

670
00:45:45,182 --> 00:45:53,807
[SPEAKER_27]: And if taking a million dollars out of a $7 million surplus is going to allow, I mean, I don't see the city of Medford having bake sales.

671
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:58,250
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't see the city of Medford manufacturing products and selling them to the market.

672
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,851
[SPEAKER_27]: Government doesn't make

673
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:03,990
[SPEAKER_27]: any money at all until it levies a tax on the citizens.

674
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,014
[SPEAKER_27]: We want to make Medford an attractive and popular town.

675
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:11,097
[SPEAKER_27]: We do that by cutting tax rates.

676
00:46:11,457 --> 00:46:17,643
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think there should be a property tax increase on the residential properties or the commercial properties.

677
00:46:18,103 --> 00:46:22,347
[SPEAKER_27]: We gotta make Medford attractive because Somerville has taken off ahead of us.

678
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:26,131
[SPEAKER_27]: And as far as alluding to those four votes,

679
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:33,717
[SPEAKER_27]: that come up, this city's constantly being told, next time for the police station, next time for the dark park.

680
00:46:34,217 --> 00:46:48,348
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, next time is now, and we do have city elections coming up next year, and I hope everybody within the sound of my voice hears it, because we need that fourth vote here on the council, or we need a new administration in the corner office.

681
00:46:48,689 --> 00:46:49,469
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much.

682
00:46:52,011 --> 00:46:53,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record.

683
00:46:53,412 --> 00:46:55,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Anthony D'Antonio, excuse me, Yale Street.

684
00:46:59,173 --> 00:47:00,793
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it happens every year.

685
00:47:01,174 --> 00:47:05,616
[SPEAKER_03]: The budget comes out, we all argue over the numbers, rightfully so.

686
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:18,703
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem exists at the conception of the budget, which, having moved back here to Medford several years back and watched how it operates, I'm disgusted with how this budget gets put together.

687
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:22,565
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say and defend everybody and anybody you want, but

688
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:31,931
[SPEAKER_03]: that nobody's worrying about the person who's on a fixed income right now, who's probably at home sweating, saying, am I going to be able to buy prescription drugs after this tax increase goes through?

689
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:34,052
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making $1,100 a month.

690
00:47:34,673 --> 00:47:36,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Figure that and having a household that they own.

691
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:39,465
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to put yourselves in their shoes.

692
00:47:39,505 --> 00:47:46,532
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times, elected officials, you're not affected by the laws that you create, by the rules, by the budgets, because you get that.

693
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:48,273
[SPEAKER_03]: You can handle it.

694
00:47:48,293 --> 00:47:49,394
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got that money coming in.

695
00:47:49,714 --> 00:47:51,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't mean that in a derogatory manner.

696
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:53,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying that people do not have it now.

697
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:56,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Electric rates are going up.

698
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Water rates are going up.

699
00:47:57,902 --> 00:47:58,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's going up.

700
00:47:58,823 --> 00:47:59,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

701
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:01,745
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuel and everything is going down right now.

702
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:02,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait.

703
00:48:02,706 --> 00:48:03,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch what happens after.

704
00:48:04,205 --> 00:48:09,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be last forever, but you've got to stop working for the administration and work for the people.

705
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,749
[SPEAKER_03]: When you say you do it, do it.

706
00:48:12,229 --> 00:48:15,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the majority of the council does not work for the people in the city of Medford.

707
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm disappointed in that because it affects everybody.

708
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:21,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It affects people that want to come here.

709
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:23,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just, you're not looking at the total picture.

710
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:28,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as the new administration coming in, it's time that we have a change in it.

711
00:48:28,677 --> 00:48:30,798
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time that we get somebody that maybe has to say,

712
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:34,757
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for you cities and towns to take on some of this fiscal responsibility.

713
00:48:35,197 --> 00:48:36,077
[SPEAKER_03]: This is insanity.

714
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:41,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't keep putting your hand in my pocket, in my neighbor's pocket, and everybody else in the city of Medford.

715
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,362
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta do it at the onset, where it counts.

716
00:48:44,682 --> 00:48:52,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you tell me you can't find room to cut the budget and make it a better city, then you're not doing your job because it's there, all right?

717
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they ought to start reading a book on it.

718
00:49:03,927 --> 00:49:07,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Mass.

719
00:49:08,432 --> 00:49:25,328
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, when my car drives down Garfield Ave., and it goes in a pothole after pothole after pothole after National Grid cut the street up, Mrs. Baker, all due respect, my car feels abused, and yet this City Council, four members, got themselves a raise.

720
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, if you're going to take our money... The raise is for all members of the council.

721
00:49:29,495 --> 00:49:30,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven members of this council.

722
00:49:30,896 --> 00:49:32,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Four members voted for it.

723
00:49:32,596 --> 00:49:34,217
[SPEAKER_13]: The entire council voted for the raise.

724
00:49:34,317 --> 00:49:34,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Check the record.

725
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:39,460
[SPEAKER_13]: It's absolutely true, councillor.

726
00:49:42,762 --> 00:49:43,863
[SPEAKER_13]: We will take... We'll give you the minutes.

727
00:49:43,883 --> 00:49:44,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead, sir.

728
00:49:44,303 --> 00:49:44,863
[SPEAKER_13]: You have the floor.

729
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, again, you're calling me incorrect when I was here.

730
00:49:48,425 --> 00:49:50,366
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe, maybe, maybe I'm dumb.

731
00:49:50,386 --> 00:49:51,827
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll provide you with a copy of the minutes.

732
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:56,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I was here, I heard the vote, and three people voted against, and four people voted for.

733
00:49:56,491 --> 00:50:05,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the mayor got a raise, so you people, you know, Paul, you get $82,000 at the sheriff's office, that's public record, and then you get about another 30, 32 here.

734
00:50:05,296 --> 00:50:06,777
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a lot of money.

735
00:50:07,057 --> 00:50:07,558
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct.

736
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:14,341
[SPEAKER_10]: And the citizens deserve a break, Paul, you know, because this is our money, and it's very, very hard.

737
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:16,763
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very, very hard for people

738
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:23,533
[SPEAKER_10]: to put that money out there and want to go to the city council or to public access to have free speech and be interrupted all the time.

739
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:29,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you know, I was at a press conference last week and I'm paying for this.

740
00:50:29,135 --> 00:50:29,915
[SPEAKER_10]: You're paying for this.

741
00:50:30,336 --> 00:50:31,436
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking to Comcast.

742
00:50:31,776 --> 00:50:32,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Who interrupts me?

743
00:50:32,657 --> 00:50:33,717
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor shuts me off.

744
00:50:34,477 --> 00:50:36,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was America, not Havana.

745
00:50:36,638 --> 00:50:38,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we had free speech rights.

746
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:42,481
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking to the cable TV provider that I paid what over 10 grand to.

747
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:47,703
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't speak because the mayor beelines it for the podium.

748
00:50:47,823 --> 00:50:50,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we're going to talk about access next week because I have a new station coming in.

749
00:50:50,904 --> 00:50:51,944
[SPEAKER_10]: There'll be a press conference.

750
00:50:51,964 --> 00:50:53,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, where's the press conference we're paying for?

751
00:50:54,045 --> 00:50:55,025
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a city budget.

752
00:50:55,646 --> 00:50:57,246
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor works for us, not himself.

753
00:50:58,947 --> 00:51:00,027
[SPEAKER_10]: You people work for us.

754
00:51:00,647 --> 00:51:08,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And this council has to be proactive because that fellow, as nice a guy as he is outside of City Hall, and I like Mayor McGlynn outside of City Hall.

755
00:51:08,807 --> 00:51:09,347
[SPEAKER_10]: I really do.

756
00:51:09,687 --> 00:51:13,728
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm taping the lighting of the Christmas tree years ago, and the mayor's smiling.

757
00:51:14,168 --> 00:51:14,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice man.

758
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:16,269
[SPEAKER_10]: But is he a leader?

759
00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:16,529
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

760
00:51:17,249 --> 00:51:19,149
[SPEAKER_10]: No, he's self-serving.

761
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,650
[SPEAKER_10]: This budget is very important.

762
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why there aren't 30,000 people banging on this door.

763
00:51:25,051 --> 00:51:25,651
[SPEAKER_10]: They're afraid.

764
00:51:25,871 --> 00:51:27,011
[SPEAKER_10]: I've talked to people around town.

765
00:51:27,031 --> 00:51:29,292
[SPEAKER_10]: They say, Joe, they just think it's a lost cause.

766
00:51:29,312 --> 00:51:30,212
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't fight City Hall.

767
00:51:30,252 --> 00:51:32,853
[SPEAKER_10]: You can fight City Hall because we own City Hall.

768
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:33,493
[SPEAKER_10]: It's our money.

769
00:51:35,081 --> 00:51:43,744
[SPEAKER_10]: You people have our money, and I thank the three and a half councilors here that do the right thing, and I hope that half a councilor falls on the right side of the fence this time.

770
00:51:47,926 --> 00:51:48,246
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

771
00:51:48,746 --> 00:51:49,446
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Lococo.

772
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:50,006
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

773
00:51:50,146 --> 00:51:50,667
[SPEAKER_22]: Last comment.

774
00:51:50,747 --> 00:51:51,967
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Camuso.

775
00:51:52,387 --> 00:51:58,349
[SPEAKER_22]: I just bluntly feel that maybe one councilor might be on the fence, and I just wanted to make a statement.

776
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,331
[SPEAKER_22]: We're letting the administration know that, you know,

777
00:52:03,978 --> 00:52:06,599
[SPEAKER_22]: What they're doing in creating a surplus is a good thing.

778
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:08,360
[SPEAKER_22]: What Director Burke is doing is a great thing.

779
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:16,063
[SPEAKER_22]: But we're saying this tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, spend, save, save, save has to be balanced out a little bit.

780
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,883
[SPEAKER_22]: We can always change it next year.

781
00:52:18,184 --> 00:52:26,007
[SPEAKER_22]: We can always, hopefully this maintains and we have a surplus on top of this amount in free cash this year.

782
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:31,069
[SPEAKER_22]: But we always have a vote in June and a vote next December that will all be us.

783
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:33,709
[SPEAKER_22]: January will be the change.

784
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,052
[SPEAKER_22]: This year, we're sending a message.

785
00:52:38,012 --> 00:52:40,774
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, Councilor Pence talked about it a couple weeks ago.

786
00:52:41,535 --> 00:52:44,317
[SPEAKER_22]: School Department, from what I understand, created a job for 90,000.

787
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,019
[SPEAKER_22]: Administrators are getting large raises.

788
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:50,762
[SPEAKER_22]: This has been happening, you know, I know of them years past, still happening.

789
00:52:51,443 --> 00:52:52,604
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's tighten our belts.

790
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:54,285
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's start here.

791
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:56,467
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been trying to do this for five or six years now.

792
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:57,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's start here.

793
00:52:57,247 --> 00:53:01,390
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the way to do it, considering how much is being put into free cash each year since 2010.

794
00:53:02,908 --> 00:53:07,511
[SPEAKER_22]: And believe me, Director Burke did it since she started.

795
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:08,852
[SPEAKER_22]: It's going to happen again.

796
00:53:10,793 --> 00:53:11,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Do it how you run your household.

797
00:53:12,614 --> 00:53:14,775
[SPEAKER_22]: You make money, you spend money, you save money.

798
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:23,321
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't tax the people from every different angle that you can to the maximum every single year.

799
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:25,442
[SPEAKER_22]: And the speakers are right.

800
00:53:26,022 --> 00:53:26,903
[SPEAKER_22]: People need a break.

801
00:53:27,263 --> 00:53:32,026
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're going to hear it in January, February when the calls start coming in and the emails start coming in.

802
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:35,087
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm moving out of MedFed because I can't afford this.

803
00:53:35,147 --> 00:53:37,810
[SPEAKER_22]: This $200, $300 increase, I can't afford it.

804
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,351
[SPEAKER_22]: Or the commercial properties.

805
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:40,572
[SPEAKER_22]: Why are you killing us?

806
00:53:40,612 --> 00:53:41,753
[SPEAKER_22]: We're trying to run a business.

807
00:53:42,393 --> 00:53:43,975
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's send a message tonight.

808
00:53:45,136 --> 00:53:46,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Lungo-Kern.

809
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:50,460
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

810
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And for the record, for the gentleman that was just at the podium, paper 14-098,

811
00:53:56,757 --> 00:54:00,460
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a motion by Councilor Marks on a roll call vote of three in the affirmative and four in the negative.

812
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,540
[SPEAKER_13]: The amendments failed.

813
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:07,024
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on the final motion regarding the increase to pay for the department heads and the city council was included.

814
00:54:07,585 --> 00:54:15,871
[SPEAKER_13]: It was upon the motion by President Calamuso from the floor that all three readings be waived and to be ordained on a roll call vote of seven in the affirmative.

815
00:54:16,331 --> 00:54:19,113
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all members of this council and zero in the negative.

816
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:19,834
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was ordained.

817
00:54:20,274 --> 00:54:21,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta.

818
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:24,417
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why that that was ordained because everyone else was mixed into that vote.

819
00:54:24,657 --> 00:54:27,338
[SPEAKER_14]: The council had a separate vote.

820
00:54:28,078 --> 00:54:28,858
[SPEAKER_14]: You just read it.

821
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:29,738
[SPEAKER_06]: You just read it.

822
00:54:29,758 --> 00:54:30,739
[SPEAKER_14]: You voted for the whole paper.

823
00:54:30,759 --> 00:54:35,020
[SPEAKER_14]: You read it for the whole paper because other people in the city were waiting for those raises.

824
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,160
[SPEAKER_14]: You were the first one at the bank.

825
00:54:40,882 --> 00:54:41,322
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

826
00:54:42,582 --> 00:54:44,202
[SPEAKER_13]: The city auditor.

827
00:54:44,663 --> 00:54:45,563
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to say one thing.

828
00:54:46,143 --> 00:54:50,404
[SPEAKER_28]: My motivation, my mission here is to just see that a tax rate gets passed.

829
00:54:50,824 --> 00:54:52,065
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to say one thing.

830
00:54:54,183 --> 00:55:06,168
[SPEAKER_28]: The tax rate has to be passed here before then it goes to the Department of Revenue to be approved there, before it can come back to the city to start the process of getting tax bills in the mail.

831
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:19,394
[SPEAKER_28]: If we don't get tax bills in the mail by January 1st, to be due on February 1st, we will not have tax bills due on February 1st, they won't be due until May 1st, and the cash flow in the city will be disrupted.

832
00:55:19,574 --> 00:55:20,815
[SPEAKER_28]: I just implore you to

833
00:55:22,297 --> 00:55:36,745
[SPEAKER_28]: finish the process, whatever process you want to pursue, to finalize a rate so we can get it to the Department of Revenue and get a tax rate approved to get the bills in the mail, because otherwise the cash flow will be a problem.

834
00:55:37,385 --> 00:55:38,185
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the only thing I want to say.

835
00:55:38,565 --> 00:55:39,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

836
00:55:39,386 --> 00:55:42,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question for Mr. O'Neill.

837
00:55:44,128 --> 00:55:48,971
[SPEAKER_08]: If, in fact, the levy limit set at the 2.5% increase from last year,

838
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:52,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to reduce the tax levy just by a monetary amount.

839
00:55:54,024 --> 00:55:59,368
[SPEAKER_08]: But that wouldn't necessarily reduce the tax levy, correct, for next year?

840
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,472
[SPEAKER_08]: An excess levy or an excess levy limit?

841
00:56:04,433 --> 00:56:13,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Through you, Mr. President, that would be actually, there's a line on the recap on page two at the bottom.

842
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:14,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It says 3D.

843
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:28,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Other revenue sources appropriated specifically to reduce the tax rate are free cash appropriated on June 30th and on or before July 1st of 2014.

844
00:56:29,474 --> 00:56:34,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So that figure would go into that spot on the recap sheet.

845
00:56:34,596 --> 00:56:35,737
[SPEAKER_04]: So the levy would stay the same.

846
00:56:36,877 --> 00:56:43,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And then next year, if in fact we didn't do the $1 million reduction and the tax levy limit went up another 2.5%, we'd see

847
00:56:44,906 --> 00:56:51,110
[SPEAKER_08]: the recuperation of that million dollars that was cut as well as another 2.5% increase if in fact that was adopted.

848
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:51,650
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

849
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:52,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

850
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:52,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

851
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:54,632
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't, you don't, you don't lose that.

852
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:59,474
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the handout from last Tuesday, page two of the levy limit.

853
00:57:00,355 --> 00:57:12,582
[SPEAKER_04]: If you care to go over that, um, counselor halfway down, you take fiscal year 2014 on the far right, just about halfway down the levy limit.

854
00:57:13,282 --> 00:57:25,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Add the 2.5%, which is 2.3 million, plus the new growth, which has just been approved at 999,941, gives you a levy limit of 96504, which is the starting point for next year.

855
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:32,954
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not taking it off the levy limit.

856
00:57:32,974 --> 00:57:34,555
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not taking it off the levy, so next.

857
00:57:34,575 --> 00:57:36,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Appropriation on page two on the recap.

858
00:57:37,238 --> 00:57:42,999
[SPEAKER_08]: So next year, when the tax rates set, that figure at $96 million or five is still the levy limit plus the 2.5%.

859
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:46,160
[SPEAKER_08]: The levy limit doesn't go down to $95 million.

860
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:54,701
[SPEAKER_05]: The levy limit stays at $96 million.

861
00:57:54,781 --> 00:58:01,582
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it comes off the money collected for the 2.5%.

862
00:58:01,802 --> 00:58:02,922
[SPEAKER_28]: It just reduced the levy.

863
00:58:02,942 --> 00:58:04,463
[SPEAKER_28]: It reduced the tax levy on the recap.

864
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:05,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially does the same thing.

865
00:58:06,497 --> 00:58:08,058
[SPEAKER_08]: But the percentage stays the same, correct?

866
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:14,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it wouldn't change the tax levy from 2.5% to whatever the factor would be, minus the million.

867
00:58:14,504 --> 00:58:15,584
[SPEAKER_08]: The levy stays at the 2.5% exclusion, right?

868
00:58:15,604 --> 00:58:18,207
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't have that option to earmark 1.5.

869
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:18,947
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

870
00:58:19,067 --> 00:58:28,855
[SPEAKER_04]: You do it essentially getting to that same point by appropriating money and inserting it in page 2 in the recap, reducing the levy on page 1 at the top of the recap.

871
00:58:29,416 --> 00:58:31,557
[SPEAKER_28]: So the excess capacity, instead of being $57,000, would be $1,057,000.

872
00:58:35,324 --> 00:58:45,431
[SPEAKER_08]: But next year, when you open the tax levy, it's going to include that million that was just cut plus the additional 2.5% on top of the 96 million.

873
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:48,393
[SPEAKER_28]: You don't lose that million.

874
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:59,722
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's safe to say that if, in fact, there's no reduction in the levy limit next year, that people see an increase of this million dollars that we're pushing, that we're not going to be spending

875
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:05,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, but it still stays in the levy limit for next year for when they collect.

876
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:09,654
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, the tax rate is a function of trying to meet the budget.

877
00:59:10,174 --> 00:59:11,955
[SPEAKER_28]: It all goes back to the budget.

878
00:59:11,975 --> 00:59:13,896
[SPEAKER_28]: We're not trying to raise it to the max.

879
00:59:13,936 --> 00:59:17,938
[SPEAKER_28]: We're just trying to fund the budget in the fairest way we can come up with.

880
00:59:22,741 --> 00:59:28,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, but what I'm saying is the levy limit right now as proposed would be $96.5 million, right?

881
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,480
[SPEAKER_28]: plus two and a half percent.

882
00:59:33,401 --> 00:59:35,001
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be- That's the levy limit, right.

883
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:38,943
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look on the recap page one, it's 96, 446, 667.33.

884
00:59:41,864 --> 00:59:44,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Page one on the recap, it's page 11 in the handout from last week.

885
00:59:44,445 --> 00:59:45,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed it something here?

886
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:45,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Page one is this.

887
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sheet 11, okay.

888
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:57,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Sheet 11, page one at the top, third line down the right.

889
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:02,975
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, yeah, that's right.

890
01:00:36,293 --> 01:00:44,018
[SPEAKER_06]: President, I make a motion to sever the motion to allow Councilor Lengelkorn's motion to prevail.

891
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,020
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

892
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,642
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Lengelkorn, do you have a dollar amount?

893
01:00:48,662 --> 01:00:51,604
[SPEAKER_13]: $1 million, I think.

894
01:00:51,624 --> 01:00:52,264
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you said $980,000.

895
01:00:52,985 --> 01:00:52,264
$940,000, $5,000, $322,000.

896
01:00:58,128 --> 01:01:02,692
[SPEAKER_13]: And did you calculate what the minimum residential factor is going to be if indeed this passes?

897
01:01:03,792 --> 01:01:04,633
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we get to that vote?

898
01:01:05,344 --> 01:01:06,525
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that will stay the same.

899
01:01:06,965 --> 01:01:07,706
[SPEAKER_06]: That will stay the same.

900
01:01:07,726 --> 01:01:08,306
[SPEAKER_13]: That will stay the same.

901
01:01:08,827 --> 01:01:09,247
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it won't.

902
01:01:09,487 --> 01:01:11,909
[SPEAKER_13]: That will change as well if we- No, it stays the same.

903
01:01:11,989 --> 01:01:12,570
[SPEAKER_13]: It stays the same.

904
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:13,230
[SPEAKER_13]: It stays the same.

905
01:01:13,411 --> 01:01:13,591
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

906
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:19,716
[SPEAKER_21]: On that motion- Mr. President, so I may make sure I understand this.

907
01:01:19,736 --> 01:01:23,198
[SPEAKER_21]: So the residential tax exemption stays the same, correct?

908
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:23,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

909
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:29,023
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a- This- This is for question- Councilman Kern's motion.

910
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:31,265
[SPEAKER_13]: This is similar to the paper she has later in the meeting.

911
01:01:31,765 --> 01:01:31,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

912
01:01:32,206 --> 01:01:34,848
[SPEAKER_21]: So at this particular moment, we're voting on question one.

913
01:01:35,494 --> 01:01:38,316
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to vote on Council Lungo's motion.

914
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:40,617
[SPEAKER_13]: A motion to reduce the tax levy.

915
01:01:40,637 --> 01:01:42,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to, Council Lungo Kern?

916
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:42,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Explain it.

917
01:01:43,479 --> 01:01:49,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we make a motion to table it, take your other paper, and then whatever the results of your other paper is.

918
01:01:50,423 --> 01:01:55,086
[SPEAKER_22]: My other paper will be moved.

919
01:01:55,106 --> 01:01:57,068
[SPEAKER_22]: We're reducing the tax levy just like

920
01:01:59,702 --> 01:02:03,223
[SPEAKER_22]: Auditor Baker mentioned, so we were not taxing to the max.

921
01:02:03,283 --> 01:02:07,525
[SPEAKER_22]: We had 57,000 we were told last week that we didn't tax up to.

922
01:02:07,745 --> 01:02:11,746
[SPEAKER_22]: Now we're going to be, whether that's a million or 945,000, plus the 57,000, we will not be taxing.

923
01:02:11,786 --> 01:02:13,727
[SPEAKER_22]: What's the number, the ultimate number at the end?

924
01:02:13,747 --> 01:02:13,727
945,333. 945,333.

925
01:02:24,429 --> 01:02:32,112
[SPEAKER_22]: 322 is last year's dollar amount that was put into free cash, which is the lowest of the last four years.

926
01:02:32,132 --> 01:02:32,192
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

927
01:02:32,512 --> 01:02:32,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

928
01:02:32,772 --> 01:02:38,494
[SPEAKER_09]: When we do that, what will the tax rate go down to from $11.7 million to what?

929
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:50,463
[SPEAKER_04]: For you, Mr. President, I did not prepare a 945 scenario.

930
01:02:50,483 --> 01:02:52,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I prepared the 1 million.

931
01:02:52,904 --> 01:02:57,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And the 1 million would drop the tax rate, residential 12 cents, and the commercial 24 cents.

932
01:02:57,165 --> 01:02:58,745
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost doubled it.

933
01:02:58,805 --> 01:02:59,766
[SPEAKER_21]: It would drop down to 11?

934
01:02:59,806 --> 01:02:59,766
11.58.

935
01:02:59,826 --> 01:03:01,346
[SPEAKER_04]: 11.58, and the commercial would go down to?

936
01:03:01,366 --> 01:03:01,346
22.53.

937
01:03:01,386 --> 01:03:04,687
[SPEAKER_21]: 22.53.

938
01:03:01,406 --> 01:03:04,687
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody fall down in the hallway, or are they just sitting there?

939
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:27,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Move the question.

940
01:03:29,752 --> 01:03:34,054
[SPEAKER_13]: On the question where this is a money paper, this will be a roll call vote.

941
01:03:34,854 --> 01:03:35,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk will call the roll.

942
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:39,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Could you re-read the motion please?

943
01:03:40,197 --> 01:03:50,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically the paper 14-784 council, correct?

944
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:58,862
[SPEAKER_13]: $1,000,000 and insert the other number.

945
01:03:58,942 --> 01:04:00,502
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not an average of the last three years.

946
01:04:00,562 --> 01:04:02,503
[SPEAKER_22]: If we average the last three years, it would be much higher.

947
01:04:03,743 --> 01:04:11,707
[SPEAKER_22]: But for Councillor Caviello to... We just got these numbers on Friday, so when I wrote this, I wasn't aware of the free cash figures.

948
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:26,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Carabello.

949
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:27,861
[SPEAKER_11]: One second, please.

950
01:04:30,962 --> 01:04:31,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President.

951
01:04:31,983 --> 01:04:32,723
[SPEAKER_11]: One second, please.

952
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:39,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I couldn't hear you.

953
01:04:41,427 --> 01:04:41,807
I'm sorry.

954
01:04:41,847 --> 01:04:42,007
No.

955
01:04:42,047 --> 01:04:44,528
Councilor Dababuka.

956
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:45,029
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

957
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:47,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Ntuker.

958
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:47,570
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

959
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:49,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Martins.

960
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:50,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

961
01:04:50,831 --> 01:04:51,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Paterson.

962
01:04:51,492 --> 01:04:51,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

963
01:04:53,947 --> 01:04:56,908
[SPEAKER_13]: No, three in the affirmative, four in the negative, the motion fails.

964
01:04:57,728 --> 01:05:05,911
[SPEAKER_13]: The next paper before us is on a motion of approval by Councilor DelaRusso to accept the minimum residential factor of 0.899216.

965
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:10,152
[SPEAKER_13]: The council has traditionally voted yes on this.

966
01:05:10,592 --> 01:05:12,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote, Mr. Clerk.

967
01:05:16,894 --> 01:05:18,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, can I be offered?

968
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:18,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

969
01:05:20,137 --> 01:05:21,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Del Rosso?

970
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:21,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

971
01:05:22,558 --> 01:05:23,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

972
01:05:23,278 --> 01:05:23,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

973
01:05:23,538 --> 01:05:25,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Member Kern?

974
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:37,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on one second.

975
01:05:47,258 --> 01:05:48,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Langel-Kern, is that you?

976
01:05:48,879 --> 01:05:52,803
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is to, for the residential factor.

977
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:58,668
[SPEAKER_13]: To accept the minimum residential factor.

978
01:05:58,748 --> 01:05:58,988
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

979
01:06:02,631 --> 01:06:03,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Neill.

980
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:03,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

981
01:06:04,953 --> 01:06:05,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Franklin.

982
01:06:05,954 --> 01:06:06,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

983
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:07,975
[SPEAKER_09]: President Wilson.

984
01:06:08,316 --> 01:06:11,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, by a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the paper passes.

985
01:06:12,499 --> 01:06:15,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Item number two, to adopt an open space discount.

986
01:06:16,745 --> 01:06:23,671
[SPEAKER_13]: The City of Medford has traditionally voted no on this, but it does not apply in the City of Medford, according to the paper before us.

987
01:06:25,533 --> 01:06:27,194
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion, the clerk will call the roll.

988
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:31,077
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

989
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:31,177
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

990
01:06:31,197 --> 01:06:31,257
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

991
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:45,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, before the roll is called.

992
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:22,066
[SPEAKER_06]: You gave us, Mr. O'Neill, you gave us some examples of what the rate would be.

993
01:07:22,086 --> 01:07:32,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I did some research as it relates to our sister city of Somerville, which is up to 35%, and I guess my question to you is this.

994
01:07:34,595 --> 01:07:40,860
[SPEAKER_06]: If in fact the city decides to vote this either yes or no, is this one of, is this,

995
01:07:42,363 --> 01:07:48,305
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the four things we're going to vote on that could be changed at any time during the forthcoming year?

996
01:07:48,685 --> 01:07:51,365
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, this has to be adopted now, yes or no?

997
01:07:51,626 --> 01:07:53,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Or could this number three be put on hold?

998
01:07:56,047 --> 01:07:58,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Three, Mr. President, it should be voted on tonight.

999
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's voted on tonight?

1000
01:07:59,948 --> 01:08:04,969
[SPEAKER_04]: What Somerville did was a home rule petition to exceed that amount.

1001
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:08,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And that seems to be now, I think there were a couple of communities that

1002
01:08:09,578 --> 01:08:12,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I think initiated that early in the tax rate process.

1003
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the law allows up to 20%.

1004
01:08:16,742 --> 01:08:19,964
[SPEAKER_04]: They go at 30, I believe Cambridge and Boston have 30 as well.

1005
01:08:20,044 --> 01:08:20,964
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're up to 35.

1006
01:08:21,024 --> 01:08:21,765
[SPEAKER_06]: They would have proved up to 35%.

1007
01:08:21,805 --> 01:08:23,225
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the first one to go to 35.

1008
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:23,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1009
01:08:23,806 --> 01:08:24,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1010
01:08:24,606 --> 01:08:29,329
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is this, if the council votes, however, they vote a number three, which is this one coming up.

1011
01:08:29,589 --> 01:08:32,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And this one says up to an extension of 20%.

1012
01:08:32,771 --> 01:08:37,333
[SPEAKER_06]: If the council were to vote to change that, strike that vote to accept the exemption,

1013
01:08:38,168 --> 01:08:41,490
[SPEAKER_06]: and change the number, 5, 10, 15, 20, 20%, whatever it might be.

1014
01:08:43,511 --> 01:08:46,833
[SPEAKER_06]: When does that become effective on the tax base rate?

1015
01:08:47,513 --> 01:08:52,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be after July 1st of 2015, or would it be January 1st of 2016?

1016
01:08:54,717 --> 01:08:58,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the council can only vote currently in the statute up to 20%.

1017
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:01,460
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have to be a home rule to exceed that amount.

1018
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:03,461
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't exceed 20%.

1019
01:09:04,162 --> 01:09:05,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's just say we do the 20%.

1020
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:06,723
[SPEAKER_04]: The scenarios that I prepared

1021
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:09,546
[SPEAKER_04]: as they always do, is 20, 15, and 10%.

1022
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:12,007
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're not answering the question.

1023
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:25,254
[SPEAKER_06]: If the council votes to do this after this vote tonight, at some point in time between January and June of this 2015, when does this become operative?

1024
01:09:25,354 --> 01:09:28,115
[SPEAKER_06]: July 1st or January 1st of 2016?

1025
01:09:28,235 --> 01:09:30,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, apparently January 1st tax bill, right.

1026
01:09:31,597 --> 01:09:32,698
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're still not missing.

1027
01:09:32,718 --> 01:09:33,258
[SPEAKER_04]: You're still missing.

1028
01:09:33,358 --> 01:09:34,358
[SPEAKER_04]: No, right now, fiscal 15.

1029
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:35,019
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1030
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:35,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1031
01:09:36,653 --> 01:09:37,934
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not voting for this right now.

1032
01:09:37,954 --> 01:09:39,676
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not voting for an exemption right now.

1033
01:09:39,816 --> 01:09:46,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just say we discussed this and in either March or April, the council decides they're going to impose the residential exemption.

1034
01:09:47,665 --> 01:09:52,770
[SPEAKER_06]: When does that become operative in the budget for the purposes of the budget or the tax rate?

1035
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it July 1st or January 1st, 2016?

1036
01:09:58,568 --> 01:10:02,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Panto, the vote is taken in December for the current fiscal year.

1037
01:10:02,851 --> 01:10:04,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It can't be voted on in April.

1038
01:10:04,473 --> 01:10:06,354
[SPEAKER_04]: The home rule petition could be filed then.

1039
01:10:06,755 --> 01:10:08,516
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not listening.

1040
01:10:08,656 --> 01:10:12,079
[SPEAKER_04]: The option is you vote it tonight or you vote it next December.

1041
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:19,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you change to exceed the 20% with the home rule petition.

1042
01:10:19,325 --> 01:10:21,587
[SPEAKER_06]: You just got through saying without a home rule petition, you can go up to 20%.

1043
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:23,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1044
01:10:23,582 --> 01:10:24,943
[SPEAKER_04]: The current statute allows up to 20%.

1045
01:10:25,124 --> 01:10:28,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that you voted tonight, we'll kick in a January.

1046
01:10:28,226 --> 01:10:31,509
[SPEAKER_06]: But what happens if we decide we want to vote on this in April or May?

1047
01:10:31,549 --> 01:10:32,009
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we need?

1048
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:35,332
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a home rule petition or can we just vote on it?

1049
01:10:36,133 --> 01:10:37,954
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't vote on it then.

1050
01:10:38,214 --> 01:10:40,616
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only propose a home rule.

1051
01:10:41,417 --> 01:10:48,583
[SPEAKER_08]: If I understand the dialogue, Mr. President, I think, um, what the assessor is trying to indicate is that the tax levy is set every year.

1052
01:10:49,084 --> 01:10:53,226
[SPEAKER_08]: And when this tax rate and tax levy is set, that's when the exemption is taken into consideration.

1053
01:10:54,126 --> 01:11:00,490
[SPEAKER_08]: If this happens semi-annually, this is something that DSS is not going to take up until the next tax cycle?

1054
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:01,410
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

1055
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:01,950
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't.

1056
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:02,571
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tonight.

1057
01:11:04,331 --> 01:11:05,012
[SPEAKER_04]: It's annual.

1058
01:11:05,112 --> 01:11:07,453
[SPEAKER_08]: So if, in fact, the residential exemption wasn't

1059
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:18,288
[SPEAKER_08]: wasn't passed this evening, and the council wanted to implement a residential tax exemption six months down the road, and we voted for it, that wouldn't take effect until the next time that you're before us to set the levy.

1060
01:11:18,468 --> 01:11:18,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1061
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:19,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1062
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:22,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And the tax classification hearing, it's the only time you can do that, correct?

1063
01:11:22,751 --> 01:11:23,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's past.

1064
01:11:23,452 --> 01:11:24,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, not May.

1065
01:11:24,693 --> 01:11:25,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Three questions ago.

1066
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:29,997
[SPEAKER_04]: The council can take it up then and propose the home rule petition and exceed the 20%.

1067
01:11:31,718 --> 01:11:32,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Fourth time.

1068
01:11:32,318 --> 01:11:34,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Panto, we do it every year at this time.

1069
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:34,540
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait a minute.

1070
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth time.

1071
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:35,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask you this.

1072
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,065
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer's not changing.

1073
01:11:38,325 --> 01:11:39,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It has not changed.

1074
01:11:39,206 --> 01:11:39,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1075
01:11:39,706 --> 01:11:41,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe you're not answering the question correctly.

1076
01:11:42,308 --> 01:11:58,402
[SPEAKER_06]: If you pass it right now, if you pass the question right now, yes or no, and the council decides in April or May they want to go to the exemption of 20%, which doesn't become operative, as you say, until January of the following year, correct?

1077
01:11:59,162 --> 01:12:01,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you still need a home rule petition for that or not?

1078
01:12:01,806 --> 01:12:05,228
[SPEAKER_04]: The only vote is right now at the tax classification hearing.

1079
01:12:06,049 --> 01:12:08,470
[SPEAKER_28]: You only need a home rule petition if you're going over 20%.

1080
01:12:09,411 --> 01:12:10,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Then let me ask you this.

1081
01:12:10,932 --> 01:12:19,457
[SPEAKER_06]: If you wait until next year at this time when the council votes up to 20% for a tax exemption, how are you going to have that figured out on this night?

1082
01:12:19,698 --> 01:12:26,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't you have to discuss this ahead of time and give us an example of what the breakdown would be and what the cost is going to be by taxes?

1083
01:12:27,456 --> 01:12:33,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it would be kind of stupid to come here on a night like tonight and all of a sudden vote for 20% exemption and not knowing what the rates are going to be.

1084
01:12:34,827 --> 01:12:36,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor O'Panter, it's on page 12, last week's handout.

1085
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:40,015
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I'm talking about having a legitimate conversation, Ed.

1086
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:43,651
[SPEAKER_06]: not just having a piece of paper thrown at us ahead of time.

1087
01:12:43,671 --> 01:12:49,053
[SPEAKER_28]: If you want to start discussing it earlier in the year, we could provide estimates for you.

1088
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:55,055
[SPEAKER_28]: That would be pretty close to the estimate, but you couldn't actually bring it up for a vote until the tax classification time.

1089
01:12:55,075 --> 01:12:59,177
[SPEAKER_28]: But we could provide estimates to be discussed in a more

1090
01:13:00,787 --> 01:13:03,248
[SPEAKER_28]: legitimate pace than trying to discuss everything at the last minute, yes.

1091
01:13:03,268 --> 01:13:03,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1092
01:13:04,029 --> 01:13:09,352
[SPEAKER_13]: And then after tonight, you have to wait until the free cash is certified, Division of Local Services sign off next year.

1093
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:11,953
[SPEAKER_13]: The only other mechanism is the home rule petition.

1094
01:13:13,214 --> 01:13:14,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Mid-year, correct?

1095
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:16,235
[SPEAKER_13]: No, your free cash has already been certified.

1096
01:13:16,255 --> 01:13:16,556
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.

1097
01:13:16,596 --> 01:13:22,399
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm talking about if we go to the exemption, Division of Local Services will have to be involved to certify the numbers.

1098
01:13:22,459 --> 01:13:24,960
[SPEAKER_13]: You only have to go for a home rule petition if you're going to go above 20%.

1099
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,722
[SPEAKER_13]: 20%, which we can do at any time.

1100
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:30,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Other than that, we have to do it in December.

1101
01:13:30,747 --> 01:13:31,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless it's a homo.

1102
01:13:31,427 --> 01:13:31,967
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct.

1103
01:13:32,308 --> 01:13:32,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1104
01:13:33,148 --> 01:13:33,448
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1105
01:13:34,568 --> 01:13:38,069
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the number three, the council has traditionally voted no on this.

1106
01:13:38,349 --> 01:13:39,290
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk will call the roll.

1107
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:41,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we have a gentleman that would like to speak.

1108
01:13:41,771 --> 01:13:42,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir.

1109
01:13:42,411 --> 01:13:43,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record.

1110
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:52,154
[SPEAKER_25]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Mass.

1111
01:13:52,954 --> 01:13:53,354
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry.

1112
01:13:54,195 --> 01:13:54,935
[SPEAKER_25]: Too much luggage.

1113
01:14:07,284 --> 01:14:08,124
[SPEAKER_25]: Season's greetings.

1114
01:14:08,785 --> 01:14:11,066
[SPEAKER_25]: If I may wish you all a peaceful Christmas too.

1115
01:14:13,487 --> 01:14:16,328
[SPEAKER_25]: We feel like this is deja vu all over again and again.

1116
01:14:17,528 --> 01:14:35,296
[SPEAKER_25]: But will you please give the local owner occupied homeowner at least a 20% real estate tax exemption.

1117
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:42,905
[SPEAKER_25]: only if they live in their house, which can be verified by their income tax filing address.

1118
01:14:44,686 --> 01:14:53,373
[SPEAKER_25]: As you know, this real real estate tax savings is being done in Malden, and Somerville is at 35%.

1119
01:14:55,134 --> 01:14:55,775
[SPEAKER_25]: Why not us?

1120
01:14:57,796 --> 01:14:59,437
[SPEAKER_25]: At least give us 20%, especially when nine of 10

1121
01:15:05,365 --> 01:15:23,708
[SPEAKER_25]: About 90% of Method homeowners would receive a lower real estate tax bill than presently proposed, versus a historical 3% to 8% increase on a yearly basis.

1122
01:15:23,748 --> 01:15:25,268
[SPEAKER_25]: If I may, I'd like to give an example.

1123
01:15:26,489 --> 01:15:29,469
[SPEAKER_25]: This year, my home, Attu, has a $400,000 value, times the present tax rate of $12.25,

1124
01:15:35,413 --> 01:15:38,274
[SPEAKER_25]: per thousand, I paid $4,900.

1125
01:15:38,314 --> 01:15:45,818
[SPEAKER_25]: Next year, in 2015, my evaluation on the home will go from $400,000 to $452,000, times $11.70 at the proposed

1126
01:16:04,785 --> 01:16:12,889
[SPEAKER_25]: new lower tax rate per 1,000 that will equal $5,288 in real estate tax for next year as proposed.

1127
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:16,911
[SPEAKER_25]: This yearly increase of $388 is almost 8% over last year, so much for Prop 2.5.

1128
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:35,086
[SPEAKER_25]: There is hope.

1129
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:59,214
[SPEAKER_25]: You, the elected city officials, have the power, through the Commonwealth of Massachusetts law, to lower this increase for the average homeowner in Medford if they live in their house as their primary residence, which is verified by their address on their income tax return.

1130
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:06,414
[SPEAKER_25]: We, the people, are not politicians at this time.

1131
01:17:07,895 --> 01:17:33,134
[SPEAKER_25]: However, you, our, the elected city councilors, do have the power tonight to vote for a 20% real estate tax residential exemption and vote to send this request to Mayor McGlynn, because I believe only he, the mayor, has the authorization slash option to select and adopt this real estate tax exemption.

1132
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:36,716
[SPEAKER_25]: along with your city council approval.

1133
01:17:37,956 --> 01:17:47,480
[SPEAKER_25]: Under Commonwealth of Massachusetts General Laws, chapter number 59, section 5C, we the people, the working class, need real estate tax relief.

1134
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:53,182
[SPEAKER_25]: Please vote yes, help save our middle class neighbors before it's too late.

1135
01:17:55,343 --> 01:18:02,225
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you kindly for listening and hopefully getting this done, for it's, in my opinion, 10 years overdue.

1136
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:10,412
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for your time.

1137
01:18:10,793 --> 01:18:11,613
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

1138
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:17,416
[SPEAKER_25]: I hope you give the taxpayers a nice Christmas present, and I hope it's a good new year without any fear.

1139
01:18:18,456 --> 01:18:18,816
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1140
01:18:21,338 --> 01:18:23,199
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk will call the roll.

1141
01:18:23,239 --> 01:18:27,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Traditionally, the council has voted no on this number three.

1142
01:18:29,142 --> 01:18:30,402
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Blanco-Kern.

1143
01:18:30,642 --> 01:18:32,223
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Caruso.

1144
01:18:32,263 --> 01:18:38,106
[SPEAKER_22]: I know I've spoken enough tonight, but I think this needs to be explained because Mr. Castaneda makes a very good

1145
01:18:38,493 --> 01:18:40,694
[SPEAKER_22]: some very good points and has a very good argument.

1146
01:18:40,734 --> 01:18:45,915
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think it's one that we would all agree with, except for the fact how it's explained to us.

1147
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:53,518
[SPEAKER_22]: And Assessor O'Neill can probably further explain it or much better explain it.

1148
01:18:54,638 --> 01:18:59,720
[SPEAKER_22]: If we voted for their exemption, up to the 20%, 15%, 10%, there would still be, if I have this correct, about 1,200 to 1,300

1149
01:19:06,953 --> 01:19:11,235
[SPEAKER_22]: owner-occupied properties that would also get hit within the City of Medford.

1150
01:19:11,295 --> 01:19:16,057
[SPEAKER_22]: That is the reasoning why I, as one Councillor, have never voted for this exemption.

1151
01:19:16,558 --> 01:19:22,600
[SPEAKER_22]: It would, at this point, South Medford would be killed as property assessments are up there.

1152
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:23,821
[SPEAKER_22]: West Medford would get killed.

1153
01:19:23,981 --> 01:19:30,584
[SPEAKER_22]: Any owner-occupied property worth more than $540,000 would also take the burden.

1154
01:19:31,304 --> 01:19:36,627
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanted to make it very clear to the people watching and, you know, people in the audience.

1155
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:43,148
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the reason why I've never voted for this exemption, because it does sound great.

1156
01:19:43,589 --> 01:19:46,651
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's tax non-owner-occupied properties more.

1157
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:48,772
[SPEAKER_22]: But that's not it.

1158
01:19:48,852 --> 01:19:50,433
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not the whole picture.

1159
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:59,519
[SPEAKER_22]: The whole picture is you'd also be hitting 1,200 to 1,300 owner-occupied properties that are valued at 540 or more.

1160
01:20:00,459 --> 01:20:01,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Very well said, Councilor Lungo.

1161
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:02,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1162
01:20:02,661 --> 01:20:06,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want him to explain it again, or you explained it right on target?

1163
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,169
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I tried to break it down as simple as possible.

1164
01:20:09,229 --> 01:20:11,430
[SPEAKER_22]: It only took, it only took me 12 years to learn.

1165
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:16,433
[SPEAKER_13]: So she was, she was right on target, right on.

1166
01:20:16,773 --> 01:20:17,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that's correct.

1167
01:20:17,814 --> 01:20:18,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1168
01:20:18,154 --> 01:20:18,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lungo.

1169
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:20,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you all set?

1170
01:20:20,936 --> 01:20:21,396
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lungo?

1171
01:20:21,476 --> 01:20:21,756
[SPEAKER_13]: All set.

1172
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:22,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1173
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:22,276
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1174
01:20:22,336 --> 01:20:22,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penta.

1175
01:20:23,577 --> 01:20:28,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Ed, you have a $546,300 base for 10% exemption at any house valued above that, correct?

1176
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:37,311
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

1177
01:20:39,153 --> 01:20:39,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1178
01:20:39,493 --> 01:20:45,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then you, and you indicated that represents 1,279 parcels.

1179
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:52,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And of all these parcels in the city, you said there's 2,309 non owner occupied parcels.

1180
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:56,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that's the number you gave us.

1181
01:20:57,047 --> 01:21:01,771
[SPEAKER_04]: This is part of the annual illustration, um, of the residential exemption.

1182
01:21:01,811 --> 01:21:03,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be for the owner occupied.

1183
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,354
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, you gave us $2,309 non-owner-occupied.

1184
01:21:08,514 --> 01:21:11,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're not including that.

1185
01:21:11,236 --> 01:21:12,357
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on the last page.

1186
01:21:12,457 --> 01:21:14,479
[SPEAKER_04]: The breakdown would be $12,032 owner-occupied to date.

1187
01:21:14,539 --> 01:21:15,179
[SPEAKER_04]: That number has gone up.

1188
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:16,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-owner-occupied is $2,309.

1189
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:16,840
[SPEAKER_04]: But that amount makes $1,279.

1190
01:21:17,221 --> 01:21:20,663
[SPEAKER_04]: That number is assumed to be owner-occupied.

1191
01:21:20,683 --> 01:21:22,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Of those owner-occupied, you go from $546 to what?

1192
01:21:34,226 --> 01:21:34,986
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want to know.

1193
01:21:35,066 --> 01:21:35,766
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the value?

1194
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:36,627
[SPEAKER_06]: How high?

1195
01:21:37,227 --> 01:21:38,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Over a million dollars.

1196
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:42,608
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a million, a few million dollar properties in the city, but you don't have those folks would pay.

1197
01:21:43,108 --> 01:21:45,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, as you go up in value, they would pay more.

1198
01:21:45,388 --> 01:21:48,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Even getting the residential exemption, they would still pay more now.

1199
01:21:48,829 --> 01:21:54,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's some of the, the problem with the way the law, the law or the exemption is to be implemented.

1200
01:21:55,491 --> 01:22:01,452
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's, let's stick to any councilor Penta because every year we do this, it's, it's non owner occupied.

1201
01:22:03,185 --> 01:22:08,787
[SPEAKER_04]: apartment buildings, anything over the breakeven point would pay more and the rest of the city owner occupied.

1202
01:22:08,827 --> 01:22:10,787
[SPEAKER_06]: We get a break, but we haven't done before.

1203
01:22:11,127 --> 01:22:21,350
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't taken from five 46 300 and gone forward to say between five 46 to 600,000 and then from 600 to 700,000 to get to that number of 1000.

1204
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:23,250
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done that exercise.

1205
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:24,151
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

1206
01:22:24,311 --> 01:22:28,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think last year it was a 501 was a break even and there were 1059 over that.

1207
01:22:29,765 --> 01:22:37,768
[SPEAKER_06]: So if 501 was a break even last year, and it's been increased by 45,000 this year, because of the appreciation, that's a pretty, that's a pretty big appreciation to property value.

1208
01:22:38,108 --> 01:22:38,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1209
01:22:38,628 --> 01:22:38,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1210
01:22:39,169 --> 01:22:39,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1211
01:22:39,449 --> 01:22:46,392
[SPEAKER_06]: So if a house between five 46 and 600, I'd like to move Mr. Clark, write this down, please.

1212
01:22:46,672 --> 01:22:47,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to get the breakdown.

1213
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:55,275
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to do it for tonight between five 46 to six, six to six 50, six 50 to seven, all the way up to the minion that you said.

1214
01:22:55,850 --> 01:23:01,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'd like to see the tax rate broken down to that, because I don't think it's as bad as everyone seems to think it is.

1215
01:23:01,173 --> 01:23:13,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you have a house that's worth $600,000, $650,000, and you're going to pay a few dollars more, it's a lot better than at least you're giving something back to someone who can't afford a $600,000 house.

1216
01:23:13,341 --> 01:23:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, it's another way of giving a break.

1217
01:23:16,924 --> 01:23:17,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Which motion?

1218
01:23:18,865 --> 01:23:19,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking to him.

1219
01:23:19,726 --> 01:23:20,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait a minute.

1220
01:23:20,046 --> 01:23:20,766
[SPEAKER_15]: You're talking to the clerk.

1221
01:23:20,786 --> 01:23:21,507
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk works for you.

1222
01:23:21,547 --> 01:23:21,787
[SPEAKER_13]: He doesn't.

1223
01:23:22,941 --> 01:23:24,042
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he works for us too.

1224
01:23:24,682 --> 01:23:26,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Your motion to the clerk is?

1225
01:23:26,423 --> 01:23:33,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Is to have the assessor's office break down from 546,300 to 600,000 and $50,000 increments.

1226
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:34,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Up to a million.

1227
01:23:34,508 --> 01:23:35,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Up to a million.

1228
01:23:35,549 --> 01:23:43,554
[SPEAKER_06]: And how that would affect the 1,279 taxpayers increase in taxes that they'd be paying.

1229
01:23:43,654 --> 01:23:44,815
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, do you have your calculator?

1230
01:23:45,475 --> 01:23:45,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1231
01:23:46,496 --> 01:23:48,557
[SPEAKER_04]: For you, Mr. President, I do have a few

1232
01:23:49,743 --> 01:23:52,705
[SPEAKER_04]: property assessed at $600, one at $700, one at $800.

1233
01:23:53,926 --> 01:24:01,072
[SPEAKER_04]: So just for an example to illustrate, with the 20% and owner occupied, they'd be paying $7,078 with the 10% and without it they'd be paying $7022.

1234
01:24:14,268 --> 01:24:17,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's about $56 more or less, depending on how you look at it.

1235
01:24:17,209 --> 01:24:18,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So $56 more or less.

1236
01:24:18,589 --> 01:24:18,569
$600,000.

1237
01:24:18,649 --> 01:24:18,709
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1238
01:24:18,729 --> 01:24:19,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's for $600,000.

1239
01:24:19,109 --> 01:24:19,309
[SPEAKER_04]: $600,000, correct.

1240
01:24:19,349 --> 01:24:19,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And go to a $700,000.

1241
01:24:19,909 --> 01:24:19,989
[SPEAKER_04]: And 10%?

1242
01:24:20,029 --> 01:24:20,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1243
01:24:20,309 --> 01:24:20,469
[SPEAKER_04]: 10% is $8,344.

1244
01:24:20,509 --> 01:24:20,469
$8,344.

1245
01:24:20,529 --> 01:24:22,110
[SPEAKER_04]: At the 10%, and with just the no residential exemption, 8193.

1246
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:23,150
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a little bit higher.

1247
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:23,810
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's another $144,000.

1248
01:24:44,228 --> 01:24:45,149
[SPEAKER_04]: $47 more.

1249
01:24:45,749 --> 01:24:48,672
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still additional plus on top of the regular additional increase.

1250
01:24:49,573 --> 01:24:53,236
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's compound, it's compounded $800,000 home with a 10%.

1251
01:24:53,556 --> 01:24:57,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 10, uh, where are we?

1252
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:02,063
[SPEAKER_04]: 9,654 and without the residential exemption, it's 9406.

1253
01:25:02,283 --> 01:25:08,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's another $248 more top of the already, you know, one 48.

1254
01:25:09,509 --> 01:25:10,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's compounded.

1255
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:13,332
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you can bring us that back in some kind of a chat,

1256
01:25:13,668 --> 01:25:14,228
[SPEAKER_06]: We can see it.

1257
01:25:14,729 --> 01:25:16,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there is some merit to that.

1258
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:17,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to be $15, $20.

1259
01:25:17,911 --> 01:25:24,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, Councillor Pentland, you're still increasing not only the $2.5 in the growth, now that, once you adopt it, that much more.

1260
01:25:24,937 --> 01:25:27,339
[SPEAKER_04]: So it could be a $300, $400 increase.

1261
01:25:27,899 --> 01:25:30,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but how many people in the city can afford $800,000, $900,000 homes?

1262
01:25:30,801 --> 01:25:30,781
$560,000.

1263
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:31,182
[SPEAKER_06]: $560,000 in Medford.

1264
01:25:31,202 --> 01:25:34,504
[SPEAKER_13]: $560,000 in Medford right now is half the city.

1265
01:25:42,379 --> 01:25:43,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Check out the latest closings.

1266
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:46,302
[SPEAKER_15]: And your 546 that you have here with the 10%.

1267
01:25:48,404 --> 01:25:49,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us that one there, please.

1268
01:25:50,285 --> 01:25:50,786
[SPEAKER_06]: That 10%.

1269
01:25:51,386 --> 01:25:53,408
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that you have, the average is 546, 300.

1270
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:54,249
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the cutoff.

1271
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:59,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It just would be marginal at that point.

1272
01:25:59,633 --> 01:26:02,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So a few cents more, whatever it would be.

1273
01:26:02,135 --> 01:26:03,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do that illustration.

1274
01:26:03,296 --> 01:26:04,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I just took 670.

1275
01:26:04,217 --> 01:26:06,199
[SPEAKER_06]: So that being said, even though it's 1,279 homes,

1276
01:26:09,342 --> 01:26:13,606
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to look at between the 5 to the 6, the 6 to the 650, 650 to the 7.

1277
01:26:14,246 --> 01:26:17,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, you're taking a residential levy and you're shifting it.

1278
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:31,320
[SPEAKER_04]: You're giving a reduction to the values that are less than the 546 and shifting it over to the non-owner occupied, the apartment buildings, and the high-end value properties.

1279
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:35,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why there's only 14 or so communities in the Commonwealth that have adopted it.

1280
01:26:37,355 --> 01:26:38,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go ask you this.

1281
01:26:38,135 --> 01:26:41,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, let's go back to someone who has a house worth $400,000.

1282
01:26:42,678 --> 01:26:43,858
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the tax rate right now?

1283
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:45,699
[SPEAKER_04]: We did that example last year.

1284
01:26:45,939 --> 01:26:47,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I didn't do it, but they would pay less.

1285
01:26:48,201 --> 01:26:48,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1286
01:26:49,401 --> 01:26:52,163
[SPEAKER_06]: But with a 10% exemption, they'd be paying even more than less.

1287
01:26:52,183 --> 01:26:52,663
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

1288
01:26:53,043 --> 01:26:53,583
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

1289
01:26:53,783 --> 01:26:55,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So it compounds the other way as well.

1290
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1291
01:26:56,385 --> 01:26:56,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1292
01:26:56,725 --> 01:26:57,965
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has a value of one.

1293
01:26:57,985 --> 01:26:59,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the residential levy doesn't go away.

1294
01:27:00,247 --> 01:27:02,488
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still shifted to somebody else.

1295
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:04,949
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're also getting at $2,309 non-owner-occupied

1296
01:27:07,338 --> 01:27:08,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to be paying at a higher rate, too.

1297
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,040
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

1298
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:11,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And that helps offset the... An example of two and three families, right?

1299
01:27:12,704 --> 01:27:12,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1300
01:27:12,824 --> 01:27:13,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penta.

1301
01:27:13,585 --> 01:27:13,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1302
01:27:13,965 --> 01:27:23,756
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may, from the chair, I will support your resolution if we wait until the re-evaluation is complete, because right now it doesn't make sense to do the exercise that's parliamentary until the re-evaluation is complete.

1303
01:27:24,877 --> 01:27:25,979
[SPEAKER_15]: What does that do to be complete?

1304
01:27:25,999 --> 01:27:26,720
[SPEAKER_15]: He told us last week.

1305
01:27:27,857 --> 01:27:28,117
[SPEAKER_15]: You go ahead.

1306
01:27:28,137 --> 01:27:28,938
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to speak for you.

1307
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:39,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the year two of the inspection program has to be completed in 2015 calendar year for our fiscal 2016.

1308
01:27:39,863 --> 01:27:41,183
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the mandate from DOI.

1309
01:27:41,223 --> 01:27:43,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Every nine, every nine years we have to do the physical inspections.

1310
01:27:44,185 --> 01:27:47,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the year 2015, we could, we could still operate with these numbers.

1311
01:27:49,047 --> 01:27:50,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Well half the city's done, right?

1312
01:27:52,298 --> 01:27:55,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no, I gave that close to half.

1313
01:27:55,539 --> 01:27:56,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It's close to half.

1314
01:27:56,459 --> 01:27:56,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1315
01:27:56,699 --> 01:27:58,320
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like high forties on both.

1316
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:02,401
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's unfair to get the numbers for half of one evaluation and half the other.

1317
01:28:02,881 --> 01:28:03,561
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my point.

1318
01:28:04,202 --> 01:28:18,586
[SPEAKER_04]: No, if he could just do, well, what's happening is my point of clarification is that it's just the inspection program to see if the property characteristics that we have on file, which is on the website in our office, it's all public is accurate.

1319
01:28:19,146 --> 01:28:19,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

1320
01:28:21,072 --> 01:28:23,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people take out building permits, some don't.

1321
01:28:24,015 --> 01:28:25,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's reflective of the inspections, correct.

1322
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:27,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Some houses get better, some get worse.

1323
01:28:28,078 --> 01:28:28,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1324
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:35,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, again, it's a property tax is an ad valorem tax based on the value of the property on a given year.

1325
01:28:35,484 --> 01:28:39,787
[SPEAKER_06]: But for what you have right now, you could give us a sample for what I just asked for.

1326
01:28:40,287 --> 01:28:44,431
[SPEAKER_06]: If we would have, you know, it's kind of go up or down, whatever it's going to be next year.

1327
01:28:44,451 --> 01:28:47,253
[SPEAKER_04]: $400,000, anything below the $500,000 would be less.

1328
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:47,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1329
01:28:48,354 --> 01:28:49,555
[SPEAKER_04]: At the expense of the others.

1330
01:28:49,655 --> 01:28:49,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1331
01:28:50,472 --> 01:28:51,072
[SPEAKER_04]: If he could do that, Mr. Clark.

1332
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:52,173
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to add that in.

1333
01:28:52,253 --> 01:28:55,956
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tax policy issue that the council has to adopt big picture.

1334
01:28:56,637 --> 01:28:57,717
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to affect someone.

1335
01:28:58,158 --> 01:28:59,739
[SPEAKER_04]: It stays within the residential class.

1336
01:29:00,339 --> 01:29:05,323
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't throw it on the apartment buildings that are non-owner occupied, that don't live in the city of Medford.

1337
01:29:05,683 --> 01:29:07,304
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes on in the three different categories.

1338
01:29:07,484 --> 01:29:11,287
[SPEAKER_06]: But you also have the non-owner occupied, and that's what we're trying to address.

1339
01:29:11,407 --> 01:29:11,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

1340
01:29:11,948 --> 01:29:11,928
2,300.

1341
01:29:12,128 --> 01:29:13,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1342
01:29:13,229 --> 01:29:14,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So do that, Mr. Clark.

1343
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:16,871
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it?

1344
01:29:17,112 --> 01:29:17,432
[SPEAKER_13]: He's got it.

1345
01:29:18,852 --> 01:29:22,733
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Pinto, Councilor Moxley.

1346
01:29:22,993 --> 01:29:30,114
[SPEAKER_17]: So from what Mr. O'Neill just mentioned, what would it take to create a new classification with the Department of Revenue?

1347
01:29:32,135 --> 01:29:36,836
[SPEAKER_04]: For you, Mr. President, Councilor Pinto, with all due respect, has been talking about that for years.

1348
01:29:37,016 --> 01:29:41,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just something that goes back to, I think, the council in 98.

1349
01:29:41,857 --> 01:29:46,518
[SPEAKER_04]: They proposed to try to change that, add another tax rate.

1350
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:54,494
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it goes up to the state house, and then DOR has an opinion on it, and that's why it hasn't been changed, so it's not likely.

1351
01:29:55,074 --> 01:29:57,856
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's an act of DOR or an act of the state legislature?

1352
01:29:57,876 --> 01:30:03,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it would have to be change in the state law, change in the classification law, going back to 1979, 1980.

1353
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you know if other states have that classification?

1354
01:30:07,722 --> 01:30:08,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not.

1355
01:30:10,064 --> 01:30:10,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not think so.

1356
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:11,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know for sure.

1357
01:30:11,985 --> 01:30:12,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1358
01:30:13,506 --> 01:30:13,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1359
01:30:14,467 --> 01:30:15,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor Knight.

1360
01:30:15,973 --> 01:30:16,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1361
01:30:17,053 --> 01:30:19,714
[SPEAKER_08]: And my question really revolved around the cyclical inspections.

1362
01:30:20,394 --> 01:30:25,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, give or take, we're about halfway complete with the residential and the commercial properties here in the city.

1363
01:30:26,435 --> 01:30:34,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any facts or figures relative to the number of people that have jumped from below the break-even to over the break-even through the cyclical inspections?

1364
01:30:34,957 --> 01:30:36,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very good question.

1365
01:30:36,378 --> 01:30:37,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have that.

1366
01:30:38,029 --> 01:30:49,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tough to, in an up market, so this market and next year's market, the assessments, I mean, we're still low as far as being at 100%, so we don't have that.

1367
01:30:49,315 --> 01:31:00,101
[SPEAKER_04]: But concerned taxpayers can get what they had, what their characteristics were last year, and then after the inspection, they can get the before and the after.

1368
01:31:00,733 --> 01:31:05,134
[SPEAKER_04]: But primarily, if the market didn't change, then you could see what the change would be.

1369
01:31:05,955 --> 01:31:08,216
[SPEAKER_07]: 8% over market or something right now in Medford?

1370
01:31:08,236 --> 01:31:08,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Pardon me?

1371
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:12,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford's over market at this point in almost double digits in terms of sales, correct?

1372
01:31:12,937 --> 01:31:13,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1373
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:13,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1374
01:31:14,418 --> 01:31:16,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1375
01:31:17,078 --> 01:31:21,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it mirrors the 2004 market, fiscal year 2004, especially twos and threes.

1376
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:25,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And I checked with Somerville.

1377
01:31:25,721 --> 01:31:27,042
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about Somerville earlier.

1378
01:31:27,722 --> 01:31:28,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing over there.

1379
01:31:29,543 --> 01:31:30,443
[SPEAKER_04]: They're twos and threes.

1380
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:39,332
[SPEAKER_04]: The conversions, I think there were about 198 new condos, primarily from conversions, mostly, not all.

1381
01:31:40,252 --> 01:31:46,453
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, we had 48 twos and threes, one mixed-use property that went to condos.

1382
01:31:47,273 --> 01:31:53,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, again, it's a business decision by the owner, and the market is there, so the return on investment is there.

1383
01:31:54,715 --> 01:31:57,995
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why we're seeing, once again, the high number of conversions.

1384
01:31:58,556 --> 01:31:59,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing as in 2004.

1385
01:32:02,691 --> 01:32:03,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. O'Neill.

1386
01:32:04,332 --> 01:32:04,652
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1387
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:05,752
[SPEAKER_13]: All in the motion.

1388
01:32:07,032 --> 01:32:08,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk will call the roll.

1389
01:32:08,693 --> 01:32:11,953
[SPEAKER_25]: Can I give some information about what was just said?

1390
01:32:14,074 --> 01:32:14,454
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1391
01:32:14,474 --> 01:32:21,475
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. O'Neill made some good points.

1392
01:32:23,616 --> 01:32:26,516
[SPEAKER_25]: In a perfect world, we wouldn't have any taxes.

1393
01:32:26,736 --> 01:32:27,917
[SPEAKER_25]: That's why we threw the English show in 1776.

1394
01:32:30,886 --> 01:32:46,575
[SPEAKER_25]: However, if we do not adopt this 20%, the full 20%, residential, unoccupied, the full 20%, which is automatic, if you approve it, and the mayor approves it.

1395
01:32:48,716 --> 01:32:50,838
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Camuso, talking to you.

1396
01:32:50,858 --> 01:32:52,278
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1397
01:32:52,298 --> 01:32:52,679
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1398
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:57,661
[SPEAKER_25]: If you do the full 20% in a perfect world,

1399
01:33:00,902 --> 01:33:03,543
[SPEAKER_25]: Zero owner-occupied should pay any increase.

1400
01:33:03,763 --> 01:33:15,425
[SPEAKER_25]: However, one, I believe, out of the 10, at a full 20%, I repeat, residential exemption, one will pay more.

1401
01:33:16,366 --> 01:33:21,487
[SPEAKER_25]: However, nine others would pay less.

1402
01:33:23,067 --> 01:33:24,808
[SPEAKER_25]: It's very important to save the middle class.

1403
01:33:26,468 --> 01:33:26,828
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1404
01:33:26,848 --> 01:33:29,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1405
01:33:29,769 --> 01:33:30,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk, call the roll.

1406
01:33:39,483 --> 01:33:40,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor DelaRusso?

1407
01:33:40,503 --> 01:33:40,824
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1408
01:33:41,364 --> 01:33:42,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1409
01:33:42,184 --> 01:33:42,384
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1410
01:33:43,164 --> 01:33:44,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor McKernan?

1411
01:33:44,605 --> 01:33:44,845
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1412
01:33:45,785 --> 01:33:46,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Martins?

1413
01:33:47,026 --> 01:33:47,246
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:39:10,558 --> 01:39:11,119

01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:25,330

1509
01:39:27,691 --> 01:39:36,197
[SPEAKER_13]: From Mayor Michael J. McGlynn to the President and members of the Medford City Council regarding amendments to Division 2 Fair Housing Commission and Division 13 Human Rights Commission.

1510
01:39:36,617 --> 01:39:47,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear Mr. President and members of the Medford City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following amendment to Division 2 and Division 13 of the Ordinance of the City of Medford.

1511
01:39:47,725 --> 01:40:00,470
[SPEAKER_13]: This amendment strikes the present provisions of our revised ordinances that set forth the Fair Housing Commission and the Human Rights Commission and blends the two commissions into one commission that will be called the Human Rights Commission.

1512
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:05,151
[SPEAKER_13]: This effort originated with members of the Fair Housing Commission and the Human Rights Commission.

1513
01:40:05,611 --> 01:40:09,473
[SPEAKER_13]: They have been working with the city solicitor for the better portion of a year on this consolidation.

1514
01:40:10,193 --> 01:40:25,077
[SPEAKER_13]: This amendment takes into consideration the respective individual jurisdictions of each commission and joins them in a fashion that will allow the resulting commission to address the significant and ever-expanding issues of human rights and fair housing in a comprehensive and streamlined fashion.

1515
01:40:25,577 --> 01:40:27,617
[SPEAKER_13]: The following is a full text of the proposed amendment.

1516
01:40:28,058 --> 01:40:31,098
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may give a brief synopsis on the proposed ordinance.

1517
01:40:31,438 --> 01:40:32,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the council is okay with that?

1518
01:40:32,839 --> 01:40:34,499
[SPEAKER_13]: We're at seven and a half pages, I believe.

1519
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:37,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that all right, ladies and gentlemen?

1520
01:40:39,485 --> 01:40:42,286
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, on the motion of Councilor Dela Russo for a synopsis of the paper.

1521
01:40:42,987 --> 01:40:54,992
[SPEAKER_13]: This is submitted by the mayor on behalf of the request of the commission to combine the Human Rights Commission and the Fair Housing Commission, which Diane McLeod is our diversity director overseas at the current time.

1522
01:40:55,553 --> 01:40:59,855
[SPEAKER_13]: It also, I believe, adds additional classes that are recognized today.

1523
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:02,096
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to

1524
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:04,541
[SPEAKER_13]: read a few.

1525
01:41:04,881 --> 01:41:12,467
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know it's gender identity, transgender and things of that nature that are part of today's, um, city.

1526
01:41:12,507 --> 01:41:14,749
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're proud to have everyone inclusive in this community.

1527
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:19,193
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, anything else you want to add before we take a look at this?

1528
01:41:19,553 --> 01:41:29,602
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, no, I just wanted to add that we have been meeting and we've been very carefully going through, um, the ordinance for a year and we did want to include, obviously we've included,

1529
01:41:29,924 --> 01:41:34,106
[SPEAKER_24]: gender identity, gender expression, and genetic information as well.

1530
01:41:35,066 --> 01:41:39,728
[SPEAKER_24]: We want all people in the city of Medford to have the same rights and privileges.

1531
01:41:39,808 --> 01:41:40,929
[SPEAKER_24]: We think that's important.

1532
01:41:41,149 --> 01:41:43,750
[SPEAKER_24]: And there are several members of the commission.

1533
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:47,351
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, some had to leave, but we're here to support this as well.

1534
01:41:48,272 --> 01:41:49,952
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's kind of a natural progression.

1535
01:41:49,972 --> 01:41:58,056
[SPEAKER_24]: The federal government actually just recently updated their legislation as well to include with housing and banking information and mortgages.

1536
01:41:59,115 --> 01:42:01,335
[SPEAKER_24]: the same gender identity, gender expression.

1537
01:42:01,395 --> 01:42:06,977
[SPEAKER_24]: We had a forum here on that in the city of Medford, and we just think it's important that everyone's treated the same.

1538
01:42:07,797 --> 01:42:13,398
[SPEAKER_13]: And I may add that Melrose recently just updated their policy to be very inclusive as well.

1539
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:15,118
[SPEAKER_13]: It was reported today in the Statehouse News.

1540
01:42:15,859 --> 01:42:20,560
[SPEAKER_13]: So I hate to be behind Melrose, but we're right behind them, hopefully.

1541
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:21,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Ours is better.

1542
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:22,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion?

1543
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:24,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

1544
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,701
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight.

1545
01:42:26,861 --> 01:42:27,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Mox.

1546
01:42:28,507 --> 01:42:29,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1547
01:42:30,087 --> 01:42:34,688
[SPEAKER_17]: With the consolidation of both these commissions, will there be the same number of seats?

1548
01:42:35,348 --> 01:42:37,609
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll have nine commission members that we had.

1549
01:42:37,649 --> 01:42:39,329
[SPEAKER_24]: We previously had nine commission members.

1550
01:42:39,369 --> 01:42:40,529
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll have nine commission members.

1551
01:42:41,009 --> 01:42:42,990
[SPEAKER_17]: So, so the number is going to stay the same.

1552
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:43,550
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1553
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:45,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any openings currently?

1554
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:46,090
[SPEAKER_24]: We only have one.

1555
01:42:46,650 --> 01:42:52,371
[SPEAKER_24]: We had someone who is interested in just told me last week that he's been a little busy and he thinks he has to, you know, take some time.

1556
01:42:52,411 --> 01:42:53,611
[SPEAKER_24]: So we'll fill that position.

1557
01:42:54,111 --> 01:42:57,672
[SPEAKER_24]: But we have eight commissions, commission members seated now.

1558
01:42:58,588 --> 01:43:00,930
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to personally thank the members of the commission.

1559
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:17,079
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, this is a very important task in our community and under your leadership, uh, in my opinion, uh, this community is moving forward on many fronts and, uh, of which housing and human rights are at the top of at least my list as a member of the council.

1560
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:23,223
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want to thank you and the committee and thank the members for coming out tonight and listening to government at its best.

1561
01:43:24,344 --> 01:43:26,205
[SPEAKER_17]: At certain points it may not seem that way, but,

1562
01:43:27,216 --> 01:43:31,320
[SPEAKER_17]: But we do get to the root of what we need to do to do the people's business.

1563
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:32,180
[SPEAKER_24]: So I thank you again.

1564
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,361
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks, I appreciate it.

1565
01:43:33,401 --> 01:43:34,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1566
01:43:34,282 --> 01:43:35,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Dela Russo, then Councilor Penta.

1567
01:43:35,903 --> 01:43:38,745
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, just one quick question.

1568
01:43:39,205 --> 01:43:42,368
[SPEAKER_19]: What was the piece of genetic information?

1569
01:43:42,388 --> 01:43:43,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Genetic information.

1570
01:43:43,188 --> 01:43:52,976
[SPEAKER_24]: That's basically, if someone were to make a decision, whether it was an employment decision or, for example, health care, well, you know, you don't really want to do that because

1571
01:43:53,493 --> 01:44:03,541
[SPEAKER_24]: they have an issue in their family and, you know, they've got, you know, historically they've got cancer in the family or some, it's, it's a decision made on someone's genetic past and it's really not appropriate.

1572
01:44:03,601 --> 01:44:04,182
[SPEAKER_24]: It shouldn't be done.

1573
01:44:04,422 --> 01:44:04,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1574
01:44:05,683 --> 01:44:06,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1575
01:44:06,023 --> 01:44:06,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Council DelaRusso.

1576
01:44:06,904 --> 01:44:07,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta.

1577
01:44:08,285 --> 01:44:09,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Two points, Mr. President.

1578
01:44:09,766 --> 01:44:17,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, on the section 50 dash 65, it talks about appointments and it says the appointments of the human rights commission, the mayor shall appoint.

1579
01:44:18,213 --> 01:44:19,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently he's appointing all the members.

1580
01:44:20,935 --> 01:44:22,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it there anything within your membership?

1581
01:44:23,959 --> 01:44:28,961
[SPEAKER_06]: that would go out of bounds, so to speak, and you folks elect members for someone who might be.

1582
01:44:29,302 --> 01:44:31,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are these nine members all mayoral appointments?

1583
01:44:31,843 --> 01:44:36,785
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, normally what our process is, we have people that come to our meetings that are interested in participating.

1584
01:44:37,205 --> 01:44:39,046
[SPEAKER_24]: They normally come to a couple of meetings.

1585
01:44:39,346 --> 01:44:40,507
[SPEAKER_24]: We all get to know each other.

1586
01:44:40,567 --> 01:44:42,348
[SPEAKER_24]: They make sure it's a good fit for them.

1587
01:44:42,388 --> 01:44:43,648
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what they wanted to do.

1588
01:44:43,969 --> 01:44:45,329
[SPEAKER_24]: We make sure it's a fit for us.

1589
01:44:45,429 --> 01:44:48,731
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, we've had people come in the past and they said, you know, this isn't what I thought it was.

1590
01:44:49,261 --> 01:44:53,822
[SPEAKER_24]: Or and then from there, we always talk about what can you bring to the commission.

1591
01:44:54,363 --> 01:44:58,684
[SPEAKER_24]: And we want people who are active and participating in the community.

1592
01:44:59,184 --> 01:45:06,406
[SPEAKER_24]: And then from there, we always send that person's resume to the mayor and say that we're interested in having that person on the commission.

1593
01:45:07,147 --> 01:45:09,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So who advertises for these positions, the mayor or the commission?

1594
01:45:10,248 --> 01:45:12,208
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, the commission has done it in the past.

1595
01:45:12,308 --> 01:45:15,869
[SPEAKER_24]: But they always come to commission members first before they go to the mayor.

1596
01:45:15,889 --> 01:45:17,050
[SPEAKER_24]: So you put an ad in the paper?

1597
01:45:17,070 --> 01:45:18,170
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's his decision after.

1598
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:19,361
[SPEAKER_06]: You put an ad in the paper.

1599
01:45:19,381 --> 01:45:20,481
[SPEAKER_24]: We have in the past.

1600
01:45:20,521 --> 01:45:21,362
[SPEAKER_24]: We haven't had to.

1601
01:45:21,902 --> 01:45:25,465
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, we've had, uh, we've had quite a few people coming to meetings, so we haven't had that.

1602
01:45:25,505 --> 01:45:28,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So what would be the best since you're merging these two together?

1603
01:45:28,047 --> 01:45:30,128
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the background of the members who are on the commission?

1604
01:45:31,369 --> 01:45:32,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, are they here tonight?

1605
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:32,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of them?

1606
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:33,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of them are here.

1607
01:45:34,431 --> 01:45:36,613
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, um, Dale Bryan is here.

1608
01:45:36,733 --> 01:45:40,076
[SPEAKER_24]: He is from Tufts university and he's the head of the peace and justice.

1609
01:45:40,176 --> 01:45:41,897
[SPEAKER_06]: They just come up, you know, this is brand new.

1610
01:45:42,157 --> 01:45:43,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe if they come up and explain,

1611
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,981
[SPEAKER_06]: their position, the people who might be watching.

1612
01:45:46,281 --> 01:45:46,681
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely.

1613
01:45:46,701 --> 01:45:48,242
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a major blend of two commissions.

1614
01:45:48,362 --> 01:45:53,944
[SPEAKER_24]: I will say David Harris had to leave to pick up his son, but he works at Harvard, um, civil rights and justice.

1615
01:45:54,224 --> 01:45:55,725
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, but he did have to leave though.

1616
01:45:57,206 --> 01:46:03,669
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1617
01:46:03,689 --> 01:46:13,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian 17 Walcott street, member of the human rights commission and full support of the

1618
01:46:14,605 --> 01:46:17,987
[SPEAKER_02]: change of the name and the combination of the two commissions.

1619
01:46:18,628 --> 01:46:18,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1620
01:46:18,968 --> 01:46:19,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1621
01:46:21,229 --> 01:46:21,390
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1622
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:24,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you just explain what's your interest and why are you involved?

1623
01:46:24,392 --> 01:46:25,492
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you get involved with this?

1624
01:46:28,034 --> 01:46:36,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I was approached, uh, by one of the city chaplains

1625
01:46:37,805 --> 01:46:40,166
[SPEAKER_02]: to ask if I was interested in the commission.

1626
01:46:40,586 --> 01:46:49,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a discussion with the diversity director, Diane McLeod, if I would be interested in participating in the commission.

1627
01:46:50,609 --> 01:46:56,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I met with, again, one of the city chaplains to discuss the possibility.

1628
01:46:57,032 --> 01:46:59,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I met with the city solicitor.

1629
01:46:59,052 --> 01:47:00,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I met with the school superintendent.

1630
01:47:00,973 --> 01:47:06,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I met with the mayor to discuss interests that I would have on the commission.

1631
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:08,569
[SPEAKER_02]: roles for the commission.

1632
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:27,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And I participated several meetings before agreeing to have my name put forward to the mayor, uh, with the full support of the then commission members, which at that time included members of the, uh, persons with disabilities committee members.

1633
01:47:30,805 --> 01:47:31,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1634
01:47:31,485 --> 01:47:33,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Brian, um, can,

1635
01:47:34,384 --> 01:47:37,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you just tell us a little bit about how you're liking it and how it's working out?

1636
01:47:37,685 --> 01:47:41,146
[SPEAKER_08]: And other than this ordinance, are there any other things that you guys have been working on?

1637
01:47:41,206 --> 01:47:44,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I know November was National Disability Awareness Month.

1638
01:47:44,646 --> 01:47:46,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Diane and I spoke at length about it.

1639
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:52,468
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd just like to maybe hear a little bit about your experiences being on the committee and how you like it.

1640
01:47:52,488 --> 01:47:58,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I said to David Harris, who is the chair of the commission before he left this evening,

1641
01:48:01,045 --> 01:48:09,350
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first year plus time I've been on the commission, there's a lot more work involved than I knew to expect.

1642
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:18,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the commission has contributed to a year long series of discussions within the community starting November of a year ago.

1643
01:48:18,975 --> 01:48:27,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll conclude on Martin Luther King day next month, uh, that focused on the legacies of the civil rights era.

1644
01:48:28,548 --> 01:48:35,571
[SPEAKER_02]: and the legacy of slavery, starting with the Proclamation, Emancipation Proclamation.

1645
01:48:36,071 --> 01:48:46,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have held a number of events on the order of one a month and have participated with several nonprofit organizations in the city.

1646
01:48:47,416 --> 01:48:55,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And as an educator, I think we've done good work at raising public awareness about the issues of concern.

1647
01:48:56,393 --> 01:48:57,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent, thank you.

1648
01:48:57,434 --> 01:48:57,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1649
01:48:58,414 --> 01:48:59,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?

1650
01:49:00,836 --> 01:49:01,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Sir?

1651
01:49:03,617 --> 01:49:04,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Chief Sacco.

1652
01:49:06,839 --> 01:49:09,441
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, Leo Sacco, police chief.

1653
01:49:09,841 --> 01:49:14,644
[SPEAKER_26]: Reside at 227 Elm Street in Medford, and I am a member of the Human Rights Commission.

1654
01:49:14,684 --> 01:49:17,165
[SPEAKER_26]: I've been a member now for a good number of years.

1655
01:49:18,266 --> 01:49:20,307
[SPEAKER_26]: Very fortunate and honored to be a member.

1656
01:49:20,857 --> 01:49:27,281
[SPEAKER_26]: And I follow in the footsteps of Captain Hubert Hanlon, who has been a member prior to my appointment.

1657
01:49:27,702 --> 01:49:31,804
[SPEAKER_26]: But upon his retirement, I was appointed to the commission.

1658
01:49:32,385 --> 01:49:35,587
[SPEAKER_26]: I think one of the big things for the city of Medford is that we're out in front.

1659
01:49:35,707 --> 01:49:45,113
[SPEAKER_26]: Many of the human rights commissions around the state, or at least in our neighboring communities, do not have a police officer as a member of the commission.

1660
01:49:45,153 --> 01:49:48,936
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's very important to be right out there in the front.

1661
01:49:49,286 --> 01:49:53,869
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, be the first line to, to hear something or the concerns of the complaints in the community.

1662
01:49:54,509 --> 01:49:58,851
[SPEAKER_26]: And many times we hear it out in the street and we're able to bring it to the committee meetings.

1663
01:49:58,971 --> 01:50:03,794
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's a definite benefit, uh, for having a police officer involved.

1664
01:50:05,035 --> 01:50:17,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any, um, to the chair, is, is, is there any involvement, um, with you as being the chief or having a police person on the board and now with the merger of these two organizations together,

1665
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:29,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And not to bring up a sour issue, but unfortunately we've seen what's happening recently throughout this country regarding the police department, whether you're for or against, whatever the action might be.

1666
01:50:30,684 --> 01:50:48,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it possible that this commission can take an attitude of just going out into the community rather than waiting for an issue to appear before it and just see what's going on and see what their attitude is and whether it's human rights for the purposes of social issues, police issues, educational issues.

1667
01:50:49,231 --> 01:50:55,175
[SPEAKER_06]: rather than just having a meeting at City Hall, going into the neighborhoods and finding out what the possibilities are.

1668
01:50:55,235 --> 01:50:56,055
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your problems?

1669
01:50:56,315 --> 01:51:05,621
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, in many cases, that already happens with police officers that are in the community that already have an idea of what's taking place in the community, and they would bring it to the commission.

1670
01:51:06,342 --> 01:51:13,806
[SPEAKER_26]: Diane McLeod and her role on a daily basis is dealing with issues in the community, and it gets brought to the commission level.

1671
01:51:14,807 --> 01:51:18,209
[SPEAKER_26]: As far as the actual outreach, I think that's something that's been done.

1672
01:51:18,898 --> 01:51:31,308
[SPEAKER_26]: repeatedly by the commission, not necessarily myself, but through Diane and David Harris and Dale and all of the various programs that are produced during the course of any given year.

1673
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:32,949
[SPEAKER_26]: There's the outreach.

1674
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:36,753
[SPEAKER_26]: The unfortunate part, and I'll say this, the unfortunate part is the apathy.

1675
01:51:37,513 --> 01:51:38,254
[SPEAKER_26]: People are quiet.

1676
01:51:38,314 --> 01:51:42,677
[SPEAKER_26]: People remain in their homes, remain in their neighborhoods, and they don't bring the issues forward.

1677
01:51:43,718 --> 01:51:48,282
[SPEAKER_06]: But wouldn't this be a perfect opportunity for which a lack of better terminology

1678
01:51:50,191 --> 01:51:53,233
[SPEAKER_06]: not for community policing, but for maybe community involvement.

1679
01:51:53,873 --> 01:51:59,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to me, this is big, merging these two commissions together to accomplish one goal.

1680
01:51:59,336 --> 01:52:11,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to assume that the goal is to make sure that this community, you know, is looked upon favorably by all kinds of people for whatever, whether they're people of color, whether it's disability, whether it's a police issue, whether it's an educational issue.

1681
01:52:11,822 --> 01:52:16,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can really run the gamut here and be such an adjunct to city government

1682
01:52:17,533 --> 01:52:20,454
[SPEAKER_06]: in such a way, I mean, you have terms here that run three years, two years, and one year.

1683
01:52:20,974 --> 01:52:27,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not always getting the same individual because the person, maybe you have one year, maybe all done, he may or she may not want to come back.

1684
01:52:28,917 --> 01:52:34,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I just see this as an open door policy that can really, this city is changing so much.

1685
01:52:35,399 --> 01:52:43,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is an absolute unique opportunity to get into the bowels of every corner of this city with this commission, committee, whatever you want to call it.

1686
01:52:43,942 --> 01:52:46,083
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what I would be expecting.

1687
01:52:46,673 --> 01:52:47,934
[SPEAKER_06]: this committee and commission to do.

1688
01:52:48,694 --> 01:53:00,282
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd like to give you an idea of what we have been doing, because as we said the last year, we've had a forum of following and tracing our faces, which we had a takeoff from the faces of Medford.

1689
01:53:00,623 --> 01:53:04,225
[SPEAKER_24]: And we started last November, and that was our kickoff.

1690
01:53:04,365 --> 01:53:08,288
[SPEAKER_24]: And every single month, as we said, we've been doing an activity in the community.

1691
01:53:08,708 --> 01:53:11,350
[SPEAKER_24]: So not in any particular order, just so you're aware.

1692
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:15,753
[SPEAKER_24]: We've had three films at Medford Library around different civil rights issues.

1693
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:20,188
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've had discussions with either a professor, et cetera, after.

1694
01:53:20,629 --> 01:53:24,811
[SPEAKER_24]: So there was the general public that attended those events.

1695
01:53:25,231 --> 01:53:32,356
[SPEAKER_24]: We also had Dr. Bernard Lafayette, which is one of the Freedom Riders, was actually at the high school.

1696
01:53:32,376 --> 01:53:34,317
[SPEAKER_24]: And he spoke to the entire junior class.

1697
01:53:35,237 --> 01:53:36,038
[SPEAKER_24]: He left after that.

1698
01:53:36,098 --> 01:53:37,399
[SPEAKER_24]: He was so well-received.

1699
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:40,681
[SPEAKER_24]: The kids were surrounding him after the event.

1700
01:53:40,741 --> 01:53:42,782
[SPEAKER_24]: And then he went and he met with the honors class.

1701
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:46,361
[SPEAKER_24]: history class and he talked to that class for a while.

1702
01:53:46,921 --> 01:53:49,722
[SPEAKER_24]: He also spoke at Tufts University as well.

1703
01:53:50,302 --> 01:53:55,384
[SPEAKER_24]: We also had a project that we wanted to do with the students because we wanted youth involvement.

1704
01:53:56,044 --> 01:54:02,186
[SPEAKER_24]: So we had a project here a few months ago where you probably saw the photos that were around with the post-its on it.

1705
01:54:02,706 --> 01:54:06,847
[SPEAKER_24]: We had this place packed with over 300 people that day.

1706
01:54:07,027 --> 01:54:12,069
[SPEAKER_24]: It was students, it was teachers, it was parents, and we had a speaker.

1707
01:54:12,994 --> 01:54:18,737
[SPEAKER_24]: who was here, Muji Kareem, and he spoke to the kids about self-worth.

1708
01:54:19,557 --> 01:54:23,098
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was incredibly, they didn't want to go home.

1709
01:54:24,039 --> 01:54:25,159
[SPEAKER_24]: We had to push them out.

1710
01:54:25,179 --> 01:54:27,320
[SPEAKER_24]: There were so many kids, it was absolutely fabulous.

1711
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,781
[SPEAKER_24]: So we did really have that program as well.

1712
01:54:30,161 --> 01:54:35,203
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we're also talking about planning our last event, which would be the MLK Day.

1713
01:54:35,263 --> 01:54:38,245
[SPEAKER_24]: And we are talking about what happened to the two youth.

1714
01:54:39,576 --> 01:54:43,759
[SPEAKER_24]: Ferguson and New York and how we don't want something like that to happen here.

1715
01:54:44,219 --> 01:54:54,986
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're going back to those youth to try and have a discussion about what we can do, what their self-worth is, and then what we can do to make something like that not happen here.

1716
01:54:55,066 --> 01:54:56,307
[SPEAKER_24]: How can we communicate better?

1717
01:54:56,347 --> 01:54:59,229
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we're just in the planning stages of that, but that's what we're doing now.

1718
01:55:00,430 --> 01:55:02,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one of the objectives of this commission?

1719
01:55:02,992 --> 01:55:06,634
[SPEAKER_24]: That's one of our forms that we've planned since last year, and we've been doing that.

1720
01:55:06,794 --> 01:55:09,116
[SPEAKER_24]: Like I said, every single month we've had something going on.

1721
01:55:09,907 --> 01:55:10,748
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure there's more.

1722
01:55:10,768 --> 01:55:12,568
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the ones I'm thinking of at the top of my head.

1723
01:55:12,608 --> 01:55:15,570
[SPEAKER_24]: But we haven't stopped since last.

1724
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:18,991
[SPEAKER_06]: So the membership of the commission, how many?

1725
01:55:19,512 --> 01:55:21,573
[SPEAKER_24]: There were eight of the nine positions.

1726
01:55:21,633 --> 01:55:23,554
[SPEAKER_06]: And how many of the Human Rights Committee?

1727
01:55:23,574 --> 01:55:24,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you merged the two together.

1728
01:55:24,354 --> 01:55:25,454
[SPEAKER_24]: The Human Rights Committee is nine.

1729
01:55:25,494 --> 01:55:26,275
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what we've got now.

1730
01:55:26,335 --> 01:55:30,577
[SPEAKER_24]: We had some of the fair housing people that we had on the commission that had left.

1731
01:55:32,058 --> 01:55:36,860
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, we had, she's now a judge, Elizabeth Cremins, who was working at the Community Housing Board.

1732
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:38,301
[SPEAKER_24]: And we had people from the fair housing.

1733
01:55:39,608 --> 01:55:40,789
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're down to nine now.

1734
01:55:40,809 --> 01:55:41,670
[SPEAKER_06]: You're having nine members.

1735
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:42,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we're keeping it at nine.

1736
01:55:42,991 --> 01:55:44,792
[SPEAKER_06]: But how many did you have between the two altogether?

1737
01:55:44,812 --> 01:55:45,592
[SPEAKER_06]: How many were there?

1738
01:55:45,633 --> 01:55:48,475
[SPEAKER_24]: No, right now we only have eight, because as people left— No, no, no.

1739
01:55:48,495 --> 01:55:51,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you merged, the two commissions separately— We're both nine.

1740
01:55:51,737 --> 01:55:56,761
[SPEAKER_24]: But as people left, we knew we were going to do this merge, and we didn't want an 18-member board.

1741
01:55:56,821 --> 01:56:05,607
[SPEAKER_24]: So as people left, as this was happening, we knew we weren't filling spots, because we didn't want to have—it was just uncontrollable to have that many people.

1742
01:56:05,728 --> 01:56:07,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do you have, a one- or a two- or a three-year vacancy?

1743
01:56:07,809 --> 01:56:08,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Which vacancy is it?

1744
01:56:09,193 --> 01:56:09,813
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be a one.

1745
01:56:11,313 --> 01:56:14,834
[SPEAKER_06]: You also go to section 5066, meetings and quorum.

1746
01:56:15,674 --> 01:56:18,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the one that I think I would make a suggested change.

1747
01:56:18,435 --> 01:56:24,516
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, when enough members are present to constitute a quorum, a majority of those present shall be sufficient for any action taken.

1748
01:56:24,916 --> 01:56:29,656
[SPEAKER_06]: So if only five out of nine show up, you're going to tell me three out of five and the decision?

1749
01:56:29,676 --> 01:56:29,956
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1750
01:56:30,197 --> 01:56:33,657
[SPEAKER_24]: Five out of the, it has to be five for a quorum.

1751
01:56:35,037 --> 01:56:35,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1752
01:56:35,297 --> 01:56:37,338
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also says a majority of those present.

1753
01:56:37,798 --> 01:56:38,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So if five show up,

1754
01:56:39,315 --> 01:56:43,597
[SPEAKER_06]: and a majority of five is three, they're going to set the tempo for nine members?

1755
01:56:44,838 --> 01:56:45,518
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't believe that.

1756
01:56:45,558 --> 01:56:46,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Give me the.

1757
01:56:46,919 --> 01:56:47,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Section 50-66.

1758
01:56:47,339 --> 01:56:48,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1759
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:50,181
[SPEAKER_18]: I read that also.

1760
01:56:50,241 --> 01:56:55,744
[SPEAKER_18]: The sufficiency of the vote would always be a majority, just like it is with a council rule.

1761
01:56:56,084 --> 01:56:58,805
[SPEAKER_18]: You couldn't pass something to the council unless you had four votes.

1762
01:57:00,006 --> 01:57:00,826
[SPEAKER_06]: But this doesn't say that.

1763
01:57:02,027 --> 01:57:03,988
[SPEAKER_18]: It says that the majority.

1764
01:57:04,368 --> 01:57:05,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Those present.

1765
01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:07,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Those present shall be sufficient.

1766
01:57:08,308 --> 01:57:10,630
[SPEAKER_18]: The sufficiency of the vote would always be a majority.

1767
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:11,591
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't say that.

1768
01:57:11,631 --> 01:57:13,652
[SPEAKER_18]: A majority of the commission.

1769
01:57:13,672 --> 01:57:15,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that should say that and not of those present.

1770
01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:17,595
[SPEAKER_06]: It says a majority of those present.

1771
01:57:17,975 --> 01:57:20,477
[SPEAKER_18]: That should say a majority of the commission.

1772
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:23,779
[SPEAKER_18]: Sufficiency of the vote is always a majority.

1773
01:57:26,962 --> 01:57:29,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor Knight.

1774
01:57:29,163 --> 01:57:30,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to amend that last line.

1775
01:57:31,085 --> 01:57:36,669
[SPEAKER_06]: After the word majority of, it should say a majority of the commission and eliminate the words

1776
01:57:37,334 --> 01:57:42,877
[SPEAKER_06]: and those present out of section 50-66, meetings quorum, that's the headline.

1777
01:57:46,438 --> 01:57:47,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you say that again, please, Counselor?

1778
01:57:47,939 --> 01:57:48,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor Knight.

1779
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:50,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a point of clarification.

1780
01:57:51,001 --> 01:57:53,822
[SPEAKER_08]: As I read it, it says five members of the commission shall constitute a quorum.

1781
01:57:54,322 --> 01:57:59,965
[SPEAKER_08]: No binding decision shall be made at any meeting at which not enough members are present to constitute a quorum when enough members operate.

1782
01:58:00,005 --> 01:58:01,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I see what you're saying, Counselor.

1783
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:07,861
[SPEAKER_08]: A vote of three of five could constitute a majority vote as opposed to a vote of five of nine.

1784
01:58:10,001 --> 01:58:11,142
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a motion for approval.

1785
01:58:11,902 --> 01:58:14,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to waive the three readings as amended?

1786
01:58:14,102 --> 01:58:17,163
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion by Councilor DelaRusso.

1787
01:58:17,483 --> 01:58:29,485
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll have plenty of motion to Councilor DelaRusso for approval of the ordinance, waiving the three readings, which speeds the process up, uh, as amended by Councilor Penta.

1788
01:58:30,217 --> 01:58:32,099
[SPEAKER_13]: The gentleman behind you, would you like to speak?

1789
01:58:35,101 --> 01:58:36,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Joe Villion, 59 Garfield Ave.

1790
01:58:36,902 --> 01:58:44,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank the HRC for being proactive when a local church was hiding behind freedom of religion to speak out against other people's civil rights.

1791
01:58:44,428 --> 01:58:47,271
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a proactive move that I really appreciated.

1792
01:58:47,771 --> 01:58:58,700
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is that if a victim is a target of the recent graffiti, say, at a university here, is this new merger going to be proactive and help

1793
01:58:59,627 --> 01:59:02,229
[SPEAKER_10]: the individual that may have been targeted by that graffiti.

1794
01:59:02,249 --> 01:59:15,120
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we had a local non-profit that was alleged to have engaged in racism and homophobia, and I spoke to the HRC, and they are a teaching entity, and Ms.

1795
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:29,031
[SPEAKER_10]: McCloud can clarify it if I'm incorrect, but they couldn't step in and help us with that really bad situation, which this council and some of the community in the mayor and the city solicitor helped eradicate.

1796
01:59:29,378 --> 01:59:43,551
[SPEAKER_10]: But it took us a lot of time, and if we had an entity that could step in when there's blatant racism and homophobia, as we saw posted right in Medford Square, that would go a long way in making people feel comfortable in this city.

1797
01:59:44,052 --> 01:59:52,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now, I think it's only an advisory board, and I would like to see if that could be clarified and if we can move forward with a stronger commission that has more power.

1798
01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:53,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1799
01:59:53,641 --> 01:59:54,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record.

1800
01:59:57,053 --> 01:59:58,094
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1801
01:59:58,134 --> 02:00:00,315
[SPEAKER_27]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1802
02:00:01,515 --> 02:00:05,518
[SPEAKER_27]: If I could, through the President's chair, ask just a few questions.

1803
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:22,127
[SPEAKER_27]: I wonder how many cases of discrimination of this nature in housing have happened, maybe recently, and what is the actual process of investigating these accusations?

1804
02:00:22,207 --> 02:00:24,408
[SPEAKER_27]: Because as, I think her name is Miss McLeod,

1805
02:00:25,243 --> 02:00:32,005
[SPEAKER_27]: alluded to, she said, like, we don't want to see things that happened in Ferguson happen here.

1806
02:00:32,525 --> 02:00:40,168
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, I know that the popular opinion of what happened in Ferguson, Missouri—and please, don't get me wrong.

1807
02:00:40,248 --> 02:00:44,209
[SPEAKER_27]: I want everybody's rights to always be protected.

1808
02:00:45,069 --> 02:00:49,711
[SPEAKER_27]: Our rights were never given by any legislative body.

1809
02:00:50,171 --> 02:00:52,832
[SPEAKER_27]: We believe in the founding of this nation.

1810
02:00:53,179 --> 02:00:58,362
[SPEAKER_27]: that our rights come from God, that are inalienable, that we're born with.

1811
02:00:58,943 --> 02:01:01,244
[SPEAKER_27]: And therefore, they should be protected.

1812
02:01:01,864 --> 02:01:19,115
[SPEAKER_27]: But what happened in Ferguson, if I understand the testimony from the grand jury, was that the officer, Mr. Wilson, I believe his name was, didn't do anything out of line.

1813
02:01:19,775 --> 02:01:22,597
[SPEAKER_27]: And he was just performing his job.

1814
02:01:23,142 --> 02:01:32,724
[SPEAKER_27]: So, but, like, it just concerns me, the process of investigation of these matters and how many of them actually happened.

1815
02:01:32,744 --> 02:01:45,027
[SPEAKER_27]: Because the truth of what happened in Ferguson, just on CNN the other night, there were correspondents doing hands up, don't shoot, and that never happened in Ferguson, Missouri.

1816
02:01:45,427 --> 02:01:49,968
[SPEAKER_27]: We have popular opinion causing

1817
02:01:51,246 --> 02:01:54,949
[SPEAKER_27]: Groups of people go out in New York City screaming, what do we want?

1818
02:01:55,150 --> 02:01:55,970
[SPEAKER_27]: Dead cops.

1819
02:01:56,311 --> 02:01:57,192
[SPEAKER_27]: When do we want them?

1820
02:01:57,652 --> 02:01:58,553
[SPEAKER_27]: Now.

1821
02:01:58,693 --> 02:02:08,762
[SPEAKER_27]: We have high school kids that just today, through social media, left their classes and stormed the state house and other places.

1822
02:02:09,303 --> 02:02:14,488
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm just concerned that everybody's civil rights is going to be protected, of course.

1823
02:02:14,975 --> 02:02:16,879
[SPEAKER_27]: But the truth is also going to be pursued.

1824
02:02:17,099 --> 02:02:18,161
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1825
02:02:18,181 --> 02:02:21,227
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's how it has always been in Medford, and it will remain that way.

1826
02:02:21,387 --> 02:02:22,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record.

1827
02:02:23,677 --> 02:02:26,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Reverend Noah Evans, 260 Grove Street in Medford.

1828
02:02:26,738 --> 02:02:28,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also the rector of Grace Episcopal Church.

1829
02:02:29,278 --> 02:02:40,000
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stand in support of this ordinance, especially the expanding and adding gender identity and expression to the protected classes in this city.

1830
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:51,062
[SPEAKER_00]: The vestry, the board of Grace Episcopal Church, signed onto a statement last spring in support of this expansion, and it's part of our faith commitment

1831
02:02:51,777 --> 02:02:56,420
[SPEAKER_00]: a faith commitment that we make in our baptism to respect the dignity of every human being.

1832
02:02:56,900 --> 02:03:06,586
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this community wants to be a community that's proud of its diversity in the way that it welcomes and accepts and values and protects all people.

1833
02:03:06,666 --> 02:03:11,668
[SPEAKER_00]: So I strongly want to stand in support of this ordinance and your passage of it tonight.

1834
02:03:11,889 --> 02:03:12,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1835
02:03:12,549 --> 02:03:13,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Reverend.

1836
02:03:15,311 --> 02:03:16,531
[SPEAKER_23]: Name and address for the record.

1837
02:03:16,551 --> 02:03:17,792
[SPEAKER_23]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1838
02:03:18,877 --> 02:03:23,398
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm so on board with you when you talk about the taxes, but Bob, I got to talk about this.

1839
02:03:24,798 --> 02:03:28,059
[SPEAKER_23]: The issues around Ferguson specifically are just very complex.

1840
02:03:29,639 --> 02:03:32,780
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to let you briefly talk on this, but this is about the ordinance.

1841
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:36,500
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to give you a little leeway, but I just want to say it's complex.

1842
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:39,261
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand, but understand what we're trying to do with this ordinance.

1843
02:03:39,401 --> 02:03:39,701
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1844
02:03:39,961 --> 02:03:42,841
[SPEAKER_23]: Well then I, I, uh, I guess I'm okay with the ordinance.

1845
02:03:43,281 --> 02:03:46,462
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to say that, uh, the issues are very complex.

1846
02:03:47,423 --> 02:03:51,044
[SPEAKER_23]: and simple answers for complex problems.

1847
02:03:52,184 --> 02:03:53,025
[SPEAKER_23]: It can't be happening.

1848
02:03:53,485 --> 02:03:53,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1849
02:03:54,105 --> 02:03:57,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford has always been and will remain very inclusive.

1850
02:03:57,566 --> 02:03:57,886
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1851
02:03:58,546 --> 02:04:09,449
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councillor Knight for approval as amended by Councillor Penta and Councillor DelaRusso made a motion to waive the three readings on this ordinance.

1852
02:04:09,909 --> 02:04:10,869
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk will call the roll.

1853
02:04:12,230 --> 02:04:13,950
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you everyone for coming out this evening.

1854
02:04:22,308 --> 02:04:23,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Carabiello?

1855
02:04:23,269 --> 02:04:23,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1856
02:04:24,569 --> 02:04:25,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Dela Russo?

1857
02:04:25,550 --> 02:04:25,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1858
02:04:26,251 --> 02:04:26,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1859
02:04:26,871 --> 02:04:27,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1860
02:04:27,611 --> 02:04:28,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Kerr?

1861
02:04:28,492 --> 02:04:28,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1862
02:04:29,152 --> 02:04:29,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

1863
02:04:29,973 --> 02:04:30,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1864
02:04:30,833 --> 02:04:31,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta?

1865
02:04:31,334 --> 02:04:31,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1866
02:04:32,555 --> 02:04:33,335
[SPEAKER_09]: President Camuso?

1867
02:04:33,735 --> 02:04:33,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1868
02:04:34,116 --> 02:04:39,219
[SPEAKER_13]: By a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, this is passed unanimously by the Medford City Council.

1869
02:04:46,063 --> 02:04:47,084
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1870
02:04:48,405 --> 02:04:50,026
[SPEAKER_22]: Are we moving on?

1871
02:04:50,226 --> 02:04:50,426
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1872
02:04:50,951 --> 02:04:53,393
[SPEAKER_22]: Just while we're under suspension, we have the chief of police here.

1873
02:04:53,413 --> 02:04:54,374
[SPEAKER_22]: If we could take paper 14-785.

1874
02:04:54,414 --> 02:04:55,374
[SPEAKER_22]: What else?

1875
02:04:55,614 --> 02:05:01,199
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, mine's quick.

1876
02:05:01,939 --> 02:05:02,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Mine will be quick.

1877
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:06,502
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no.

1878
02:05:06,643 --> 02:05:07,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Item 14-785.

1879
02:05:08,864 --> 02:05:09,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Please.

1880
02:05:09,344 --> 02:05:10,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Offered by Councilor Lungo Kern.

1881
02:05:10,946 --> 02:05:17,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the chief of police look into the new program that many cities and towns are implementing, which is called Coffee with a Cup.

1882
02:05:18,291 --> 02:05:19,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it further...

1883
02:05:21,497 --> 02:05:26,199
[SPEAKER_13]: resolve that Medford look into implementing the program once per month after the new year.

1884
02:05:26,259 --> 02:05:27,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1885
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:29,000
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Camuso.

1886
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:38,524
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw a police officer, a friend of mine, posted pictures of coffee with a cop, but it was down in Barnstable County.

1887
02:05:39,084 --> 02:05:42,886
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, a couple months went by and I said, I got to talk to the chief about this.

1888
02:05:43,646 --> 02:05:49,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Then two weeks ago, I was in Chelsea at the Starbucks right across from Market Basket and

1889
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:58,286
[SPEAKER_22]: Right outside the Starbucks was Coffee with a Cop, so I realized that it was happening within large communities like ours.

1890
02:05:59,187 --> 02:06:17,762
[SPEAKER_22]: There was probably, I don't know if what we do has to be as extensive as Chelsea, but there were probably 10 plus police officers there, you know, 10, 20 citizens coming in and out, so maybe about 30, 30 citizens just coming to meet a police officer, asking questions, mingling,

1891
02:06:18,528 --> 02:06:33,318
[SPEAKER_22]: What I thought was important about it and why I'd like to bring it to Medford is, especially in light of all that's happened in the last year or two, you get to see the faces, you get to learn the names, and it's not just the citizens learning the police officers' names, it's vice versa.

1892
02:06:33,418 --> 02:06:40,403
[SPEAKER_22]: It was the police officers seeing, there was young children there, so it was just seeing faces and getting to know the community.

1893
02:06:40,423 --> 02:06:45,547
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's, I'd love to hear your opinion on it and see maybe whether it's once a month

1894
02:06:46,193 --> 02:06:48,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Every few months, we pick a different location.

1895
02:06:48,374 --> 02:06:50,155
[SPEAKER_22]: We have bestsellers.

1896
02:06:50,235 --> 02:06:53,716
[SPEAKER_22]: We have Mr. Coffee Roasters.

1897
02:06:53,756 --> 02:06:56,097
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we have Dunkin' Donuts, Starbucks all over the place.

1898
02:06:56,157 --> 02:07:02,180
[SPEAKER_22]: And whether it's one or two to 10 police officers at a time, I think it's something that would be beneficial.

1899
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:08,242
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, obviously, we'd like to start in the South Medford area where we have the biggest amount of problems.

1900
02:07:08,342 --> 02:07:11,283
[SPEAKER_22]: But I just thought it was a great program.

1901
02:07:11,303 --> 02:07:13,884
[SPEAKER_22]: I think people in Medford really take to it.

1902
02:07:14,384 --> 02:07:15,485
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's an opportunity.

1903
02:07:16,028 --> 02:07:18,949
[SPEAKER_22]: to, you know, the community meetings you run, Chief, are great.

1904
02:07:19,229 --> 02:07:24,791
[SPEAKER_22]: I was very, very impressed with how many, you know, the detectives were there at the last meeting I went to.

1905
02:07:24,871 --> 02:07:25,491
[SPEAKER_22]: You were there.

1906
02:07:26,331 --> 02:07:32,273
[SPEAKER_22]: There was police officers there, probably the same thing, 10 or 15 police officers from all ranks.

1907
02:07:32,994 --> 02:07:35,875
[SPEAKER_22]: But that was on a, you know, weeknight at 7 p.m.

1908
02:07:36,055 --> 02:07:36,955
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to bring this.

1909
02:07:37,215 --> 02:07:40,256
[SPEAKER_22]: The one I went to in Chelsea, or I happened to be at, was at

1910
02:07:41,540 --> 02:07:42,960
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to say maybe 10 a.m.

1911
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:47,241
[SPEAKER_22]: on a Wednesday morning, but I propose that maybe we pick a different day of the week each time we do it.

1912
02:07:47,621 --> 02:07:49,822
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you'd get a whole host of people coming out.

1913
02:07:50,562 --> 02:07:56,683
[SPEAKER_22]: They were gracious to my daughter, and, you know, it's just, she had a smile on her face.

1914
02:07:56,703 --> 02:08:03,425
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, she knew, you know, what the police, they all had their uniform on, and I think it's good for all ages, and I think it would be great for the community.

1915
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:05,601
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't disagree.

1916
02:08:05,661 --> 02:08:10,424
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, I've spoken with Chief Kyes and Chelsea to find out how that was working.

1917
02:08:10,804 --> 02:08:12,665
[SPEAKER_26]: And he said it's been going very well.

1918
02:08:13,606 --> 02:08:19,490
[SPEAKER_26]: But just as you had mentioned, for 28 years, we've had the monthly community meetings at 7 p.m.

1919
02:08:19,530 --> 02:08:22,131
[SPEAKER_26]: on a Wednesday night, the first Wednesday of every month.

1920
02:08:22,812 --> 02:08:26,694
[SPEAKER_26]: Some meetings are better attended than others, but at least it's an opportunity.

1921
02:08:27,215 --> 02:08:29,977
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's coffee with a number of police officers.

1922
02:08:30,117 --> 02:08:31,978
[SPEAKER_26]: There's donuts, there's muffins.

1923
02:08:33,195 --> 02:08:39,300
[SPEAKER_26]: So we do that in our way and we've been doing that much longer than many of these other communities.

1924
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:47,186
[SPEAKER_26]: We are looking for other ways to do the outreach and to market the good things that are going on in the city and the good things that are going on in the police department.

1925
02:08:47,966 --> 02:08:52,690
[SPEAKER_26]: I can say there are a lot of people in this community that have coffee with the cops.

1926
02:08:54,467 --> 02:08:58,770
[SPEAKER_26]: go by any donut shop, you know what it says.

1927
02:08:59,631 --> 02:09:12,019
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that there'll be some people who'll give me the business over what I just said, but the fact is, what it is, there are so many donut shops in the city, they could be substations, and we probably wouldn't have to worry too much about a new station.

1928
02:09:12,819 --> 02:09:16,922
[SPEAKER_26]: But the fact of the matter is, it is a good program.

1929
02:09:17,242 --> 02:09:19,684
[SPEAKER_26]: It's something new that's being done by various communities.

1930
02:09:19,744 --> 02:09:23,827
[SPEAKER_26]: We're looking at it, and we may not start it right away,

1931
02:09:25,070 --> 02:09:33,377
[SPEAKER_26]: I would say probably in June, July, and August when things slow down for our regular monthly community meetings, that would be something that we would definitely try by then.

1932
02:09:33,777 --> 02:09:41,664
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't want to just do it without having a little more background information and get some buy-in from the offices that they would want to be willing participants.

1933
02:09:41,744 --> 02:09:50,611
[SPEAKER_26]: But they're very willing to be part of the outreach program today is what they do in their normal daily activities.

1934
02:09:50,692 --> 02:09:52,413
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think this is a good thing.

1935
02:09:52,707 --> 02:09:53,227
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Chief.

1936
02:09:53,307 --> 02:09:57,408
[SPEAKER_22]: I know we have, we do, I truly believe we have some great police officers in Medford.

1937
02:09:57,428 --> 02:10:02,329
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, just to get them to talk to the people I think would be huge.

1938
02:10:03,289 --> 02:10:11,671
[SPEAKER_26]: Just what I hear from the young people in the schools, you know, in the DARE program, you know, it's a big thing to wave, to smile, and you know, say hello.

1939
02:10:11,751 --> 02:10:15,052
[SPEAKER_26]: Three little things, very simple, that would go a long way.

1940
02:10:15,672 --> 02:10:16,092
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks, Chief.

1941
02:10:16,172 --> 02:10:16,452
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1942
02:10:19,648 --> 02:10:20,488
[SPEAKER_23]: Name and address, Fleur.

1943
02:10:20,908 --> 02:10:29,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street, and I'd like to just echo what he said, that this is a great beginning for street walking police officers.

1944
02:10:29,371 --> 02:10:30,132
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a great beginning.

1945
02:10:30,692 --> 02:10:34,893
[SPEAKER_23]: We need to get out there because we have had demographic shifts like never before.

1946
02:10:35,353 --> 02:10:39,295
[SPEAKER_23]: We have more students all over the place at Tufts University.

1947
02:10:39,335 --> 02:10:41,616
[SPEAKER_23]: We have whole neighborhoods that have changed.

1948
02:10:43,336 --> 02:10:45,557
[SPEAKER_23]: The Glenwood section,

1949
02:10:46,319 --> 02:10:48,640
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the stop-and-shop, you won't recognize anybody.

1950
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:51,181
[SPEAKER_23]: There's so many new faces down at that stop-and-shop.

1951
02:10:52,361 --> 02:10:54,282
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see the new people coming in and going out.

1952
02:10:54,802 --> 02:10:56,382
[SPEAKER_23]: And these people are renters.

1953
02:10:56,682 --> 02:11:04,905
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of these two-family houses have turned into rental properties, and so you need to make yourself a... You need to find them because they're not going to come to you.

1954
02:11:05,285 --> 02:11:09,286
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to encourage this program and to continue it.

1955
02:11:09,326 --> 02:11:09,627
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1956
02:11:09,647 --> 02:11:10,727
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1968
02:13:06,475 --> 02:13:08,616
[SPEAKER_13]: and all documents incidental thereto.

1969
02:13:09,196 --> 02:13:19,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Number four, that the following funds be appropriated and be available to fund the Peace Garden project and to up front the costs of the PARC grant, the sources of this appropriation are as follows.

1970
02:13:19,501 --> 02:13:27,464
[SPEAKER_13]: $100,000 from Cummings Foundation, $50,000 from Wynn Resorts, payment number one, $200,000 from Wynn Resorts, payment number two, $4,475 from Miscellaneous Contributions, a $475,000

1971
02:13:36,957 --> 02:13:42,559
[SPEAKER_13]: section 125 federal transportation earmark will also be used to fund construction costs.

1972
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:45,841
[SPEAKER_13]: The total estimated peace garden construction cost is $1,128,725,000.

1973
02:13:46,101 --> 02:13:56,145
[SPEAKER_13]: That the resolution takes effect upon its passage, and that is number five, that the resolution takes effect upon its passage.

1974
02:13:57,445 --> 02:13:58,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record.

1975
02:13:58,866 --> 02:14:01,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Lauren DiLorenzo, Director of the Office of Community Development.

1976
02:14:01,447 --> 02:14:03,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, members of the Council, thank you for

1977
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:30,464
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting with us the committee of the whole prior to this for presentation on the update of the Senior Center of Garden which is a Peace Garden which has been proposed to honor the victims of the Boston Marathon Marathon about bombing excuse me and I think we've talked about this project before we've been moving ahead on this we have a variety of sources of funds to move this project from a concept to a reality and I am asking for your support tonight to accept and

1978
02:14:31,478 --> 02:14:46,368
[SPEAKER_01]: a grant that we have applied for from the state in the amount of $299,350.14, and to also accept and to appropriate funds that have been donated to the project, as the president has detailed for you earlier.

1979
02:14:46,969 --> 02:14:48,910
[SPEAKER_01]: The project is well-conceived.

1980
02:14:49,811 --> 02:14:58,477
[SPEAKER_01]: It is probably one of the most special park projects and projects that we have done.

1981
02:14:59,531 --> 02:15:02,212
[SPEAKER_01]: In the city, there's been a lot of interest in it.

1982
02:15:02,473 --> 02:15:04,033
[SPEAKER_01]: You've all been supportive to date.

1983
02:15:04,614 --> 02:15:09,776
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to seek your support in the future as we move forward so that we can actually get this project out to bid.

1984
02:15:09,796 --> 02:15:18,181
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we've talked about this before, it does serve a larger population, but it is on the grounds of the Medford Senior Center.

1985
02:15:18,761 --> 02:15:21,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that it will be primarily used by the seniors.

1986
02:15:22,663 --> 02:15:26,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that we can move this ahead so we can get this under construction this spring.

1987
02:15:29,163 --> 02:15:29,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion?

1988
02:15:31,765 --> 02:15:35,388
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor DelaRusso, the clerk will call the roll.

1989
02:15:39,652 --> 02:15:40,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Mox.

1990
02:15:41,454 --> 02:15:42,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1991
02:15:44,016 --> 02:15:54,785
[SPEAKER_17]: At tonight's Committee of the Whole meeting, the issue of maintenance of this particular Peace Garden was mentioned.

1992
02:15:55,566 --> 02:15:56,827
[SPEAKER_17]: And from what we were told,

1993
02:15:57,803 --> 02:16:08,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, the maintenance has not been outlined as of yet, but currently I guess is in the process of putting together a full fledged maintenance plan.

1994
02:16:09,747 --> 02:16:26,552
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, I was hoping that we would have this prior to any vote of this council as we, uh, know from, uh, past experience in this community that, um, any project that moves forward, uh, the mayor and the administration is always looking for

1995
02:16:27,295 --> 02:16:37,200
[SPEAKER_17]: a maintenance infrastructure plan on how we're going to maintain, which is going to be city property, how we're going to maintain that property.

1996
02:16:37,741 --> 02:16:40,422
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would see this park as no difference.

1997
02:16:40,502 --> 02:16:50,367
[SPEAKER_17]: I realize the administration is touting this Peace Garden and that's under the mayor's purview to do that.

1998
02:16:50,868 --> 02:16:55,110
[SPEAKER_17]: However, while we have so many infrastructure demands,

1999
02:16:55,738 --> 02:17:25,182
[SPEAKER_17]: on both the municipal and educational fronts that require immediate attention in our community, I would support a balanced approach, Mr. President, of the $1,298,725, which would provide a modest memorial honoring the Boston Marathon victims while recognizing the local needs that we currently are addressing within our community, i.e.,

2000
02:17:25,742 --> 02:17:33,887
[SPEAKER_17]: road and sidewalk repairs, educational programming, municipal building maintenance and repair, enhanced public safety measures.

2001
02:17:34,748 --> 02:17:51,418
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we heard tonight that the different earmarks that are going to pay for this Peace Garden and Wynn Resorts has a total of two payments of a combined $250,000.

2002
02:17:54,149 --> 02:18:08,176
[SPEAKER_17]: I as one person that live in the Wellington area, and I think we all recognize this issue when the casino was first mentioned going to Everett, was the number one concern that residents had was the traffic impact in our community.

2003
02:18:09,356 --> 02:18:11,197
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the number two was public safety.

2004
02:18:11,717 --> 02:18:17,660
[SPEAKER_17]: And number three was the impact it would have to the local business economy in the area.

2005
02:18:18,501 --> 02:18:21,422
[SPEAKER_17]: And I am very disappointed that

2006
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:42,234
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor opted to put $250,000 from Wynn Resorts into a Peace Garden when, in my opinion, the number one issues that were mentioned over the past year should have been on the table and addressed, whether it's public safety, whether it's traffic mitigation.

2007
02:18:42,934 --> 02:18:51,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Any one of those issues, the $250,000 could have gone to improve conditions within our community, Mr. President.

2008
02:18:53,300 --> 02:19:21,058
[SPEAKER_17]: I am not opposed to memorializing the devastating impact that that marathon bombing had, in particular on one of our own in the community and four additional others, and many countless people that were injured during that day that still suffer the emotional scars from that particular time.

2009
02:19:22,044 --> 02:19:31,891
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I believe that we could do this in a way that we could accomplish that goal and also accomplish the many needs that we hear over and over again.

2010
02:19:32,651 --> 02:19:39,836
[SPEAKER_17]: As you can see within the chamber itself today, we have construction being done on the ceiling and parts of the ceiling that are caving in.

2011
02:19:40,196 --> 02:19:44,539
[SPEAKER_17]: We all know the conditions of our municipal buildings throughout the city.

2012
02:19:45,219 --> 02:19:50,963
[SPEAKER_17]: We heard earlier tonight about 1,200,000 of improvements needed in our public school system.

2013
02:19:51,438 --> 02:19:52,679
[SPEAKER_17]: And the list goes on and on.

2014
02:19:53,179 --> 02:20:02,464
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not saying that this demand list or this list that's out there of needs should replace any other thing that may take place in the community.

2015
02:20:02,745 --> 02:20:04,265
[SPEAKER_17]: We always need to move forward.

2016
02:20:04,626 --> 02:20:10,309
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I think there could be a balance of the spending on this particular memorial.

2017
02:20:10,849 --> 02:20:20,775
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would support moving forward on a modest memorial, one that can accomplish that goal and also accomplish the goals

2018
02:20:21,162 --> 02:20:27,646
[SPEAKER_17]: that are before us in our community regarding public safety, regarding road repairs, regarding infrastructure, Mr. President.

2019
02:20:28,087 --> 02:20:29,908
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are the comments I wanted to make.

2020
02:20:30,508 --> 02:20:39,474
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also wanted to clarify that the construction cost may be $1,128,725, but you also have to factor in the design and the initial survey cost.

2021
02:20:39,494 --> 02:20:39,634
[SPEAKER_17]: That's $170,000.

2022
02:20:40,015 --> 02:20:43,437
[SPEAKER_17]: And that brings it up to the figure I mentioned, a million — almost $1,300,000.

2023
02:20:51,552 --> 02:20:52,893
[SPEAKER_17]: It's $1,298,725.

2024
02:20:54,953 --> 02:20:57,294
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know how my colleagues feel on that.

2025
02:20:58,394 --> 02:21:20,042
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe the current lack of a maintenance plan, although it's in the works, and I'm not doubting it's not in the works, this project, according to the mayor, according to the article I have from the Boston Globe, and this was dated April 11, 2014, it said the design plans have been in the works for 11 months.

2026
02:21:20,842 --> 02:21:32,331
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would date that back to May of 2013, Mr. President, that this proposal was out there in the administration and his staff was working on it.

2027
02:21:33,132 --> 02:21:42,879
[SPEAKER_17]: And we, as a council, had very little input because my input at the time would have been, let's go, let's get something done, but not to that level.

2028
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:45,041
[SPEAKER_17]: We have too many needs in this community.

2029
02:21:45,462 --> 02:21:47,263
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are my comments, Mr. President.

2030
02:21:47,971 --> 02:21:57,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and I look eager to hear what my colleagues have to say on the motion of approval by counselor Della Russo clerk.

2031
02:21:57,358 --> 02:21:57,958
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll call the roll.

2032
02:21:59,179 --> 02:22:00,640
[SPEAKER_13]: You didn't press your button until just now.

2033
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:02,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Counsel, go ahead.

2034
02:22:02,842 --> 02:22:03,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Love to hear from you.

2035
02:22:04,022 --> 02:22:16,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we've had many conversations about this as you know, and it's not that I'm opposed to the garden, but in part I'm opposed to the expenditure of this large amount of money.

2036
02:22:17,055 --> 02:22:22,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have an issue as it relates to how it's being dedicated.

2037
02:22:22,858 --> 02:22:29,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe, unfortunately, what happened to this young lady shouldn't have happened to anyone.

2038
02:22:30,462 --> 02:22:45,449
[SPEAKER_06]: But she and three others who the mayor has decided to nominate the dedication to be for, I think it misses the boat about all the people that really did get hurt and killed and some people damaged for the rest of their lives.

2039
02:22:46,567 --> 02:22:53,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Two parts that I don't agree with on this, as I attended the meeting in, what was it?

2040
02:22:53,911 --> 02:22:56,432
[SPEAKER_06]: The linkage meeting back in- April.

2041
02:22:56,552 --> 02:22:57,853
[SPEAKER_06]: April 16th of this past year.

2042
02:22:57,873 --> 02:23:04,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And the mayor at that point in time indicated, quote, that people are calling off the phone wanting to make contributions.

2043
02:23:05,336 --> 02:23:09,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we have indicated here tonight, with the paper that you've submitted,

2044
02:23:14,793 --> 02:23:17,354
[SPEAKER_06]: $475 on miscellaneous contributions.

2045
02:23:17,854 --> 02:23:21,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I look at the wind contributions of $250,000, two separate ones.

2046
02:23:22,656 --> 02:23:42,364
[SPEAKER_06]: It was this Medford City Council, I believe in January of last year, between Councilor Lengel and myself, who introduced resolutions on the matter of the wind casino being a community next door, having a preference as to, you know, what our position should be, who I believe there were seven resolutions between Councilor Lengel and myself,

2047
02:23:43,145 --> 02:23:55,968
[SPEAKER_06]: passed forward as it relates to the impact of that casino that was sent to the mayor, and the mayor never once responded back to this council, never once asked us in part of mitigation and as a surrounding community what we would be looking for.

2048
02:23:55,988 --> 02:24:10,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I remember correctly, he himself submitted a document to the Mass Gaming Commission indicating money to be used for the Wellington area for program study, for the traffic impact, and I believe there was another one as it relates to the Wellington Circle intersection over there.

2049
02:24:12,457 --> 02:24:23,979
[SPEAKER_06]: taking that and coming forward and now recognizing that Wynn has given us $250,000 and never once has the mayor ever come to this council and just saying, listen, I've got $250,000.

2050
02:24:24,399 --> 02:24:27,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd even like to use part of it at this park over here.

2051
02:24:27,620 --> 02:24:29,480
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you guys and ladies like to do with it?

2052
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:33,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing, never, no response, absolutely zero as it relates to that.

2053
02:24:34,261 --> 02:24:38,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we get the $100,000 contribution from the Cummings Foundation and that's all well and good.

2054
02:24:39,342 --> 02:24:44,604
[SPEAKER_06]: If he felt that he wanted to submit that, get the $100,000, so be it.

2055
02:24:44,624 --> 02:25:02,010
[SPEAKER_06]: But now you're taking the $475,000 from, which was originally going to be the mayor's water taxi park development over there on Clippership Drive, for which, again, council never, no public hearing ever took place before this council to ask for our recommendation.

2056
02:25:02,390 --> 02:25:06,872
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you alluded to earlier this evening, even though it's a federal grant, a lot of the times,

2057
02:25:07,855 --> 02:25:10,477
[SPEAKER_06]: cities and towns make the request and there's no votes that are taken.

2058
02:25:10,818 --> 02:25:12,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it would have been nice to have a vote.

2059
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:15,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the exact date in front of me.

2060
02:25:15,261 --> 02:25:27,351
[SPEAKER_06]: From my understanding, I believe that the mayor, our state representative, and yourself took a picture less than a month ago indicating that the city of Memphis was receiving this $299,000 grant.

2061
02:25:27,751 --> 02:25:31,414
[SPEAKER_06]: A great presumption by this mayor of how this council would vote.

2062
02:25:32,014 --> 02:25:34,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the time has come that this has got to stop. $1,300,000

2063
02:25:37,438 --> 02:25:40,480
[SPEAKER_06]: $1,300,000 for this particular garden.

2064
02:25:41,701 --> 02:25:43,041
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all the mayor's doing.

2065
02:25:43,562 --> 02:25:45,923
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been no interaction with the city council.

2066
02:25:46,223 --> 02:25:50,185
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been no action for inclusion with the city council of what we would like.

2067
02:25:51,186 --> 02:25:58,130
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there was another individual who unfortunately died in that bombing when it took place at the marathon.

2068
02:25:58,890 --> 02:26:06,274
[SPEAKER_06]: And in that community, we'll leave it nameless, in that particular community, that individual has a nice little grave with a nice little stone with a flag.

2069
02:26:06,893 --> 02:26:09,293
[SPEAKER_06]: and a plaque that identified how and why.

2070
02:26:09,834 --> 02:26:12,974
[SPEAKER_06]: No multi-million dollar peace garden.

2071
02:26:14,034 --> 02:26:26,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I think of this, and I think of all the veterans that are in our cemeteries, and the ones that are going to war now, and the ones that are going to be dying now, and the ones that will be dying in the future, they don't get this million dollar peace garden.

2072
02:26:27,257 --> 02:26:29,057
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is not even being dedicated to them.

2073
02:26:29,117 --> 02:26:32,458
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just being dedicated to how this memorial is basically being set up.

2074
02:26:33,018 --> 02:26:34,638
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the marathon of some two years ago.

2075
02:26:35,125 --> 02:26:47,790
[SPEAKER_06]: And as the gentleman tonight so nicely explained delicately where all these spots are going to be and the compass that's going to be used, you know, and the references to along the way, the 26 mile way would give you an idea of where the marathon took place.

2076
02:26:48,970 --> 02:26:54,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make this clear, especially to the Campbell family, if they're watching and if they have any sense of understanding of what I'm trying to say.

2077
02:26:54,852 --> 02:26:58,033
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a tragedy and I understand that.

2078
02:26:58,994 --> 02:27:02,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's nothing I or anyone else can do to bring back your daughter.

2079
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:06,843
[SPEAKER_06]: But this community, I believe, should have had more of an interaction.

2080
02:27:06,863 --> 02:27:09,064
[SPEAKER_06]: This city council should have had more of an interaction.

2081
02:27:09,365 --> 02:27:16,910
[SPEAKER_06]: This mayor should have been more interactive with us, rather than going on his whim of, I'm going to develop this million dollar peace garden.

2082
02:27:18,091 --> 02:27:21,254
[SPEAKER_06]: For which, completely, it keeps commentary, keeps coming.

2083
02:27:21,634 --> 02:27:23,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be mostly used by the seniors.

2084
02:27:24,756 --> 02:27:27,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, to me, that's not what the peace garden should be about.

2085
02:27:27,278 --> 02:27:28,820
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be mostly used by the community.

2086
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:32,062
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at an intersection that's highly visible by an awful lot of traffic.

2087
02:27:32,437 --> 02:27:34,398
[SPEAKER_06]: but there's going to be no place for them to stop and park.

2088
02:27:35,218 --> 02:27:39,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's going to be used by the seniors, sure, the memorial for the seniors, they're going to pass on.

2089
02:27:40,581 --> 02:27:57,389
[SPEAKER_06]: As the memorial that we have up in the high school on Winthrop Street, it's there for those kids to see each and every day to give them a remembrance of the fellows and the ladies that pass on because they went to war to defend our country and for the freedoms and privileges of other folks and other countries and other lands and for other opportunities.

2090
02:27:58,930 --> 02:28:00,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a scaled-down approach

2091
02:28:01,316 --> 02:28:02,536
[SPEAKER_06]: would be much more palatable.

2092
02:28:02,957 --> 02:28:11,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the monies, if this city has this unique opportunity, and you certainly do a good job of getting money for parks and recreation in this community, there's no question about it.

2093
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:19,203
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think if the efforts could be geared into another direction for community use.

2094
02:28:19,935 --> 02:28:21,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're dealing with a deficit.

2095
02:28:21,395 --> 02:28:26,136
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a very small office, maybe two people at the very most, two and a half.

2096
02:28:26,716 --> 02:28:29,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to your sister city in Somerville, and they've got 13 and 14.

2097
02:28:30,117 --> 02:28:35,958
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the reason why they're way ahead of us as it relates to development and things to be done, because they can spread their wings and look at things.

2098
02:28:37,098 --> 02:28:40,318
[SPEAKER_06]: The Peace Garden started off as a priest garden.

2099
02:28:40,338 --> 02:28:42,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they said they didn't attach a name to it.

2100
02:28:42,339 --> 02:28:43,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Then now they're attaching a name to it.

2101
02:28:45,179 --> 02:28:46,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the gesture nice?

2102
02:28:46,299 --> 02:28:46,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

2103
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:48,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the remembrance nice?

2104
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:48,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

2105
02:28:49,713 --> 02:28:53,376
[SPEAKER_06]: of having the remembrance for this young lady, yes, and for the three other folks.

2106
02:28:53,916 --> 02:28:55,858
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think it fits the budget right now.

2107
02:28:56,519 --> 02:29:02,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like to be presumed and have my vote presumed on any dollar amount in this community.

2108
02:29:03,304 --> 02:29:09,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a result of that, Mr. President, I'm going to make a recommendation that this dollar amount be reduced by 50%.

2109
02:29:09,829 --> 02:29:16,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they want to put something together, I think they can have enough monies to be put together

2110
02:29:17,203 --> 02:29:24,547
[SPEAKER_06]: to make a very nice memorial at a $500,000 clip rather than, and I think the money's already there to make the $500,000 meet the obligation.

2111
02:29:26,508 --> 02:29:30,430
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion to strike 1.1 and add $500,000, is that correct?

2112
02:29:30,630 --> 02:29:30,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2113
02:29:32,030 --> 02:29:32,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2114
02:29:33,211 --> 02:29:35,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caravaglia and then Councilor De La Russa.

2115
02:29:36,152 --> 02:29:37,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Lauren, a quick question.

2116
02:29:38,474 --> 02:29:43,536
[SPEAKER_21]: The money from Wynn, is that over and above the million dollars that we're going to get or is that part of the million dollars?

2117
02:29:43,876 --> 02:29:45,217
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a separate commitment.

2118
02:29:46,174 --> 02:29:49,415
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is not part of the $1 million commitment, is that correct?

2119
02:29:50,955 --> 02:29:53,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a solicitor?

2120
02:29:53,716 --> 02:29:53,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2121
02:29:54,136 --> 02:29:56,336
[SPEAKER_18]: The $250,000 is part of the agreement with Wynn.

2122
02:29:56,356 --> 02:29:57,917
[SPEAKER_18]: It's part of the $1 million that we're going to get.

2123
02:29:58,297 --> 02:30:00,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I could break it down for you if I had the agreement yet.

2124
02:30:01,177 --> 02:30:03,418
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's certainly not that Wynn only committed $250,000.

2125
02:30:03,458 --> 02:30:07,539
[SPEAKER_18]: There are many other elements to that agreement.

2126
02:30:09,099 --> 02:30:13,260
[SPEAKER_21]: I know Council Marks mentioned earlier about the maintenance agreement.

2127
02:30:14,038 --> 02:30:15,759
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to see that too, as soon as possible.

2128
02:30:18,580 --> 02:30:22,982
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, the $475,000, that was coming from the water project?

2129
02:30:23,762 --> 02:30:24,342
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

2130
02:30:24,402 --> 02:30:29,324
[SPEAKER_01]: The $475,000 is a federal earmark for the Clippership Linear Park and pathway.

2131
02:30:29,644 --> 02:30:33,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Was that part of the water earmark?

2132
02:30:33,225 --> 02:30:38,948
[SPEAKER_01]: The water taxi is a separate earmark in that it's off of the Clippership Linear Park.

2133
02:30:38,988 --> 02:30:40,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that part of the 475?

2134
02:30:40,408 --> 02:30:40,748
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it is not.

2135
02:30:43,252 --> 02:30:45,454
[SPEAKER_01]: That's additional allocation for that.

2136
02:30:45,534 --> 02:30:46,355
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a separate earmark.

2137
02:30:46,995 --> 02:30:51,598
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that water taxing money still floating around?

2138
02:30:51,759 --> 02:30:55,922
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a proposed scope of services that's been sent to the state.

2139
02:30:56,102 --> 02:30:57,303
[SPEAKER_01]: They send it to the feds.

2140
02:30:57,323 --> 02:30:58,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at the feds being reviewed now.

2141
02:30:59,905 --> 02:31:00,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, it is.

2142
02:31:01,266 --> 02:31:02,186
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not floating around.

2143
02:31:02,547 --> 02:31:05,769
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still there, and we are attempting to access that money.

2144
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:08,091
[SPEAKER_21]: So that money couldn't be used for this pact?

2145
02:31:09,585 --> 02:31:10,566
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that will not.

2146
02:31:10,586 --> 02:31:12,287
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a Feripo discretionary grant.

2147
02:31:12,327 --> 02:31:13,508
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very specific.

2148
02:31:14,508 --> 02:31:19,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as this park grant application is specific to this particular project based on the application that we have.

2149
02:31:20,532 --> 02:31:34,401
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't mind, can I just clarify that if this allocation is cut in half, all of the design plans have to be changed, this earmark would not be available, and really the funding package would have to be completely changed.

2150
02:31:34,421 --> 02:31:36,122
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to stress that.

2151
02:31:36,142 --> 02:31:37,503
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to see as soon as possible

2152
02:31:38,075 --> 02:31:40,156
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, the, uh, the maintenance package.

2153
02:31:40,916 --> 02:31:51,359
[SPEAKER_01]: We, as I said, at the committee of the whole, we have a meeting this week with some of the division and department heads to discuss how we best going to approach maintenance and that I was going to be donating services, right?

2154
02:31:51,399 --> 02:31:55,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll submit, I'll submit that plan to you as soon as we know what it is with, with an estimated cost.

2155
02:31:55,820 --> 02:31:58,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of clarification, Mr. President, clarification.

2156
02:31:58,301 --> 02:31:59,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just say that?

2157
02:31:59,790 --> 02:32:02,533
[SPEAKER_06]: The $75,000 for the water taxi is not part of the 475?

2158
02:32:03,694 --> 02:32:07,017
[SPEAKER_01]: $475,000 is a separate earmark.

2159
02:32:07,337 --> 02:32:11,040
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a transportation earmark for Clippership Linear Path and Parkway.

2160
02:32:11,481 --> 02:32:14,403
[SPEAKER_01]: The ferryboat discretionary grant is approximately $795,000.

2161
02:32:14,463 --> 02:32:15,184
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a separate earmark.

2162
02:32:15,224 --> 02:32:16,385
[SPEAKER_01]: When was our public hearing for that one?

2163
02:32:20,803 --> 02:32:23,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't even have an approved scope of work.

2164
02:32:23,164 --> 02:32:27,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we have an approved, the feds have allowed that to go forward, we will have public meetings on that.

2165
02:32:28,986 --> 02:32:30,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand your frustration.

2166
02:32:30,666 --> 02:32:32,887
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the process that we don't have that money yet.

2167
02:32:33,407 --> 02:32:37,108
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an earmark without the money being allocated, I should say, to the project.

2168
02:32:37,128 --> 02:32:48,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to point that further, Mr. President, how could you, why would you want to spend that much time, effort, and energy on something that, I mean, if this is another project of the mayor's, I mean, it's taking away from other projects that the city needs.

2169
02:32:48,932 --> 02:32:50,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And this council isn't even aware of that one.

2170
02:32:53,485 --> 02:32:53,845
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2171
02:32:53,965 --> 02:32:55,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Dela Russo.

2172
02:32:56,067 --> 02:33:01,711
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, again, I motion approval of the paper that was presented before us.

2173
02:33:03,652 --> 02:33:03,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2174
02:33:04,052 --> 02:33:17,541
[SPEAKER_13]: And just one clarification, um, your motion to strike out the 1.1, that is, uh, you can make a resolution, but the motion before us is just to accept the paper and authorize submission by the city.

2175
02:33:17,721 --> 02:33:18,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll move to amend the paper.

2176
02:33:18,862 --> 02:33:19,062
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2177
02:33:19,162 --> 02:33:20,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll move to amend the paper.

2178
02:33:20,827 --> 02:33:21,867
[SPEAKER_06]: To amend the paper to 1.3.

2179
02:33:22,567 --> 02:33:24,468
[SPEAKER_13]: The paper isn't requesting us to amend it.

2180
02:33:24,568 --> 02:33:26,648
[SPEAKER_13]: It's authorizing the mayor to submit the application.

2181
02:33:26,668 --> 02:33:29,209
[SPEAKER_13]: I would ask the city solicitor for clarification.

2182
02:33:30,049 --> 02:33:32,410
[SPEAKER_13]: The bottom line where the mayor put 1.128.

2183
02:33:32,450 --> 02:33:34,950
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to amend the paper, amend the dollar amount.

2184
02:33:35,390 --> 02:33:38,371
[SPEAKER_18]: This is only to submit the grant, correct?

2185
02:33:38,951 --> 02:33:44,112
[SPEAKER_18]: If you amend it, let's assume for purposes of analysis that there was an amendment to reduce the dollars.

2186
02:33:44,672 --> 02:33:46,673
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we wouldn't be in compliance with the grant.

2187
02:33:47,845 --> 02:33:54,789
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make any difference, because I think as the rest of the dollars— We don't have to apply for the grant, because the rest of the dollars are there.

2188
02:33:55,850 --> 02:33:57,231
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have to apply for the grant.

2189
02:33:57,271 --> 02:34:00,553
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to get this approval, or we're stuck in the mud.

2190
02:34:00,733 --> 02:34:01,874
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be spinning our tires.

2191
02:34:02,054 --> 02:34:03,494
[SPEAKER_06]: You already have $350,000 from private people.

2192
02:34:03,515 --> 02:34:05,155
[SPEAKER_06]: All you have to come up with is another $100,000.

2193
02:34:10,593 --> 02:34:13,618
[SPEAKER_13]: You can make a recommendation to scale down the project.

2194
02:34:13,658 --> 02:34:15,321
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't agree with the project as presented.

2195
02:34:15,761 --> 02:34:20,830
[SPEAKER_13]: But what we're voting on as the Medford City Council is to authorize the submission of the grant.

2196
02:34:21,290 --> 02:34:23,431
[SPEAKER_13]: for what the mayor deemed $299,350.14.

2197
02:34:23,531 --> 02:34:26,813
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can amend it and then vote on the main paper.

2198
02:34:26,833 --> 02:34:30,334
[SPEAKER_15]: If the amendment fails, then you can vote on the same main paper, or the main motion.

2199
02:34:30,694 --> 02:34:35,056
[SPEAKER_13]: The $1.1 you want to amend, it's just informational.

2200
02:34:35,957 --> 02:34:36,797
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not declarative.

2201
02:34:36,837 --> 02:34:37,918
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not asking for anything.

2202
02:34:37,958 --> 02:34:39,078
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just informational.

2203
02:34:39,098 --> 02:34:42,100
[SPEAKER_13]: The total estimated Peace Guide and construction project cost is $1.128.

2204
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:49,003
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to amend that to read $500,000 when it's not realistic, you can do that, councillor.

2205
02:34:51,582 --> 02:34:53,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight and then Councilor Langel-Koenig.

2206
02:34:54,604 --> 02:34:55,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2207
02:34:56,626 --> 02:35:01,048
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very interesting and informative presentation that was given at the committee of the whole meeting.

2208
02:35:02,229 --> 02:35:13,776
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that jumped out at me was the fact that with the passage of this project will be multiple ADA improvements down at the senior center and multiple ADA compliance improvements down there.

2209
02:35:14,206 --> 02:35:17,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Absent this project, I don't think that these improvements are going to take place.

2210
02:35:17,787 --> 02:35:25,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that these ADA compliance improvements are vital based upon the location alone of where the Peace Garden is going to be.

2211
02:35:25,371 --> 02:35:29,632
[SPEAKER_08]: It's located between two facilities that house elderly and disabled individuals in our community.

2212
02:35:30,713 --> 02:35:34,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I think that it will beautify the square.

2213
02:35:34,274 --> 02:35:41,437
[SPEAKER_08]: It will give people a reason to come and to stop and to stay and to sit, and it will begin to create a revitalization and a utilization of our waterfront.

2214
02:35:42,221 --> 02:35:44,102
[SPEAKER_08]: which is something that this council talks about frequently.

2215
02:35:44,142 --> 02:35:47,544
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a very underutilized asset here in Medford, and that's our waterfront.

2216
02:35:47,884 --> 02:35:53,466
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we need to give people a reason to come to our downtown business districts and a reason to stay in our downtown business districts.

2217
02:35:54,187 --> 02:35:55,827
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I certainly like the plan.

2218
02:35:56,227 --> 02:36:01,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that it provides improvements for accessibility, but it also provides improvements for a cycling community.

2219
02:36:01,950 --> 02:36:03,971
[SPEAKER_08]: It puts bicycle racks in there.

2220
02:36:04,111 --> 02:36:08,653
[SPEAKER_08]: It's accessible to be accessed through multimodal transportation.

2221
02:36:09,217 --> 02:36:10,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think this is a good expenditure.

2222
02:36:10,917 --> 02:36:12,078
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that I'm going to be supporting.

2223
02:36:12,638 --> 02:36:13,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councillor.

2224
02:36:13,838 --> 02:36:15,419
[SPEAKER_22]: Councillor Lungo-Kern and then Councillor Marks.

2225
02:36:15,899 --> 02:36:18,139
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Camuso.

2226
02:36:18,159 --> 02:36:20,320
[SPEAKER_22]: I have mixed feelings about this.

2227
02:36:22,100 --> 02:36:24,741
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's one of those votes where your heart wants to vote for you ahead.

2228
02:36:24,821 --> 02:36:31,142
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just saying it's very extensive, $1.3 million for 25,000 square feet.

2229
02:36:31,723 --> 02:36:36,784
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think a huge, huge aspect of this, which has been mentioned, is the maintenance aspect.

2230
02:36:38,872 --> 02:36:43,695
[SPEAKER_22]: from what I understand, May 2013, that's one year, seven months, and we really don't have a maintenance plan.

2231
02:36:44,796 --> 02:36:52,221
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to see a maintenance plan before I move forward with this vote, whether that's, you know, I know there's a meeting on Thursday with department heads.

2232
02:36:54,182 --> 02:37:00,827
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to know what the maintenance figure would be per year, what the DPW, our Medford DPW would be able to handle.

2233
02:37:01,527 --> 02:37:05,870
[SPEAKER_22]: If they come in and say we cannot handle another thing, then we're talking landscaping bills

2234
02:37:06,263 --> 02:37:09,824
[SPEAKER_22]: weekly bills for landscaping during six months of the year.

2235
02:37:10,384 --> 02:37:18,846
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would like to know what the DPW can handle, what we're going to have to contract out, how much that is going to cost the city.

2236
02:37:18,866 --> 02:37:23,728
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's very good, you know, what the mayor's done and where he's taken money from.

2237
02:37:25,768 --> 02:37:33,871
[SPEAKER_22]: The initial money would be a lot better to handle if we know the taxpayers are going to pay $5,000 in maintenance per year versus $150,000 per year.

2238
02:37:35,825 --> 02:37:41,109
[SPEAKER_22]: I really think that figure is extremely important component of this project.

2239
02:37:42,530 --> 02:37:47,334
[SPEAKER_22]: I also would like to make a motion with regards to the fountain.

2240
02:37:47,574 --> 02:37:53,438
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's one of the most expensive aspects of the construction and the maintenance.

2241
02:37:53,799 --> 02:37:56,661
[SPEAKER_22]: How much is that fountain going to cost?

2242
02:37:58,622 --> 02:38:01,885
[SPEAKER_01]: The estimated cost of the piece of the fountain is $275,000.

2243
02:38:01,925 --> 02:38:03,786
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just an estimate at this stage.

2244
02:38:03,806 --> 02:38:04,567
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't been bid yet.

2245
02:38:06,018 --> 02:38:08,979
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's part of my concern.

2246
02:38:09,319 --> 02:38:10,459
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure it's going to be beautiful.

2247
02:38:10,479 --> 02:38:17,081
[SPEAKER_22]: Believe me, this is something that any city or town would love to have in their community.

2248
02:38:18,122 --> 02:38:26,985
[SPEAKER_22]: But a fountain at $275,000, if that breaks down in completion, say, five years from now, who's going to come up with the $275,000?

2249
02:38:27,445 --> 02:38:31,826
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's probably the most expensive component of this project.

2250
02:38:32,246 --> 02:38:33,327
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this project's great.

2251
02:38:33,387 --> 02:38:34,607
[SPEAKER_22]: ADA, accessibility.

2252
02:38:35,403 --> 02:38:40,364
[SPEAKER_22]: open space, green space for the seniors and the community as a whole.

2253
02:38:40,544 --> 02:38:44,545
[SPEAKER_22]: It's something that I want to vote for, but I just really feel like we need a little more information.

2254
02:38:44,905 --> 02:38:51,607
[SPEAKER_22]: I think something could be put together to make me feel more at ease by next week, especially with the meeting coming up on Thursday.

2255
02:38:51,627 --> 02:38:52,687
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that can be done.

2256
02:38:53,547 --> 02:38:59,908
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of the cost of that is the actual vaults that are put in there, so those won't really break down.

2257
02:38:59,948 --> 02:39:02,969
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pumps that have to be maintained and cleaning.

2258
02:39:03,690 --> 02:39:07,311
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the maintenance, maintenance is always an issue with everything that we do.

2259
02:39:07,972 --> 02:39:11,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that's a function of government.

2260
02:39:11,773 --> 02:39:13,553
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that has to be addressed.

2261
02:39:14,214 --> 02:39:16,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I've asked the council to move on this paper.

2262
02:39:16,894 --> 02:39:18,795
[SPEAKER_01]: We are coming up on a holiday season.

2263
02:39:19,135 --> 02:39:24,297
[SPEAKER_01]: The grant agreement has to be executed, excuse me, by December 31st.

2264
02:39:24,377 --> 02:39:30,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I know that we all know that grants are still taxpayers' dollars.

2265
02:39:31,197 --> 02:39:50,431
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not accessed any municipal taxpayer money to fund this, and I believe that the maintenance amount, the mayor's intention is to get donations for that, and he has had people who have offered to make donations, as Councilman Pinto had talked about before, since some of those will be labor-related.

2266
02:39:50,831 --> 02:39:52,993
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand your concerns.

2267
02:39:53,033 --> 02:39:53,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they will be addressed.

2268
02:39:53,993 --> 02:39:59,237
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be addressed, and I'm still hoping that the council move forward on this paper tonight.

2269
02:40:00,291 --> 02:40:05,433
[SPEAKER_22]: If I may finish it, I think that's important aspect of these donations coming in on a yearly basis.

2270
02:40:05,493 --> 02:40:07,213
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it going to be a one-time donation?

2271
02:40:07,273 --> 02:40:11,175
[SPEAKER_22]: So five, 10 years from now, it's completely up to the city.

2272
02:40:11,595 --> 02:40:14,016
[SPEAKER_22]: I think these numbers, we need to know these numbers.

2273
02:40:14,116 --> 02:40:17,257
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's, and I'm sorry that it's December 31st.

2274
02:40:17,277 --> 02:40:20,018
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have a meeting a couple of days before Christmas.

2275
02:40:20,078 --> 02:40:21,078
[SPEAKER_22]: We can vote on it then.

2276
02:40:21,098 --> 02:40:23,579
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, this should have came before us a month ago.

2277
02:40:23,599 --> 02:40:26,139
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2278
02:40:26,420 --> 02:40:27,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, just to clarify,

2279
02:40:28,096 --> 02:40:34,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lungo-Kern, your motion you just asked for, Vice President Caraviello asked for that already, the maintenance program and costs.

2280
02:40:34,758 --> 02:40:39,799
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, and then what will the DPW be handling and what will we have to contract out for?

2281
02:40:40,019 --> 02:40:45,580
[SPEAKER_13]: So Councilor Lungo-Kern, DPW be handling and what will be contracted out.

2282
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:52,282
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are all resolutions and there's a main motion for approval right now by

2283
02:40:53,740 --> 02:40:58,343
[SPEAKER_22]: And just last one, how much to maintain, what's the estimate to maintain this entire project?

2284
02:40:59,043 --> 02:41:00,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caravino, like I just said.

2285
02:41:02,445 --> 02:41:04,427
[SPEAKER_13]: He asked for the maintenance program and the cost.

2286
02:41:05,047 --> 02:41:05,287
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

2287
02:41:05,307 --> 02:41:05,987
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Mox.

2288
02:41:06,828 --> 02:41:07,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2289
02:41:07,969 --> 02:41:19,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I would just caution my council colleagues that moving forward on a plan that doesn't include maintenance is not being fiscally responsible.

2290
02:41:21,447 --> 02:41:29,351
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would also state, Mr. President, that we're looking at contractual services.

2291
02:41:29,991 --> 02:41:33,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, it's been discussed that we're not sure what the DPW is going to handle.

2292
02:41:34,053 --> 02:41:36,954
[SPEAKER_17]: But at some point, we're going to outsource services.

2293
02:41:37,494 --> 02:41:39,875
[SPEAKER_17]: And we don't know what the actual cost is going to be.

2294
02:41:40,576 --> 02:41:49,960
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe, as a member of this council, before we move forward on any project, especially with the track record this city has

2295
02:41:50,428 --> 02:41:52,149
[SPEAKER_17]: on maintaining our infrastructure.

2296
02:41:52,769 --> 02:42:01,514
[SPEAKER_17]: If this city had an impeccable record of maintaining its current infrastructure, such as City Hall, the Police Department, the Public Library,

2297
02:42:02,015 --> 02:42:07,958
[SPEAKER_17]: the, the dilapidated DPW yard, the fire stations, the list goes on and on our roads.

2298
02:42:08,638 --> 02:42:20,625
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, then I would say if our record was impeccable, yes, you know, I have every faith and trust that the city is going to come out and devise a plan that makes sense on behalf of, uh, the rate pays in this community.

2299
02:42:21,185 --> 02:42:23,426
[SPEAKER_17]: However, that is not the case.

2300
02:42:23,986 --> 02:42:28,829
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think asking the question beforehand just makes common sense.

2301
02:42:29,509 --> 02:42:30,310
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the only thing I'm saying.

2302
02:42:30,350 --> 02:42:31,150
[SPEAKER_17]: It makes common sense.

2303
02:42:31,553 --> 02:42:35,596
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we heard tonight that none of this is going to be taxpayer money.

2304
02:42:36,317 --> 02:42:43,342
[SPEAKER_17]: And we all know, as was mentioned, grants and so forth come from taxpayers' money, which Lauren is correct on that.

2305
02:42:44,022 --> 02:42:48,065
[SPEAKER_17]: My issue is not the fact that there's taxpayer money being used.

2306
02:42:48,606 --> 02:42:54,070
[SPEAKER_17]: The money that's going into this project could be allocated for a different use.

2307
02:42:54,810 --> 02:42:55,651
[SPEAKER_17]: The 250 from wind management

2308
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,401
[SPEAKER_17]: could go for anything we want in this community.

2309
02:43:00,801 --> 02:43:02,221
[SPEAKER_17]: And don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

2310
02:43:02,761 --> 02:43:07,983
[SPEAKER_17]: This happened to be the mayor at his pecking order list, and he chose to use it for this.

2311
02:43:08,503 --> 02:43:11,763
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, that's every prerogative the mayor has, and good for him.

2312
02:43:12,244 --> 02:43:16,565
[SPEAKER_17]: But that 250,000 could have been used for any need in the community.

2313
02:43:17,045 --> 02:43:25,067
[SPEAKER_17]: The Cummings Foundation, if you read their grant application, it includes a list of causes, and this is not limited to them,

2314
02:43:25,948 --> 02:43:29,509
[SPEAKER_17]: human services, education, healthcare, social justice.

2315
02:43:30,210 --> 02:43:39,453
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you look at, it's the 100K for 100 programs, it's $10 million a year the Cummings Foundation gives out to local cities and towns.

2316
02:43:40,374 --> 02:43:55,500
[SPEAKER_17]: The town of Burlington got their 100,000 and they're using it for a mobile command unit facilitating greater effectiveness and management of critical police incidences and the lives and safety of the people in their community.

2317
02:43:55,932 --> 02:43:57,093
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what they're using it for.

2318
02:43:57,713 --> 02:44:05,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, Reading's using it for understanding disabilities to meet increased needs of students and families by renewing its disability awareness curriculum.

2319
02:44:06,337 --> 02:44:14,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Watertown's using it to support early stage empowerment programs, reaching people with early stage Alzheimer's disease to improve quality of lives.

2320
02:44:15,962 --> 02:44:17,983
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what some of the communities are using it.

2321
02:44:18,804 --> 02:44:24,006
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor sought to use the $100,000 to apply for the application to do a peace guide.

2322
02:44:24,526 --> 02:44:25,427
[SPEAKER_17]: That's his prerogative.

2323
02:44:25,834 --> 02:44:29,696
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want my colleagues to know that there's other potential uses.

2324
02:44:30,096 --> 02:44:46,944
[SPEAKER_17]: The park rent, it says in the park rent itself under section C eligible projects are those for the purchase of parkland development of a new park or renovation of an existing park by any municipality with an improved open space and recreation plan, which we have.

2325
02:44:48,177 --> 02:45:06,472
[SPEAKER_17]: So that could be used for one of 24 different parks, and I realize the mayor just came before us to renovate a few more parks in the community, but I is one that attended the parks as growing up in this city, and also my kids know the need in each individual park, inherit from residents.

2326
02:45:06,853 --> 02:45:12,257
[SPEAKER_17]: So I believe that the park grant money, if the mayor opted to, the $299,000 could have been spent

2327
02:45:15,770 --> 02:45:31,700
[SPEAKER_17]: to revitalize some of the parks in the community, and we could have put together a committee and so forth to find out what the actual needs are rather than someone dictate what the needs are, and move forward on improving many of our parks.

2328
02:45:32,360 --> 02:45:41,586
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are a host of issues that could have been looked at with this money, and the mayor opted to use it this way.

2329
02:45:42,086 --> 02:45:44,928
[SPEAKER_17]: I happen to have a fundamental disagreement with the mayor,

2330
02:45:45,385 --> 02:45:47,826
[SPEAKER_17]: On this, I think we could accomplish both goals.

2331
02:45:48,346 --> 02:45:51,107
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I was never involved in the process.

2332
02:45:52,688 --> 02:46:06,634
[SPEAKER_17]: According to the article in the Globe, April 11th, says that the design plans have been in the works for 11 months, but McGlynn said the proposal was kept private because the city did not have the money to build the Goddard.

2333
02:46:07,708 --> 02:46:15,390
[SPEAKER_17]: So they were working on this with his inner circle for a number of months, and we found out about it.

2334
02:46:15,650 --> 02:46:16,530
[SPEAKER_17]: I speak for myself.

2335
02:46:16,910 --> 02:46:19,071
[SPEAKER_17]: I found out about it by turning on the local news.

2336
02:46:19,711 --> 02:46:22,812
[SPEAKER_17]: That's how I found out about it as a member of the council.

2337
02:46:23,532 --> 02:46:32,094
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I think, honestly, Mr. President, I don't think anyone wants to be pitted one way or another

2338
02:46:32,873 --> 02:46:34,274
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a worthy proposal.

2339
02:46:35,135 --> 02:46:42,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Do I think we could make handicap improvements and disability improvements to the senior center without building a peace garden?

2340
02:46:42,921 --> 02:46:43,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

2341
02:46:44,022 --> 02:46:45,883
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we don't need a peace garden to provide.

2342
02:46:46,143 --> 02:46:49,146
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would say, why weren't we doing this in the last 10 years?

2343
02:46:50,147 --> 02:46:54,730
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, provide what's necessary for the senior center in that particular area.

2344
02:46:57,812 --> 02:46:59,033
[SPEAKER_17]: One last thing, Mr. President.

2345
02:47:02,549 --> 02:47:11,934
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it was back in October 27, 2014, that there was an article posted in the Meffitt transcript.

2346
02:47:13,155 --> 02:47:16,736
[SPEAKER_17]: And from what I understand, it was a press release from the mayor's office.

2347
02:47:17,777 --> 02:47:24,981
[SPEAKER_17]: And the first paragraph is, and this is October 27, 2014, Mayor Michael McGlynn was pleased to accept a $299,350 in grant funding

2348
02:47:31,530 --> 02:47:42,659
[SPEAKER_17]: from the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, Parkland Acquisitions and Renovations for Communities Park Grant Program, which will be used towards the construction of the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden.

2349
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:52,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Tonight we heard that this grant wasn't approved until sometime the beginning of December and maybe a couple of weeks prior to that.

2350
02:47:53,878 --> 02:48:15,115
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not sure how the mayor takes the liberty to come out before the grants approved by the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, accepts the check, which is a picture in the paper, I'm not making this up, and Lauren, you're in the picture, accepts the check, and then says, don't worry about the council.

2351
02:48:16,275 --> 02:48:17,897
[SPEAKER_17]: We know they're gonna accept this check.

2352
02:48:19,114 --> 02:48:19,995
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't worry about them.

2353
02:48:20,555 --> 02:48:21,175
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to accept it.

2354
02:48:21,195 --> 02:48:22,816
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to have my own press conference.

2355
02:48:22,836 --> 02:48:25,398
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to release my own press releases in the paper.

2356
02:48:26,859 --> 02:48:30,521
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the council will eventually vote on it, like everything else.

2357
02:48:31,041 --> 02:48:31,742
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll vote on it.

2358
02:48:32,382 --> 02:48:34,943
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll submit to my pressure, and they'll vote on it.

2359
02:48:35,524 --> 02:48:47,551
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would say, Mr. President, that, as I stated at the beginning, I support a modest memorial honoring the victims of the bombing of the marathon and with

2360
02:48:48,004 --> 02:48:58,929
[SPEAKER_17]: The additional monies that could be used, such as the Wynn grant, as far as I'm concerned, the Cummings grant would have to reapply and put what we really need in this community.

2361
02:49:00,009 --> 02:49:04,371
[SPEAKER_17]: But that would be my — if I had my druthers, that would be what would happen, Mr. President.

2362
02:49:04,752 --> 02:49:12,455
[SPEAKER_17]: So, tonight, I cannot support this grant that's before us for the $299,000, based on the reasons I just mentioned, Mr. President.

2363
02:49:13,075 --> 02:49:13,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Counselor.

2364
02:49:13,816 --> 02:49:14,356
[SPEAKER_17]: Counselor Knight.

2365
02:49:15,296 --> 02:49:16,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2366
02:49:17,052 --> 02:49:22,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can certainly understand the concerns that my colleagues raise about a maintenance plan, a perpetual care at the site.

2367
02:49:23,534 --> 02:49:25,634
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I want to point out that this isn't Hormel Stadium.

2368
02:49:26,014 --> 02:49:26,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Placed at Park.

2369
02:49:26,894 --> 02:49:28,375
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even Barry Park, Mr. President.

2370
02:49:28,415 --> 02:49:31,975
[SPEAKER_08]: This location is the size of a large backyard in the city of Medford.

2371
02:49:32,516 --> 02:49:37,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And the city owns a portion of the space now and does provide maintenance and upkeep to the area.

2372
02:49:37,457 --> 02:49:42,478
[SPEAKER_08]: So the only major expense that's going to be outside of the ordinary, in my opinion, would be the fountain.

2373
02:49:43,378 --> 02:49:46,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think that the maintenance and upkeep of a fountain is going to change the scope

2374
02:49:47,375 --> 02:49:50,236
[SPEAKER_08]: of what's being done there right now too drastically.

2375
02:49:51,136 --> 02:49:53,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I certainly understand the concerns about a maintenance plan.

2376
02:49:54,197 --> 02:49:58,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that these concerns are warranted, but I think they're warranted when we're looking at projects that are on a much larger scale.

2377
02:49:59,379 --> 02:50:09,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there is an expenditure of, you know, $1.1 million to construct this, but I think that the ends are going to justify the means, and I think that the benefits are going to fire away the costs.

2378
02:50:12,104 --> 02:50:13,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2379
02:50:13,484 --> 02:50:14,745
[SPEAKER_08]: May I also add that I feel as

2380
02:50:15,659 --> 02:50:19,943
[SPEAKER_08]: fitting tribute to those that were lost in the Boston Marathon bombing, Mr. President.

2381
02:50:20,283 --> 02:50:27,570
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also am proud to be a part of the community that's going to have the largest scale monument to that tragedy to date.

2382
02:50:27,590 --> 02:50:30,833
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree 100% and support it wholeheartedly.

2383
02:50:31,574 --> 02:50:32,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Penta.

2384
02:50:32,875 --> 02:50:33,456
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just shocked.

2385
02:50:34,056 --> 02:50:36,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor Marks, did you just, I wrote it down.

2386
02:50:36,759 --> 02:50:40,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you say October 27 and then left a transcript?

2387
02:50:43,345 --> 02:50:45,365
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a picture of the mayor accepting a check for $299,000.

2388
02:50:45,886 --> 02:50:52,247
[SPEAKER_13]: How does this happen?

2389
02:50:52,487 --> 02:50:53,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Ceremonial checks.

2390
02:50:53,187 --> 02:50:54,008
[SPEAKER_01]: You were all invited.

2391
02:50:54,028 --> 02:50:55,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was invited?

2392
02:50:55,828 --> 02:50:56,628
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have been invited.

2393
02:50:56,648 --> 02:50:58,089
[SPEAKER_13]: You were all invited as a council.

2394
02:50:58,749 --> 02:51:00,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I beg to differ with you.

2395
02:51:00,669 --> 02:51:05,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Ceremonial checks when the secretaries come out and announce the award of the grants to communities.

2396
02:51:07,271 --> 02:51:10,271
[SPEAKER_06]: How could you accept a check when the council hasn't even discussed it for a vote?

2397
02:51:10,632 --> 02:51:11,992
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cardboard, and it's this big.

2398
02:51:13,310 --> 02:51:15,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know something?

2399
02:51:15,732 --> 02:51:18,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Two weeks ago, Mr. President, you said we already voted on this and we didn't.

2400
02:51:19,074 --> 02:51:20,014
[SPEAKER_06]: So you were proven wrong.

2401
02:51:20,294 --> 02:51:23,556
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be proven wrong, too, because this council has never voted on this.

2402
02:51:24,117 --> 02:51:25,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Officer of Community Development.

2403
02:51:26,398 --> 02:51:26,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2404
02:51:26,718 --> 02:51:29,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Has this been before the council previously?

2405
02:51:29,320 --> 02:51:29,520
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2406
02:51:29,860 --> 02:51:31,221
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about the PSCART.

2407
02:51:31,241 --> 02:51:33,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for a vote.

2408
02:51:33,602 --> 02:51:35,863
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about it in terms of the block grant application.

2409
02:51:36,084 --> 02:51:36,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Not for this vote.

2410
02:51:37,184 --> 02:51:39,406
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular vote in front of you for the allocation of funds is not.

2411
02:51:39,426 --> 02:51:41,707
[SPEAKER_13]: The Community Development Block Grant contained

2412
02:51:42,588 --> 02:51:43,909
[SPEAKER_13]: funding for this project.

2413
02:51:43,969 --> 02:51:45,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Not this vote, Paul.

2414
02:51:45,909 --> 02:51:46,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Councillor.

2415
02:51:46,649 --> 02:51:48,350
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a different vote altogether.

2416
02:51:48,550 --> 02:51:50,351
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a different vote, but it's been before us for a vote.

2417
02:51:50,411 --> 02:51:51,811
[SPEAKER_14]: The park vote has never been before the council.

2418
02:51:51,831 --> 02:51:52,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I was correct.

2419
02:51:52,412 --> 02:51:52,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2420
02:51:52,832 --> 02:51:53,372
[SPEAKER_06]: You were wrong.

2421
02:51:54,172 --> 02:51:54,892
[SPEAKER_13]: That's your opinion.

2422
02:51:54,952 --> 02:51:55,653
[SPEAKER_13]: It is my opinion.

2423
02:51:55,673 --> 02:51:56,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to table.

2424
02:51:57,213 --> 02:51:59,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to table is undebatable.

2425
02:51:59,134 --> 02:52:02,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Until next week.

2426
02:52:02,295 --> 02:52:02,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Until next week.

2427
02:52:02,755 --> 02:52:03,575
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favour?

2428
02:52:03,936 --> 02:52:04,056
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

2429
02:52:04,736 --> 02:52:05,456
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

2430
02:52:06,196 --> 02:52:08,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

2431
02:52:08,397 --> 02:52:09,357
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk is in doubt.

2432
02:52:09,538 --> 02:52:10,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call, please.

2433
02:52:15,364 --> 02:52:16,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to wait until your council colleague gets back?

2434
02:52:17,005 --> 02:52:24,470
[SPEAKER_13]: It's up to you.

2435
02:52:24,650 --> 02:52:26,031
You call for the table.

2436
02:52:26,491 --> 02:52:30,214
Did you just call for a roll?

2437
02:52:30,234 --> 02:52:30,554
Yeah.

2438
02:52:31,274 --> 02:52:34,036
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't interrupt a roll call.

2439
02:52:34,496 --> 02:52:35,517
Motion to table.

2440
02:52:36,258 --> 02:52:37,338
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to fail anyway.

2441
02:52:37,418 --> 02:52:38,259
We'll hear more about it.

2442
02:52:47,058 --> 02:52:47,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

2443
02:52:48,178 --> 02:52:48,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table.

2444
02:52:49,539 --> 02:52:50,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

2445
02:52:50,739 --> 02:52:51,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2446
02:52:51,419 --> 02:52:53,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should you guide him to tell him how to vote?

2447
02:52:53,200 --> 02:52:53,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know what we were voting on.

2448
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:54,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought we were voting on the paper.

2449
02:52:54,881 --> 02:52:55,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

2450
02:52:55,461 --> 02:52:56,141
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my error.

2451
02:52:56,201 --> 02:52:59,282
[SPEAKER_08]: As a matter of fact, I'll move for reconsideration after the vote, if need be, Mr. President.

2452
02:52:59,642 --> 02:52:59,922
Thank you.

2453
02:53:00,963 --> 02:53:01,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Turner?

2454
02:53:01,883 --> 02:53:02,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2455
02:53:03,744 --> 02:53:04,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Martin?

2456
02:53:04,584 --> 02:53:04,804
Yes.

2457
02:53:05,804 --> 02:53:06,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Fenton?

2458
02:53:06,385 --> 02:53:06,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2459
02:53:07,705 --> 02:53:08,425
[SPEAKER_13]: President Caluso?

2460
02:53:08,645 --> 02:53:08,865
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2461
02:53:08,945 --> 02:53:12,267
[SPEAKER_13]: By a vote in the affirmative, the motion is tabled, three in the negative.

2462
02:53:13,447 --> 02:53:13,767
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2463
02:53:13,787 --> 02:53:16,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Offered by, while we're under suspension,

2464
02:53:17,400 --> 02:53:19,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Offered by Vice President Carvey-Yellow.

2465
02:53:19,081 --> 02:53:20,963
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two papers.

2466
02:53:21,003 --> 02:53:25,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer condolences to the family of Medford School teacher... Wait a minute, you have my resolution.

2467
02:53:25,967 --> 02:53:26,648
[SPEAKER_15]: How could you do that?

2468
02:53:27,128 --> 02:53:27,708
[SPEAKER_13]: It was tabled.

2469
02:53:27,728 --> 02:53:29,090
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole paper was tabled, Counselor.

2470
02:53:29,250 --> 02:53:29,730
[SPEAKER_13]: What table?

2471
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:30,130
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole agenda?

2472
02:53:30,150 --> 02:53:31,191
[SPEAKER_13]: No, there's more on the agenda.

2473
02:53:32,933 --> 02:53:33,854
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more on the agenda.

2474
02:53:36,198 --> 02:53:36,999
[SPEAKER_13]: You can have it your way.

2475
02:53:37,039 --> 02:53:38,180
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess you want your way all the time.

2476
02:53:39,081 --> 02:53:44,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Offer 14-783, which, oh, we'll go to Councilor Lungo-Kearns, who's the next one on the agenda.

2477
02:53:45,727 --> 02:53:49,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Item 14-783, offered by Councilor Lungo-Kearns.

2478
02:53:49,945 --> 02:53:57,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the city council receive a copy of the last three years' certified free cash forms, which were signed off by the DOR.

2479
02:53:57,189 --> 02:54:06,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it further resolved that the council receive a breakdown showing which accounts the certified free cash came from for each of the last three years, each account and dollar figure.

2480
02:54:06,755 --> 02:54:07,636
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

2481
02:54:07,816 --> 02:54:08,056
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2482
02:54:08,116 --> 02:54:08,777
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be brief.

2483
02:54:09,357 --> 02:54:12,119
[SPEAKER_22]: President Camuso, the first part we received on Friday.

2484
02:54:12,179 --> 02:54:14,160
[SPEAKER_22]: The second part I would move approval on.

2485
02:54:14,300 --> 02:54:17,362
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to see where the free cash is coming from, which accounts.

2486
02:54:18,150 --> 02:54:20,512
[SPEAKER_22]: if we could get a breakdown of that for the last three years.

2487
02:54:20,933 --> 02:54:21,793
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion for approval.

2488
02:54:21,813 --> 02:54:26,877
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

2489
02:54:27,118 --> 02:54:27,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

2490
02:54:27,538 --> 02:54:28,179
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

2491
02:54:28,219 --> 02:54:28,799
[SPEAKER_13]: The ayes have it.

2492
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:32,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Next item on the agenda offered by Councilor Penta.

2493
02:54:32,942 --> 02:54:37,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved the Mayor's newly implemented water rate tiered program be discussed.

2494
02:54:37,827 --> 02:54:38,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penta.

2495
02:54:38,667 --> 02:54:45,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, as we know, we had a committee of the whole meeting a little while ago with the Water and Soil Commission as it relates to the

2496
02:54:46,104 --> 02:54:47,505
[SPEAKER_06]: new tiered water rate structure.

2497
02:54:47,545 --> 02:54:57,810
[SPEAKER_06]: And at that meeting, it was kind of like informative that there was some issues of concern that they were going to investigate as it relates to the tiers, whether it's tier one, two, and three.

2498
02:54:58,651 --> 02:55:09,757
[SPEAKER_06]: The one especially as it relates to tier two, which would be the rate set for the commercial business and the minimum of zero to 800 in tier one for the residential.

2499
02:55:09,797 --> 02:55:10,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something to be looked at.

2500
02:55:11,998 --> 02:55:14,719
[SPEAKER_06]: The city council voted this past budget to knock out $600,000,

2501
02:55:16,523 --> 02:55:23,006
[SPEAKER_06]: from the estimated amount that the MWRA would be having to impose on the city of Medford.

2502
02:55:23,127 --> 02:55:35,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a result of that vote, for which was eliminated from the budget, the Water and Soil Commission then implemented the tier rate system, which will, in essence, not only recapture the amount of money, but probably more than that.

2503
02:55:36,534 --> 02:55:44,818
[SPEAKER_06]: My concern right now is the mayor not addressing that for which the city council addressed during the budget and at that last meeting.

2504
02:55:45,538 --> 02:55:59,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went back into my inventory, which is January of 1989, and there's a front page headline that talks about water rates pushing up again, and the mayor is quoted.

2505
02:55:59,663 --> 02:56:02,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to read his quote on the increase in the water rates.

2506
02:56:03,444 --> 02:56:04,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Council Knight.

2507
02:56:05,125 --> 02:56:06,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in the sixth grade in 1989.

2508
02:56:06,985 --> 02:56:07,366
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2509
02:56:08,406 --> 02:56:09,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Should have learned something then.

2510
02:56:10,207 --> 02:56:11,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Bottom line is,

2511
02:56:12,461 --> 02:56:17,163
[SPEAKER_06]: With many residents getting water bills of between $400 and $600 for six months.

2512
02:56:17,223 --> 02:56:21,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind you, this is back in 1989.

2513
02:56:21,685 --> 02:56:23,446
[SPEAKER_06]: $400 and $500 for six months.

2514
02:56:23,466 --> 02:56:28,628
[SPEAKER_06]: The increase could bring the annual cost of water bills for a family well over $1,000.

2515
02:56:29,008 --> 02:56:38,993
[SPEAKER_06]: If the city's passed along all of the increased costs, Mayor McGlynn issued a statement saying, I am challenging the state and federal officials to

2516
02:56:40,018 --> 02:56:41,078
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is very important.

2517
02:56:41,098 --> 02:56:42,379
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go to page eight now.

2518
02:56:49,662 --> 02:56:51,863
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the key part of the story.

2519
02:56:54,164 --> 02:56:58,286
[SPEAKER_06]: The federal governments have abdicated from their sense of responsibility to clean up the harbor.

2520
02:57:00,587 --> 02:57:09,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Commenting that the state and federal government fully expect us to pay an obscenely disproportionate share of the cleanup of these efforts, McGlynn called upon

2521
02:57:10,287 --> 02:57:22,831
[SPEAKER_06]: local and state elected officials to provide support to legislate proposals that would take the funding off the local communities and to work to bring about administrative action to the same end.

2522
02:57:23,411 --> 02:57:27,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's nothing more than I think what this Council, myself, and other people have been saying.

2523
02:57:28,153 --> 02:57:31,694
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have a revenue reserve fund back then.

2524
02:57:31,754 --> 02:57:34,355
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have, no, $8.5 million.

2525
02:57:34,795 --> 02:57:37,256
[SPEAKER_06]: We had all we could do to make sure that the people were paying these bills.

2526
02:57:37,737 --> 02:57:40,619
[SPEAKER_06]: subsequent to the enterprise fund coming under foundation.

2527
02:57:41,179 --> 02:57:52,306
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have the mayor going back to 1989, back then, recognizing and addressing that the cost was not only going to be prohibitive, but cities and towns and the people who make up cities and towns are going to be paying for this.

2528
02:57:52,866 --> 02:58:01,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have a chance, or here he has a chance right now, for the purposes of giving the break that he's talking about, that he was blaming the feds and the state for.

2529
02:58:02,352 --> 02:58:04,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that, Mr. President, this isn't me making it up.

2530
02:58:04,914 --> 02:58:05,774
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what he said.

2531
02:58:05,834 --> 02:58:06,655
[SPEAKER_06]: These are his quotes.

2532
02:58:07,099 --> 02:58:09,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's written in the paper in 1989.

2533
02:58:09,800 --> 02:58:22,644
[SPEAKER_06]: In 1989, as a matter of fact, we had a resolution on the council agenda on that same night to strip the MWRA of its powers because of obscene charging to cities and towns.

2534
02:58:23,144 --> 02:58:36,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm asking, Mr. President, that my colleagues make a request to the mayor to hold in abeyance this tiered rate system for one year and to find out and to let's just see, you know, where we're going as it relates to the

2535
02:58:37,571 --> 02:58:39,112
[SPEAKER_06]: savings in the water and soil count.

2536
02:58:39,132 --> 02:58:45,157
[SPEAKER_06]: We have $8.5 million, and now you're increasing the tax base even more for water and soil customers.

2537
02:58:45,598 --> 02:58:55,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally contrary to what the mayor argued way back in 1989, and at the same time, it's the same issue that's before us now, and we're sitting on $8.5 million of reserve.

2538
02:58:55,405 --> 02:58:56,827
[SPEAKER_06]: We had no reserves back then.

2539
02:58:57,187 --> 02:58:57,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we do.

2540
02:58:58,188 --> 02:59:00,910
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, to me, I think you're penalizing the ratepayers for this.

2541
02:59:04,414 --> 02:59:05,155
[SPEAKER_21]: President Camuso.

2542
02:59:05,375 --> 02:59:10,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you for bringing us up to date on the 1989 meeting of the Medford City Council.

2543
02:59:11,619 --> 02:59:22,686
[SPEAKER_13]: But this city council, if I recall, time after time after time have been the driving force behind having the tiered water rate system.

2544
02:59:23,407 --> 02:59:29,511
[SPEAKER_13]: And now that we've paid a consultant, Hitchcock or Babcock, after the Water and Soil

2545
02:59:30,371 --> 02:59:44,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Woodcock, I'm sorry, after the Water and Soil Commission has done yeoman's work on this, to now ask to hold it in abeyance, based upon your article from 1989, and... Point of clarification, Councilor Fenton.

2546
02:59:45,094 --> 02:59:51,495
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not my article, it's what the mayor has said, and what the mayor was quoted as saying, not what I said.

2547
02:59:51,515 --> 02:59:52,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Quoted 30 years ago, Councilor.

2548
02:59:52,696 --> 02:59:53,616
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is 1989, not 30 years ago.

2549
02:59:53,636 --> 02:59:53,616
89!

2550
02:59:53,656 --> 02:59:54,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so what's wrong with that?

2551
02:59:59,037 --> 03:00:07,184
[SPEAKER_06]: If you saw the light back in 89, you had no reserve then and you got eight and a half million dollars now, why wouldn't you want to give it back to the rate payers?

2552
03:00:07,264 --> 03:00:09,366
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's go back to 1939 and govern the city of Medford.

2553
03:00:09,386 --> 03:00:10,366
[SPEAKER_14]: You're making no sense at all.

2554
03:00:10,807 --> 03:00:11,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Where does it end?

2555
03:00:11,668 --> 03:00:12,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Where does it begin?

2556
03:00:12,528 --> 03:00:13,229
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the question.

2557
03:00:13,309 --> 03:00:14,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Where does it begin?

2558
03:00:15,130 --> 03:00:20,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I cannot sit here and logically support this.

2559
03:00:20,815 --> 03:00:21,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't.

2560
03:00:21,175 --> 03:00:22,156
[SPEAKER_13]: To hold it in obeyance.

2561
03:00:22,176 --> 03:00:22,697
[SPEAKER_13]: You never do.

2562
03:00:22,977 --> 03:00:23,918
[SPEAKER_13]: To hold it in obeyance.

2563
03:00:24,863 --> 03:00:34,336
[SPEAKER_13]: So I ask for a roll call vote on my esteemed council colleague Robert M. Penter's article and being a councilor back in 1989 for his insight, but I can't support him now in 2014.

2564
03:00:36,602 --> 03:00:39,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then all I can say in response to that, Counselor, is simply this.

2565
03:00:39,465 --> 03:00:41,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in 1989, there was no dollar surplus.

2566
03:00:42,027 --> 03:00:43,688
[SPEAKER_06]: We were fighting to stay survival.

2567
03:00:43,949 --> 03:00:53,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And from 89 until now, and while your friend the mayor has been in office, he's accumulated $8.5 million in surplus of tax and ratepayers' money, and he doesn't want to give it back to them, and he wants to keep charging them more and more.

2568
03:00:54,158 --> 03:00:55,139
[SPEAKER_13]: What about you?

2569
03:00:55,159 --> 03:00:56,200
[SPEAKER_13]: What about me what?

2570
03:00:56,220 --> 03:00:58,702
[SPEAKER_13]: You personally requesting for a tiered rate system.

2571
03:00:59,503 --> 03:01:01,605
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked for a tiered rate system.

2572
03:01:01,865 --> 03:01:03,867
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't ask to have it imposed as they did.

2573
03:01:04,127 --> 03:01:08,992
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked, and I believe the whole idea was to show us what it would be like not to implement it.

2574
03:01:09,453 --> 03:01:12,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Councillor, we asked for it, now it's not to implement it.

2575
03:01:12,856 --> 03:01:14,338
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same thing with the parking meters.

2576
03:01:14,398 --> 03:01:15,980
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got parking meters all around the city.

2577
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:17,722
[SPEAKER_14]: All we ask for the meter is to negotiate.

2578
03:01:17,742 --> 03:01:18,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it is.

2579
03:01:18,803 --> 03:01:19,784
[SPEAKER_14]: We're referring back to 1989 now.

2580
03:01:21,846 --> 03:01:22,527
[SPEAKER_14]: We might have to.

2581
03:01:22,587 --> 03:01:25,690
[SPEAKER_14]: We might have to refer back to 1983 if you want.

2582
03:01:26,110 --> 03:01:26,511
[SPEAKER_14]: We can.

2583
03:01:26,711 --> 03:01:27,332
[SPEAKER_14]: We can go back.

2584
03:01:27,592 --> 03:01:28,153
[SPEAKER_14]: We can go back.

2585
03:01:28,393 --> 03:01:29,875
[SPEAKER_14]: History always tells us a story.

2586
03:01:29,935 --> 03:01:31,236
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the story that history tells us?

2587
03:01:31,656 --> 03:01:36,682
[SPEAKER_13]: The best predictor of the future is the past, and I think your past has come as far as America.

2588
03:01:41,233 --> 03:01:41,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Heisner.

2589
03:01:41,813 --> 03:01:42,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Merry Christmas.

2590
03:01:42,593 --> 03:01:44,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2591
03:01:44,914 --> 03:02:00,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I look back to some of my notes, and I have here resolution dated 09-803 brought forward by my colleague, Councilor Penta, relative to the creation of an excessive water use program, which passed unanimously by this council.

2592
03:02:00,919 --> 03:02:05,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, in 2010, Councilor Penta, implementation of a tiered rate system.

2593
03:02:06,006 --> 03:02:08,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Paper number 12720.

2594
03:02:08,507 --> 03:02:12,089
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that this is something that's not uncommon and not unheard of, Mr. President.

2595
03:02:12,209 --> 03:02:15,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I went back and I, I, please.

2596
03:02:15,871 --> 03:02:17,312
[SPEAKER_06]: What a clarification.

2597
03:02:17,332 --> 03:02:18,873
[SPEAKER_06]: The asking for a tiered rate system.

2598
03:02:19,353 --> 03:02:19,813
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.

2599
03:02:19,974 --> 03:02:23,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we all asked for that because we wanted to know why we didn't ask to have it implemented.

2600
03:02:24,016 --> 03:02:28,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was council max.

2601
03:02:28,118 --> 03:02:33,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the only one at the time that voted against the old, the new water rate, the new water meter system.

2602
03:02:33,900 --> 03:02:40,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was Councilor Marks who introduced the idea of having possibly a tiered rate system because of the commercial people in the city.

2603
03:02:40,442 --> 03:02:46,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And those that use more water would be paying for more, and that's not what's happening.

2604
03:02:46,884 --> 03:02:47,984
[SPEAKER_21]: It's your family.

2605
03:02:48,524 --> 03:02:49,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.

2606
03:02:51,105 --> 03:02:53,326
[SPEAKER_21]: Gentlemen, be civil, please.

2607
03:02:53,986 --> 03:02:57,307
[SPEAKER_21]: I had the privilege of talking with one of the water commissioners today about this.

2608
03:02:58,327 --> 03:03:01,348
[SPEAKER_21]: And Mr. Kamara alluded to me that

2609
03:03:02,769 --> 03:03:16,239
[SPEAKER_21]: After the first bills come out, they would re-look at the rate, not the rate, but the usage, see if it may be moving from 80 to 1,000 or where it should be, because they have no history to study.

2610
03:03:16,419 --> 03:03:20,322
[SPEAKER_21]: So after they have a little history, they said it would be re-looked at again.

2611
03:03:20,482 --> 03:03:22,164
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the recommendation made at the meeting.

2612
03:03:22,504 --> 03:03:22,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2613
03:03:24,545 --> 03:03:24,585
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

2614
03:03:24,605 --> 03:03:27,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor, did I hear that?

2615
03:03:27,648 --> 03:03:30,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, like I said, Counselor Penter, I mean, Counselor Marks,

2616
03:03:32,844 --> 03:03:43,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I have here at least eight resolutions that was put forth by past city councils over the last seven years that would ask for the implementation of a tiered water rate system.

2617
03:03:43,788 --> 03:03:48,930
[SPEAKER_08]: The administration responded to recommendations made by the council over a seven-year period.

2618
03:03:49,590 --> 03:03:52,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm scratching my head on this one a little bit, Mr. President.

2619
03:03:52,331 --> 03:03:56,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

2620
03:03:56,312 --> 03:03:58,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Gastineau, you name and address for the record, please.

2621
03:04:02,925 --> 03:04:03,485
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, you what?

2622
03:04:04,165 --> 03:04:04,506
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry.

2623
03:04:05,806 --> 03:04:07,547
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

2624
03:04:09,707 --> 03:04:12,068
[SPEAKER_25]: Andrew Castaneri, Cushion Street, Method Mass.

2625
03:04:13,369 --> 03:04:20,451
[SPEAKER_25]: This, I think Councilor Panter brings up some good points about this tiered rate.

2626
03:04:21,372 --> 03:04:24,953
[SPEAKER_25]: I believe it's presently very unfair to the residential versus the commercial.

2627
03:04:27,894 --> 03:04:30,315
[SPEAKER_25]: And if I may think off the cuff here,

2628
03:04:31,154 --> 03:04:36,518
[SPEAKER_25]: I doubt it was the peoples that polluted the harbor, general public.

2629
03:04:37,659 --> 03:04:46,786
[SPEAKER_25]: It was more so like the Tannenmills in Lawrence or the Monsantos where the ProPublica casino probably is going to go.

2630
03:04:46,806 --> 03:04:49,969
[SPEAKER_21]: The commercial people will be paying the higher rate.

2631
03:04:50,329 --> 03:04:50,789
[SPEAKER_25]: You sure?

2632
03:04:51,189 --> 03:04:51,350
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2633
03:04:51,570 --> 03:04:53,031
[SPEAKER_25]: Because it seems like three tiers.

2634
03:04:53,211 --> 03:04:55,273
[SPEAKER_25]: Listen---- They are paying the top rate.

2635
03:04:55,393 --> 03:04:56,173
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I don't think so.

2636
03:04:56,874 --> 03:04:57,935
[SPEAKER_25]: I disagree with that, sir.

2637
03:04:59,220 --> 03:05:01,081
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me, I'm going on my recollection.

2638
03:05:01,441 --> 03:05:04,622
[SPEAKER_25]: The first tier was like 800, up to 800, I believe, right?

2639
03:05:05,122 --> 03:05:09,384
[SPEAKER_25]: At whatever it is, 13 and 12 point something cents.

2640
03:05:10,485 --> 03:05:11,625
[SPEAKER_25]: Correct, Councilor Buenaventura?

2641
03:05:11,765 --> 03:05:17,988
[SPEAKER_25]: Something like that.

2642
03:05:21,989 --> 03:05:22,649
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the higher rate.

2643
03:05:23,870 --> 03:05:25,050
[SPEAKER_25]: But wait a minute.

2644
03:05:25,410 --> 03:05:26,391
[SPEAKER_21]: It's higher than residential.

2645
03:05:30,360 --> 03:05:32,781
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't say commercial in their counselor night, does it?

2646
03:05:35,462 --> 03:05:35,683
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

2647
03:05:36,663 --> 03:05:37,663
[SPEAKER_21]: So they will be paying more.

2648
03:05:40,165 --> 03:05:41,265
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not sure that's accurate.

2649
03:05:42,246 --> 03:05:43,586
[SPEAKER_25]: You're right, thank you counselor.

2650
03:05:44,427 --> 03:05:44,647
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

2651
03:05:48,468 --> 03:05:53,771
Right, right.

2652
03:06:00,825 --> 03:06:02,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Councillor Marks.

2653
03:06:04,687 --> 03:06:08,409
[SPEAKER_17]: The commercial pays the second rate, which is higher than the first rate.

2654
03:06:09,690 --> 03:06:14,973
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you're a residential user and you use 700 cubic feet, you're going to pay that low rate.

2655
03:06:15,684 --> 03:06:22,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Once you go over the 800, 801, for that one cubic foot, you're paying the high rate for that one foot.

2656
03:06:23,046 --> 03:06:23,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2657
03:06:23,626 --> 03:06:26,487
[SPEAKER_17]: But commercial is going to automatically pay that second rate.

2658
03:06:26,767 --> 03:06:27,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Automatically.

2659
03:06:27,627 --> 03:06:28,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Automatically.

2660
03:06:28,207 --> 03:06:28,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2661
03:06:28,528 --> 03:06:29,828
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are paying the high rate.

2662
03:06:29,848 --> 03:06:31,368
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're paying the second rate, the middle rate.

2663
03:06:31,388 --> 03:06:31,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2664
03:06:31,548 --> 03:06:34,429
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're not paying the third rate, which is the highest of the rates.

2665
03:06:34,929 --> 03:06:36,230
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 1,800 and above, 1,600 and above.

2666
03:06:36,710 --> 03:06:37,650
[SPEAKER_06]: If they use it, they will.

2667
03:06:37,790 --> 03:06:41,111
[SPEAKER_06]: If they use it, they won't.

2668
03:06:41,231 --> 03:06:44,372
[SPEAKER_06]: The commercial, if you went to the meeting, you would have heard what he said.

2669
03:06:45,835 --> 03:06:45,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

2670
03:06:46,075 --> 03:06:46,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information.

2671
03:06:47,596 --> 03:06:50,197
[SPEAKER_13]: You just said they won't use the water.

2672
03:06:50,677 --> 03:06:54,899
[SPEAKER_13]: The commercial rates, if you read the note, the note says... So the Lawrence Memorial Hospital's gonna not use the water?

2673
03:06:55,719 --> 03:06:59,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the big users should be paying for the system that they're taxing.

2674
03:06:59,401 --> 03:07:02,982
[SPEAKER_13]: The Lawrence Memorial Hospital, Budweiser, Tufts University.

2675
03:07:03,282 --> 03:07:06,423
[SPEAKER_13]: These are people that are doing millions of gallons of water a day.

2676
03:07:06,603 --> 03:07:07,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Read the message that went out to the people.

2677
03:07:07,964 --> 03:07:12,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Mrs. Jones on 3rd Street is using two cubic feet to take a shower and to boil some macaroni.

2678
03:07:13,546 --> 03:07:14,847
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you know she's making macaroni?

2679
03:07:15,187 --> 03:07:16,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Because she's a young Italian woman.

2680
03:07:18,468 --> 03:07:25,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, we've asked for this, we've championed this under the leadership of all the members of this council.

2681
03:07:25,611 --> 03:07:29,412
[SPEAKER_13]: It came to fruition, and now we're asking for a year, holding it in abeyance.

2682
03:07:29,993 --> 03:07:30,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote.

2683
03:07:31,514 --> 03:07:37,718
[SPEAKER_25]: If I may, if you are going to buy a gallon of gasoline, you buy 1 gallon, it is whatever the price is, $3.

2684
03:07:38,079 --> 03:07:39,580
[SPEAKER_25]: If you buy 10, it is $3.

2685
03:07:40,180 --> 03:07:44,563
[SPEAKER_25]: As far as the wholesale rate, I am not sure about that.

2686
03:07:44,804 --> 03:07:59,354
[SPEAKER_25]: In my limited mathematics, I would have Mr. Lasky, the director, figure this out, but I would start with at least $1,000 for the first tier, $2,000 for the second tier, ballpark here, and $3,000 for the third tier, and above that $3,000,

2687
03:08:01,518 --> 03:08:07,242
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't care if you're residential, commercial, or the shoemaker, you pay the highest rate.

2688
03:08:07,903 --> 03:08:10,685
[SPEAKER_25]: So you pay as you use and try to conserve.

2689
03:08:11,565 --> 03:08:18,290
[SPEAKER_25]: And these old corporations that are defunct, Chapter 11, Chapter 7, like the Monsantos, how much do they pay to clean the harbor?

2690
03:08:18,370 --> 03:08:22,954
[SPEAKER_25]: Why do we saddle with this beyond our children's times?

2691
03:08:22,974 --> 03:08:23,434
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not fair.

2692
03:08:25,876 --> 03:08:26,316
[SPEAKER_21]: It happened in 1989.

2693
03:08:26,396 --> 03:08:39,419
[SPEAKER_21]: If you'd like to lower the water rates on all of us, then the city of Medford will have to let the school department will pay their own water bill, city hall will pay their own water bill, the fire department will pay their own water bill, and the police department will pay their own water bill.

2694
03:08:40,619 --> 03:08:43,040
[SPEAKER_21]: None of those, none of the municipal buildings pay a water bill.

2695
03:08:44,020 --> 03:08:44,860
[SPEAKER_06]: The taxpayers do.

2696
03:08:44,880 --> 03:08:45,741
[SPEAKER_21]: The taxpayers do.

2697
03:08:46,101 --> 03:08:46,721
[SPEAKER_21]: We pick it up.

2698
03:08:47,041 --> 03:08:47,281
[SPEAKER_21]: In effect.

2699
03:08:47,321 --> 03:08:47,521
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure.

2700
03:08:47,621 --> 03:08:49,822
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have any free cash in my pocket.

2701
03:08:53,155 --> 03:08:57,859
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to point out, thank you, vice president Carriello.

2702
03:08:58,019 --> 03:08:59,240
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't support this tonight.

2703
03:08:59,620 --> 03:09:08,167
[SPEAKER_22]: This is in committee, this issue, and we are going to reevaluate once we get, I think we only went through one or two quarters with the new tiered rate.

2704
03:09:08,307 --> 03:09:10,909
[SPEAKER_22]: Once we get through three or four, we're going to reevaluate.

2705
03:09:10,929 --> 03:09:12,330
[SPEAKER_21]: That is what the commissioner told me today.

2706
03:09:12,350 --> 03:09:12,630
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

2707
03:09:12,670 --> 03:09:16,733
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're going to possibly make changes or advise them to make changes or recommend.

2708
03:09:17,233 --> 03:09:21,897
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think... He said once they have some history on their side, they will make a change if necessary.

2709
03:09:22,943 --> 03:09:23,804
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight.

2710
03:09:24,785 --> 03:09:28,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I kind of concur with Councilor Lungo-Kern in her assessment.

2711
03:09:29,008 --> 03:09:29,829
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there is a paper.

2712
03:09:29,849 --> 03:09:31,691
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same exact paper that's in committee.

2713
03:09:32,371 --> 03:09:37,696
[SPEAKER_08]: 90 days haven't passed since that paper was disposed of by this council and no report from that committee has been issued forthwith to the body.

2714
03:09:38,116 --> 03:09:42,380
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think this is a matter that should be appropriate for discussion at this point in time based upon our internal rules.

2715
03:09:43,581 --> 03:09:45,403
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I mean, I'm not going to challenge the chair.

2716
03:09:45,443 --> 03:09:47,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to raise a question, a question of rules.

2717
03:09:47,585 --> 03:09:48,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that

2718
03:09:49,200 --> 03:09:52,462
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at this, and we have a set of rules that we're agreeing to live by.

2719
03:09:52,502 --> 03:09:55,605
[SPEAKER_08]: We voted to suspend rule 33 today to take items out of order, and that's it.

2720
03:09:56,545 --> 03:10:01,069
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, if a matter is disposed of, 90 days before it comes back to the floor.

2721
03:10:02,010 --> 03:10:06,013
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the paper that's still in subcommittee, and the subcommittee hasn't reported on any findings, Mr. President.

2722
03:10:06,073 --> 03:10:07,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this is where that discussion should take place.

2723
03:10:08,034 --> 03:10:08,815
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

2724
03:10:09,075 --> 03:10:10,376
[SPEAKER_21]: Roll call vote has been requested.

2725
03:10:13,178 --> 03:10:16,121
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to refer it?

2726
03:10:16,201 --> 03:10:17,422
[SPEAKER_21]: It's already in committee, if I'm not mistaken.

2727
03:10:21,285 --> 03:10:22,946
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why I brought this up is very simple.

2728
03:10:26,149 --> 03:10:27,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.

2729
03:10:27,650 --> 03:10:28,811
[SPEAKER_06]: History tells you the story.

2730
03:10:28,891 --> 03:10:40,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the mayor back then recognized the fact that the people were getting walloped for having high water and sewer bills, how does it explain today when you have eight and a half million dollars and you can't give the people a break?

2731
03:10:41,362 --> 03:10:42,222
[SPEAKER_06]: It's as simple as that.

2732
03:10:43,684 --> 03:10:46,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't have it both ways, as you say, Councilor Camuso.

2733
03:10:47,806 --> 03:10:49,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like cake, so you can eat it, all right?

2734
03:10:52,169 --> 03:10:53,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to place it on file.

2735
03:10:54,751 --> 03:10:55,212
[SPEAKER_21]: All in favor?

2736
03:10:58,154 --> 03:10:59,435
[SPEAKER_21]: Move on.

2737
03:11:00,135 --> 03:11:01,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

2738
03:11:02,017 --> 03:11:03,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that vote all taken care of?

2739
03:11:03,618 --> 03:11:04,619
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you speaking on something else?

2740
03:11:04,779 --> 03:11:05,019
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2741
03:11:12,225 --> 03:11:14,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Public participation in the agenda.

2742
03:11:14,366 --> 03:11:15,427
[SPEAKER_21]: He's not speaking in this matter.

2743
03:11:16,978 --> 03:11:17,858
[SPEAKER_21]: He's not speaking on this?

2744
03:11:17,918 --> 03:11:18,239
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2745
03:11:18,399 --> 03:11:20,660
[SPEAKER_21]: He's speaking on something else.

2746
03:11:20,800 --> 03:11:21,140
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2747
03:11:21,500 --> 03:11:21,820
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2748
03:11:25,482 --> 03:11:26,183
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, gentlemen.

2749
03:11:27,823 --> 03:11:28,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Gentlemen.

2750
03:11:30,024 --> 03:11:31,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony D'Antonio, Yale Street.

2751
03:11:31,925 --> 03:11:32,326
[SPEAKER_03]: One meeting.

2752
03:11:32,806 --> 03:11:36,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question, and maybe somebody on the council can enlighten me.

2753
03:11:37,552 --> 03:11:43,476
[SPEAKER_03]: taxpayers and people that may be watching on TV and the overcrowded and the Council Hall here.

2754
03:11:43,536 --> 03:11:57,547
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was on my way to City Hall today to get a parking placard sticker and I bumped into my neighbor just as I was leaving and he said he had already come from City Hall and they said he cannot get the stickers any longer like we used to do at City Hall.

2755
03:11:58,327 --> 03:12:01,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a method or a way to do this?

2756
03:12:01,290 --> 03:12:03,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now-

2757
03:12:05,098 --> 03:12:11,839
[SPEAKER_22]: From what I recall, they're waiting until the parking meters are put in place to issue permits.

2758
03:12:12,259 --> 03:12:14,660
[SPEAKER_22]: We discussed this in committee, does anybody else recall?

2759
03:12:16,260 --> 03:12:17,660
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be January, February.

2760
03:12:18,020 --> 03:12:21,241
[SPEAKER_03]: So then the placards we have now are grandfathered in until that date?

2761
03:12:21,381 --> 03:12:29,602
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, they're not going to do any enforcement, but then the people that are going to enforce the meters are also going to enforce permit packing.

2762
03:12:29,642 --> 03:12:31,263
[SPEAKER_22]: So South Memphis is very excited about it.

2763
03:12:31,443 --> 03:12:33,923
[SPEAKER_22]: I know there were a number of residents from our meeting that were there.

2764
03:12:34,411 --> 03:12:36,172
[SPEAKER_22]: that want this to move forward.

2765
03:12:37,894 --> 03:12:38,734
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't our decision.

2766
03:12:38,774 --> 03:12:40,476
[SPEAKER_22]: This is just what we were told.

2767
03:12:40,496 --> 03:12:41,296
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand.

2768
03:12:42,017 --> 03:12:44,799
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's important you brought it up, because I did get an email on it this week.

2769
03:12:44,939 --> 03:12:46,940
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody very concerned they couldn't renew their permit.

2770
03:12:47,641 --> 03:12:48,061
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

2771
03:12:48,161 --> 03:12:48,782
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good to know.

2772
03:12:49,342 --> 03:12:53,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I have other things to say about the parking program, but I had enough for tonight.

2773
03:12:53,926 --> 03:12:54,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody.

2774
03:12:54,666 --> 03:12:55,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

2775
03:12:55,887 --> 03:12:57,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Counselor.

2776
03:13:00,810 --> 03:13:03,333
[SPEAKER_06]: You just bring up, and you just, she just jogged my memory on something.

2777
03:13:04,014 --> 03:13:06,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I was told that you won't be able to come.

2778
03:13:06,116 --> 03:13:09,399
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have to go online and make an application to get them.

2779
03:13:09,439 --> 03:13:11,942
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's the case, everybody doesn't have a computer in this community.

2780
03:13:12,513 --> 03:13:14,675
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you don't have a car, how are you supposed to do this?

2781
03:13:15,235 --> 03:13:17,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Residents are getting a break, too, in some of the parking.

2782
03:13:17,476 --> 03:13:18,117
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I understand that.

2783
03:13:18,137 --> 03:13:21,479
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they don't have a computer, and if they're telling you that's the only way you can do it online, that's.

2784
03:13:21,879 --> 03:13:23,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there'll be other mechanisms.

2785
03:13:23,741 --> 03:13:24,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't recall that.

2786
03:13:24,922 --> 03:13:25,442
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't recall that.

2787
03:13:25,462 --> 03:13:27,023
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my neighbors does not have a computer.

2788
03:13:27,223 --> 03:13:29,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2789
03:13:29,345 --> 03:13:35,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I am aware that they do have public computers at the Medford Public Library that's accessible, and people are allowed to use them there as well.

2790
03:13:35,509 --> 03:13:37,270
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a point of information if anybody's interested.

2791
03:13:37,290 --> 03:13:40,652
[SPEAKER_13]: They're actually going to be set up, too, in certain areas to get this off the ground.

2792
03:13:40,692 --> 03:13:41,533
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a huge undertaking.

2793
03:13:41,934 --> 03:13:43,956
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as the public is informed, that's great.

2794
03:13:44,356 --> 03:13:45,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one last thing before I go.

2795
03:13:49,100 --> 03:13:53,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight, you were talking about the construction up on Smith Street to Hicks Avenue last week.

2796
03:13:55,025 --> 03:13:55,865
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have a question.

2797
03:13:57,387 --> 03:14:02,511
[SPEAKER_03]: On the corner of Main Street and Alexander Avenue, there seemed to have been a mistake.

2798
03:14:02,911 --> 03:14:04,352
[SPEAKER_03]: The council addressed this a few weeks ago.

2799
03:14:04,412 --> 03:14:05,734
[SPEAKER_03]: But I understand that.

2800
03:14:06,114 --> 03:14:10,658
[SPEAKER_03]: But why in God's name do we have to have a bolted in sawhusk

2801
03:14:11,682 --> 03:14:15,263
[SPEAKER_03]: wood with yellow caution tape on it.

2802
03:14:15,283 --> 03:14:16,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's terrible.

2803
03:14:16,644 --> 03:14:18,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when can we get rid of this damn thing?

2804
03:14:18,825 --> 03:14:24,427
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there is a permanent plan that council asked this question a few weeks ago, maybe three or four weeks ago.

2805
03:14:24,627 --> 03:14:25,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Cafe dear.

2806
03:14:25,347 --> 03:14:26,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's in front of them.

2807
03:14:26,648 --> 03:14:26,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2808
03:14:26,848 --> 03:14:27,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Cafe dear.

2809
03:14:27,608 --> 03:14:27,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2810
03:14:28,368 --> 03:14:29,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't been to the last couple of meetings.

2811
03:14:29,789 --> 03:14:30,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed out.

2812
03:14:30,569 --> 03:14:30,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2813
03:14:30,929 --> 03:14:31,569
[SPEAKER_13]: We missed you.

2814
03:14:33,110 --> 03:14:33,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Merry Christmas.

2815
03:14:35,631 --> 03:14:36,051
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2816
03:14:36,551 --> 03:14:38,212
[SPEAKER_13]: The records were passed too.

2817
03:14:39,278 --> 03:14:39,778
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

2818
03:14:40,459 --> 03:14:43,962
[SPEAKER_13]: We have two papers in the hands of the clerk, and they are two condolences.

2819
03:14:44,642 --> 03:14:46,764
[SPEAKER_13]: They're both submitted by Vice President Caraviello.

2820
03:14:47,484 --> 03:15:01,595
[SPEAKER_13]: The first one, 14-791, offered by Vice President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extends its sincere condolences to Medford school teacher Bill Carter, who passed away last week after losing his battle with cancer.

2821
03:15:01,615 --> 03:15:02,115
[SPEAKER_13]: He'll be missed.

2822
03:15:02,916 --> 03:15:04,596
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

2823
03:15:05,217 --> 03:15:05,917
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

2824
03:15:06,737 --> 03:15:08,797
[SPEAKER_13]: And offered by Vice President Caraviello.

2825
03:15:08,817 --> 03:15:14,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved, the city council offer a moment of silence for the recent passing of Marie, Mary Butler, long time resident of Medford.

2826
03:15:15,279 --> 03:15:17,439
[SPEAKER_13]: The chair recognizes Vice President Caraviello.

2827
03:15:17,740 --> 03:15:18,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2828
03:15:18,700 --> 03:15:32,443
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, we often come up here and we give resolutions and condolences to many people, like a school teacher, or someone's aunt, uncle, grandmother.

2829
03:15:33,970 --> 03:15:43,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Last Tuesday, a woman, Mary butler was killed in a tragic accident on high street.

2830
03:15:44,658 --> 03:15:46,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Mary butler was born and raised in medford.

2831
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:50,523
[SPEAKER_21]: She has lived pretty much by herself her whole life.

2832
03:15:50,563 --> 03:15:51,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Her parents died at a young age.

2833
03:15:52,264 --> 03:15:53,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Her brother died at a young age.

2834
03:15:54,185 --> 03:15:59,370
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a woman who has no family, no sisters, brothers.

2835
03:16:02,210 --> 03:16:10,695
[SPEAKER_21]: home, there's going to be a small ceremony but there will be no family there at 730 tomorrow morning at St.

2836
03:16:10,715 --> 03:16:17,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Carty's but this woman has no family to be there and there's no condolences or anything.

2837
03:16:18,520 --> 03:16:24,464
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're always offering condolences for people that someone's grandmother or someone's work for the city.

2838
03:16:25,004 --> 03:16:28,927
[SPEAKER_21]: This woman was just a regular woman, taxpayer, whole life in the community, good

2839
03:16:30,245 --> 03:16:34,289
[SPEAKER_21]: Just recently moved over to the Regency condo because the house was getting to be too much.

2840
03:16:34,309 --> 03:16:35,711
[SPEAKER_21]: She was a neighbor of mine for 30 years.

2841
03:16:36,952 --> 03:16:44,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice woman, no family, and I'd like to offer this moment of silence for her just because the city is her family.

2842
03:16:58,433 --> 03:17:02,535
[SPEAKER_17]: Just if I could touch upon that, and I appreciate Councilor Caviello bringing this up.

2843
03:17:03,995 --> 03:17:09,878
[SPEAKER_17]: That marks the second fatality in that particular area within the past year.

2844
03:17:11,059 --> 03:17:16,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Two fatalities in the past year on that particular stretch of High Street.

2845
03:17:17,402 --> 03:17:23,185
[SPEAKER_17]: I've offered several resolutions regarding the lighting in front of the school and in front of the church.

2846
03:17:23,912 --> 03:17:26,693
[SPEAKER_17]: in that particular area and along High Street.

2847
03:17:27,413 --> 03:17:34,476
[SPEAKER_17]: And this council has offered many, many suggestions on traffic-calming approaches in this community.

2848
03:17:34,956 --> 03:17:44,399
[SPEAKER_17]: And as I mentioned before, we need to take back our streets from speeders and people that are breaking the rules and the laws of the roads, going through stop signs, Mr. President.

2849
03:17:44,759 --> 03:17:47,940
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's unfortunate that an incident like this takes place.

2850
03:17:48,740 --> 03:17:50,641
[SPEAKER_17]: However, it's becoming more

2851
03:17:53,847 --> 03:17:59,852
[SPEAKER_17]: available in this community, and we're seeing more pedestrian accidents in this community.

2852
03:18:00,413 --> 03:18:05,417
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know what we need to do, Mr. President, but we've discussed about widening sidewalks.

2853
03:18:05,757 --> 03:18:08,379
[SPEAKER_17]: We've talked about raised crosswalks.

2854
03:18:09,560 --> 03:18:17,647
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a pilot program going on right now, and we still fall short of the mark, in my opinion, in providing pedestrian safety.

2855
03:18:18,127 --> 03:18:21,429
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't clearly mark our crosswalks.

2856
03:18:21,769 --> 03:18:23,770
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not painted in a timely fashion.

2857
03:18:24,070 --> 03:18:27,412
[SPEAKER_17]: The lighting throughout the community is poor, Mr. President.

2858
03:18:27,773 --> 03:18:31,335
[SPEAKER_17]: The signage is inadequate, in my opinion, throughout the city.

2859
03:18:31,815 --> 03:18:44,762
[SPEAKER_17]: And we very seldom see any type of traffic stings or radar stings within our community that do have a profound impact in slowing cars on our streets.

2860
03:18:45,362 --> 03:18:54,126
[SPEAKER_17]: And really, Mr. President, I don't know what it's going to take, but in my opinion, we're at a situation right now that's epidemic in our community.

2861
03:18:54,486 --> 03:19:02,009
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you have two pedestrians within a year's span killed in the same area, Mr. President, that should raise a red flag.

2862
03:19:03,090 --> 03:19:03,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2863
03:19:13,832 --> 03:19:15,152
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Andrew Castaneda.

2864
03:19:15,172 --> 03:19:41,299
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to say, when you voted on the owner-occupied exemption, even though we all knew that 9 out of 10 of the owner-occupied would see less of a tax increase, I'm very shocked there was 7 to nothing against the proposal from the state.

2865
03:19:41,809 --> 03:19:43,649
[SPEAKER_25]: which is from the state we could use.

2866
03:19:45,230 --> 03:19:49,210
[SPEAKER_25]: I figure at least you're going to offer 10%, half, a half a bone.

2867
03:19:51,891 --> 03:19:53,771
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess I'm not surprised.

2868
03:19:53,811 --> 03:19:56,332
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe capitalism wins again.

2869
03:20:04,893 --> 03:20:06,054
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor to adjourn?

2870
03:20:06,374 --> 03:20:06,914
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

2871
03:20:06,934 --> 03:20:07,474
[SPEAKER_13]: The ayes have it.
