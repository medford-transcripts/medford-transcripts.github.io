00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:26,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:32,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

3
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:34,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I am John Petrella.

4
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:45,691
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of our program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed decisions.

5
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:54,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we have a special guest, Holly Racer, who is an attorney with the law firm Rich May.

6
00:00:55,623 --> 00:01:03,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Holly will be speaking on things you really need to know about Method's new zoning audiences.

7
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:05,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Holly.

8
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:08,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining us on the show today.

9
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:10,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, John, for having me.

10
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:17,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into any questions, can you just give us a little background, what you do?

11
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:18,708
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Harley Racer.

12
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:20,890
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the Boston law firm Rich May PC.

13
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,212
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a land use and litigation attorney.

14
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:31,240
[SPEAKER_00]: My practice centers on the intersection of municipalities, open space, land use, and disputes that arise from those.

15
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:32,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, very good.

16
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:33,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

17
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:38,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're going to get right into asking some questions here with Holly.

18
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:51,624
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I want to start off with Salem Street zoning by asking you, what was the process and where does the Salem Street project stand right now?

19
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does the zoning stand right now?

20
00:01:54,453 --> 00:02:14,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, so the Salem Street rezoning effort and the Salem Street corridor that went forward started in the City Council and they hired a consultant to do a revamp and change that would allow for greater density and for mixed use as a right along the Salem Street corridor and the areas that abut it.

21
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:25,799
[SPEAKER_00]: When it went to the Community Development Board and just before that, when it was finally made public, there was quite a bit of opposition from the Salem Street community and the neighborhood.

22
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:36,731
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was particular concern that the environmental justice community, which runs straight through, wasn't given the necessary

23
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:57,197
[SPEAKER_00]: involvement and engagement and the mayor to their credit uh stepped in and it slowed down when it got to the community development board and there were some changes that were recommended by the community development board okay um and and some of those remained when it went to the city council and some the city council chose to reject okay so

24
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,046
[SPEAKER_01]: There was involvement from the community after the fact, I guess.

25
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:04,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that okay to say that?

26
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:11,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the community got involved because they were upset and they weren't notified, that type of situation.

27
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:12,931
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair to say.

28
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:20,554
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't the level of involvement or engagement that there should have been for the environmental justice community in particular.

29
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:21,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

30
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:30,740
[SPEAKER_00]: The Medford has a comprehensive plan and it has goals and objectives of tracking the environmental justice policy that the state has.

31
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

32
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,142
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires some extra involvement when it goes through these communities.

33
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:43,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just didn't seem to occur and it led to considerable public backlash when it became more widely known.

34
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:44,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

35
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:45,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

36
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:46,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the answer.

37
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:49,807
[SPEAKER_01]: The other question, there was a...

38
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:59,894
[SPEAKER_01]: A loss, a big issue about a methadone clinic going into that neighborhood down by the Roberts School.

39
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:01,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a tight area.

40
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,277
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the status of the methadone clinic?

41
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:05,017
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?

42
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:10,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, last year there was a project that was proposed to put a methadone clinic in the Salem Street area.

43
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:17,407
[SPEAKER_00]: That received considerable opposition from the neighborhood, and it didn't go forward.

44
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:27,735
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems with the rezoning effort is that it would have changed the zoning in that district on Salem Street to allow similar clinics as of right.

45
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:34,241
[SPEAKER_00]: And this came just months after the clinic was defeated in the initial go-round.

46
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:38,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a real problem and that really upset a lot of people.

47
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:44,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it got to the Community Development Board, the Community Development Board did take that clinic

48
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:56,977
[SPEAKER_00]: As of right out of the zoning changes and so those are not part of the Salem Street zoning district Okay, so the methadone clinics definitely out the clint the right to have a clinic as of right is out is out Okay.

49
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:05,561
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and then you know you mentioned Environmental justice neighborhood a lot of people I know do not know what that is.

50
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:07,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us a little information?

51
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:08,263
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly is it?

52
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:15,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, the state and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has an environmental justice policy.

53
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:26,274
[SPEAKER_00]: And this came after the recognition that underserved communities are often, they catch the brunt of environmental

54
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:46,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Harms from projects and so this is an effort by the state to engage these communities More and so when a state when a project goes forward that needs some state review It there's there's additional obligations and requirements to engage these communities these communities are defined by

55
00:05:48,603 --> 00:06:04,067
[SPEAKER_00]: if the annual income is 65% of the median in the state, if it's 40% minorities, or if there's 25% of the community doesn't have English proficiency.

56
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:04,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

57
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:05,468
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

58
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:09,789
[SPEAKER_01]: And these obligations, I mean, they have to be met.

59
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,304
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be met for state projects.

60
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:23,994
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Medford has adopted a comprehensive plan that tracks those requirements and sets them as goals, as ideals for the city to do the same thing in practice here.

61
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:24,715
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

62
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:26,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

63
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:29,279
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Holly, thanks for that previous answer.

64
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also, I mean, there's a lot going up at St.

65
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:34,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Clair Road.

66
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:37,146
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big mess up there.

67
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:42,151
[SPEAKER_01]: the neighbors, people don't understand, a lot of questions.

68
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,714
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly is the situation?

69
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:46,475
[SPEAKER_01]: What started it?

70
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:47,497
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?

71
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:48,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we stand?

72
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:52,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was an interesting situation there at St.

73
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:52,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Clair Road.

74
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Your viewers are likely aware that it was the former convent.

75
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:02,158
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's an old boarding house that has been vacant for many years.

76
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,303
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's zoned residential, and so it's not permissible to have a boarding house there.

77
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:24,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the building is sat and a for-profit developer purchased the property and had a plan to move forward with a for-profit project, which was to renovate the interior, redesign it, renovate it, and then lease it out for a profit.

78
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:34,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it couldn't do that as a right under the zoning ordinances, and so it applied to the Community Development Board for

79
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:41,349
[SPEAKER_00]: to not have to follow the zoning requirements as a Dover Amendment project.

80
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:57,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Dover Amendment is a state statute that prohibits municipalities from enacting and enforcing zoning ordinances against nonprofit religious organizations and nonprofit educational organizations.

81
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:05,159
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what the developer did is applied for Dover Amendment approval with the board,

82
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:14,247
[SPEAKER_00]: and did so by saying that eventually the organization that would be leasing it is a non-profit organization.

83
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:29,171
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought this was a problem because under the Dover Amendment, it's supposed to be a non-profit entity that is seeking the relief from the zoning ordinances for a non-profit use.

84
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:34,293
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we had a for-profit developer seeking it for a for-profit use

85
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:41,999
[SPEAKER_00]: even though eventually it would go to be a non-profit use by the person leasing it, which was a shelter.

86
00:08:42,760 --> 00:09:02,097
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it took multiple rounds of the community development board, the for-profit developer made changes to their presentation, they reorganized the entity that would house the building, and eventually satisfied the board, although we still disagreed with their analysis.

87
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:07,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so moving ahead, there, what's going in there?

88
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so the company that originally owned it, they still own it.

89
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:15,852
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going to fix it up and lease it.

90
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:18,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So a non-profit is going in.

91
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:20,914
[SPEAKER_00]: A non-profit will lease it.

92
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:24,735
[SPEAKER_00]: And the non-profit is, it's an organization to house,

93
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:29,878
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a temporary shelter for victims of domestic violence.

94
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:30,358
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

95
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:30,939
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

96
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:31,839
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all set.

97
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:32,319
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.

98
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,720
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going in there.

99
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,441
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as last I saw, yes.

100
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:36,002
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

101
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:36,482
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

102
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:37,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you never know.

103
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,783
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, things change.

104
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:42,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on who the nonprofit is, and we all know how that works out.

105
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:52,871
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, another thing in method, and this is my observation, you know,

106
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:57,113
[SPEAKER_01]: The people of our neighborhoods, okay?

107
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:58,493
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot going on.

108
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:00,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're talking Medford Square.

109
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:17,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Every part of Medford, basically, with this, I don't know what kind of zoning, you know, if you could label it what you would call it, but, you know, it seems like people came out

110
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:22,674
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to the council, talk to the zoning board, I mean, whatever.

111
00:10:22,794 --> 00:10:32,816
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw all the meetings, you hear about them, big discussions, and it's like totally ignored the community.

112
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:41,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, a few people want, you know, what's happening, but what do people do?

113
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:44,758
[SPEAKER_01]: What's their, like, how do they fight it?

114
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:45,458
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they try to,

115
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:48,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even talking about fighting it, Holly.

116
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:50,244
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they get people to listen?

117
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:50,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean.

118
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:56,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this isn't unique to Medford, first of all.

119
00:10:57,265 --> 00:11:00,526
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it takes is it takes people showing up.

120
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:01,967
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes effort.

121
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:03,007
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time.

122
00:11:03,827 --> 00:11:06,648
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay attention to the agendas.

123
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:08,408
[SPEAKER_00]: You read the minutes.

124
00:11:08,788 --> 00:11:11,629
[SPEAKER_00]: And you show up to all the boards, all the committees.

125
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:16,170
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that really helps is to organize.

126
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:17,631
[SPEAKER_00]: get together.

127
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:27,597
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, I've seen it here in Medford and I've seen it elsewhere, there's a great diversity of expertise in your neighborhood.

128
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:39,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's neighborhood has it and there's skill sets that your neighbors have that are different than yours and if you can pull your resources, pull together and divide and

129
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:43,729
[SPEAKER_00]: divide and share the work that is before you to keep track of what's going on.

130
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:47,933
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first step, is to know what's happening and to show up and to have your voices be heard.

131
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

132
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:51,576
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that makes sense.

133
00:11:51,596 --> 00:12:00,903
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like that's going on, but then it just seems like whatever this zoning push, I mean, you're telling me it's not just Medford.

134
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this like a statewide push?

135
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's always competing interests.

136
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:14,194
[SPEAKER_00]: There's interests that will come from the city councils and the mayors and from the different boards.

137
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:22,660
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have objectives, and those don't always necessarily align with the neighborhoods and the communities that are going to be affected.

138
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:41,248
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important for the people to show up, pay attention, track what's happening, and if something seems off, if it seems wrong, if the people know it's not right, then get a legal opinion and see if there's something that's happened that needs to be looked at a little closer.

139
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,149
[SPEAKER_00]: See if there's some impropriety in the procedure.

140
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,050
[SPEAKER_00]: See if there's some process that's not been followed.

141
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,492
[SPEAKER_00]: See if there's some substantive defect to what they're pursuing.

142
00:12:49,975 --> 00:12:51,216
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, all right.

143
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:53,957
[SPEAKER_01]: That all makes sense.

144
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:56,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to follow up again.

145
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, people are looking for good governance.

146
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:03,562
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I call it.

147
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:06,184
[SPEAKER_01]: People that, OK, we're going to do this.

148
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:08,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants to see Method get better.

149
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:09,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody.

150
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:14,208
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're not just the people that aren't

151
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think some of the zoning, what they're going to do in Meffitt Square, I mean, it could be a positive thing.

152
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:22,722
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be if it's done right.

153
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everyone in the city wants to see changes.

154
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:32,144
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are like, I mean, they're wholesale.

155
00:13:32,424 --> 00:13:34,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're going up stories.

156
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,486
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do you foster good governance?

157
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if you can answer that question, but what do you do?

158
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:42,987
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?

159
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,287
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like our hands are tied.

160
00:13:44,947 --> 00:14:06,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, it's hard, you speak with your vote, for one thing, and you show up, you know, we know democracy isn't a one-day event on election day, you know, you show up and you have your voices heard and you organize, and it's really important for projects that go forward, especially rezoning projects and big changes that are going to affect neighborhoods, for it to be

161
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:11,030
[SPEAKER_00]: what the community in the neighborhood wants and what they need.

162
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:22,657
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we know that people who are the residents and the business owners that live on these streets and in these neighborhoods, they know what needs are there.

163
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:23,757
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what needs to be done.

164
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:26,199
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what problems need to be fixed.

165
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,960
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what is going to make it worse, too.

166
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they need to be listened to.

167
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:37,465
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also help organize to present their solutions, you know, so that they can be considered

168
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:41,706
[SPEAKER_00]: before it's done from a top-down approach.

169
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:49,468
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really does take integrating with the community and speaking to them and engaging with them and listening.

170
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:54,389
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to force people to listen.

171
00:14:54,489 --> 00:15:06,953
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you show up and if you make sure that they're being watched carefully so that the interests of the community are being heard, that helps.

172
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:30,545
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, all right, because I just I think there's I just think there's a lot of frustration in method because You know, like I said people want to see changes they want to see good things they want to see the city grow Yeah, we want to see some affordable housing there's a lot of things we want but it's like I

173
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:33,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know where to begin.

174
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:36,043
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming down with like everything.

175
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:38,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all at once.

176
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:40,384
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not talking minor.

177
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:43,826
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're talking major renovations.

178
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:48,248
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know, I guess it's, I mean, who's pushing it?

179
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's the city itself.

180
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:55,831
[SPEAKER_01]: The people running the city right now, they just seem to be pushing this and pushing this and pushing this.

181
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:57,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's like,

182
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:02,794
[SPEAKER_01]: such a fast speed that they're doing all this.

183
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:16,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see this in other communities where they're, I mean, I don't want to get into too much, but Boston Ave, Tufts College, South Method, you know, Mystic Ave, I mean, we do need updating, we do need things to happen.

184
00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:17,945
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are like,

185
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:23,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this whole city, I mean, it's going to be under construction if everything goes through, you know?

186
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:25,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're seeing this in other cities or?

187
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:27,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's not uncommon.

188
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:39,427
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I can tell you is if you show up in an organized way, you can have an impact and you can have an effect and you can slow things down if they're moving too quickly.

189
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:57,275
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to make sure that what's being done is being done properly, that corners aren't being cut, that the proper notices are being provided, that the engagement's being done, that all of the procedure is above board.

190
00:16:57,715 --> 00:17:09,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those levers that are there, there are many levers available to citizens and residents and the community, but it does take effort.

191
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,702
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to happen on its own.

192
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,026
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the levers are there.

193
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:17,530
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull all the levers and they still it's just going to happen.

194
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:19,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, where do you go?

195
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:21,535
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to you're not going to win all the time.

196
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:23,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I understand.

197
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:23,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

198
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:24,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

199
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,323
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, if there's if there's something that that looks bad or smells bad.

200
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:35,367
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, get a legal opinion and see if it's something that could lead to, you know, some type of action more than just showing up in the meetings.

201
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:42,671
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that you find that is by showing up and having the community oversight, the citizen oversight on what the government's, on what your local government's doing.

202
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:47,693
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I look at this all and I don't see, you know, I don't see winners and losers.

203
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:52,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I see this whole entire city wants things to be better.

204
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,536
[SPEAKER_01]: They want more money to come into the city.

205
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:56,777
[SPEAKER_01]: We want more business.

206
00:17:58,218 --> 00:18:01,799
[SPEAKER_01]: We want more than likely what every other city wants.

207
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,540
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the size.

208
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's what's the biggest problem.

209
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:12,545
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyhow, I know we're getting on in time here.

210
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:15,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you.

211
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:16,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we finish.

212
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done cases like this where you've been hired by cities or?

213
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:29,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hired by citizen groups, sometimes aligned with cities and sometimes adverse to cities.

214
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:30,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

215
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:34,245
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes fighting a project and sometimes supporting a project.

216
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:34,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

217
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:35,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it from both sides.

218
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:37,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have seen it from both sides.

219
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:37,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

220
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And this goes on a lot, I take it.

221
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,427
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on all the time, everywhere.

222
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:41,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

223
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:43,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been going on for a long time.

224
00:18:43,187 --> 00:18:43,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

225
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:45,127
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing new.

226
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:47,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing that hasn't happened before.

227
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,149
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely right.

228
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:49,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

229
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:50,290
All right.

230
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:52,912
[SPEAKER_01]: We can finish the show with that.

231
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:53,392

234
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:04,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you got a lot of information out, especially in method.

235
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:07,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now, people really need to hear that.
