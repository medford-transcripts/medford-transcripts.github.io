    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=25.293s">Hello</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=26.934s">Welcome</a>  to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=33.661s">I</a>  am John Petrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=35.883s">The</a>  purpose of our program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=46.615s">Today,</a>  we have a special guest, Holly Racer, who is an attorney with the law firm Rich May. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=55.623s">Holly</a>  will be speaking on things you really need to know about Method's new zoning audiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=64.432s">Welcome,</a>  Holly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=65.813s">Thank</a>  you for joining us on the show today.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=69.096s">Thank</a>  you, John, for having me.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=71.441s">Before</a>  we get into any questions, can you just give us a little background, what you do?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=77.847s">I'm</a>  Harley Racer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=78.728s">I'm</a>  at the Boston law firm Rich May PC. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=81.39s">I'm</a>  a land use and litigation attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=83.953s">My</a>  practice centers on the intersection of municipalities, open space, land use, and disputes that arise from those.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=91.914s">Okay,</a>  very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=92.835s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=94.575s">So,</a>  we're going to get right into asking some questions here with Holly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=99.858s">So,</a>  I want to start off with Salem Street zoning by asking you, what was the process and where does the Salem Street project stand right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=111.684s">Where</a>  does the zoning stand right now?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=114.453s">Sure,</a>  so the Salem Street rezoning effort and the Salem Street corridor that went forward started in the City Council and they hired a consultant to do a revamp and change that would allow for greater density and for mixed use as a right along the Salem Street corridor and the areas that abut it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=135.688s">When</a>  it went to the Community Development Board and just before that, when it was finally made public, there was quite a bit of opposition from the Salem Street community and the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=146.78s">And</a>  there was particular concern that the environmental justice community, which runs straight through, wasn't given the necessary <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=158.172s">involvement</a>  and engagement and the mayor to their credit uh stepped in and it slowed down when it got to the community development board and there were some changes that were recommended by the community development board okay um and and some of those remained when it went to the city council and some the city council chose to reject okay so</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=178.44s">There</a>  was involvement from the community after the fact, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=182.186s">Is</a>  that okay to say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=184.871s">I</a>  mean, the community got involved because they were upset and they weren't notified, that type of situation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=192.21s">That's</a>  fair to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=192.971s">There</a>  wasn't the level of involvement or engagement that there should have been for the environmental justice community in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=200.654s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=201.615s">The</a>  Medford has a comprehensive plan and it has goals and objectives of tracking the environmental justice policy that the state has. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=211.02s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=211.2s">And</a>  that requires some extra involvement when it goes through these communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=215.662s">And</a>  that just didn't seem to occur and it led to considerable public backlash when it became more widely known.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=224.325s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=225.125s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=225.505s">I</a>  appreciate the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=227.786s">The</a>  other question, there was a... <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=231.167s">A</a>  loss, a big issue about a methadone clinic going into that neighborhood down by the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=240.034s">I</a>  mean, that's a tight area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=242.355s">What's</a>  the status of the methadone clinic? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=244.317s">What's</a>  going on?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=245.338s">Well,</a>  last year there was a project that was proposed to put a methadone clinic in the Salem Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=251.863s">That</a>  received considerable opposition from the neighborhood, and it didn't go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=258.568s">One</a>  of the problems with the rezoning effort is that it would have changed the zoning in that district on Salem Street to allow similar clinics as of right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=268.616s">And</a>  this came just months after the clinic was defeated in the initial go-round. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=274.301s">And</a>  so that was a real problem and that really upset a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=279.045s">Now,</a>  when it got to the Community Development Board, the Community Development Board did take that clinic <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=285.85s">As</a>  of right out of the zoning changes and so those are not part of the Salem Street zoning district Okay, so the methadone clinics definitely out the clint the right to have a clinic as of right is out is out Okay.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=297.417s">All</a>  right, and then you know you mentioned Environmental justice neighborhood a lot of people I know do not know what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=305.601s">Can</a>  you give us a little information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=307.322s">What</a>  exactly is it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=308.683s">Sure,</a>  the state and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has an environmental justice policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=316.008s">And</a>  this came after the recognition that underserved communities are often, they catch the brunt of environmental <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=327.895s">Harms</a>  from projects and so this is an effort by the state to engage these communities More and so when a state when a project goes forward that needs some state review It there's there's additional obligations and requirements to engage these communities these communities are defined by <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=348.603s">if</a>  the annual income is 65% of the median in the state, if it's 40% minorities, or if there's 25% of the community doesn't have English proficiency.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=364.367s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=365.148s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=365.908s">And</a>  these obligations, I mean, they have to be met.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=370.663s">They</a>  have to be met for state projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=372.364s">And</a>  so Medford has adopted a comprehensive plan that tracks those requirements and sets them as goals, as ideals for the city to do the same thing in practice here.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=384.415s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=385.516s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=386.537s">OK,</a>  Holly, thanks for that previous answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=390.42s">I'd</a>  also, I mean, there's a lot going up at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=394.083s">Clair</a>  Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=396.005s">It's</a>  a big mess up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=398.046s">the</a>  neighbors, people don't understand, a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=402.952s">What</a>  exactly is the situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=405.635s">What</a>  started it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=406.576s">What's</a>  going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=407.797s">Where</a>  do we stand?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=409.385s">Yeah,</a>  it was an interesting situation there at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=412.188s">Clair</a>  Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=413.91s">Your</a>  viewers are likely aware that it was the former convent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=418.534s">And</a>  so it's an old boarding house that has been vacant for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=422.919s">And</a>  it's zoned residential, and so it's not permissible to have a boarding house there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=428.544s">And</a>  so the building is sat and a for-profit developer purchased the property and had a plan to move forward with a for-profit project, which was to renovate the interior, redesign it, renovate it, and then lease it out for a profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=445.336s">Now,</a>  it couldn't do that as a right under the zoning ordinances, and so it applied to the Community Development Board for <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=456.607s">to</a>  not have to follow the zoning requirements as a Dover Amendment project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=462.089s">Now,</a>  the Dover Amendment is a state statute that prohibits municipalities from enacting and enforcing zoning ordinances against nonprofit religious organizations and nonprofit educational organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=478.276s">And</a>  so what the developer did is applied for Dover Amendment approval with the board, <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=486.525s">and</a>  did so by saying that eventually the organization that would be leasing it is a non-profit organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=495.868s">We</a>  thought this was a problem because under the Dover Amendment, it's supposed to be a non-profit entity that is seeking the relief from the zoning ordinances for a non-profit use. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=509.632s">And</a>  here, we had a for-profit developer seeking it for a for-profit use <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=515.013s">even</a>  though eventually it would go to be a non-profit use by the person leasing it, which was a shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=522.76s">And</a>  so it took multiple rounds of the community development board, the for-profit developer made changes to their presentation, they reorganized the entity that would house the building, and eventually satisfied the board, although we still disagreed with their analysis.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=542.608s">Okay,</a>  so moving ahead, there, what's going in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=547.69s">I</a>  mean, so the company that originally owned it, they still own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=554.452s">They</a>  were going to fix it up and lease it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=556.073s">So</a>  a non-profit is going in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=559.354s">A</a>  non-profit will lease it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=561.054s">And</a>  the non-profit is, it's an organization to house, <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=566.536s">It's</a>  a temporary shelter for victims of domestic violence.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=570.018s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=570.678s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=570.979s">So</a>  it's all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=571.899s">It's</a>  done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=572.339s">They're</a>  going in there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=573.76s">As</a>  far as last I saw, yes.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=575.681s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=576.022s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=576.502s">Because</a>  you never know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=577.643s">You</a>  know, things change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=578.843s">And</a>  depending on who the nonprofit is, and we all know how that works out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=584.827s">You</a>  know, another thing in method, and this is my observation, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=594.272s">The</a>  people of our neighborhoods, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=597.413s">There's</a>  a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=598.553s">Now</a>  we're talking Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=601.594s">Every</a>  part of Medford, basically, with this, I don't know what kind of zoning, you know, if you could label it what you would call it, but, you know, it seems like people came out <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=618.613s">talk</a>  to the council, talk to the zoning board, I mean, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=622.794s">You</a>  saw all the meetings, you hear about them, big discussions, and it's like totally ignored the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=633.976s">I</a>  mean, you know, a few people want, you know, what's happening, but what do people do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=641.817s">What's</a>  their, like, how do they fight it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=644.818s">How</a>  do they try to, <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=646.963s">I'm</a>  not even talking about fighting it, Holly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=648.783s">How</a>  do they get people to listen? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=650.504s">I</a>  mean.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=652.244s">Well,</a>  this isn't unique to Medford, first of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=657.265s">And</a>  what it takes is it takes people showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=661.266s">It</a>  takes effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=662.347s">It</a>  takes time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=663.827s">You</a>  have to pay attention to the agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=667.068s">You</a>  read the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=668.788s">And</a>  you show up to all the boards, all the committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=672.129s">And</a>  one thing that really helps is to organize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=677.05s">get</a>  together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=678.691s">There's,</a>  I've seen it here in Medford and I've seen it elsewhere, there's a great diversity of expertise in your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=687.718s">Everyone's</a>  neighborhood has it and there's skill sets that your neighbors have that are different than yours and if you can pull your resources, pull together and divide and <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=700.126s">divide</a>  and share the work that is before you to keep track of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=704.189s">That's</a>  the first step, is to know what's happening and to show up and to have your voices be heard.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=709.334s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=710.615s">I</a>  mean, that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=711.596s">It</a>  seems like that's going on, but then it just seems like whatever this zoning push, I mean, you're telling me it's not just Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=721.524s">Is</a>  this like a statewide push?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=725.247s">Well,</a>  there's always competing interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=728.329s">There's</a>  interests that will come from the city councils and the mayors and from the different boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=734.954s">They'll</a>  have objectives, and those don't always necessarily align with the neighborhoods and the communities that are going to be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=743.34s">And</a>  so it's important for the people to show up, pay attention, track what's happening, and if something seems off, if it seems wrong, if the people know it's not right, then get a legal opinion and see if there's something that's happened that needs to be looked at a little closer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=761.288s">See</a>  if there's some impropriety in the procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=763.189s">See</a>  if there's some process that's not been followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=766.09s">See</a>  if there's some substantive defect to what they're pursuing.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=769.975s">OK,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=771.256s">That</a>  all makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=774.738s">I'm</a>  going to follow up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=779.02s">Basically,</a>  people are looking for good governance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=782.662s">That's</a>  what I call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=783.902s">People</a>  that, OK, we're going to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=786.364s">Everyone</a>  wants to see Method get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=789.345s">Everybody.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=790.906s">I</a>  mean, we're not just the people that aren't <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=795.86s">I</a>  mean, I think some of the zoning, what they're going to do in Medford Square, I mean, it could be a positive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=801.381s">It</a>  could be if it's done right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=803.302s">And</a>  I think everyone in the city wants to see changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=808.223s">But</a>  these are like, I mean, they're wholesale. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=812.424s">I</a>  mean, they're going up stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=816.125s">You</a>  know, how do you foster good governance? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=818.666s">I</a>  don't even know if you can answer that question, but what do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=822.467s">What</a>  do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=823.087s">It's</a>  like our hands are tied.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=824.947s">Yeah,</a>  well, it's hard, you speak with your vote, for one thing, and you show up, you know, we know democracy isn't a one-day event on election day, you know, you show up and you have your voices heard and you organize, and it's really important for projects that go forward, especially rezoning projects and big changes that are going to affect neighborhoods, for it to be <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=848.609s">what</a>  the community in the neighborhood wants and what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=851.251s">You</a>  know, we know that people who are the residents and the business owners that live on these streets and in these neighborhoods, they know what needs are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=862.697s">They</a>  know what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=863.857s">They</a>  know what problems need to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=866.339s">They</a>  know what is going to make it worse, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=869.34s">And</a>  so they need to be listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=871.321s">They</a>  can also help organize to present their solutions, you know, so that they can be considered <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=877.945s">before</a>  it's done from a top-down approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=883.346s">But</a>  it really does take integrating with the community and speaking to them and engaging with them and listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=889.488s">And</a>  it's hard to force people to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=894.489s">But</a>  if you show up and if you make sure that they're being watched carefully so that the interests of the community are being heard, that helps.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=907.693s">okay,</a>  all right, because I just I think there's I just think there's a lot of frustration in method because You know, like I said people want to see changes they want to see good things they want to see the city grow Yeah, we want to see some affordable housing there's a lot of things we want but it's like I <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=932.401s">I</a>  don't even know where to begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=933.662s">They're</a>  coming down with like everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=936.763s">And</a>  it's all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=938.223s">And</a>  we're not talking minor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=940.444s">You</a>  know, you're talking major renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=943.906s">And</a>  it's like, you know, I guess it's, I mean, who's pushing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=948.328s">I</a>  guess it's the city itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=950.588s">The</a>  people running the city right now, they just seem to be pushing this and pushing this and pushing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=956.651s">And</a>  I think it's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=959.512s">such</a>  a fast speed that they're doing all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=962.814s">Do</a>  you see this in other communities where they're, I mean, I don't want to get into too much, but Boston Ave, Tufts College, South Method, you know, Mystic Ave, I mean, we do need updating, we do need things to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=977.164s">But</a>  these are like, <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=979.088s">I</a>  mean, this whole city, I mean, it's going to be under construction if everything goes through, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=983.492s">I</a>  mean, you're seeing this in other cities or?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=985.614s">Well,</a>  yeah, it's not uncommon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=988.557s">But</a>  what I can tell you is if you show up in an organized way, you can have an impact and you can have an effect and you can slow things down if they're moving too quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=999.947s">There</a>  are ways to make sure that what's being done is being done properly, that corners aren't being cut, that the proper notices are being provided, that the engagement's being done, that all of the procedure is above board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1017.715s">And</a>  so those levers that are there, there are many levers available to citizens and residents and the community, but it does take effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1029.34s">And</a>  it's not going to happen on its own.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1031.823s">So,</a>  you know, the levers are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1034.126s">You</a>  pull all the levers and they still it's just going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1038.651s">Now,</a>  where do you go?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1039.793s">You're</a>  not going to you're not going to win all the time.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1041.955s">Oh,</a>  no, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1043.477s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1043.978s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1044.599s">But</a>  I mean, if there's if there's something that that looks bad or smells bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1048.323s">you</a>  know, get a legal opinion and see if it's something that could lead to, you know, some type of action more than just showing up in the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1055.467s">And</a>  the way that you find that is by showing up and having the community oversight, the citizen oversight on what the government's, on what your local government's doing.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1063.031s">See,</a>  I look at this all and I don't see, you know, I don't see winners and losers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1068.394s">I</a>  see this whole entire city wants things to be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1073.115s">They</a>  want more money to come into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1075.576s">We</a>  want more business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1078.218s">We</a>  want more than likely what every other city wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1081.919s">It's</a>  just the size. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1084.04s">I</a>  guess that's what's the biggest problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1087.342s">So</a>  anyhow, I know we're getting on in time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1092.565s">I</a>  want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1095.786s">Before</a>  we finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1097.63s">Have</a>  you done cases like this where you've been hired by cities or?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1104.983s">I've</a>  been hired by citizen groups, sometimes aligned with cities and sometimes adverse to cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1110.144s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1110.604s">And</a>  sometimes fighting a project and sometimes supporting a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1114.285s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1114.945s">I've</a>  seen it from both sides.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1116.045s">So</a>  you have seen it from both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1117.466s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1117.766s">And</a>  this goes on a lot, I take it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1119.886s">It</a>  goes on all the time, everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1121.447s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1121.627s">And</a>  it's been going on for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1123.187s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1124.187s">It's</a>  nothing new. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1125.908s">It's</a>  nothing that hasn't happened before.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1128.428s">You're</a>  absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1129.289s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1131.511s">We</a>  can finish the show with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1132.972s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1134.133s">Really,</a>  Holly, I appreciate you coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1136.675s">I</a>  think you cleared up a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1139.837s">And</a>  I think you got a lot of information out, especially in method. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1144.841s">Like</a>  right now, people really need to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1147.643s">So</a>  I want to thank you for joining us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1153.807s">You</a>  know, we're near the end of the show, so thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1158.009s">We</a>  really, really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1159.769s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1160.25s">I</a>  also, as we end the show, I want to take a minute to thank everyone who's been watching the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1170.773s">Thank</a>  you for your feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1172.234s">We've</a>  gotten a lot of positive and we've gotten negative and we'll take it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1176.517s">We'll</a>  take any feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1180.78s">And</a>  if you'd like to share any comments or have any suggestions for a show or appearing on a future show, you can contact us at johnpatroller55 at gmail.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1196.957s">And</a>  you will be able to see replays of this show on metfordtv.org, Metford Happenings on YouTube, and also Metford Happenings on Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1208.747s">And</a>  from all of us at Metford Happenings, I'm John Petralla. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1212.93s">And</a>  remember, stay informed, and I'm going to just finish with, I have a funny feeling you're going to be coming, or I'm going to invite you back on the show, maybe about five, six months up the road, because there's so much activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1226.406s">I'd</a>  be happy to be back, and thank you for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1228.308s">Thank</a>  you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bb2OGdaRgK0&t=1229.749s">Have</a>  a great day, everybody.</p>
