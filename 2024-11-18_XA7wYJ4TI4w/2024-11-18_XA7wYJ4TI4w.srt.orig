42
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,761

00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:55,815
[SPEAKER_09]: be it further resolved that the goals of this meeting are to detail the great benefits and significant impacts of DC our own ways and properties on the city of Medford and improve communication between DC are the city of Medford and the residents of Medford to ensure prompting collaborative responses to improve conditions for all stakeholders, be it further resolved that the mayor send a copy of this resolution invitation

153
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:01,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Senator Jalen's office as the center has graciously offered to help set up the visit by Susan affairs.

154
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:02,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Madam President.

155
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:11,674
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think as this council as well where, as many counselors here have put forward resolutions regarding the DCR and the state of the properties in our community.

156
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:36,329
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's a lot of work that we really need DCR to step up on in terms of keeping their ways and properties clean, making sure that their construction projects are communicated with the city and that they're making the improvements that we want to see as a community, and that we also have, you know, clean and safe and fair access to all of the parks and those great benefits that we have from DCR managed properties as well.

157
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:46,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, as this council knows the responses to us have been either slow or non existent, and the same is true of the city staff the mayor as well.

158
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:53,498
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I think, given the advocacy of this council and the municipality as well

159
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:10,838
[SPEAKER_02]: a number of resident organizations, Walk Medford, the newly formed Route 16 coalition, which is looking at the entire stretch of Route 16 and trying to improve that, as well as I think what likely will form between Medford and Malden, some work around the Felsway and improvements on that property.

160
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:12,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time

161
00:11:14,477 --> 00:11:29,591
[SPEAKER_02]: that we invite the new commissioner of DCR down here to meet with us, to hear our concerns directly, to meet with city staff and build stronger lines of communication so we can get those prompt and speedy responses to our requests, as well as having a clear

162
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:36,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, advanced notice when DCR is going to come in and impact our community, and I think this is a way to do it.

163
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:47,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I was meeting with Senator Jalen and we kind of discussed this and she thought it would be good for the council to originate this, I did speak with the mayor and she was in favor of this as well.

164
00:11:48,053 --> 00:12:01,745
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure that with this council's support that all of us can work together to get the DCR folks down here to make a real impact and try to make a real change in the relationship between the city of Medford and DCR.

165
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:09,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked for my colleagues support and I hope that this effort can try to jumpstart the work that we've already been doing around this issue.

166
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:10,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

167
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:12,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

168
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

169
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:49,621
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got so much property known by them, and they leave in such disrepair, and you know what there's a lot of stuff to the safety hazards for the last three years, we have that we have that the kayaking and the club number has been that tree in the middle of the water for three years now I've asked every year for them to at least get the tree out of this so people don't get hurt when they go by that still there.

170
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:55,524
[SPEAKER_01]: The roads, all their properties are all on disarray.

171
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:58,586
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I support this with Councilor Beza.

172
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:12,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I've been on them every single year to do is stay on top of their property, because hey, I think we have our fair share of DCI property here that should at least be clean, trimmed, and kept in an orderly fashion.

173
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:15,475
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll second Councilor Beza's motion.

174
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:17,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Carvilla.

175
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:17,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

176
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:18,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

177
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:20,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam President, thank you very much.

178
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:34,442
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that there are a number of DCI-owned properties that have service contracts with the city, where the city is afforded the opportunity to maintain and upkeep certain properties, one of those being the Condon Shelves, Councilor Cabello was speaking of down at the sleeping hall.

179
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:41,305
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just ask that as part of this paper that we get a copy of all the service and maintenance agreements that we have with the DCI, so we know who's responsible for what.

180
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:47,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultimately, it is the DC has land, but the city in the past has signed on to be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of certain houses.

181
00:13:48,428 --> 00:14:01,554
[SPEAKER_16]: So for us to make an informed decision, I think we need to know what fossils those are, and whether or not those agreements still exist, and whether or not they need to be maybe beefed up a little bit to get us what community needs and benefits necessary to protect this.

182
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:02,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

183
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:03,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to be an amendment?

184
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:08,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

185
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:12,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I also just want to thank Vice President Behrs for bringing this forward.

186
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's frustrating for residents, it's frustrating for us.

187
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:23,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Anytime that someone raises an issue, we realize it's a DCR road, a DCR property, and we know that oftentimes we're going to hit our head against the wall trying to get something done.

188
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:26,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully this can help us move on that subject.

189
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,880
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of Vice President Behrs as amended, oh, sorry, Councilor Sang.

190
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

191
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:45,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just also going to mention, you know, during my time here, during the session, we've passed countless resolutions on DCR property, you know, trying to get it clean, trying to get things fixed, trying to make things more accessible, more friendly to residents.

192
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:51,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It is certainly frustrating to see the lack of response from the DCR.

193
00:14:52,167 --> 00:15:00,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of the structures, you know, the institutional structures, the accountability is just not there right now.

194
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:14,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank Vice President Behrs for introducing this because I think this is one of the ways that we can leverage our power as a city council and as the city of Medford to try to get the DCR to do better and to do more for our city.

195
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:15,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

196
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:22,696
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Behrs as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Seng.

197
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:23,917
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

198
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:24,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

199
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,477
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

200
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:26,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

201
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:27,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President.

202
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:32,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to take paper 22339 off the table.

203
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:34,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I do just want to know that.

204
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:35,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

205
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:37,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, great.

206
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:48,310
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one on the motion of ice and bears take to to dash 339 off the table as we do have a representative with us now second by tonight all those in favor.

207
00:15:51,628 --> 00:16:02,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Petition presentations and similar papers 22-339 petition for a grant of location on National Grid North Andover Massachusetts relocation of utility pole jointly on the horizon New England for Massachusetts.

208
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:05,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe we have a representative from National Grid with us.

209
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:13,186
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could please come to the podium, share your name and address for the record, please, and just give us an overview of the proposed project we're looking at.

210
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:15,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

211
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:19,398
[SPEAKER_13]: John Jankowski, 170 Medford Street in Malden, Mass.

212
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:21,500
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize for being late.

213
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,883
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was here on last week.

214
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:26,424
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't get on.

215
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry about that.

216
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:29,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for coming back.

217
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:31,788
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember when Robert Penta called, so I was there.

218
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:32,468
[SPEAKER_13]: I just couldn't get on.

219
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:33,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize for that.

220
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,113
[SPEAKER_13]: So that pole is going to be relocated.

221
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:42,416
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to build an underground residential development there.

222
00:16:43,307 --> 00:16:47,851
[SPEAKER_13]: and they're gonna have to move it 15 feet, I believe.

223
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:51,674
[SPEAKER_13]: The road won't be disturbed.

224
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:54,857
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just the panels, the sidewalk.

225
00:16:55,678 --> 00:17:01,042
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you have any questions or concerns, I can definitely answer those questions.

226
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:05,306
[SPEAKER_13]: When do we expect the work to be done?

227
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:07,585
[SPEAKER_13]: As you know, as soon as possible.

228
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I know they're doing some work out there.

229
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,970
[SPEAKER_14]: So the is a date, daytime hours.

230
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

231
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:13,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

232
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:15,052
[SPEAKER_14]: How long would that take?

233
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:16,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it would be just one day.

234
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:17,374
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

235
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:21,618
[SPEAKER_14]: And would it impact impact any neighbors driveways or anything?

236
00:17:21,678 --> 00:17:22,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe so.

237
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:22,438
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

238
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,059
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

239
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:24,120
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a case.

240
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:24,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

241
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:26,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

242
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:28,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for being here.

243
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:36,161
[SPEAKER_02]: For the panels that are disturbed, are they just going to be replaced with concrete?

244
00:17:37,302 --> 00:17:43,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a little out of scope, so I understand if we can't insert right now, but it was something I was thinking of last week when we were taking a look at this.

245
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:55,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any long-term plan by National Grid, and I know Verizon co-owns these poles as well, for moving services underground, or is that not really on the radar?

246
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:59,880
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's an overhead area, so it's going to stay overhead.

247
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:05,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, if someone wants to go underground, there'll be a cost involved in that.

248
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:06,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

249
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:08,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

250
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:12,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have one question.

251
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:15,490
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know there's obviously long-term work there with that new development.

252
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,110
[SPEAKER_09]: These sidewalk panels, you'll do the work and it will be replaced immediately.

253
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And then whatever happens down the line happens down the line, not waiting for that project to fully replace them.

254
00:18:24,332 --> 00:18:25,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

255
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,173
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by?

256
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:33,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Carviello, all those in favor?

257
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:35,378
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

258
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

259
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

260
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:39,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

261
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:43,845
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Naito to revert back to regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Sang.

262
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:44,545
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

263
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:45,986
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

264
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:46,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

265
00:18:49,229 --> 00:19:04,380
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-354 offered by President Morales, unless anyone objects, be it resolved that the Medford City Council, by the Medford City Council, the Council submit proposals or ideas for the FY23 City Budget to the City Clerk by Monday, May 23rd at 3 p.m.

266
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,784
[SPEAKER_09]: for consideration at the City Council's FY23 Budget Proposal Committee of the Whole meetings to be scheduled for Tuesday, May 24th.

267
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:13,946
[SPEAKER_09]: and Wednesday, May 25, as needed.

268
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:24,132
[SPEAKER_09]: So this paper is before us, I think, since the then new administration came in two years ago, there was the hope of having these pre-budget meetings and for whatever reason, they've never materialized.

269
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:36,918
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is just the intention to take things into our own hands to at least communicate what we as a council are seeking from the budget, rather than getting the budget delivered to us kind of at the last hour and really not having as much for the woman's life.

270
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:37,919
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is my intention.

271
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:42,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I would hope to schedule them for Tuesday and if we need to, we can go to Wednesday as well for next week.

272
00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:45,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

273
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:46,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

274
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:51,130
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Naik, seconded by Vice-President Paris.

275
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,910
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

276
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

277
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:53,452
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

278
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,212
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

279
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,201
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-355 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

280
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:06,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the company that installed the bocce courts at Riverside Ave, return to repair them with the proper materials and make them the proper size.

281
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:07,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Carvalho.

282
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:07,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

283
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:10,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam President, this is the third time I've had this on the agenda.

284
00:20:11,786 --> 00:20:16,887
[SPEAKER_01]: City of Medford went out and hired a company that supposedly does tennis courts and bocce courts.

285
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:22,729
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyone I know, I don't know very much about bocce, but I know those aren't bocce courts.

286
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are sand pits.

287
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:28,807
[SPEAKER_01]: and their voucher cards don't have sand in them, they have clay and they're too big.

288
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:41,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't believe we paid money to a company to put in voucher cards for people to play on them that are just not voucher cards, they're just sand and you throw the ball, the ball just sinks.

289
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:53,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they, and I said, suppose a company does it, this is my third time asking them, if not, I say, make a motion that we have the city solicitor

290
00:20:54,557 --> 00:21:01,080
[SPEAKER_01]: file suit against them to bring them up to where they're supposed to be to be considered a budget court, not a sandbox.

291
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caravella.

292
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:05,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

293
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:08,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam President, I just asked that this paper also be sent to the Director of Recreation.

294
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:13,304
[SPEAKER_16]: I know the Recreation Department's been expanding their programming related to blotchy.

295
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:20,786
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at the Recreation booklet, you'll see that they have pickup games, I guess is what you want to call it, of blotchy down there as well.

296
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:22,087
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think this is something that

297
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:33,654
[SPEAKER_16]: the recreation department's really trying to take a look at investing some energy and effort into and having the state of the art quality facilities is what's going to really increase participation, I think, so I think it's a great measure.

298
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,435
[SPEAKER_16]: The budget quotes are something I was always very supportive of.

299
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:47,382
[SPEAKER_16]: I was the sponsor of the initial resolve under the Burke administration that brought these to fruition, and Councilor Caviello is right, the specs are not up to community standards.

300
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:49,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

301
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:50,949
[SPEAKER_09]: And Councilor Caviello, do you want to amend the paper?

302
00:21:51,630 --> 00:22:02,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that if it's not repaired that we have to see a solicitor go after the company financially to repair or some type of reimbursement and we'll do it on our own.

303
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:03,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not that big of a deal.

304
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:08,039
[SPEAKER_01]: All you gotta do is come in with some clay, put it down there, but probably an hour's worth of work, two hours worth of work.

305
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:09,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's been three years.

306
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:12,041
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting for this to get done.

307
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:13,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

308
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,985
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Carvillo as amended by Councilor Carvillo and Councilor Knight.

309
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:18,987
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

310
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:19,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

311
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:20,769
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

312
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

313
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,762
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to take

314
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,146
[SPEAKER_09]: 22317 and 22318 from the table.

315
00:22:35,226 --> 00:22:35,806
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

316
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:37,488
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

317
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:38,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

318
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:45,394
[SPEAKER_09]: 22317, the loan order for Sidewalk Fonz is eligible for its third reading on May 17th, 2022.

319
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:48,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe, is there any current discussion on this?

320
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe we have representatives from the administration that are able to speak to this.

321
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:00,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, councillors.

322
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:01,843
[SPEAKER_05]: It's me, Gibran.

323
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:03,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm the DPW commissioner.

324
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:06,286
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and Owen Motel with me.

325
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,067
[SPEAKER_05]: He is the new city engineer.

326
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,508
[SPEAKER_03]: He hasn't left already.

327
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:13,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the new city engineer, Owen.

328
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

329
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:27,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did have a number of questions addressed by Chief of Staff Nisarian, but I think also if you were able to more speak to the work that could be anticipated with this bond, but of course there's specific questions from my fellow councillors.

330
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:31,297
[SPEAKER_09]: have a presentation, go ahead.

331
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:33,500
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no presentation, basically.

332
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:33,920
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a map.

333
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,101
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a map, yes.

334
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:40,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were going to... I can do that.

335
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:43,690
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a heat map for the sidewalks

336
00:23:58,752 --> 00:24:01,153
[SPEAKER_03]: on the stated sidewalks, which ones are priority.

337
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:26,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And within that report, it gave the amount of money that our backlog is, and it showed the state of the sidewalks, and it also showed the hot zones, and it created this presentation map here, which overlays, it's a heat map with the priority of the sidewalk state.

338
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:37,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would add to that that the other piece of data that's used is the amount of pedestrian traffic that is going towards the central location.

339
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:43,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of these are schools, hospitals, T stations, you know, major bus areas, things like that.

340
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:45,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what this map identifies.

341
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:50,786
[SPEAKER_05]: So it helps the engineers try to figure out where to focus the attention.

342
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:56,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I will mention that this is really the first year that we're using two sets of data as opposed to one.

343
00:24:56,987 --> 00:25:04,869
[SPEAKER_05]: The one set that was used prior to this year was a list of sidewalk repair requests that the DPW maintains.

344
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:12,090
[SPEAKER_05]: That list is approximately 1,700 locations long and reports long.

345
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:21,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were going by that prior, but now this makes the data a lot more rich and usable because now we're able to say, oh, OK, well,

346
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,593
[SPEAKER_05]: know what we want to do, what the heat map tells us, and what this set of data is telling us.

347
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:43,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're able to cross-reference it with the requests that are being made by the public to make sure that we're putting a list together for the contractor, the engineer, or even in-house as well to know what we need to be focusing our attention on.

348
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:46,744
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a key difference, I think, from other years.

349
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, another key difference I just want to point out is that

350
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:56,882
[SPEAKER_05]: We know what we need to do now, which we didn't really before because we did not have this assessment.

351
00:25:59,837 --> 00:26:09,580
[SPEAKER_05]: a very good idea of how much money we need to spend, how much planning we need to do to get to where we need to be, and I'm confident we'll get there.

352
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,481
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is going to take all the tools and toolbox approach.

353
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:23,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the reasons I'm here is to try to explain in-house what I'm looking at strategically to get us to a place in-house where we can do more sidewalk work,

354
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:26,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can do more street and road work, to be honest.

355
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:40,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's things like, right now, evaluating the use of a sidewalk grinder so we can take care of a lot of the obstructions that have been reported both by residents as well as the data that was collected as part of this project.

356
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:46,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can probably take care of a lot of those in-house with just grinding down the panel.

357
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:49,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one thing that I'm trying to do.

358
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:58,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I am also trying to talk strategy about our highway department and how to get them the resources that they need.

359
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:03,748
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, we're looking at a used spreader machine so we can do greenhouse paving.

360
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started doing greenhouse patching

361
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:12,533
[SPEAKER_05]: but we're doing it by hand, so I'm looking at getting equipment so we can even become more efficient at that.

362
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:18,715
[SPEAKER_05]: That strategy is slower, and we also know we have the immediate need of sidewalk repair work to do.

363
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:20,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So in my mind, it's really both.

364
00:27:20,776 --> 00:27:23,977
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing in-house strategy and figuring out the best way to do

365
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:53,402
[SPEAKER_05]: to do that and grow that and then in the meantime we know we have these 1700 locations and we have this data that tells us where we need to be so we're basically ready to go with the locations and maybe you can talk more about the specific locations with a contractor to do you know the one million over two years really try to get as many locations as we can resolve so that's that's you know the the pitch I'm making with that

366
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:54,646
[SPEAKER_05]: that piece.

367
00:27:55,587 --> 00:28:04,233
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, the last bond, we were able to do about 220 to 250 locations per year.

368
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:09,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And this year, we anticipate that that number will probably go down due

369
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:21,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, that's why we have roughly, I think the studies said we have around 2100 locations to do within the city.

370
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:28,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we're, you know, this heat map basically helps us prioritize those.

371
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:34,156
[SPEAKER_14]: So first, thank you for coming out tonight.

372
00:28:34,316 --> 00:28:37,758
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that first I want to thank Chief of Staff Nazarian.

373
00:28:38,078 --> 00:28:45,902
[SPEAKER_14]: I had some questions last week and I've been championing a sidewalk hot top crew for, I think, since the year I started.

374
00:28:47,322 --> 00:29:01,509
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that until we do that, and it's good to hear that we're trying to find some equipment and have some onsite with our staff, but until we do that, even if we catch up, if we don't have, this isn't ongoing,

375
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:07,727
[SPEAKER_14]: year round as soon as the week that the cement is is mixed and we can stop pouring cement.

376
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:11,209
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to, it's just going to continue no you know as well as I do.

377
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:25,419
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm glad to see that we're trying something I, I, you know, I did talk to the mayor and I know we have some budget concerns coming up and I know it's difficult hiring a whole new crew, but it's something that when

378
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:31,253
[SPEAKER_14]: keep coming to us and the city keeps coming to us and asking for $250,000 million.

379
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:34,235
[SPEAKER_14]: It's frustrating, and I'm sure you can understand that.

380
00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:38,058
[SPEAKER_14]: It's frustrating because this isn't an issue that just happened this year.

381
00:29:38,658 --> 00:29:40,699
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't this is something that's been going on for years.

382
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:50,766
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I've always been taught to think ahead and try to find a way, not only to try to fix the solution, but make sure we stay ahead of that, that that's that problem as we move forward.

383
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:55,429
[SPEAKER_14]: So, those are my concerns and my questions I think that with that.

384
00:29:55,993 --> 00:30:02,496
[SPEAKER_14]: The other concerns I had were the fact that unfortunately the procurement system is that has to go out to bed.

385
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:16,581
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I fear, and working municipality I get a different advantage by talking to colleagues that I work with and understanding the lack of true contractors that are out there.

386
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:30,341
[SPEAKER_14]: that aren't busy that aren't working that can do masonry work that that's a piece that I'm hoping we have licensed masons or people that work with cement I hear in some communities that

387
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:40,732
[SPEAKER_14]: they're bidding out to landscapers, and they're making big bucks because they can bid for an easy, an easy buck because no one else is bidding for them.

388
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:47,960
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I just, we just want to make sure that we're, we're handling that the correct way and making sure that we're staying on top of that.

389
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:49,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Because again,

390
00:30:50,522 --> 00:30:58,366
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a crew that comes out there and uses the wrong mix or pours it the wrong way or whatnot and slopes it the wrong way.

391
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:04,349
[SPEAKER_14]: And now it's turned into a rain issue in someone's neighborhood or someone's property.

392
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:19,197
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are concerns that it's comical that people just listen to your concerns that you want to express as a council that constituents have asked for and said, shame on you for not wanting to fix sidewalks.

393
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:23,785
[SPEAKER_14]: you'd be a fool not to want to fix sidewalks, okay?

394
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I think everybody here wants that done.

395
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:36,192
[SPEAKER_14]: I think making sure that all of our questions are answered and we're putting the best foot forward, which I think the assessment's a great, great step.

396
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:42,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that I've talked to the mayor and people, from what I gather, we're looking at the most needy

397
00:31:43,857 --> 00:31:58,745
[SPEAKER_14]: sidewalks where most dangerous sidewalks correct it's not going to be people aren't going to jump because somebody calls from one side of the city or not and everything wants to get done in front of this person's house of that we're going to we're going to track we're going to go after the number one sidewalks.

398
00:31:59,667 --> 00:31:59,987
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

399
00:32:00,007 --> 00:32:04,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're still going to track the links coming in, and that's not going to change.

400
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:08,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do cross-reference that list or the spreadsheet for this one.

401
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:12,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if we get it more than once, that's logged in the spreadsheet as well.

402
00:32:13,381 --> 00:32:16,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So we try to capture everything in the DPW that comes in.

403
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:22,550
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is a whole new set of data that really allows us to hone in on not just the dangerous,

404
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:31,418
[SPEAKER_05]: most dangerous areas, but the areas that have the most pedestrian traffic, and then we want to focus on as a representative of the public.

405
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:39,099
[SPEAKER_05]: The long term plan in my mind as the DPW commissioner is to do just what you explained.

406
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,941
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just much, it's a longer arc.

407
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:46,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am a new person at the helm at DPW.

408
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:56,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think hopefully you've seen what I've tried to do in engineering is sort of steer the ship towards making sure that our data is backing up the work that we're doing.

409
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:17,923
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think a lot of people are familiar with the assessments at this point, you know, really to keep ahead of ourselves, to match the deterioration rate with the work that we need to put into it, whether it's in-house or contract, you know, the estimates are about two and a half million dollars worth of effort annually.

410
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:23,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So the half a million dollars that we're talking about is just a piece of a much bigger puzzle.

411
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:26,528
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to, in my opinion, we're going to need to be

412
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:36,688
[SPEAKER_05]: building our in-house capacity, as well as doing contract work for many years to catch up with ourselves and to get the 1700 locations down.

413
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,403
[SPEAKER_05]: and to make sure we're focusing our attention and our resources on the hotspots located on this map.

414
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:49,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's what I'm really focused on that piece.

415
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:50,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I appreciate that.

416
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,848
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is why this meeting is so important.

417
00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:54,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate you coming out tonight.

418
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:59,492
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that the last piece is, in the past, we've asked for lists.

419
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:01,253
[SPEAKER_14]: We've asked, just tell us.

420
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:07,520
[SPEAKER_14]: The proof is in the pudding people want to see so when they when we would ask in the past can we have a list.

421
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:16,190
[SPEAKER_14]: It was daunting so I'm glad to see that we have this assessment that we can, we can actually now chart and follow the data as we're taking them off.

422
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:22,457
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know I talked to the mayor and she said that that's not going to be a difficult task now we can now be informed.

423
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:51,426
[SPEAKER_14]: of you know maybe monthly updates saying this is what we did and this is where we're going so it gives us a good understanding what what's getting done so we can actually see it and you know we you know the question a lot of times in the past um is we just bonded 250 000 and it doesn't seem like we've done anything well it was tough for us to say well look at this area this year because we didn't know so i think that it's important that we get that data as well

424
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:53,748
[SPEAKER_05]: You are highlighting a very important point.

425
00:34:53,788 --> 00:34:57,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that we want to provide that information.

426
00:34:57,171 --> 00:35:02,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that I don't want to speak alone, but I've just been around this sort of work for a while.

427
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:11,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think in previous years, because the engineering office has done a lot of resident engineer work for this project in prior years, there's

428
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:26,313
[SPEAKER_05]: uh this desire to want to get it all done and there's a desire to satisfy the squeaky wheel so to speak and those are very strong desires so i think what has happened in the past is we

429
00:35:26,726 --> 00:35:30,347
[SPEAKER_05]: don't always know where the resources are going to be focused.

430
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:40,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Necessarily, we have this great list, we have inspections in the field, and we have the anecdotal and the institutional knowledge, that's what we're going by, right?

431
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:45,133
[SPEAKER_05]: This time, it's like I was saying, and that it's really the point I want to keep highlighting, it's different this time, and I think if

432
00:35:46,689 --> 00:36:02,660
[SPEAKER_05]: know we're doing it the way we'd like to do it and focusing on the data and approaching in that way it will be much easier for us to provide something like monthly updates here's what we did this month here's what we're planning on doing next month that's something that i think we can definitely if we can make that to a motion that'd be

433
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:11,203
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, to ask for the DPW commissioner for once this project had started, even for a monthly update, that would be great.

434
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,024
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll end on a personal note.

435
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:19,187
[SPEAKER_14]: I kid you not, as I'm walking in here, fellow counselors heard my wife call me crying.

436
00:36:21,648 --> 00:36:26,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Avid runner, marathon runner, going for a nightly run, raised sidewalk,

437
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:35,385
[SPEAKER_14]: hit their foot, hit the top of the race sidewalk, and now my daughter's taking her to the doctor.

438
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:41,990
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is stuff that, this is what you wish, as we're going through, it's that important.

439
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,312
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure I'm just one case.

440
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:48,595
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's imperative that we need to get these sidewalks fixed.

441
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:50,797
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to focus on our infrastructure.

442
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:53,359
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a vital piece of our community.

443
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,019
[SPEAKER_14]: We all know that.

444
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,402
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and again, the questions I brought up in last week's

445
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:03,022
[SPEAKER_14]: meeting where I think very valid and appreciate the answers.

446
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:16,925
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that between the chief of staff, the mayor, and two fine gentlemen in front of us, I think that I'm satisfied with what direction we're moving into, and I hope we see some real movement, and I appreciate that.

447
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:17,585
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

448
00:37:24,831 --> 00:37:25,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

449
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:29,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to Commissioner McGibbon the other day, and

450
00:37:31,263 --> 00:37:36,444
[SPEAKER_02]: made the faux pas that I thought he'd been around for like a decade because of how much work he's done in the last three or four years.

451
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:41,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have big shoes to fill, but I'm just mentioning that to somebody else.

452
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:43,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm confident that you will.

453
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:55,487
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to follow up on actually one of Councillor Scarpelli's questions, one of the things we were talking about last month was trying to get this out a little early, you know, get the first reading done in April so we could try to get bids and procurement out.

454
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:59,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that happened or are we waiting for this third reading to start the procurement process?

455
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:02,621
[SPEAKER_05]: You wanna answer?

456
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:08,866
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been procured and we did receive some bids and they're high, like Owen was mentioning.

457
00:38:08,926 --> 00:38:13,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So those bids do reflect the inflation.

458
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way that we would do that is work with the contractor.

459
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:21,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, sorry.

460
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:25,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Qualified bidders though, Tim, are we getting qualified construction companies?

461
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:28,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get that detail, but I know you and Marco did it.

462
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:28,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

463
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:29,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

464
00:38:30,403 --> 00:38:30,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

465
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:31,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

466
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:31,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

467
00:38:31,764 --> 00:38:33,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you both.

468
00:38:33,705 --> 00:38:34,545
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're fine.

469
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:37,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So that leads into my next question.

470
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:39,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously going to support this.

471
00:38:39,348 --> 00:38:40,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's good.

472
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:44,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I think whatever work we can do to try to at least stay afloat, right?

473
00:38:45,211 --> 00:38:46,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Not keep things from getting worse.

474
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:52,154
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sometimes maybe the best we can do with the limited conditions that we have right now.

475
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:55,196
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I recall,

476
00:38:56,485 --> 00:39:04,849
[SPEAKER_02]: we had, and I'm just trying to remember the numbers in my head, you probably have them in yours, the $100 million backlog, that was streets and sidewalks together, correct?

477
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:13,513
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 51, as of 2021, there's reports state that it was 51 plus million in resurfacing work for roadways.

478
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:19,336
[SPEAKER_03]: The sidewalks are around 31 plus, closer to 32 million backlog.

479
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:20,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, okay, thank you.

480
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:23,337
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 31 numbers what I was looking for.

481
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:46,996
[SPEAKER_05]: know and do we expect that those numbers have increased since 2021 just with the inflation and yeah there's a conservative numbers when they do these types of reports yeah but yeah we're starting to approach that sort of getting close to that conservative number just based on cost materials okay great uh well terrible but but but it's good to have the information yeah um so

482
00:39:48,187 --> 00:39:51,448
[SPEAKER_02]: You said the 2.5 million a year, that's what we're kind of trying to piece together.

483
00:39:51,468 --> 00:40:03,493
[SPEAKER_02]: This was going to be 500,000, you know, just doing the math in my head, how long is it going to take us at current investment levels to get to a state of good repair?

484
00:40:04,854 --> 00:40:16,198
[SPEAKER_05]: This sidewalk is tougher to answer that question because we didn't have a full condition index economic analysis that we did with the pavement, which really laid it out in that report.

485
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:17,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Sidewalks, that,

486
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,459
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have that type of work done.

487
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:30,361
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, half a million dollars a year of just contract work obviously is not going to cut it.

488
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:41,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be some combination, and I don't know what the combination is, of in-house work and contract work for a while to get to a place where we don't have backlog anymore.

489
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:42,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how long that will take.

490
00:40:43,204 --> 00:40:43,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

491
00:40:43,704 --> 00:40:46,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the honesty and the directness.

492
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:53,575
[SPEAKER_02]: know, again, you've heard me make this point a million times before and I'm just going to make it again for the sake of making it.

493
00:40:54,616 --> 00:40:56,097
[SPEAKER_02]: People are getting hurt on the sidewalks.

494
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:08,511
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that there's a sidewalk problem, we know the reason of decades of disinvestment in sidewalks, we know how important it is to have good high quality sidewalks and streets for people to be safe for all modes of transportation for

495
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:13,784
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the issues with collisions and crashes and injuries that happen on streets and sidewalks.

496
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:21,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevermind that we are also probably have liability exposure on things like that, as we know from some of the cases that have come against the city.

497
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really do think it's imperative.

498
00:41:23,972 --> 00:41:27,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And this obviously is not in your purview, but I'm just saying it anyway.

499
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:40,792
[SPEAKER_02]: That, you know, this council and the city administration come up with a plan to significantly invest in the backlogs of capital needs this community has, I think this community is ready for it I hear people asking for it I hear people.

500
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:49,055
[SPEAKER_02]: from all across the political spectrum all the time saying what's wrong with our roads what's wrong with our sidewalks what's wrong with our high school why don't we have a fire headquarters.

501
00:41:49,755 --> 00:42:04,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that if we all came together across, you know, different political beliefs different different, you know, voting groups that we could come up with a package and a plan that the people of this community would support to address those long term needs and get us on a good footing.

502
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:13,304
[SPEAKER_02]: where we can actually start to think about the go forward basis and keeping things in good repair, not thinking about how long it's gonna take us just to get there.

503
00:42:13,604 --> 00:42:21,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I'm gonna support this tonight, but I think it's pretty clear that we have a lot more investment and a lot more work to do in the long run.

504
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:24,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna keep making that point from this seat.

505
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:32,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that all of our colleagues in city government will come together and help us with that.

506
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

507
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:33,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

508
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:34,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

509
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:34,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

510
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:35,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

511
00:42:35,357 --> 00:42:35,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

512
00:42:35,577 --> 00:42:35,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

513
00:42:35,877 --> 00:42:36,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

514
00:42:36,818 --> 00:42:37,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

515
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:37,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

516
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:38,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

517
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:38,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

518
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:40,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

519
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:41,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

520
00:42:41,381 --> 00:42:41,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

521
00:42:41,641 --> 00:42:41,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

522
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:42,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

523
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:42,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

524
00:42:42,662 --> 00:42:43,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

525
00:42:43,342 --> 00:42:44,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

526
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:45,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

527
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:45,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

528
00:42:45,484 --> 00:42:45,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

529
00:43:02,092 --> 00:43:04,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, yeah.

530
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:14,294
[SPEAKER_03]: So, to repeat, basically, we typically do around 220 to 250 locations a year.

531
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:19,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And this year, due to inflation, we're expecting probably a little bit less than that, like on the lower end.

532
00:43:19,996 --> 00:43:26,797
[SPEAKER_01]: So, how many, how many reds, how many, how many panels are in that red group there?

533
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:28,733
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the location.

534
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:36,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way that this was mapped out on visually, well, the way that it was mapped out was on segments of roadway.

535
00:43:36,936 --> 00:43:39,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of those segments are one location.

536
00:43:39,557 --> 00:43:40,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes there's two.

537
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:42,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So on average, it's plus one.

538
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,900
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, you know, that's times 200.

539
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So those.

540
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

541
00:43:49,841 --> 00:43:52,682
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I say, how much, how much of the rate are we going to get done this year?

542
00:43:53,562 --> 00:43:55,063
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to, are we going to cut that rate in half?

543
00:43:56,525 --> 00:44:02,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot more red than... I see, I see there's an awful lot of red there.

544
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:12,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Three to four years ago, I brought in the company that wanted to do sidewalk grinding here and we kind of let it, no one ever contacted them and along with the company,

545
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:18,585
[SPEAKER_01]: that that ground and ground and build the car, the asphalt right on on site.

546
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:28,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So as they as they ground they put it back on and, you know, we could probably get, you know, on secondary roads, and we could probably be paving two streets for the price of one.

547
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:33,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And again that and I say that was brought in and it kind of went kind of went no way I know.

548
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:35,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I know.

549
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where it is now but I said that was brought in seven years ago.

550
00:44:39,183 --> 00:44:39,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And again,

551
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:43,764
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't say didn't know it didn't materialize that there's a better way.

552
00:44:44,404 --> 00:44:48,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Also the red priority is also non compliant ADA ramps.

553
00:44:48,545 --> 00:44:52,166
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are, you know, a lot more of a priority to try to fix those first.

554
00:44:52,906 --> 00:44:55,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And I share the same concern, Councilor Scott.

555
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:59,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're late, we're late into the construction season.

556
00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:08,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time this goes out to bid and we bond it, maybe we might be starting in August, maybe July.

557
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:11,506
[SPEAKER_17]: six to eight weeks, it's July.

558
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:12,507
[SPEAKER_01]: July, okay.

559
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:24,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, and I'm concerned about the quality of company that we're gonna be able to attract because everybody's, no matter what city or town you drive through, there's construction going on everywhere.

560
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:29,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, everywhere in this whole state, there's construction.

561
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to be clear, we have bids already.

562
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:32,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

563
00:45:32,402 --> 00:45:32,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

564
00:45:33,243 --> 00:45:34,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And who's gonna be monitoring?

565
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:37,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we gonna have someone on like a,

566
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:39,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhat of a clerk of the works on these?

567
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:41,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

568
00:45:42,022 --> 00:45:43,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And who will that be?

569
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:45,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, an engineer from the engineering office.

570
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:56,113
[SPEAKER_05]: The past couple of years now has been being both resident engineer and sort of design engineer at the same time on this type of work.

571
00:45:56,153 --> 00:46:01,217
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, the design part is helping the contractor figure out the scope of the spot.

572
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:03,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a key panel.

573
00:46:03,478 --> 00:46:07,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just that panel or that one next to it is also not compliant, so let's do that one at the same time.

574
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:14,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have an engineer doing that and we also have an engineer checking quality control and measuring.

575
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:17,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are the two sort of points that we have.

576
00:46:18,285 --> 00:46:24,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in those registries, I'm assuming we're doing those first, if there's a stump there, are we going to be removing the stump at the same time?

577
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:27,468
[SPEAKER_03]: The stumps are in a different.

578
00:46:27,508 --> 00:46:35,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a different, but if one of the stumps is located on the right and they happen to be on the street, are we going to do both at the same time?

579
00:46:36,563 --> 00:46:46,307
[SPEAKER_03]: The stumps are under a different contract that I don't believe was analyzed.

580
00:46:46,327 --> 00:46:47,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what you're saying.

581
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:55,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to try to find those synergies if we can, but we do have a contract list for stumps.

582
00:46:57,389 --> 00:47:02,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have another list of stumps that's just going to be ground down sidewalk work.

583
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:06,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have this just sidewalk work.

584
00:47:06,294 --> 00:47:11,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So to your point, I would like to find synergies as well with those two overlap.

585
00:47:11,397 --> 00:47:14,379
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not working in the same spot twice.

586
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:18,281
[SPEAKER_05]: But they will be two separate contractors under two separate sets of direction.

587
00:47:18,681 --> 00:47:20,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do have the freedom of leads and methods.

588
00:47:22,088 --> 00:47:30,591
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I think when those times when you say, oh, well, that stump needs to go and it's impairing that sidewalk, we're going to be trying to get that stump out of there.

589
00:47:31,132 --> 00:47:39,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's not something that we can repair correctly, we may not actually do that spot until we can repair it correctly.

590
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:46,578
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you feel that we'll be able to get the 200 panels in by the end of the concrete season?

591
00:47:48,844 --> 00:47:53,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm led to believe that we can do 200 locations if they could stretch that by that far.

592
00:47:56,261 --> 00:47:56,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

593
00:47:58,907 --> 00:47:59,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Other side.

594
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:01,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

595
00:48:02,385 --> 00:48:03,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had two quick questions.

596
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:14,318
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one was, you had mentioned that a lot of these red sites are places with high traffic, for example, with schools, with commercial centers.

597
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:22,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the green line coming in change any of the prioritization for the sidewalks?

598
00:48:23,313 --> 00:48:28,958
[SPEAKER_05]: that was included in this study as a location, a pedestrian desirable location.

599
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:31,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, the simple answer is yes.

600
00:48:31,521 --> 00:48:32,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

601
00:48:32,401 --> 00:48:37,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second short question was, how did we get to the loan order amount of 1 million?

602
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:41,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, was it just because we had done it in the past or?

603
00:48:44,432 --> 00:48:45,653
[SPEAKER_05]: That I do not have an answer yet.

604
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:47,860
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries.

605
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:53,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I just asked because, you know, in times of inflation, it is actually wise to borrow more.

606
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:57,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And because, because of how inflation works.

607
00:48:57,989 --> 00:49:09,098
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was I was just saying, the point I wanted to make was, if we're in the same economic situation next year, nationally, with high inflation, it might be worth borrowing more.

608
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:15,863
[SPEAKER_04]: If, if we're in a similar situation, of course, the ideal is to have it in the city budget and to plan ahead.

609
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:16,163
[SPEAKER_04]: But

610
00:49:16,984 --> 00:49:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the point I wanted to make.

611
00:49:18,185 --> 00:49:22,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I also wanted to just state my kind of view on this issue.

612
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:29,815
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think it's clear that we need greater investment in our infrastructure in the city and I think there's wide political consensus for that.

613
00:49:31,016 --> 00:49:36,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this means bring things in house, so that we are creating

614
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:49,389
[SPEAKER_04]: better jobs, so that we are creating a system that's more reliable and a system that's more accountable for City Council to hold to hold our city accountable.

615
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:56,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I think ultimately this is an issue of accessibility it's an issue of, of equity for different neighborhoods.

616
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:03,277
[SPEAKER_04]: As we can see on that map different neighborhoods have have fallen behind when it comes to infrastructure.

617
00:50:04,077 --> 00:50:31,539
[SPEAKER_04]: um coming over to the city council meeting we saw tons of young people especially using our sidewalk and as a young person you know who just graduated from medford high you know oftentimes we walk from the high school to medford square and you know these are these are routes that we take to go home and it's important that um we all you know we keep that safe and it's not just young people using of course all of our um residents use our sidewalks so i think it's important um that we get started now and i think that's the point that you two are trying to make is

618
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:41,625
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a big challenge ahead of us, but it's really important that we start now, and that we make the investments that will make people's lives tangibly better today.

619
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:48,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's usually, you know, that's the metric I use to determine my votes is, will this vote make residents' lives better?

620
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:54,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you two have created a very compelling presentation as to why that is the case.

621
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:54,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

622
00:50:55,412 --> 00:50:56,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

623
00:50:56,093 --> 00:50:58,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins, then we'll go back to Vice-Chairman Behrs and Councilor Carvalho.

624
00:50:58,955 --> 00:50:59,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

625
00:51:01,128 --> 00:51:04,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Merrill, and thank you so much for being here today and giving us this.

626
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:12,192
[SPEAKER_11]: thorough overview of the work that this bond could help to facilitate.

627
00:51:13,814 --> 00:51:32,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to supporting this tonight I just wanted to say I think that the direction that the DPW and the engineering department is taking us in now, both with the sidewalk improvements roster as well as things like the pavement management plan if I'm getting that name right that was released last year I think that those have been very helpful tools for

628
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:49,397
[SPEAKER_11]: myself as a representative and also for the communities who are sort of trying to get our arms around these as you say multi multi year projects of addressing the backlog kind of trying to chart that arc of how, where do we go from here and how long is it going to take.

629
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:58,806
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, speaking anecdotally you know and when folks reach out to me and say, you know, my street looks like this, when will that get fixed.

630
00:51:59,426 --> 00:52:05,992
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not a task I enjoy to look at the plan and say well you're rated a yellow.

631
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:09,434
[SPEAKER_11]: So unfortunately that means that it's not this year.

632
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:16,280
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a painful thing to have to share at the same time it's helpful, and to go to Vice President bears this point.

633
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:27,977
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it strengthens the case for taking a very thoughtful focused look at how are we going to get to a place where we can sustainably fund capital improvements on a

634
00:52:29,868 --> 00:52:41,076
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, non geologic timescale, and also how we're going to fund a more robust city payroll, so that over time we can bring more and more of this work in house if that's what's best for the community and best for infrastructure.

635
00:52:42,677 --> 00:52:51,604
[SPEAKER_11]: So, thank you again and I think that this, as you say, data driven approaches, very useful for us and at least for me, and metabolizing it and sharing it with the community.

636
00:52:52,725 --> 00:52:53,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

637
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:54,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Behrs.

638
00:52:55,347 --> 00:52:57,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll defer to Councilor Knight, thank you.

639
00:52:57,548 --> 00:52:59,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry, was I repeatedly missing you?

640
00:53:00,991 --> 00:53:02,271
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it was intentional.

641
00:53:02,592 --> 00:53:07,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you were making chitchat.

642
00:53:08,013 --> 00:53:09,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Does the city replace sidewalks on private ways?

643
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:19,696
[SPEAKER_05]: As a matter of policy, I think in the past, the city has done it.

644
00:53:20,817 --> 00:53:25,198
[SPEAKER_05]: There are issues that have to do with sidewalks on private ways.

645
00:53:27,131 --> 00:53:28,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if that answers your question.

646
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:31,075
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's... How about if we make it a yes or no question?

647
00:53:31,796 --> 00:53:36,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving forward, I'd like it to be no, but there has been some precedent that has been set.

648
00:53:37,121 --> 00:53:39,103
[SPEAKER_05]: There has been some expectations that have been set.

649
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:44,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So to peel away from that, I think it's going to take some time.

650
00:53:44,968 --> 00:53:53,633
[SPEAKER_16]: So the intention would be, I guess, moving forward, the city would be moving away from paving private ways, the sidewalks are private ways.

651
00:53:53,834 --> 00:54:09,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's, I'd like to better describe it by finding a policy that is a policy that we have some direction of moving forward on private ways, because right now, for my palate, there's too much gray area on what we should or shouldn't be doing.

652
00:54:10,922 --> 00:54:14,845
[SPEAKER_05]: it in the past, we continue to work forward, especially with maintenance issues.

653
00:54:15,706 --> 00:54:23,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I know public safety wise, we do make improvements to this issue of public safety for sure in private ways, but I think

654
00:54:24,945 --> 00:54:31,609
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's work to be done there to figure out exactly what the city should be doing and what public money should be spent on private ways.

655
00:54:31,629 --> 00:54:39,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that there are options set out in ordinance for folks to do work in private ways.

656
00:54:39,113 --> 00:54:41,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that the city can also do work in private ways.

657
00:54:41,855 --> 00:54:45,697
[SPEAKER_05]: But finding where we should be is the question that I have.

658
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:47,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So unfortunately, it's not yes or no.

659
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:50,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of like, yes, in the past, and there has been work done.

660
00:54:50,681 --> 00:55:00,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's still sort of, yes, moving forward in the future, but as the academic commission, I want to make sure that we're spending public funds in the right places.

661
00:55:00,223 --> 00:55:04,844
[SPEAKER_05]: And that could be privately, I'm not saying it's not, I'm saying that there's a lot of gray area there.

662
00:55:05,205 --> 00:55:07,585
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a definition of that over time.

663
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:11,906
[SPEAKER_16]: In this map with the 1700, or the 2100 sidewalk panels,

664
00:55:19,532 --> 00:55:21,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Does this include private waste in this assessment?

665
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:21,813
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

666
00:55:22,313 --> 00:55:23,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Does not include private waste?

667
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:25,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Just public waste.

668
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:26,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

669
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:28,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

670
00:55:28,697 --> 00:55:29,277
[SPEAKER_05]: City on the street.

671
00:55:29,557 --> 00:55:33,139
[SPEAKER_05]: City full of jurisdiction, so publicly accepted waste.

672
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,342
[SPEAKER_16]: And percentage wise, number of public waste versus private waste that we have in this community?

673
00:55:40,362 --> 00:55:40,342
33%.

674
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:44,465
[SPEAKER_05]: 33%.

675
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:44,465
[SPEAKER_05]: So a third of the streets in this community are private waste?

676
00:55:44,485 --> 00:55:44,825
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot.

677
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:45,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, there's a lot.

678
00:55:54,692 --> 00:56:03,058
[SPEAKER_16]: So, in essence, there would be a third of the streets in this community, if we expend these funds, that would receive no benefit from it, regardless of when we do it, right?

679
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:06,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we're not gonna be paying for private sidewalks going forward for right now.

680
00:56:07,161 --> 00:56:08,923
[SPEAKER_16]: If they're issued as well.

681
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:16,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna say, well, they could, because they don't just live in the private way, they go to the public ways.

682
00:56:16,348 --> 00:56:20,011
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they will experience these funds when they go,

683
00:56:20,591 --> 00:56:21,472
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to the team.

684
00:56:21,532 --> 00:56:29,420
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a community benefit, yeah, but as the person that's said, I'm on the list for 11 years, and then you say it's private way, you're going to be on the list for another 11 years.

685
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had those calls.

686
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:37,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so yeah, I will say that in that transition I was talking about, if there is, I'm not sure if we're staying accessible or not,

687
00:56:38,509 --> 00:56:43,273
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say that I've highlighted some areas that are of concern with public funds in private ways.

688
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that public safety is always there.

689
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:57,863
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we feel that there's a public safety issue with sidewalk repair, that would be something that we would be able to do, spend public funds on it, and not have to worry about that expenditure.

690
00:56:57,964 --> 00:57:02,247
[SPEAKER_16]: And if somebody resides in a private way and they want to replace the sidewalk in front of the house, can they do it?

691
00:57:02,307 --> 00:57:03,868
[SPEAKER_16]: All they have to do is pull a permit from you guys?

692
00:57:03,948 --> 00:57:04,568
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not our problem.

693
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,189
[SPEAKER_05]: They can do it.

694
00:57:05,229 --> 00:57:05,649
[SPEAKER_16]: They can do it.

695
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:07,671
[SPEAKER_16]: Do they even have to pull a permit from you guys?

696
00:57:08,643 --> 00:57:21,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless they're- Not necessarily, not by default.

697
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:26,772
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need approval from the form of the letter.

698
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:27,653
[SPEAKER_05]: We just did one.

699
00:57:30,374 --> 00:57:37,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It does happen, and what I try to be, and as city engineer I try to be as honest with folks that call and want something like that.

700
00:57:37,736 --> 00:57:42,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way that I describe it is that there's multiple paths to get what you'd like to get done.

701
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's our path with the public money in our process.

702
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:56,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you do not like that timeline, then you also have the option, if you have the resources to do it this way, just to make sure everybody understands what all of the options are in the public realm.

703
00:58:03,695 --> 00:58:09,959
[SPEAKER_16]: We have no real assessment on a third of the streets, just with the condition that there's about a third of the streets that are private ways in the community.

704
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:12,120
[SPEAKER_16]: We did no assessment on those Starbucks whatsoever.

705
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:15,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, not the formal assessment.

706
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:16,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Not the formal assessment, okay.

707
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:17,423
[SPEAKER_16]: I like this approach.

708
00:58:17,443 --> 00:58:19,064
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that this is very helpful, you know what I mean?

709
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:20,825
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like we're going to get more bang for our buck, right?

710
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:26,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultimately, it's like the sneakers that we're wearing most of the rubber off of are the ones we're going to replace, right?

711
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:28,770
[SPEAKER_07]: We're focusing the money where it needs to go, right?

712
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I think it makes sense.

713
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:30,771
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?

714
00:58:30,831 --> 00:58:31,651
[SPEAKER_16]: We're getting bang for our buck.

715
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:34,833
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, methodology, which we haven't seen in a long time.

716
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:37,795
[SPEAKER_16]: It's something I've been calling for for a long time, you know, so I appreciate what you're doing.

717
00:58:38,696 --> 00:58:42,718
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we need to really take a look at how we handle private ways in this community.

718
00:58:43,038 --> 00:58:44,119
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not like they pay less taxes.

719
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:45,620
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree.

720
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,361
[SPEAKER_16]: In some most instances, they pay more.

721
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:53,466
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you look at the streets that are private ways and the homes that are on them, right?

722
00:58:54,106 --> 00:58:56,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Bigger houses, bigger lots and the like, right?

723
00:58:56,568 --> 00:59:04,535
[SPEAKER_16]: So we need to wrap our heads around this because the taxpayers in this community should receive the same services regardless of whether or not this street has been publicly or privately accepted.

724
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:06,497
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, that's legal mumbo-jumbo.

725
00:59:06,517 --> 00:59:09,079
[SPEAKER_16]: The regular citizen in this community doesn't care about that.

726
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:14,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, what they care about is the fact that Councilor Beas said, we can disagree on just about everything in this place.

727
00:59:14,663 --> 00:59:18,466
[SPEAKER_16]: The one thing we all agree on is our roads and sidewalks are in bad shape and we need to invest in them.

728
00:59:18,927 --> 00:59:20,548
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, I'm happy to spend this money.

729
00:59:21,369 --> 00:59:22,790
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish there was another zero at the end of it.

730
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:25,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, and I know you guys do too, right?

731
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultimately, at the end of the day, I know you guys do too.

732
00:59:27,915 --> 00:59:29,596
[SPEAKER_16]: In the future, I'm going to call for a meeting.

733
00:59:29,636 --> 00:59:35,720
[SPEAKER_16]: We can start really looking at talking about this private way stuff because, you know, I think that it really needs to be addressed.

734
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,761
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, you guys did a great presentation.

735
00:59:37,801 --> 00:59:38,782
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate your work.

736
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:39,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome aboard.

737
00:59:39,783 --> 00:59:41,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations on your new appointment, maybe permanency.

738
00:59:42,504 --> 00:59:43,105
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

739
00:59:43,145 --> 00:59:46,067
[SPEAKER_16]: You've done a good job and you've proved it, you know what I mean, time and time again when you come up here.

740
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:46,867
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you very much.

741
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:50,590
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate your honesty and openness in answering the questions.

742
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:50,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

743
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

744
00:59:52,231 --> 00:59:54,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, if I could just respond to that.

745
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:56,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I wholeheartedly agree, Councilwoman.

746
00:59:56,554 --> 01:00:05,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that in-house, we talk about private ways, public expenditure, and how best to deal with it on a regular basis, on a day-to-day basis.

747
01:00:06,342 --> 01:00:10,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say that continuing that conversation with the Council are more than happy to do.

748
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:12,466
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you know the answer to this.

749
01:00:12,586 --> 01:00:20,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Does accepting more public ways increase our eligibility or benefits for funding through the state house, maybe?

750
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:23,549
[SPEAKER_05]: It does, yeah, Chapter 90.

751
01:00:24,009 --> 01:00:27,530
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the, we're not supposed to specify aid on private ways, it's illegal, right?

752
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:28,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the issues.

753
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:33,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, but if we turn these private ways into public ways, do we get more money too?

754
01:00:34,332 --> 01:00:35,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

755
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:39,314
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very easy to say that, and I think that we do,

756
01:00:40,022 --> 01:00:45,206
[SPEAKER_05]: have a very good idea of what needs to happen to get more private ways into the public sector.

757
01:00:45,686 --> 01:00:48,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just from an administrative type of work.

758
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:50,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big chunk of work.

759
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Polls and levies involved.

760
01:00:52,511 --> 01:00:56,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe there's no levies, maybe there's city benefits provided or something.

761
01:00:57,434 --> 01:00:59,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all the title owners need to agree

762
01:01:00,717 --> 01:01:03,720
[SPEAKER_05]: with what's going on, I think it's more than 50%.

763
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,902
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a process, right?

764
01:01:04,922 --> 01:01:06,824
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole process involved.

765
01:01:06,844 --> 01:01:14,913
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hopefully very soon, Freedomway and Steamroller Drive will be in front of this body for public acceptance, and that is a transfer.

766
01:01:19,246 --> 01:01:23,568
[SPEAKER_05]: that was, I wouldn't say onerous, but you know, heavy on the administrative tasks.

767
01:01:24,068 --> 01:01:31,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're talking about private ways that are owned by potentially hundreds of other individuals, you got to get 50% of the people in the street to agree to do it.

768
01:01:31,152 --> 01:01:34,954
[SPEAKER_16]: You got to get seven, you got to get four here to agree to the five here to agree to this.

769
01:01:34,974 --> 01:01:35,674
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's not enough.

770
01:01:35,694 --> 01:01:37,155
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have to stay where you're coming from.

771
01:01:50,141 --> 01:01:56,062
[SPEAKER_05]: both the planning board and this council would need to be okay with accepting a public waiver.

772
01:01:56,302 --> 01:01:57,983
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really broad topic.

773
01:01:58,063 --> 01:02:01,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, let's forget about that until I bring it up later on, because I think we're getting way off track.

774
01:02:01,624 --> 01:02:02,204
[SPEAKER_16]: No problem.

775
01:02:02,324 --> 01:02:06,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I just love talking.

776
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:08,065
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an helpful outline of it.

777
01:02:08,745 --> 01:02:10,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Just two follow up questions.

778
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:14,687
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 33% of the streets, but do we know what a percent of the mileage are private ways?

779
01:02:16,336 --> 01:02:18,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little less than three miles.

780
01:02:18,921 --> 01:02:20,063
[SPEAKER_02]: A little less than three.

781
01:02:20,143 --> 01:02:21,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's our total?

782
01:02:21,385 --> 01:02:22,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now it's around...

783
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:27,873
[SPEAKER_03]: in my head, I have it at like 8.4, but I don't want to keep that up.

784
01:02:27,993 --> 01:02:30,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So that 33% is actually close to a mileage.

785
01:02:31,035 --> 01:02:34,838
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the number of streets, it's actually the mileage of ways.

786
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:37,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to follow up and give you the correct information.

787
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:41,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's right.

788
01:02:41,463 --> 01:02:41,563
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

789
01:02:41,703 --> 01:02:42,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

790
01:02:42,243 --> 01:02:42,704
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.

791
01:02:42,724 --> 01:02:48,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that's just, you know, I'm trying to find, you know, you have the number of streets, but some of the streets are this long and some of them are this long versus the mileage.

792
01:02:49,229 --> 01:02:50,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

793
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:52,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm way off, actually.

794
01:02:53,397 --> 01:02:53,798
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

795
01:02:53,998 --> 01:02:55,138
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm putting you on the spot.

796
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

797
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,221
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we'll get the right answer.

798
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:02,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my second question is kind of a similar one.

799
01:03:02,602 --> 01:03:06,064
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about the 200 locations, do you have that measured out?

800
01:03:06,544 --> 01:03:12,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand maybe they haven't entirely all been selected yet, but could you give that number in linear feet or mileage?

801
01:03:14,088 --> 01:03:15,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Or could you give that to us going forward?

802
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:35,858
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about what a location is, and a location can be anything from one panel to half a dozen panels, probably on average two to three.

803
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:47,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Another reason why I like that monthly report idea better than providing a list of funds is because we may end up on a street doing one location, and then 10 feet away, that wasn't on the list.

804
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,361
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't on this.

805
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:51,441
[SPEAKER_05]: While we're here, we should do whatever.

806
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,786
[SPEAKER_05]: There's quite a bit of that that happens.

807
01:03:55,666 --> 01:04:03,369
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes we'll make the choice on the spot that day to go to that one day.

808
01:04:03,449 --> 01:04:07,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Even maybe across the street, sometimes we'll say, boy, this whole block is bad.

809
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:10,692
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do a lot sometimes.

810
01:04:11,412 --> 01:04:15,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so I don't think we have a specified location list at this point.

811
01:04:15,514 --> 01:04:15,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we, Ellen?

812
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a list of specified locations at this point?

813
01:04:20,175 --> 01:04:20,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just general areas?

814
01:04:21,016 --> 01:04:21,516
[SPEAKER_05]: General areas.

815
01:04:22,941 --> 01:04:24,563
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, in the month of the report, that would be great.

816
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:30,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd just be great to take the metric of a location, which is variable, and put it into a standardized metric that we can.

817
01:04:30,749 --> 01:04:32,491
[SPEAKER_02]: We did half a mile of sidewalks this year.

818
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:33,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

819
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:35,394
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be valuable to me.

820
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:36,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can think about it.

821
01:04:36,475 --> 01:04:39,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, I think, a more awesome way to report metrics.

822
01:04:40,539 --> 01:04:40,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

823
01:04:42,701 --> 01:04:43,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thanks.

824
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:45,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I will stop belaboring the point at this point.

825
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:47,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Kerrio.

826
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:47,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

827
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:55,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is there going to be a separate company grinding the low-priority sidewalks, or the same company going to be doing all the same thing?

828
01:04:56,054 --> 01:05:00,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not have the answer to that, I'm sorry.

829
01:05:00,697 --> 01:05:02,598
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be good.

830
01:05:02,658 --> 01:05:13,043
[SPEAKER_01]: And I live in a private way, and again, I don't know what it gets me, but back in the 70s and the 80s, before a lot of people were even born in this room,

831
01:05:14,538 --> 01:05:19,222
[SPEAKER_01]: The city used to give you half the money to pay the street.

832
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:37,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember my, I was where I live, we have like, it was like four or five streets and think I paid about $800 and all the neighbors, you know, we had a counselor and I said that there was a contentious means to get to get 20 people to agree to pay the money but I don't know if that's something that you know.

833
01:05:38,429 --> 01:05:42,212
[SPEAKER_01]: If people, I think that the council actually eliminated that.

834
01:05:42,492 --> 01:05:42,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

835
01:05:42,853 --> 01:05:44,914
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember the policy at one point in time.

836
01:05:45,054 --> 01:05:49,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Same thing where all the neighbors chipped in.

837
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:50,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we all chipped in.

838
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:51,299
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I think, I think I paid about $800.

839
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we all pay about $800 a piece.

840
01:05:53,982 --> 01:05:56,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did like four, four small streets.

841
01:05:57,104 --> 01:05:59,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, now, now they're ready to be done again.

842
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:04,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but as I was curious to see if you have anybody that's going to be, you know, just doing the grinding.

843
01:06:05,147 --> 01:06:09,294
[SPEAKER_01]: on the low priority, if it's going to be the same company or a separate company?

844
01:06:09,314 --> 01:06:19,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, I'm exploring right now buying a grinder, a small grinder machine just for sidewalks for the DBW and do some training and seeing if we can do

845
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:25,816
[SPEAKER_05]: those types of just a heap panel and grind off the top to reduce the tributing hazard.

846
01:06:26,056 --> 01:06:31,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of like busting out the entire panel, pouring a new panel, we could take care of a lot of locations.

847
01:06:31,538 --> 01:06:42,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Just having an in-house grinding machine and not contracting out, just doing that piece in-house, because that's buying a machine, doing some training and working it into the schedule, as opposed to a whole other contract.

848
01:06:43,923 --> 01:06:46,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should be doing that in-house anyway.

849
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:49,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we talked about doing sidewalks in private ways,

850
01:06:50,952 --> 01:06:54,613
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of residents are going to be a little shocked to find out how much property they don't have.

851
01:06:55,294 --> 01:07:00,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Because over the years, you know, you've sort of taken your lawn and sort of kept on growing out toward the street.

852
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:08,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when you want to say if they at some point they want to come in and take a sidewalk, you can see how many walls and driveways are going to be

853
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:10,166
[SPEAKER_01]: coming down.

854
01:07:11,647 --> 01:07:13,528
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should make people aware of that.

855
01:07:13,548 --> 01:07:31,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, you know, be saying not a hard no, no, no night right is me sort of saying that there's a lot of work to do this and try to figure out we really need some sort of a policy when it comes to you have to put curbs and you get up a curb and so is down on those streets that don't have them anymore.

856
01:07:31,435 --> 01:07:34,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the city has an interest in ways we have rights within private ways.

857
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:47,137
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a question of, and I don't have the answer, where do you draw the line when it comes to public interest and public safety and landowner rights of the owners of the land and how that

858
01:07:47,644 --> 01:07:54,288
[SPEAKER_05]: interplay works, and then add in the factor of, okay, now we want to spend public money on that private land.

859
01:07:54,548 --> 01:07:55,308
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that look like?

860
01:07:55,348 --> 01:07:58,510
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are our boundaries and constraints when we do that?

861
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And making sure we have that all worked out.

862
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:04,353
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, it's past practice, and there are ways that we have been doing things.

863
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:07,494
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not stopping that in its tracks.

864
01:08:07,595 --> 01:08:08,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that would work at all.

865
01:08:10,576 --> 01:08:13,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the, I would say the majority of the private ways don't have sidewalks.

866
01:08:14,197 --> 01:08:27,600
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see a sidewalk here and there on the, but the bulk of them don't have the, but I say, when you go to look at that, you can see a lot of unhappy neighbors when they come to find out where their land really is.

867
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,900
[SPEAKER_01]: When you've taken that lead way over the years, you know, it's just.

868
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:36,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they feel empowered though too, is now they realize that, oh, I could do this without city involvement.

869
01:08:36,622 --> 01:08:37,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

870
01:08:40,145 --> 01:08:41,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

871
01:08:41,886 --> 01:08:43,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have one question.

872
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:44,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

873
01:08:45,327 --> 01:08:45,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Apologies.

874
01:08:45,907 --> 01:08:53,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, um, you mentioned that the thank you both for being here, by the way, that 88 compliant sidewalks being the highest priorities.

875
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:55,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that include so you said?

876
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:56,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, non compliant.

877
01:08:56,752 --> 01:08:59,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So is that just ramps that exist that are non compliant?

878
01:08:59,193 --> 01:09:02,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there spaces where there should be curb cuts also in that?

879
01:09:02,134 --> 01:09:05,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe they're both animals.

880
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:09,981
[SPEAKER_09]: and did those places, I'm asking, I mean, I'm keenly focused on this.

881
01:09:10,001 --> 01:09:19,949
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at past resolutions, this is something I'm focused on, but as someone now who pushes a stroller around this city, hopping curbs in a stroller or any mobility device, anything like that is not fun.

882
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:23,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just curious about curb cuts, just personally.

883
01:09:24,733 --> 01:09:27,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So this contract is for repair.

884
01:09:27,515 --> 01:09:29,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so it wouldn't be anything new?

885
01:09:29,197 --> 01:09:29,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

886
01:09:29,697 --> 01:09:30,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

887
01:09:31,657 --> 01:09:33,979
[SPEAKER_03]: know, working on other avenues for this.

888
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:34,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

889
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

890
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:44,388
[SPEAKER_04]: The director mentioned in response to Councilor Kerrio-Villa's question that you guys might be looking at getting an in-house grinder.

891
01:09:44,408 --> 01:09:47,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what the timeline on that might look like?

892
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:50,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that be something within the next year, within a few years?

893
01:09:52,080 --> 01:10:01,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a relatively low-cost piece of equipment, so I'm hoping to have something, potentially even later this season.

894
01:10:01,525 --> 01:10:12,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing the research to try to figure out what model to get, talking to the crew about what the capacity they have for learning it, putting it into the schedule, things like that.

895
01:10:13,212 --> 01:10:14,712
[SPEAKER_05]: But things are looking pretty good so far.

896
01:10:14,812 --> 01:10:18,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Lights are showing green, so I'm just gonna keep plugging down that app.

897
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:20,736
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as priorities go,

898
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:34,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, I share the priority of getting our pavement house in order, and I think continuing to work with our capacities of common haves.

899
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:41,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this seems to be like a low-hanging fruit to me, to get something like that in-house so we can get work done.

900
01:10:41,768 --> 01:10:46,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say sooner rather than later, it's a matter of making sure I understand how much

901
01:10:47,855 --> 01:10:55,863
[SPEAKER_05]: one costs new and doing the procurement correctly and making sure that the guys can get trained and I don't want to get it too early, I don't want to get it too late.

902
01:10:56,184 --> 01:11:00,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So finding that sweet spot, making sure that when we buy it, it goes into operation.

903
01:11:01,149 --> 01:11:02,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully on day one, ideally.

904
01:11:02,831 --> 01:11:04,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to time it.

905
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:12,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, and that would that would also affect the which roads go out for which sidewalks go first right because yeah.

906
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:13,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

907
01:11:13,637 --> 01:11:22,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that's really a tripping hazard type piece of equipment so panel shifts, I'm just going to grind off the top of it and make it a compliant tripping hazard.

908
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:25,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you so much.

909
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:31,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this presentation, you know, in addition to answering our questions, also answers a bunch of questions from viewers at home.

910
01:11:32,335 --> 01:11:40,921
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of folks at home are watching, and I think, you know, your presentation was very well put together, very compelling, and thank you for coming to City Council today.

911
01:11:42,122 --> 01:11:42,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

912
01:11:42,802 --> 01:11:43,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

913
01:11:43,643 --> 01:11:46,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, I move for approval of paper 22317 and 22318.

914
01:11:47,005 --> 01:11:50,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to make sure that that's for third reading.

915
01:11:52,913 --> 01:11:55,955
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do have a B paper from Councilor Scarpelli if you want to take that first.

916
01:11:55,995 --> 01:12:02,299
[SPEAKER_09]: So the B paper was to ask DPW Commissioner for a monthly update on progress or just- That's correct.

917
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:02,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

918
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:07,102
[SPEAKER_14]: It's understandable to the- Yes, I agree to that.

919
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:07,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

920
01:12:07,983 --> 01:12:09,124
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be nice, that'll be helpful.

921
01:12:09,144 --> 01:12:10,024
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you.

922
01:12:10,304 --> 01:12:14,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the B paper from Councilor Scarpelli, the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by-

923
01:12:16,268 --> 01:12:17,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

924
01:12:17,388 --> 01:12:18,929
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

925
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:20,309
[SPEAKER_09]: The paper passes.

926
01:12:20,989 --> 01:12:23,330
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor... I don't have this page, that's why.

927
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:29,372
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve for a third reading, papers 22-317 and 22-318.

928
01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:31,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice-Chair Stephens.

929
01:12:32,032 --> 01:12:33,653
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are going to do that, I do have a question on 22-318.

930
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:38,371
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think they need to be separate roll calls for third reading.

931
01:12:38,391 --> 01:12:38,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

932
01:12:38,651 --> 01:12:41,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you wanna take the vote on 22-317 first?

933
01:12:42,253 --> 01:12:42,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

934
01:12:42,533 --> 01:12:46,314
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to approve for third reading 22-317.

935
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:46,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

936
01:12:47,595 --> 01:12:48,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Second by Councilor Carviello.

937
01:12:48,775 --> 01:12:50,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

938
01:12:57,662 --> 01:12:58,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President bears.

939
01:12:58,362 --> 01:12:58,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

940
01:12:59,523 --> 01:13:00,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Carroll.

941
01:13:00,283 --> 01:13:00,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

942
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:01,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

943
01:13:01,964 --> 01:13:02,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

944
01:13:02,944 --> 01:13:03,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor night.

945
01:13:03,724 --> 01:13:03,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

946
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:05,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

947
01:13:05,165 --> 01:13:05,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

948
01:13:05,905 --> 01:13:07,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor saying yes, President Morrell.

949
01:13:07,866 --> 01:13:10,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven in front of zero in the negative the motion passes.

950
01:13:11,448 --> 01:13:19,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And then to to dash 318 vice president bears you have a question on this paper, which is eligible for third reading is the loan order for stump removal bonds.

951
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:20,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

952
01:13:20,211 --> 01:13:21,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

953
01:13:22,978 --> 01:13:28,402
[SPEAKER_02]: when we, this is presented in April, Chief of Staff Nazarian said that this would address 95% of the stumps in the city.

954
01:13:29,123 --> 01:13:33,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, we've had some kind of ongoing issues with the stump dump.

955
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chief of staff said that none of these stumps would end up in the stump dump.

956
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:41,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just wanna make sure from you folks that both of those facts are still true.

957
01:13:51,483 --> 01:13:54,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the contractors are moving them they're not going into the stuff.

958
01:13:55,086 --> 01:14:02,393
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the 95% question is that is that wrote, is it going to address 95% of the stumps that are currently in the city.

959
01:14:02,413 --> 01:14:09,199
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what she said she is on the line.

960
01:14:09,239 --> 01:14:09,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.

961
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:15,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

962
01:14:15,987 --> 01:14:18,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, President morale and members of the council.

963
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:24,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to our dbw commissioner and our city engineer for the work on the prior item.

964
01:14:25,372 --> 01:14:33,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President bears to answer your question I have further clarification since the last meeting that there's some variation between

965
01:14:34,508 --> 01:14:36,350
[SPEAKER_10]: the work that's conducted for stumps.

966
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:50,302
[SPEAKER_10]: In particular, I've learned that stumps that are not in sidewalks that are not surrounded by concrete are significantly less costly to remove than those that are surrounded by concrete and I think DPW Commissioner

967
01:14:50,742 --> 01:14:54,784
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if Commissioner McGivern could speak to that further if there are further questions.

968
01:14:55,685 --> 01:14:59,887
[SPEAKER_10]: My understanding is there's a there's a material cost divide between the two.

969
01:15:00,488 --> 01:15:12,395
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a result, we're going to work to focus on stumps that are kind of as has been stated some of the easier stumps to remove that would be, um in areas that are not necessarily impacted.

970
01:15:12,435 --> 01:15:13,976
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, there's that synergy that

971
01:15:20,532 --> 01:15:39,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So unfortunately, I can't say it's 95% anymore, because I've been educated on that subject, but there's a lot of stumps in the city, but I am happy that we have so many funding sources that are contributing into this project, roughly, as you know, $600,000 with 250 from this proposed borrowing.

972
01:15:39,364 --> 01:15:40,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

973
01:15:49,490 --> 01:16:01,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what would be helpful then, if possible, if there's a total number of stumps in the city and how many may be removed by this project, and you don't have to have it now, but if you could just send that over.

974
01:16:01,379 --> 01:16:05,502
[SPEAKER_05]: People- We don't wanna misspeak, but we can get you that information for sure.

975
01:16:05,742 --> 01:16:08,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, yeah, and that would be really helpful.

976
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:10,625
[SPEAKER_02]: People talk about it a lot.

977
01:16:10,986 --> 01:16:16,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, and we know that it's a priority as well, so that's another reason we're trying to get the stumps in queue.

978
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:17,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

979
01:16:20,182 --> 01:16:20,982

1047
01:20:35,729 --> 01:20:40,953
[SPEAKER_00]: As we end the last day of the Police Appreciation Week, it's a little disappointing that

1048
01:20:41,306 --> 01:20:46,750
[SPEAKER_00]: the city doesn't really recognize this week as they do many others, and some even getting a full month of appreciation.

01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:50,832
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to say thank you to the Metro Police Department.

1050
01:20:51,553 --> 01:21:07,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Second and through the chair, hopefully, I'd like to express my extreme frustration and disappointment in council members, Collins, Tseng, Zach Beas, and President Nicole Morrell for their comments made about the Medford Police Department

1051
01:21:07,665 --> 01:21:15,368
[SPEAKER_00]: with members Kit Collins and Zach Beers demanding an apology for an incident that has not yet been investigated or concluded.

1052
01:21:15,949 --> 01:21:26,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself and many others feel that these types of actions from our elected officials are what continue to divide this city and make all citizens feel uneasy when it comes to the Medford Police Department.

1053
01:21:26,714 --> 01:21:36,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I know it probably won't happen, we kindly ask that you all rescind those comments made until there is a complete and final conclusion from that incident.

1054
01:21:36,118 --> 01:21:36,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1055
01:21:39,113 --> 01:21:40,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Giglio.

1056
01:21:41,533 --> 01:21:43,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else would like to speak for public participation?

1057
01:21:43,294 --> 01:21:53,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, that is the end of our agenda.

1058
01:21:57,576 --> 01:21:59,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Would anyone like to make a motion to adjourn?

1059
01:22:01,357 --> 01:22:05,477
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1060
