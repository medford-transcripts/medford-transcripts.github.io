1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:10,215
[SPEAKER_03]: learning, chronology of events from July and August of 2020, and the Medford Public Schools return to school dynamic planning framework.

2
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:27,283
[SPEAKER_03]: In summary, school year 2020-2021 will be recorded by historians as the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded incredible flexibility on the part of all educational leaders, students, and families.

3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:42,219
[SPEAKER_03]: But thanks to all of the Medford Public Schools community and the Medford community at large, we were able to coexist with the rapid changes and brought back the option of in-person learning and remote learning.

4
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,762
[SPEAKER_03]: The following further describes these accomplishments.

5
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:53,207
[SPEAKER_03]: The three goals that I, the superintendent identified

6
00:00:54,135 --> 00:01:02,177
[SPEAKER_03]: The district improvement goal was in fact the district strategic plan, which was presented last week.

7
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:09,860
[SPEAKER_03]: The three overarching goals of the district strategic plan were safety, equity, and consistency.

8
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:21,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I attached the strategic plan in this as a hyperlink and the slide deck for additional information.

9
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:31,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Please note that the strategic plan is not a final document, but it's a living document that will continue to be revised and updated.

10
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:51,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the area of safety, we charged ourselves with implementing a district-wide reopening plan that met the guidelines of Massachusetts Department of Public Health and provide in-person learning opportunities for all students pre-K to 12

11
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:53,726
[SPEAKER_03]: who selected that option.

12
00:01:56,367 --> 00:02:17,996
[SPEAKER_03]: As evidence under safety, I stated that in collaboration with Tufts University, the city of Medford and the Broad Institute, the Medford Public Schools was able to provide COVID-19 testing for all staff beginning in September of 2020 and testing of all students, which began in November of 2020 for those that were in person.

13
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,918
[SPEAKER_03]: As hyperlinks documents,

14
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:24,299
[SPEAKER_03]: supporting safety.

15
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:34,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I included a sample dashboard, a COVID-19 dashboard, the metrics from the Board of Health and the MPS consent form.

16
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:44,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Under equity, our goal was to provide all students with access to district opportunities to ensure individual student success.

17
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:55,652
[SPEAKER_03]: The evidence was that the Medford Public Schools was able to prioritize our most vulnerable students first with in-person instruction beginning the last week of September.

18
00:02:56,433 --> 00:03:06,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Our most vulnerable students attended school four days a week, and we were able to provide one-to-one technology for all students through the purchases of Chromebooks.

19
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:11,942
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, we were able to provide hotspots for our most vulnerable students and families in need.

20
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:24,218
[SPEAKER_03]: When looking at our limited technology in 2019, the additional funding that we received from CARES Act and ESSER, we are now able to meet the needs of all students and staff.

21
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,765
[SPEAKER_03]: During the fall of this school year, we purchased over 500 MacBooks for all educational staff.

22
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:38,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, documents supporting this claim are our elementary hybrid reopening document.

23
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:44,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And I listed the technology status document from 2019 to see how far we've come from 2019 to 2020-21 school year.

24
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:46,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the area of consistency,

25
00:03:55,137 --> 00:04:10,248
[SPEAKER_03]: to prepare principals and other district leaders for remote and hybrid instruction by developing a common language and adopting common practices that ensure all remote and hybrid students have access to high quality instruction.

26
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:20,095
[SPEAKER_03]: So the evidence in the Medford Public Schools, we are committed to holding ourselves accountable and providing transparent expectations for all of our learners,

27
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:25,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I listed the Medford Public Schools language of expectations for remote learning.

28
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:32,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only was it for administration, it was for staff and also for students.

29
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:41,188
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford Public Schools elementary hybrid schedule and our elementary remote days for hybrid instruction.

30
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:49,373
[SPEAKER_03]: The second goal that is required to be presented is the student learning goal.

31
00:04:50,993 --> 00:05:07,022
[SPEAKER_03]: The student learning goal is this past year, the focus, the continued focus was elementary mathematics to improve elementary achievement outcomes in mathematics by deepening teacher and principal knowledge of math.

32
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:16,168
[SPEAKER_03]: As evidence I stated, the superintendent remains committed to addressing elementary achievement in mathematics.

33
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:18,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though due to the pandemic,

34
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:28,127
[SPEAKER_03]: all learning walks were suspended out of an abundance of caution and due to the blended delivery of instruction for our remote and in-person students.

35
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:38,889
[SPEAKER_03]: The superintendent will resume learning walks and invite Lesley University once again to participate for the fall of 21 this coming school year.

36
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford Public Schools continues to partner with Lesley University in other capacities.

37
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:54,677
[SPEAKER_03]: The superintendent continues to closely partner with the math director as we are going to pilot a few elementary programs next year.

38
00:05:55,797 --> 00:06:01,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Please refer to the attached documents for greater information about what is happening in mathematics.

39
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:15,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we will be piloting three programs for next school year come September in mathematics in all of the schools in order to make a formal recommendation to the school committee

40
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:21,578
[SPEAKER_03]: in the spring of 22 for a new elementary mathematics curriculum.

41
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:26,042
[SPEAKER_03]: My third goal, which is a professional practice goal.

42
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:33,389
[SPEAKER_03]: This, in fact, was my third year of the new superintendent induction program, which is called NSIP.

43
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,692
[SPEAKER_03]: In that program, which is

44
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,505
[SPEAKER_03]: a program endorsed by DESE and in collaboration with our Department of Ed.

45
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:54,558
[SPEAKER_03]: It is to develop skills in strategy development, data analysis, and instructional leadership by completing, which I did this year, the third year of the NSSEP program.

46
00:06:56,577 --> 00:07:02,581
[SPEAKER_03]: The evidence I provided was that Dr. Edouard-Vincent successfully completed the full three-year NISP program.

47
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:08,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Due to the pandemic restrictions, all classes this year were held remotely by Zoom.

48
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:20,332
[SPEAKER_03]: However, in light of the racial awakening that has taken place across the nation and the globe, NISP added an additional model of affinity groups with a focus on equity.

49
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:31,303
[SPEAKER_03]: These additional modules created opportunities for superintendents to discuss potential problems of practice and proactively address issues around equity.

50
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:42,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent presented a significantly revised district strategic plan to the school committee on June 7th, 2021, and it was approved.

51
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:59,001
[SPEAKER_03]: This key expectation of all superintendents entails developing an action plan for all strategic priorities, the alignment of all school plans, the budget, leadership team meetings, and evaluation within the district strategy.

52
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:01,663
[SPEAKER_03]: The final expectation of the program

53
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:07,650
[SPEAKER_03]: is for superintendents to monitor progress and refine priorities and action plans.

54
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:21,877
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee will receive an annual update on the district strategy for improvement, our strategic plan to assess, provide input and make the necessary budgetary decisions based on our most current priorities.

55
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:30,082
[SPEAKER_03]: As attachments, I included the NISP program at a glance and the district strategy for improvement.

56
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:35,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I am going to stop there.

57
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:47,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And now this is the official portion of the evaluation based on the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

58
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:53,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the four standards, instructional leadership being standard one.

59
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:57,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Standard two is management and operations.

60
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:02,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Standard three is family, community, and engagement.

61
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:06,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And standard four is professional culture.

62
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:23,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the information that was shared, many of the articles listed as evidence, including school committee documentation, which are available in your drives, I will pause there for questions.

63
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:29,513
[SPEAKER_03]: comments and feedback from the school committee.

64
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:35,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

65
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:37,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

66
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:40,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Superintendent, for your self-evaluation.

67
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:51,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just noticing on the family and community engagement, I would encourage the addition of the ongoing exceptional relationship with the Medford CPAC.

68
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:57,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

69
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Member van de Kloot.

70
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

71
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:18,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So Superintendent Marisa Edward-Vincent, I think that you continue to do an exceptional job under the most difficult of circumstances this year.

72
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:32,222
[SPEAKER_02]: At every turn, I think that you've certainly displayed an incredible commitment to your role, to being available to us, to the community, to the kids at every turn.

73
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,605
[SPEAKER_02]: As the four standards are outlined,

74
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:42,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you have met them all and done an exemplary job.

75
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:49,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you and I look forward to your continued leadership in our community.

76
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:53,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member van de Kloot.

77
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:54,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

78
00:10:56,386 --> 00:11:05,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just wanted to say thank you, Superintendent Edwin Vincent, for your evaluation and all your goals that you sent to us.

79
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:11,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also want to mention that you do continue to exhibit exceptional instructional leadership.

80
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:17,815
[SPEAKER_06]: You motivate your team and the teachers and all the students.

81
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:20,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Everywhere you go, you walk around with a smile.

82
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:22,397
[SPEAKER_06]: You make the students happy.

83
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,838
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like they're your family.

84
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,518
[SPEAKER_06]: an extended family.

85
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:31,040
[SPEAKER_06]: You make everybody feel warm and comfortable and very personable.

86
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,102
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to say that those are just a brief summary of my feedback.

87
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:37,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

88
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:40,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Kreatz.

89
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, how do you figure who's next?

90
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:50,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

91
00:11:54,465 --> 00:12:11,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all your hard work, it's pretty interesting to reflect back over less than 12 months and think about how much has been accomplished not just pandemic oriented but really well beyond the pandemic, and how much.

92
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:16,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Notable change, there is a foot.

93
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:23,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I think about the presentations we received from your, your leadership team and the

94
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,312
[SPEAKER_01]: commentary and feedback.

95
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:31,617
[SPEAKER_01]: It's notable that things are moving forward and changing.

96
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:35,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's way more than you can ask for in this year.

97
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:36,743
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that.

98
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:43,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did have a question about procedurally for the school committee in terms of how we

99
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:48,657
[SPEAKER_01]: will formalize our feedback to the superintendent.

100
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:54,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I think member Rousseau offered to collect all that feedback earlier today.

101
00:12:54,042 --> 00:13:12,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to establish what that timeline would be since this is our last scheduled meeting so that we can make sure that we complete this this year and get to go into next year sort of as it's intended instead of as we have been forced to do for these last couple of years.

102
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you member Graham members up.

103
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

104
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:30,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so around the procedure and timeline so I mean I my suggestion here would be that I know we have to have at least one more meeting to prove the allocation the city's budget.

105
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,181
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's a committee of the whole.

106
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:41,967
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if we were to finalize and approve at that same meeting and then

107
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:45,954
[SPEAKER_00]: revote it at our first regular we have to do a real vote at a regular meeting.

108
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:58,239
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that if we did that vote of the committee of the whole that I I'm suspect expecting that that could be submitted to death see without anybody be concerned if we can plan to vote it in September.

109
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,560
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds reasonable to everybody.

110
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It's

111
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:07,546
[SPEAKER_02]: One question?

112
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:08,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Member Van der Kloot.

113
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:15,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the meeting that we're going to have to confirm the budget a committee of the whole, or are we going to add a regular meeting?

114
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:17,588
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it have to be?

115
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:22,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we could make it a special meeting if we needed to.

116
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,090
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do it as a special meeting.

117
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I may, then I believe our regular votes actually count there as well, so.

118
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:33,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we could change it to that, special meeting.

119
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:34,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

120
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:49,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could maybe have everybody's evaluation by the beginning of next week and have the final special meeting the last week in June, if that is amenable to my colleagues.

121
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:51,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

122
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:53,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

123
00:14:54,793 --> 00:15:00,934
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I was going to ask one, if there needs to be a motion for that, but also that, you know, we have a schedule.

124
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:17,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I would make a motion that we move to the rules subcommittee, a schedule for next year's evaluation process with a month advance notice of our evaluation that needs to be presented and dates on the calendar for each of the timeline items.

125
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:18,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I have a second?

126
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Second that.

127
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:24,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Ruseau.

128
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,210
[SPEAKER_05]: before the roll is called, Member Mustone?

129
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin, could you repeat it?

130
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,933
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just trying to figure out the scheduling, so I missed what you said.

131
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:36,875
[SPEAKER_04]: May I, Mayor?

132
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:38,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

133
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:53,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Timeline for the superintendent's evaluation process referred to the rules, equity policy subcommittee, so that we have a laid out timeline for the future with a month advance notice to school committee members to prepare our rubric.

134
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:58,636
[SPEAKER_04]: and a date where we have the superintendent's self-evaluation and our response to the evaluation.

135
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So no more the week of June 27th?

136
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:02,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the week of June 27th this year.

137
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:04,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about for the future.

138
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:11,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Her motion is to create a plan for next year so that we don't run into going over the last meeting in June.

139
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, thank you.

140
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, motion.

141
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:16,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a question on that motion, Member Kreatz?

142
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:22,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I sent in my tally today.

143
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:26,526
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done that yet.

144
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:34,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, it's just a motion on the floor to get a calendar together for next year so that we don't run into this timeline.

145
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:39,070
[SPEAKER_05]: But we ran into this timeline because it seems like yesterday, we just did your last year's evaluation.

146
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:43,631
[SPEAKER_05]: So motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Ruseau.

147
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:44,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, please.

148
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:46,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

149
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:46,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

150
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:48,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz.

151
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:48,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

152
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:51,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

153
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

154
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:53,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

155
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:55,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Member Mustone.

156
00:16:55,997 --> 00:17:00,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes number or so yes, I'm a van to clear.

157
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:14,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative the motion passes there may ask a question is make member mclaughlin the member van de Kloet are we doing the on favors I mean didn't we make that that we don't have to do roll call and I'm sorry yes.

158
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:19,527
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that this number.

159
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:25,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that voice votes are not allowed until tomorrow under the

160
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:27,104
[SPEAKER_01]: emergency provisions.

161
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see it in the guidance, but why don't we do it just to be safe?

162
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:33,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

163
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:34,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I didn't read that part of it.

164
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,210
Mayor?

165
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:38,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Van der Kloot.

166
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:53,843
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that what we're thinking, but if we could just look and determine when we think the special meeting would be, what is the latest that the city council can give us the budget

167
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:59,206
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually, I know it has to be done by the 30th, right?

168
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:02,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Their last Tuesday meeting is the 29th of June.

169
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:07,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that mean that we are going to, our special meeting will be held on the 30th?

170
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:21,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case, I mean, if they have to, if they go all the way to the 29th to confirm the budget, then it would suggest that our special meeting would be on the 30th.

171
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?

172
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:35,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to set the date so I know what, you know, if we do it the previous week, we might not yet have the budget from the City Council.

173
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:35,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?

174
00:18:38,747 --> 00:18:39,247
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

175
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:40,028
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

176
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:41,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So therefore, I make a motion.

177
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:45,498
[SPEAKER_02]: that the special meeting be held on Wednesday, June 30th?

178
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:46,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that?

179
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:47,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

180
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:48,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Superintendent, is that a date?

181
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:51,400
[SPEAKER_03]: June 30th is my son's birthday.

182
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,121
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened last year too.

183
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:54,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

184
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:54,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

185
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:59,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like we're always backed up, but we'll make it work.

186
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:05,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we think that the city council might be done sooner so we could do it on Monday the 28th?

187
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:09,506
[SPEAKER_05]: The city council has meetings.

188
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:11,927
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to schedule meetings for this Saturday.

189
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:22,721
[SPEAKER_05]: and then they'll still have the schools and multiple departments left to go, which will bring them to having a meeting or two the week of the 21st.

190
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:27,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would assume they would vote on the budget on the 29th.

191
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:30,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor.

192
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:32,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Grant.

193
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:33,610
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess two questions.

194
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,553
[SPEAKER_01]: One is just looking for clarification about whether

195
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:48,364
[SPEAKER_01]: whether meetings must be held in person at that time, because that obviously changes scheduling.

196
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:57,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my other question is, the city council can approve or decline the budget.

197
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,187
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't change the amount, is that correct?

198
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:08,388
[SPEAKER_05]: They can reduce line items either in the operations itself in a certain department or

199
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:15,670
[SPEAKER_05]: in the operating so they could reduce line items.

200
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

201
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:30,116
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could meet in anticipation that nothing will change next week in a special meeting and then call a separate meeting if it becomes necessary after they vote.

202
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:33,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that another potential option?

203
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:36,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll defer to the senior members.

204
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you usually have your final approval meeting after the city council approves?

205
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:44,526
[SPEAKER_02]: The truth of the matter is we never had a final approval meeting.

206
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,248
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was we submitted it.

207
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:55,035
[SPEAKER_02]: We always understood that the city council has never declined the amount that we submitted.

208
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:58,558
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something new that we're doing this year.

209
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:14,056
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's difficult because if they go all the way to the end, you know, we can't really, if they haven't voted the budget, how can we accept it?

210
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:22,784
[SPEAKER_02]: This really is a question I think Mr. Murphy might have to weigh into since he was the one who suggested, because otherwise I'd say let's do the meeting on Monday the 28th.

211
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:23,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I agree.

212
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:25,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would be far, far preferable.

213
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:32,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go to July 1st, it's the beginning of the 4th of July weekend.

214
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:42,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So could we work on doing like a doodle poll or getting the specifics?

215
00:21:43,058 --> 00:21:45,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know he's probably on campus somewhere.

216
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:49,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not sure where he is just yet.

217
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:56,443
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so once we get that, I would actually suggest otherwise that we look at Monday the 28th.

218
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,725
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's put a hold on Monday the 28th.

219
00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:05,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's get a date that the evaluations will be delivered to member Ruseau.

220
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday the 28th doesn't work for me, if at all possible.

221
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:09,952
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what?

222
00:22:10,273 --> 00:22:11,173
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not work for me.

223
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:15,396
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Thursday or Friday, the 24th or 25th?

224
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, both are fine.

225
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,516
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe earlier in the day.

226
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:23,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send out a poll.

227
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:26,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

228
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:28,319
[SPEAKER_05]: A doodle poll.

229
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:31,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday the 21st, which gives us one full week.

230
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that sound like a good day to get your evaluations to Member Ruseau?

231
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:35,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

232
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:35,703
Okay.

233
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:37,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we need a motion?

234
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:39,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

235
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:46,368
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't be earlier than three.

236
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:47,489
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't be earlier than three.

237
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:48,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe four o'clock start?

238
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:49,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Would four o'clock work?

239
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:53,453
[SPEAKER_05]: on that Thursday, the 24th, potentially?

240
00:22:56,814 --> 00:22:58,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd have to do a leader's time.

241
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:03,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send out a poll.

242
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:12,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so please have your evaluations to Member Ruseau by Monday, June 21st, and you will get to the poll tomorrow on a new date.

243
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:19,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions or comments before we adjourn this meeting?

244
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:21,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor?

245
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

246
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:23,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Two things.

247
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:28,129
[SPEAKER_04]: One is I'm wondering what the process is for identifying us.

248
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:30,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want us to just put our mics on and say Mayor?

249
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know when we have people in the queue, I'm not sure that you can see or can you see on this edge.

250
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:37,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know this microphone process is different.

251
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:39,355
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you could just define that.

252
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:45,098
[SPEAKER_04]: And then before I shut it off, I just wanted to also thank the superintendent for this year.

253
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:45,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been

254
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:49,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been very interesting and it's been really good to work with you.

255
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:57,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And I especially appreciated your communication around the commercials and your willingness to go into the studio and give that a shot.

256
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:58,267
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

257
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:10,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to read, I thought I saw him here earlier, so I thought he might chime in, but I do want to read a letter that we received for the committee of the whole.

258
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:18,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear members of the school committee, I'm writing to express my utmost appreciation and support for Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.

259
00:24:18,661 --> 00:24:23,003
[SPEAKER_02]: The courage and grace that she has displayed over the past year is truly remarkable.

260
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:25,625
[SPEAKER_02]: The city is blessed to have her leading our school system.

261
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I am sure that the members of this committee feel the same.

262
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:31,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to many more years with Dr. Edouard-Vincent at the helm.

263
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:37,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Respectfully, Sean M. Began, Esquire, Zero Governors Ave, Medford, Mass.

264
00:24:38,198 --> 00:24:38,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

265
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:39,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Van der Kloot.

266
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:40,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

267
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:45,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn.

268
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:48,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Member Ruseau.

269
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:50,203

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: 7, the affirmative, 0, and the negative.

280
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion is approved.

281
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:10,894
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 21 minutes, and we'll start our regular meeting.
