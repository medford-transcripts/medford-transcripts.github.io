    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=0.051s">learning,</a>  chronology of events from July and August of 2020, and the Medford Public Schools return to school dynamic planning framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=11.176s">In</a>  summary, school year 2020-2021 will be recorded by historians as the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded incredible flexibility on the part of all educational leaders, students, and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=28.57s">But</a>  thanks to all of the Medford Public Schools community and the Medford community at large, we were able to coexist with the rapid changes and brought back the option of in-person learning and remote learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=43.32s">The</a>  following further describes these accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=49.624s">The</a>  three goals that I, the superintendent identified <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=54.135s">The</a>  district improvement goal was in fact the district strategic plan, which was presented last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=63.738s">The</a>  three overarching goals of the district strategic plan were safety, equity, and consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=72.68s">I</a>  attached the strategic plan in this as a hyperlink and the slide deck for additional information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=83.683s">Please</a>  note that the strategic plan is not a final document, but it's a living document that will continue to be revised and updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=93.705s">Under</a>  the area of safety, we charged ourselves with implementing a district-wide reopening plan that met the guidelines of Massachusetts Department of Public Health and provide in-person learning opportunities for all students pre-K to 12 <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=112.405s">who</a>  selected that option. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=116.367s">As</a>  evidence under safety, I stated that in collaboration with Tufts University, the city of Medford and the Broad Institute, the Medford Public Schools was able to provide COVID-19 testing for all staff beginning in September of 2020 and testing of all students, which began in November of 2020 for those that were in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=139.097s">As</a>  hyperlinks documents, <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=143.278s">supporting</a>  safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=145.921s">I</a>  included a sample dashboard, a COVID-19 dashboard, the metrics from the Board of Health and the MPS consent form. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=155.61s">Under</a>  equity, our goal was to provide all students with access to district opportunities to ensure individual student success. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=165.426s">The</a>  evidence was that the Medford Public Schools was able to prioritize our most vulnerable students first with in-person instruction beginning the last week of September. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=176.433s">Our</a>  most vulnerable students attended school four days a week, and we were able to provide one-to-one technology for all students through the purchases of Chromebooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=187.099s">In</a>  addition, we were able to provide hotspots for our most vulnerable students and families in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=192.966s">When</a>  looking at our limited technology in 2019, the additional funding that we received from CARES Act and ESSER, we are now able to meet the needs of all students and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=204.919s">During</a>  the fall of this school year, we purchased over 500 MacBooks for all educational staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=211.912s">Again,</a>  documents supporting this claim are our elementary hybrid reopening document. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=219.217s">And</a>  I listed the technology status document from 2019 to see how far we've come from 2019 to 2020-21 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=224.921s">Under</a>  the area of consistency, <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=235.137s">to</a>  prepare principals and other district leaders for remote and hybrid instruction by developing a common language and adopting common practices that ensure all remote and hybrid students have access to high quality instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=250.928s">So</a>  the evidence in the Medford Public Schools, we are committed to holding ourselves accountable and providing transparent expectations for all of our learners, <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=260.815s">I</a>  listed the Medford Public Schools language of expectations for remote learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=266.779s">Not</a>  only was it for administration, it was for staff and also for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=273.423s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools elementary hybrid schedule and our elementary remote days for hybrid instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=283.629s">The</a>  second goal that is required to be presented is the student learning goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=290.993s">The</a>  student learning goal is this past year, the focus, the continued focus was elementary mathematics to improve elementary achievement outcomes in mathematics by deepening teacher and principal knowledge of math. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=309.564s">As</a>  evidence I stated, the superintendent remains committed to addressing elementary achievement in mathematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=317.048s">Even</a>  though due to the pandemic, <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=319.105s">all</a>  learning walks were suspended out of an abundance of caution and due to the blended delivery of instruction for our remote and in-person students. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=329.247s">The</a>  superintendent will resume learning walks and invite Lesley University once again to participate for the fall of 21 this coming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=340.29s">Medford</a>  Public Schools continues to partner with Lesley University in other capacities. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=346.714s">The</a>  superintendent continues to closely partner with the math director as we are going to pilot a few elementary programs next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=355.797s">Please</a>  refer to the attached documents for greater information about what is happening in mathematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=362.72s">And</a>  again, we will be piloting three programs for next school year come September in mathematics in all of the schools in order to make a formal recommendation to the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=376.373s">in</a>  the spring of 22 for a new elementary mathematics curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=382.819s">My</a>  third goal, which is a professional practice goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=387.363s">This,</a>  in fact, was my third year of the new superintendent induction program, which is called NSIP. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=394.93s">In</a>  that program, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=397.5s">a</a>  program endorsed by DESE and in collaboration with our Department of Ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=403.146s">It</a>  is to develop skills in strategy development, data analysis, and instructional leadership by completing, which I did this year, the third year of the NSSEP program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=416.577s">The</a>  evidence I provided was that Dr. Edouard-Vincent successfully completed the full three-year NISP program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=423.281s">Due</a>  to the pandemic restrictions, all classes this year were held remotely by Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=429.225s">However,</a>  in light of the racial awakening that has taken place across the nation and the globe, NISP added an additional model of affinity groups with a focus on equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=441.13s">These</a>  additional modules created opportunities for superintendents to discuss potential problems of practice and proactively address issues around equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=453.519s">Dr.</a>  Edouard-Vincent presented a significantly revised district strategic plan to the school committee on June 7th, 2021, and it was approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=463.407s">This</a>  key expectation of all superintendents entails developing an action plan for all strategic priorities, the alignment of all school plans, the budget, leadership team meetings, and evaluation within the district strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=479.741s">The</a>  final expectation of the program <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=482.307s">is</a>  for superintendents to monitor progress and refine priorities and action plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=488.49s">The</a>  school committee will receive an annual update on the district strategy for improvement, our strategic plan to assess, provide input and make the necessary budgetary decisions based on our most current priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=502.818s">As</a>  attachments, I included the NISP program at a glance and the district strategy for improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=512.523s">And</a>  so I am going to stop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=516.286s">And</a>  now this is the official portion of the evaluation based on the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=527.914s">It's</a>  the four standards, instructional leadership being standard one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=534.319s">Standard</a>  two is management and operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=538.798s">Standard</a>  three is family, community, and engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=543.122s">And</a>  standard four is professional culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=547.266s">And</a>  so in the information that was shared, many of the articles listed as evidence, including school committee documentation, which are available in your drives, I will pause there for questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=566.992s">comments</a>  and feedback from the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=575.214s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=576.895s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=577.795s">Thank</a>  you, Superintendent, for your self-evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=582.276s">I</a>  was just noticing on the family and community engagement, I would encourage the addition of the ongoing exceptional relationship with the Medford CPAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=596.734s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=606.73s">Member</a>  van de Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=607.841s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=609.382s">So</a>  Superintendent Marisa Edward-Vincent, I think that you continue to do an exceptional job under the most difficult of circumstances this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=619.591s">At</a>  every turn, I think that you've certainly displayed an incredible commitment to your role, to being available to us, to the community, to the kids at every turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=633.983s">As</a>  the four standards are outlined, <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=636.298s">I</a>  think that you have met them all and done an exemplary job. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=643.621s">So</a>  I thank you and I look forward to your continued leadership in our community.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=652.845s">Thank</a>  you, Member van de Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=654.086s">Member</a>  Kreatz?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=656.386s">Yes,</a>  I just wanted to say thank you, Superintendent Edwin Vincent, for your evaluation and all your goals that you sent to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=665.71s">And</a>  I also want to mention that you do continue to exhibit exceptional instructional leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=672.453s">You</a>  motivate your team and the teachers and all the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=677.915s">Everywhere</a>  you go, you walk around with a smile. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=680.976s">You</a>  make the students happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=682.417s">It's</a>  like they're your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=685.458s">an</a>  extended family. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=686.599s">You</a>  make everybody feel warm and comfortable and very personable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=692.18s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that those are just a brief summary of my feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=697.502s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=699.303s">Thank</a>  you, Member Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=708.666s">I</a>  know, how do you figure who's next? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=710.006s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=714.465s">Thank</a>  you for all your hard work, it's pretty interesting to reflect back over less than 12 months and think about how much has been accomplished not just pandemic oriented but really well beyond the pandemic, and how much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=733.677s">Notable</a>  change, there is a foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=736.639s">So</a>  when I think about the presentations we received from your, your leadership team and the <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=746.81s">commentary</a>  and feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=748.552s">It's</a>  notable that things are moving forward and changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=751.797s">And</a>  so that's way more than you can ask for in this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=755.982s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=757.344s">And</a>  then I did have a question about procedurally for the school committee in terms of how we <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=765.775s">will</a>  formalize our feedback to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=769.538s">I</a>  think member Rousseau offered to collect all that feedback earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=774.042s">And</a>  I just wanted to establish what that timeline would be since this is our last scheduled meeting so that we can make sure that we complete this this year and get to go into next year sort of as it's intended instead of as we have been forced to do for these last couple of years.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=795.969s">Thank</a>  you member Graham members up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=797.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=799.211s">Yes,</a>  so around the procedure and timeline so I mean I my suggestion here would be that I know we have to have at least one more meeting to prove the allocation the city's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=811.359s">I</a>  believe that's a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=815.723s">I</a>  think that if we were to finalize and approve at that same meeting and then <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=822.433s">revote</a>  it at our first regular we have to do a real vote at a regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=826.375s">But</a>  I think that if we did that vote of the committee of the whole that I I'm suspect expecting that that could be submitted to death see without anybody be concerned if we can plan to vote it in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=839.679s">That</a>  sounds reasonable to everybody.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=841.58s">It's</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=847.086s">One</a>  question? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=847.706s">Yes,</a>  Member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=848.826s">Is</a>  the meeting that we're going to have to confirm the budget a committee of the whole, or are we going to add a regular meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=856.588s">What</a>  does it have to be?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=857.608s">I</a>  mean, we could make it a special meeting if we needed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=862.749s">We</a>  could do it as a special meeting.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=864.11s">And</a>  if I may, then I believe our regular votes actually count there as well, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=870.071s">Yeah,</a>  we could change it to that, special meeting.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=874.372s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=876.608s">So</a>  we could maybe have everybody's evaluation by the beginning of next week and have the final special meeting the last week in June, if that is amenable to my colleagues.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=890.574s">Member</a>  McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=892.654s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=894.793s">So</a>  yeah, I was going to ask one, if there needs to be a motion for that, but also that, you know, we have a schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=901.515s">I</a>  would make a motion that we move to the rules subcommittee, a schedule for next year's evaluation process with a month advance notice of our evaluation that needs to be presented and dates on the calendar for each of the timeline items. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=918.339s">Can</a>  I have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=918.959s">Second</a>  that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=920.219s">Motion</a>  by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=925.968s">before</a>  the roll is called, Member Mustone?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=930.151s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, could you repeat it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=931.412s">We</a>  were just trying to figure out the scheduling, so I missed what you said.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=936.375s">May</a>  I, Mayor?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=937.836s">Yes,</a>  Member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=938.937s">Timeline</a>  for the superintendent's evaluation process referred to the rules, equity policy subcommittee, so that we have a laid out timeline for the future with a month advance notice to school committee members to prepare our rubric. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=954.435s">and</a>  a date where we have the superintendent's self-evaluation and our response to the evaluation.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=958.656s">So</a>  no more the week of June 27th?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=960.957s">Yes,</a>  the week of June 27th this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=963.137s">I'm</a>  talking about for the future.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=965.618s">Her</a>  motion is to create a plan for next year so that we don't run into going over the last meeting in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=971.34s">Correct,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=973.12s">Okay,</a>  motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=974.301s">Do</a>  you have a question on that motion, Member Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=976.641s">I</a>  sent in my tally today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=985.686s">We</a>  haven't done that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=986.666s">Right</a>  now, it's just a motion on the floor to get a calendar together for next year so that we don't run into this timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=994.809s">But</a>  we ran into this timeline because it seems like yesterday, we just did your last year's evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=999.17s">So</a>  motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1003.872s">Roll</a>  call, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1005.492s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1006.352s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1007.413s">Member</a>  Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1008.613s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1010.053s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1011.334s">Member</a>  Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1012.934s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1014.315s">I'm</a>  sorry, Member Mustone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1015.997s">Yes</a>  number or so yes, I'm a van to clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1021.199s">Yes,</a>  7 in the affirmative the motion passes there may ask a question is make member mclaughlin the member van de Kloet are we doing the on favors I mean didn't we make that that we don't have to do roll call and I'm sorry yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1038.447s">What</a>  was that this number.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1041.808s">I</a>  thought that voice votes are not allowed until tomorrow under the <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1046.223s">emergency</a>  provisions.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1050.606s">I</a>  didn't see it in the guidance, but why don't we do it just to be safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1053.068s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1053.288s">Yeah,</a>  I didn't read that part of it.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1057.591s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1058.472s">So</a>  I think that what we're thinking, but if we could just look and determine when we think the special meeting would be, what is the latest that the city council can give us the budget <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1075.205s">It's</a>  usually, I know it has to be done by the 30th, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1079.966s">Their</a>  last Tuesday meeting is the 29th of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1083.307s">So</a>  does that mean that we are going to, our special meeting will be held on the 30th? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1090.089s">Just</a>  in case, I mean, if they have to, if they go all the way to the 29th to confirm the budget, then it would suggest that our special meeting would be on the 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1102.99s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1105.252s">I</a>  really need to set the date so I know what, you know, if we do it the previous week, we might not yet have the budget from the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1115.223s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1118.747s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1119.748s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1120.108s">So</a>  therefore, I make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1122.397s">that</a>  the special meeting be held on Wednesday, June 30th? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1125.798s">Is</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1126.778s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1127.139s">Superintendent,</a>  is that a date?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1129.479s">June</a>  30th is my son's birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1131.42s">It</a>  happened last year too. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1133.641s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1134.621s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1135.281s">It's</a>  like we're always backed up, but we'll make it work.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1139.703s">Do</a>  we think that the city council might be done sooner so we could do it on Monday the 28th?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1147.806s">The</a>  city council has meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1149.746s">They're</a>  trying to schedule meetings for this Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1152.313s">and</a>  then they'll still have the schools and multiple departments left to go, which will bring them to having a meeting or two the week of the 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1163.622s">So</a>  I would assume they would vote on the budget on the 29th.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1170.007s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1171.108s">Member</a>  Grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1172.609s">So</a>  I guess two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1173.83s">One</a>  is just looking for clarification about whether <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1180.163s">whether</a>  meetings must be held in person at that time, because that obviously changes scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1189.985s">And</a>  then my other question is, the city council can approve or decline the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1198.846s">They</a>  can't change the amount, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1202.307s">They</a>  can reduce line items either in the operations itself in a certain department or <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1211.128s">in</a>  the operating so they could reduce line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1216.07s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1216.83s">So</a>  we could meet in anticipation that nothing will change next week in a special meeting and then call a separate meeting if it becomes necessary after they vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1230.676s">Is</a>  that another potential option?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1234.898s">I'll</a>  defer to the senior members. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1237.16s">Do</a>  you usually have your final approval meeting after the city council approves?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1241.904s">The</a>  truth of the matter is we never had a final approval meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1244.727s">What</a>  happened was we submitted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1247.049s">We</a>  always understood that the city council has never declined the amount that we submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1255.516s">So</a>  this is something new that we're doing this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1261.885s">You</a>  know, it's difficult because if they go all the way to the end, you know, we can't really, if they haven't voted the budget, how can we accept it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1275.318s">This</a>  really is a question I think Mr. Murphy might have to weigh into since he was the one who suggested, because otherwise I'd say let's do the meeting on Monday the 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1282.844s">Right,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1284.026s">Which</a>  would be far, far preferable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1287.941s">And</a>  if you go to July 1st, it's the beginning of the 4th of July weekend.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1293.788s">So</a>  could we work on doing like a doodle poll or getting the specifics? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1303.058s">Because</a>  I know he's probably on campus somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1305.961s">I'm</a>  just not sure where he is just yet.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1310.519s">And</a>  yeah, so once we get that, I would actually suggest otherwise that we look at Monday the 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1316.783s">So</a>  let's put a hold on Monday the 28th.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1319.225s">And</a>  let's get a date that the evaluations will be delivered to member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1325.97s">Monday</a>  the 28th doesn't work for me, if at all possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1329.652s">It's</a>  what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1330.273s">It</a>  does not work for me.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1331.534s">How</a>  about Thursday or Friday, the 24th or 25th? <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1335.416s">Yeah,</a>  both are fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1341.175s">maybe</a>  earlier in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1343.056s">I'll</a>  send out a poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1346.178s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
